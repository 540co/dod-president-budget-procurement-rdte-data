"ASW Research Prog - Cong","5.000","- Acoustic waves may be detected by the particle motions of small parcels of seawater as the longitudinal wave passes a point.   Lasers hold the promise of very finely detecting these particle motions, but this detection has to overcome large amounts of ambient particle motions which are not due to acoustic energy at particular frequencies.  Research experimentation is attempting to overcome these extraneous signals.- Recent at-sea efforts showed that refracted acoustic energy in the upper ocean leads to regions which are quieter than others.  This phenomenon will be examined further with experiments at higher latitudes.  The physical nature of these quiet regions will be investigated to construct a predictive model.-  Details of the ocean surface wave field hold clues to signatures of shallow submerged objects.  Fluid dynamical studies of wave-wave and wave-turbulent interactions over larger areas, to connect with remote sensing methods, are being incorporated into parallel algorithmic formulations for rapid processing.   Such modeling holds the promise of reducing clutter for the remote sensing methodologies.","5.000","ASW surveillance has been the primary topic of this program.    Efforts have been successfully used to address field experimentation and algorithm development.  FY2015  Details are classified but involve understanding upper ocean acoustic structure to address passive detection opportunities,  numerical modeling to understand ocean clutter impeding detection and creating false alarms, and new sensor opportunities.","83685f37f67d798287a99b73e333760fa6729e8e-0-32c0b8dece5a78116512e88b00700edb0a897b96","83685f37f67d798287a99b73e333760fa6729e8e","root.record.ProjectList.Project","83685f37f67d798287a99b73e333760fa6729e8e-1-5a172d3f59dfbcfeb7271cd6d9c8b6360ffdf0cc"

"CW Bill Young Marrow Donor Program","31.500","NMDP continued to expand participation of transplant centers. Hospitals that participate in both the NMDP Network of treatment centers as well as the NDMS that is managed by the Department of Health and Human Services were invited to join the RITN.  As a result of this targeted recruitment, eight additional transplant centers joined; unfortunately two centers were lost to attrition resulting in a total composition of: 47 transplant centers, 6 donor centers, and 7 cord blood banks.During this period, the C. W. Bill Young Marrow Donor Recruitment and Research Program, BMRD, NMRC directly contributed to donor recruitment and transplantation and science and technology developments including over 5,000 transplants coordinated by the NMDP of which over 500 were provided by DoD volunteers through the NMRC / Georgetown part of the program.  The NMDP added over 700,000 volunteer donors to the national registry, of which over 40,000 were from DoD volunteers from the NMRC / Georgetown.  Probe Testing Progress:The laboratory tested 17,885 new volunteers for HLA-A,-B; 17,885 for HLA-C, and 20,805 for HLA-DRB1. In the first three months the laboratory has typed 18,615 donors for HLA-DQB1 and is currently working on providing HLADPB1 typing for those donors. They are currently working on establishing and validating robust assays for DQB1 and DPB1 because of recent studies suggesting that these loci may impact outcome of transplantation; DQB1 when a mismatched donor is selected and DPB1 when a donor with a T cell epitope mismatch is selected.Sequencing Progress Report:Through this grant they continue to improve the robotics and reagents to test samples flow by typing large numbers of donors at recruitment. The PI and team are currently typing 1000 volunteers of European ancestry for the registry using a one step SBT typing method. They previously sequenced 196 loci from patients and potentially matched family members.","31.500","National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) will continue to expand participation of transplant centers increasing the enrollment of  volunteer donors to the national registry.

"CW Bill Young Marrow Donor Program","28.888","NMDP:NMDP continued to expand participation of transplant centers in RITN. Hospitals that participate in both the NMDP Network of treatment centers as well as the NDMS that is managed by the Department of Health and Human Services were invited to join RITN.  As a result of this targeted recruitment, eight additional transplant centers joined; unfortunately two centers were lost to attrition resulting in a total composition of: 47 transplant centers, 6 donor centers, and 7 cord blood banks.A new initiative that began was the Site Assessment program that involved an NMDP staff member reviewing existing documentation at 11 RITN transplant centers against a standardized checklist. As a result, many best practices were gleaned from these centers and the RITN SOP template was updated based on the content of the checklists.NMRC:During this period, the C. W. Bill Young Marrow Donor Recruitment and Research Program, BMRD, NMRC directly contributed to donor recruitment and transplantation and science and technology developments.  This includes over 5,000 transplants coordinated by the NMDP of which over 500 were provided by DoD volunteers through the NMRC / Georgetown part of the program.  The NMDP added over 700,000 volunteer donors to the national registry, of which over 40,000 were from DoD volunteers from the NMRC / Georgetown.  Numerous science and technology accomplishments are included and these developments are translated into the development of medical countermeasures to respond to potential marrow toxic injury which are linked to the national effort to develop medical countermeasures for radiation injury.    Georgetown:Donor Center ProgressThe DoD registry includes 707,913 volunteers of which 45,362 volunteers were recruited in 2011. There were 8,709 health evaluations and confirmatory HLA typings requested in 2011 and 892 requests were made for stem cell collection of which 577 went to actual collection.Probe Testing Progress:The laboratory tested 17,885 new volunteers for HLA-A,-B; 17,885 for HLA-C, and 20,805 for HLA-DRB1. In the first three months the laboratory has typed 18,615 donors for HLA-DQB1 and is currently working on providing HLADPB1 typing for those donors. They are currently working on establishing and validating robust assays for DQB1 and DPB1 because of recent studies suggesting that these loci may impact outcome of transplantation; DQB1 when a mismatched donor is selected and DPB1 when a donor with a T cell epitope mismatch is selected.Sequencing Progress Report:Through this grant they continue to improve the robotics and reagents to test samples flow by typing large numbers of donors at recruitment. The PI and team are currently typing 1000 volunteers of European ancestry for the registry using a one step SBT typing method. They previously sequenced 196 loci from patients and potentially matched family members.","31.500","N/A","816d37735e6ebf76d7e9f6615c586ff354f8d908-0-33fe3de49ff0bddf93d88bd2748f5c3f71a31dac","816d37735e6ebf76d7e9f6615c586ff354f8d908","root.record.ProjectList.Project","816d37735e6ebf76d7e9f6615c586ff354f8d908-1-467311e2030d9667848ec80294901934299c55d2"

In addition, these programs all had a clear transition path with implementation on a current platform or one undergoing acquisition targeted to be within 2-3 years of project completion.  The following areas of investment were executed to enable a diverse suite of advanced manufacturing production improvements- Innovation Manufacturing Institutes (IMI) (previously Advanced Manufacturing Innovation Institutes) (see program  descriptions addressed above):   1) IMI for 3D printing:  The institute accomplished a first-year, start-up phase consisting of establishing over 80 industry, academic, and non-profit members, creating a balanced governance structure to engage industry and government stakeholders, development of performance metrics, a project call process, an operating plan, the hiring of full-time staff, and completed renovations of the headquarters, the Innovation Factory.  A Call for Projects resulted in six applied research projects, engaging over 35 member organizations on project teams.  The Additive Manufacturing technology roadmap was developed using results generated from a series of workshops with members.  A  Second Project Call was launched with anticipated awards totaling $9 million (government share).  Plans for education and workforce training and outreach were developed, and initiatives were launched in these areas.  The IMI for 3D printing began the development of a new public and private (members-only) collaborative website for secure exchange of relevant information on projects, member organization capabilities, and developments in the additive manufacturing industry.  2) IMIs for digital manufacturing and design, and for lightweight metals:  Provided resources for initial staffing of each Institute, permitting timely standup of the Institutes to facilitate growth in membership and customer interest.  Awarded initial cooperative agreements. The Technology Advisory Boards of these Institutes were established along with operating procedures on governance, intellectual property protection, and membership. Began cross-institute project teaming with the 3D printing IMI, and began engagement with organic (depot) manufacturing communities within DoD. Executed the initial Project Calls and awarded first round of projects, typically $1M in government funds matched 1:1 or better by industry. Contracts were awarded in the following core areas for each Institute:   IMI for digital manufacturing and design: advanced manufacturing enterprise, intelligent machines, and advanced analysis;   IMI for lightweight metals: applications of new/novel metals and alloys, primary metal manufacturing processes, secondary manufacturing processes, and development of products exploiting lightweight and modern metals.Other projects executed (space limitation precludes project details below, but further descriptions are available):Automated Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) Analysis of Composite Ultrasonic Inspection Data for Manufacturing Quality ControlCarbon Nanotube CablesConnecting American ManufacturingCurved Transparent CeramicsLaser Assisted Consolidation of CompositesMulti-function PeriscopeOn Tool Inspection of Automated Fiber Placement","25.000","Projects to be executed (space limitation precludes project details below, but further descriptions are available):Affordable RadarLarge Affordable SubstratesOn Tool Inspection of Automated Fiber PlacementSolid Rocket Motor Digital Factory","f1547c2183f174b00ed2d2620e782d02c7304370-0-3bcadf80b8033faecb12b877e590999f9b6281a2","f1547c2183f174b00ed2d2620e782d02c7304370","root.record.ProjectList.Project","f1547c2183f174b00ed2d2620e782d02c7304370-0-501afd2ac4944a6835e91198228358efc2358bf8"
