It provides Production Support Equipment Replacement and Modernization to Government-owned equipment and real property used in the production of Weapons and Tracked Combat Vehicles.  The program also provides funding for Layaway of Industrial Facilities (LIF) and for the redistribution of equipment no longer required for production of Army systems.  This effort supports the Abrams RESET, Systems Enhancement Package (SEP) Programs and Spin-Out Framework.  Funding is required for the preservation, Packing, Crating, Handling, and Transportation (PCH&T) of equipment excess to production, where such actions do not constitute substantial or complete shutdown or excessing of U.S. Army Tank-Automotive and Armaments Command (TACOM) production equipment.  This program also funds projects to prevent unnecessary deterioration, perform maintenance, cover storage expenses of idle items of Government-owned equipment, and unplanned repairs to active equipment as situations arise."

            "val": "FY 2014 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $1.544 million supports the procurement, repair, or replacement of Government-owned Industrial Plant Equipment (IPE) and Government-owned Real Property at the Joint System Manufacturing Center at Lima (JSMCL), formerly the Lima Army Tank Plant (LATP).  In addition, this program procures repair or replacement of Government-owned IPE at contractor-owned manufacturing facilities in Scranton, PA, Indianapolis, IN, and other locations.  This request also supports emergency repairs to prevent production interruptions or loss of resources, as well as addressing threats to security, worker safety, and environmental issues.  At JSMCL, projects include repair and rehab of machining centers, rehab of underground utilities and sewers,repair and upgrade of building electrical controls and resurfacing of deteriorating asphalt and concrete surfaces.  Partial layaway of manufacturing facilities at JSMCL, pertaining to Abrams and Stryker production lines, is also included.  With platform production cessation, occurring in the POM, there will be increased demands to facilitize, equip and enhance current manufacturing operations with new suppliers, as many current DoD contractors exit military production and divest to other commercial sector work. At the other locations, most projects address planned rehab or emergency repair of Government-owned machining centers and other Government IPE.  These projects help prevent increased costs due to obsolete or nonoperational equipment, and also address environmental and safety deficiencies. In addition, this project covers unplanned repairs to Government-owned equipment, as situations arise.  Funds are used to establish, modernize or replace Army-owned industrial facilities and equipment used in direct support of increased WTCV production requirements, resulting from ongoing heightened tensions\/surge requirements in direct support of Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO).  In the present OCO environment, TACOM's Industrial Base needs use funds to establish, modernize and\/or replace Army owned industrial facilities and equipment used in direct support of increased WTCV production requirements (PIF Projects, Parts obsolescence, supplier non-availability, Foreign Dependency, and Single Source Failure issues) throughout the Industrial Base, and direct manufacturing support of the Organic Base.  Funding supports Active Component.\n\n\"In accordance with section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses and providing military support to civil authorities\"."
