            "val": "The Air Force (AF) Physical Security Systems program provides turnkey procurement, installation, integration, and acceptance testing of base defense physical security systems to protect aircraft, to include remotely pilot aircraft and infrastructure required to operate them, missiles, nuclear weapons, and other critical war fighting resources on more than 200 locations worldwide to include active AF, Air Force Reserve, and Air National Guard locations as well as numerous expeditionary, temporary, and semi-fixed locations.  At some locations, the AF has a need to provide initial physical security systems.  At other locations, there is a continuing need to upgrade and modernize existing physical security systems presently installed at fixed sites worldwide.  These existing systems must be replaced or upgraded approximately every five years, depending on environmental conditions, type of sensor, and availability of spare parts due to technical obsolescence.  The program funds modern security systems such as, but not limited to, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS); Visual Detection and Assessment Systems (VDAS), ground surveillance radar systems; explosive detection systems; physical delay and\/or denial systems; fence-mounted sensor systems which can include integration into an existing fence, refurbishment\/replacement of an existing fence or initial installation of a fence\/lighting\/refurbishment\/installation of lighting to support visuals assessment systems; access control systems; identity management systems; and annunciator\/data fusion systems that provide comprehensive battle-space awareness.  The program also funds night vision\/reconnaissance, surveillance and target acquisition technologies required for Air Force Security Forces personnel to engage enemy forces twenty-four hours a day under conditions of degraded visibility due to darkness, adverse weather, battlefield obscurants, foliage and man-made structures.  These devices enable near to long range target acquisition, identification and engagement to include significant fratricide reduction, which improves battlefield command and control 24\/7 home station and combat operations.  It focuses on technology that can bring an immediate improvement to the mounted\/dismounted Airman's equipment.  It develops or enhances equipment that provides the individual Airman day\/night situational awareness and individual targeting capability as a complete weapon system; funds also support the use of investment equipment for major range and test facilities.  Program funds are also used to pay for power and communication infrastructure and other IDS support requirements (e.g. HVAC for temperature control within server and annunciator control rooms).  IDS are required for Protection Levels (PL) 1 - 4 assets and facilities (ex. AF aircraft parking areas).  The program will respond to transient and on-going security threats and provide tactical, semi-permanent and fixed site security systems which may require design & engineering, installation, infrastructure and allied support, integration, acceptance testing, modeling and simulation, training, Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (MILES) Gear, and interim contractor support.  This program also directly supports the Homeland Defense elements of antiterrorism, counterterrorism, critical infrastructure protection, intelligence, and consequence management.  Other physical security delay\/denial systems funded in this program include remotely operated mobile sensor systems to include directed energy weapons for force protection applications, non-lethal weapons, and remotely operated weapons mounting & fire control systems.  This program also funds testing of physical security systems and equipment at various test locations.  Provides Tactical and Expeditionary Security Systems  (TESS)designed to provide deployable perimeter base defense worldwide. These Tactical & Expeditionary security systems employs sensors, assessment devices, alarm monitors, data communications links and power equipment to form a continuous electronic security envelope around critical resources and installation perimeters, improving the ability of Air Force (AF) Security Forces (SF) to see, understand and act first to defeat our enemies.  Designs are modular and tailored to support any requirement and include line and wide area detection and assessment systems such as ground surveillance radar and unmanned ground\/airborne surveillance systems.  \n\nItems requested in FY14 are identified on the following P-40A and are representative of items to be procured.  Items procured during execution may change based on critical equipment needed to support current Air Force mission requirements."

            "val": "1.  AIR LAUNCH CRUISE MISSILE (ALCM) SECURITY SYSTEMS:  Funds procurement of intrusion detection sensors, alarm annunciators, surveillance systems and related security system equipment needed to upgrade and\/or replace unsupportable, aging and obsolete ALCM security command and control systems\/equipment.  FY14 continues funding the installation and integration of the perimeter and exterior\/interior security system at WSAs.  Funds provide security upgrade planning at various other WSAs and priority AF locations.  Funding for this effort is in PE 0101122F.\n\n2.  MINUTEMAN SQUADRON SECURITY:  Funds procurement of intrusion detection sensors, alarm annunciators, and surveillance systems required to maintain and replace critical Minuteman warhead storage security command and control subsystems that can no longer be supported.  Funding for this effort is in PE 0101213F.\n\n3.  AIR BASE DEFENSE (ABD):  Funding supports AF tactical sensor program and tactical equipment to provide critical capability to fulfill air base defense requirements.  AF SF requires automated, effective systems to detect intrusions and assess potential targets.  Tactical\/Expeditionary equipment is required to provide robust force protection capabilities worldwide.  Tactical\/Expeditionary kit procurement includes scalable configurations required by unit type code logistics details, including varying numbers of active, passive and telescoping infrared and breakwire sensors as well as communications equipment, radios, assessment devices, training and associated support equipment.  Expeditionary flightline security supporting a host of platforms to include aircraft; intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance assets; and critical infrastructure.  New technologies continue to improve force protection capabilities and security system effectiveness while mitigating SF manpower limitations. Funding for this effort is in PE 0207588F.  OVERSEAS CONTINGENCY OPERATIONS(OCO): FY12 funds procured fixed site IDS for Protection Level 2\/3\/4 resources at Al-Udeid AB (Qatar), Al-Dhafra AB (UAE), and Ali Al Salem AB (Kuwait).  These USCENTCOM bases are programmed for long term\/enduring use and currently have a mix of Expeditionary\/Tactical Security Systems and IDS packages which lack interoperability with contiguous IDS and future upgrades. Permanent fixed site IDS solutions will integrate disparate sensor systems and ensure required security standards are met for critical war fighting assets located at enduring bases.  Funding for this effort is in PEs 0207588F and 0207589F.\n\n4.  BASE PHYSICAL SECURITY SYSTEMS (BPSS):  Reduces the risk to AF personnel, weapon systems, and facilities.  DoD downsizing, reductions in forward basing, and aircraft technology advances evolved AF weapons systems into increasingly valuable national power projection capabilities.  However, the security afforded most AF aircraft and associated personnel and facilities in terms of equipment or manpower has not kept pace with the changing world environment, state-of-the-art technology and potential threats.  Force Protection BPSS contracts enable the AF to meet both BPSS and flightline security requirements in accordance with the Aerospace Expeditionary Force concept.  FY14 funding procures, tests, and installs equipment including a variety of sensors,sensor platforms, unmanned air and\/or ground vehicles, assessment devices and communication equipment to meet a broad range of intrusion detection needs (mobile, semi-permanent\/expeditionary and fixed, perimeter, tactical and flightline).  Acquires, tests, and installs exterior and interior intrusion detection, assessment, alarm reporting systems, and identity management systems for AF installations.  Installations and upgrades include engineering, interior\/exterior intrusion detection systems, annunciators, access control systems with accompanying communications upgrades, video storage systems, allied support, technical orders, initial training, training equipment (e.g. MILES Gear), interim contractor support, and ancillary equipment items.  IDS upgrade technologies include, but are not limited to, ground surveillance radar systems, explosive detection systems, fence mounted\/ground sensor technologies, unmanned ground\/aerial day\/night surveillance and detection systems, and remotely operated weapon systems.  Nuclear Weapon Storage Areas (WSAs) are located throughout the CONUS and vault storages areas at main operating bases in Europe.  Funding also supports projects for nuclear weapons in storage to meet long term physical security requirements in the face of enduring and emerging threats.  Critical assets at permanent AF installations worldwide require permanently installed IDS and access control systems.  Technology improvements include extended range detection and assessment, biometric readers, automated entry control, large vehicle screening, integrated command, control and display, man portable surveillance, target radar systems, sensor platforms, delay\/denial technologies, and remotely operated weapons systems. Force protection security equipment reduces risk to AF personnel, nonnuclear PLs 1- 4, weapon systems and facilities at AF, ANG and AFR installations.  This includes protection of flightlines (mass and dispersed aircraft parking areas, runways, controlled movement areas, etc.), critical support facilities, infrastructure, personnel and perimeters of restricted areas, controlled areas, and installation perimeters.   DoD downsizing, reductions in forward basing, and aircraft technology advances elevated AF weapon systems into increasingly valuable national power projection capabilities.  Projects support long-term physical security requirements in the face of enduring and emerging threats.  Critical assets at AF installations worldwide require permanently installed IDS and access control systems.  Detection and access control systems integrate alarms, sensors, entry control, identity management functions, and annunciators into consolidated packages in support of priority resource protection.  This effort funds integration of Transformational Technology Insertion, to fully leverage existing government owned equipment to enhance SF units capability to see, understand, and act first to defeat threats.  This is accomplished through the successful integration of long and short range ground based radar, long and medium range thermal imagers, and other relevant sensor data into one common operating picture. Funding for this effort is in PE 0207589F.\n \n5. ANTITERRORISM:  Funds procurement of intrusion detection systems which greatly enhance the effectiveness of AF antiterrorism program efforts to detect, deter, and defend service members, civilian employees, family members, facilities, and other AF resources around the globe against terrorist attacks.  Furthermore, targeted and rapid procurement\/installation of TASS is often required to protect resources that have been evaluated as potentially soft targets for terrorist attacks.  Funding for this effort is in PE 0208047F."
