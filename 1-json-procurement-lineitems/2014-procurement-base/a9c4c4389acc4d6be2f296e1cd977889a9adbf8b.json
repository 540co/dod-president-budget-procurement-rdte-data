            "val": "The Air Force (AF) is the executive agent for Headquarters United States Central Command (HQ USCENTCOM) which is geographically separated from its AOR by over 7,000 miles.  HQ USCENTCOM's mission is to work with its national and international partners in promoting development and cooperation among nations, responding to crises, and deterring or defeating state and transnational aggression in order to establish regional security and stability across its entire Area of Responsibility (AOR). Since USCENTCOM's AOR, covering the Middle East, includes the challenges of regional stability and violent extremists, this Combatant Command's mission is critical in regards to the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO). To meet its mission responsibilities across this geographical expanse, HQ USCENTCOM must rely heavily on Command, Control, Communications, and Computer (C4) systems capable of achieving full spectrum information superiority. FY14 funding continues to maintain, sustain and modernize critical inter\/intra-theater C4 capabilities and improves communications reliability, capacity, and security in a number of key operating locations in Southwest Asia (SWA). Acquiring current systems reduces life cycle maintenance, and reduces the AF's need to activate and deploy Guard and Reserve units to maintain and operate the older, more manpower-intensive tactical communications systems. FY14 funding procures critical communications and electronics equipment in direct support of ongoing Contingency operations across the AOR. \n\n1. USCENTCOM COMMAND AND CONTROL SYSTEMS: FY14 funding procures communications equipment supporting the USCENTCOM Headquarters, Commander and staff in MacDill AFB, FL and its CENTCOM Forward Headquarters (CFH) in Al Udeid, Qatar, as well as office locations in Bahrain, Kuwait, Camp Arifjan, and Security Cooperation Offices within the USCENTCOM Area of Responsibility.   Effort will procure equipment life cycle updates, as well as new technology directly supporting, but not limited to: Command and Control (C2) systems, classified and unclassified voice, data and video dissemination, local area network (LAN) infrastructure (routers, switches, servers, etc.), establishment of the CENTCOM Partner Network (CPN) which provides a new secure network for bilateral \/ multilateral information sharing up to the SECRET RELEASABLE level.  CPN solves a sharing issue with our regional partners and supports the Command's CONPLAN\/OPLANs. Joint Staff J3 validated this Multinational Information Sharing (MNIS) Operational System Requirement per CJCSI 6285.01B, in 2010, 2011, and 2012 (Joint Staff J3 #7 MNIS priority).  Support increased data storage capacity requirements of Disaster Recovery (DR) site equipment and uninterrupted power supply (UPS) required for the command's collateral classified and unclassified data networks. This equipment provides HQ USCENTCOM with effective C4 systems to effectively conduct current and future operations throughout the AOR. This effort is funded in program element (PE) 0201122F.\n         \n2. JOINT COMMUNICATIONS SUPPORT ELEMENT (JCSE): JCSE, assigned under Joint Enabling Capabilities Command, US Transportation Command, is the only joint Department of Defense (DoD) unit specifically formed to provide C4 systems support for Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) contingency operations worldwide. Equipment requirements are approved annually by the JCS and procurement for the AF share is executed by JCSE.  FY14 funding procures the AF's proportional cost share of deployable Everything over Internet Protocol (EoIP) and satellite terminal equipment for one joint task force and four service component network spokes. A percentage of currently employed commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) EoIP and satellite terminal equipment is approaching the end of its 6-year lifecycle and needs to be replaced. The Phase 3 EOIP equipment requires replacement to meet the evolving warfighter requirements. This effort is funded in PE 0207422F.\n\n 3. AIR COMBAT COMMAND (ACC) COMMUNICATIONS: Air Forces United States Central Command (AFCENT) is the ACC component designated to support USCENTCOM operations in deployed theaters for the AF. Funds modernize and upgrade C4 systems throughout the area of responsibility (AOR). Procurement efforts include: communications infrastructure requirements, satellite terminal equipment, data network servers and associated information assurance tools, information transfer nodes and routers, joint radio relay upgrades and installations, as well as deployed air traffic control and landing systems and navigational aid systems. All efforts are funded in PE 0201131F.   Major FY14 procurement initiatives are detailed below:\n\n a. AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL SYSTEMS MODIFICATIONS FOR AFGHANISTAN: With the current ongoing operations and planned mission changes, vital adjustments to the upcoming transition to Afghanistan control is required, which include installing several additional joint radio relay (JR2) units and internal relocations of existing JR2 units are required in FY13.  In addition, equipment modifications and technical upgrades are needed to existing Air Traffic Control Systems to ensure an effective transition to Afghan control during the upcoming transition period (FY13\/FY14).  If these efforts are not funded, it will result in unsafe flying conditions for military and civil aircraft across Afghanistan.\n\nb. DEPLOYABLE Ka\/Ku-BAND EARTH TERMINAL (DKET) SATELLITE TERMINAL MODERNIZATION PROGRAM:  This initiative is required to technically upgrade and modernize the existing Ku-band satellite terminals across the AFCENT network supporting the SWA AOR.  This multi-year effort will ensure continued success in transitioning the employed Ku-band satellite terminals (DKETs) to the Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) as mandated by the Office of the Secretary of Defense.  In addition, the funds will provide critical modernization of the on-line terminals, providing upgraded satellite modems, reconfiguration of capabilities to meet ongoing and planned satellite backbone network requirements. The transition is very important for effective C2 communications.  Failure to fund will result in decreased capability to supply mission related video and voice communications to the warfighter.\n\nc. BASE COMMAND, CONTROL, COMMUNICATIONS, COMPUTERS, and INTELLIGENCE (C4I)INFRASTRUCTURE: This FY14 initiative will support communications asset positioning and upgrades to the CENTCOM Theater Posture Plan (TPP) locations identified for post OEF operations support.  This effort is required at several AFCENT locations in the AOR and will provide critical system upgrades to ensure communication cable infrastructure is adequate, maintain emergency 911 services, DSN telephone switches, technical control facilities, and DOD CS 1000 phone switches, land mobile radios (LMR), and unclassified\/classified data networks maintain current interoperability and information assurance certification requirements required by the Department of Defense and public law.  The following locations are part of this program:\n\nc1. AL UDEID INFRASTRUCTURE:  Continued support to meet relocation of multiple tenant units\/organization relocating to Al Udeid and existing organizations\/tenant requirements are required. The host nation has provided multiple new facilities for U.S. use, but these facilities do not have the infrastructure cabling nor communications equipment included, thus AFCENT must procure and install communications equipment to get C2 communications, data, voice and VTC to the new user locations. Funding requested in FY14 supports the continued new tenants and upcoming relocation of US users at other Qatar locations.\n\nc2. AL DHAFRA INFRASTRUCTURE: Continued support to meet internal relocation of multiple tenant units\/organization at Al Dhafra and upgrading of many older communications infrastructure on the base.  The host nation has provided multiple new facilities for U.S. use, but these facilities do not have the infrastructure cabling nor communications equipment included, thus AFCENT must procure and install communications equipment to get C2 communications, data, voice and VTC to the new user locations. \n\nc3. LIWA INFRASTRUCTURE:  Internal planning from the host nation has required AFCENT to plan for communications infrastructure at Liwa, UAE.  Funding is required to meet the new operations starting in FY14. The host nation is planning to provide several new facilities for U.S. use, but these facilities do not have the infrastructure cabling nor communications equipment included, thus AFCENT must procure and install communications equipment to get C2 communications, data, voice and VTC to the new user locations.   \n\nc4. ALI AL SALEM INFRASTRUTURE:  Multiple end user\/tenant locations require communications infrastructure upgrades to ensure continued command and control (C2) and distribution of voice, data, and VTC requirements.  Included in the FY14 requirements are new data network\/routers to meet transition from old asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) interface to new internet protocol (IP) interface for DISA terrestrial transmission leases, which provide backbone transport for the site.\n\nc5. ZAYED MILITARY CITY COMPLEX (ZMCC) INFRASTRUTURE:  Internal planning from the host nation has required AFCENT to plan for communications infrastructure at ZMCC, UAE.  FY13 funding is required to meet the new operations starting in late FY13 and\/or early FY14 timeframe. The host nation is planning to provide new facilities for U.S. use, but these facilities do not have the infrastructure cabling nor communications equipment included, thus AFCENT must procure and install communications equipment to get C2 communications, data, voice and VTC to the new user locations.\n\nc6.  BAGRAM INFRASTRUCTURE:  Many of the existing AFCENT base communications information transfer nodes (ITN) require equipment lifecycle upgrades to meet current requirements in the harsh environment. In addition, due to the upcoming relocations of forces across Afghanistan, internal modifications will be required to meet increasing user populations during the drawdown across the region.\n\nd. SWA-THEATER ENTERPRISE REQUIREMENTS:  To meet Unified Capabilities (UC) requirements across the SWA AOR, AFCENT must conduct communications enterprise network upgrades, as well as equipment replacement in FY13 into FY14.  FY14 funds are required for network router upgrades to transition off old\/outdated Promina networks to meet black core routing, as well as local session controller (LSC) equipment to transition off time division multiple (TDM) to Internet Protocol (IP) transport.  Lastly, the enterprise level communications equipment upgrades are required to also meet vital information assurance certification requirements."

            "val": "USCENTCOM:  FY14 procurement funds in the amount of $3.761M will procure C4 equipment items required for HQ USCENTCOM, MacDill AFB, FL and CENTCOM Forward HQ at Al Udeid, Qatar, to effectively conduct communications support missions impacting Command and Control (C2) and operational missions conducted by the Commander and staff.  The C4\/Information Technology (IT) supporting the command must be sustained and upgraded to meet the ever increasing demands of current, ongoing contingency operations, and the growth of data storage requirements.  Without OPAF funding, the vital life cycle replacement of communications equipment directly supporting all C2 and C4 operations will be at significant risk and will catastrophically affect the ability of the ongoing contingency operational missions across the AOR.     \n\nJCSE:  FY14 procurement dollars in the amount of $5.133M procures communications equipment based on Strategic Planning Guidance; which includes major upgrades to mobile satellite systems, Everything over Internet Protocol (EoIP), and COMSEC equipment. Current employed commercial-off-the-shelf, EoIP, and satellite terminal equipment is approaching the end of its 6-year life cycle and needs to be replaced. The Phase 3 EoIP equipment requires replacement, along with replacement of equipment, to meet the modernization program goals which include meeting emerging real-world operational requirements with improved capabilities, smaller footprint, reduced operations and maintenance costs, and seamless integration with the global information grid. Per the Planning Guidance, the AF is mandated to fund one-third of the fair share of JCSE's validated equipment modernization plan. JCSE's Modernization Program is built\/restructured based on COCOM requirements and emerging technologies. Service's influence JCSE's spending plan through recommendations in concert with MDAP schedules, ensuring that Service dollars meet Joint Service requirements. \n\nUSAFCENT: FY14 procurement funds in the amount of $25.382M will procure numerous C4 equipment items critically required for HQ USAFCENT, Shaw AFB, and the CAOC\/AFFOR staff, Al Udeid, Qatar, to effectively conduct its communications support missions directly supporting CFACC C2 and all operational missions being conducted by the CFACC and Staff.  The C4\/IT supporting the CFACC's mission must be sustained and upgraded to meet the ever increasing demands from the ongoing contingency operations, and to be able to support contingency plans. Without OPAF funding, all C2 and C4 operations at USAFCENT locations will be at significant risk and will catastrophically affect the ability of the ongoing contingency air operational missions across the AOR.  \n\nItems requested in FY14 are identified on the following P-40A and are representative of items to be procured.  Items procured during execution may change based on critical equipment needed to support current Air Force mission requirements."
