            "val": "CLOSED CIRCUIT TELEVISION (CCTV)\/AUDIOVISUAL EQUIPMENT:  Imagery Acquisition and Audiovisual (AV) systems and their products are used throughout the Air Force to inform and train warfighters and to document combat operations and other events of historical significance. Combat video documentation is used for operational reporting and analysis, situational awareness, battle damage assessment, intelligence and operational analysis, casualty identification, and the historical record. In addition, video and multimedia based products are developed for warfighter operations, readiness training, medical videography, public and internal information, testing and evaluation, and corporate communications. Commanders recognize that imagery quickly conveys very accurate and unbiased information, and are requiring greater amounts of video imagery to help meet the challenges of a very active warfighting force. The Air Force is meeting this challenge in FY13 by dedicating funding to procure and sustain this important capability by replacing older video studio systems with newer and more capable equipment and systems for both Air Force video production and combat\/contingency documentation teams. Imagery acquisition systems are centrally managed to establish and maintain standardization of systems, as well as to ensure full interoperability with all other electronic image acquisition, transmission system formats, and presentation systems used in the Air Force."

            "val": "1. IMAGE ACQUISITION\/TELEVISION STUDIO EQUIPMENT:  FY14 procures replacement equipment and upgrades for studio-based video systems and photography equipment. Increased implementation of digitally based video and photo systems for image signal capture, processing, editing, and transmission enables Air Force multimedia facilities to offer greater capability in image articulation and customer understanding. FY14 funding will also continue evolution into High Definition (HD) video production and the next generation of digital photography. This equipment includes cameras, editing and duplication systems, and all accessories necessary for image capture, processing, and distribution. This program funds 19 production centers and base multimedia facilities which provide products for combat operations, education and training and corporate \ncommunications. Funding for this effort is in program element (PE)0102890F.\n\n2. COMBAT CAMERA SYSTEMS:  FY14 continues replacement of heavily used and worn mobile combat documentation video and digital photography cameras and night vision lenses, portable video recorders, portable nonlinear digital video editors, and mobile digital photography editing workstations in support of worldwide Combat Camera and multimedia forces. This program provides for technology upgrades to portable video and photo systems and includes lightweight digital cameras and camcorders providing higher quality imagery to the warfighter. These newer systems reduce the transportation footprint, streamline the work load and enable combat camera personnel to transmit motion and still imagery across satellite as well as terrestrial systems. This critical capability provides warfighters with greater flexibility in decision-making with real-time operational and combat imagery. Funding for this effort is in PE 0102890F.\n\n3.  WESTERN TEST RANGE DIGITAL IMAGING SYSTEMS:  This funding effort is a continuation for a multiyear replacement of 35-year old high speed film cameras with high-speed digital imaging and IR systems at the Western Range Test Range.  These cameras are mounted on mobile optical tracking systems and on camera towers next to the launch pad to provide detailed slow motion photography of the launch events.  The cameras support satellite, ballistic, missile defense and aeronautical missions on the Western Test Range and at Kodiak Island, Alaska.  FY14 continues the multiyear replacement of 35 year-old high-speed engineering film cameras with high-speed digital imaging and IR systems along with upgrade of mobile tracking mounts to support the new digital cameras.  Funding for this effort is in PE 0305550F."
