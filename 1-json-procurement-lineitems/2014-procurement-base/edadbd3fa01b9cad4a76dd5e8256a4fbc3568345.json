It sustains Army production test capabilities through upgrade and replacement of instrumentation and equipment that is technologically and\/or economically obsolete.  Modernization of test instrumentation and equipment provides increased automation and efficiencies, improved data quality and quantity and cost avoidances to Army Program Managers.  Programmed funding will be used to upgrade or replace production test instrumentation and equipment at Aberdeen Test Center (ATC), Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD; and Yuma Test Center (YTC), Yuma Proving Ground, AZ (including YTCs Cold Regions Test Center (CRTC), Fort Greely, AK)."

At YTC, procures replacement transducers used to collect performance data during automotive tests (including sensors, load cells, thermocouple amplifiers, pressure transducers, embedded wireless sensors, strain gages, current transducers and thermocouples); and replaces costly film based imaging systems with digital cameras and recorders.\n\nThe majority of the instrumentation being upgraded or replaced is obsolete and has met or exceeded its economic life.  This instrumentation is required to ensure complete and accurate test data is collected and safety and environmental hazards are minimized.  Benefits of this project include increased test efficiencies and decreased costs and risks to Army Program Managers.\n."
