This shortens the time required to field capabilities initiated under SEP. Items in this category include Commercial Off-the Shelf\/Government Off-the Shelf\/Non-Developmental Item small arms, individual and crew served weapons components, sights, and accessories. Capabilities envisioned for procurement include the MK 56 Optic, which improves Soldier's target acquisition and probability of hit for the M2 .50 Caliber Crew Served Machine Gun; the Squad Common Optic which combines the close range\/rapid target acquisition capabilities of the M68 Close Combat Optic (CCO) and the magnified capabilities of the M150 Rifle Combat Optic (RCO); and the Sniper\/Designated Marksman Optic which combines the close range\/low end magnification and the extended range\/higher magnification to allow for a full spectrum operational capability for sniper teams and the Designated Marksman the squad level.\n\n\"In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.\""
