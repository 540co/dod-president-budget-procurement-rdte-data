Funding procures printers, laptop computers and Client Suites to support the Biometric Automated Toolset System (BATS), which is a fully-fielded capability with a three-year refresh cycle.\n\nIntelligence Analysis System Mod (IAS) Family of Systems (FoS) provides intelligence support to Marines garrison, shipboard, and battlefield missions at all levels of the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF). This support includes the formulation and\/or compilation of the commander's Priority Intelligence Requirements (PIR), Essential Elements of Information (EEI), and Other Intelligence Requirements (OIR); contingency planning; management of MAGTF collection assets; all-source intelligence analysis, briefing support, intelligence product fusion, production, reporting dissemination and training. The IAS FoS has proven to be the All-Source Fusion Center that provides interoperable scalable, semi-automated capabilities to receive, process, analyze, display and disseminate all-source intelligence, including imagery, to support timely tactical decision-making across the MAGTF."
