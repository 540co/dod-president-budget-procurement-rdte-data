            "val": "Theater Battle Management Core Systems (TBMCS) is an integrated battle management system used to plan, execute, and assess an air campaign.  It provides automated planning tools enabling consistent, coordinated battle management at entities ranging from the force level (Air Operations Centers [AOC]) to the unit level (wings\/squadrons) for operations and intelligence functions.  TBMCS is a United States Air Force system with Joint interest responsible for generation and dissemination of the air tasking order and interoperates with allied units.  Enhanced force level capabilities will be provided through the Applications Development project and unit-level operations and intelligence capabilities through the unit-level (Unit Level\/Unit Command and Control [UL\/UC2]) project within the AOC Weapon System Program Element (PE) 0207410F.\n\nFunding for this exhibit contained in PE 0207410F."

            "val": "1.  TBMCS-FORCE LEVEL (TBMCS-FL): Provides the Joint and Combined Air Component Commander with the automated tools necessary to effectively and efficiently plan, monitor, and execute the air campaign.  This includes planning and issuing the Air Tasking and Airspace Control Orders that ensure the theater commander's intent is supported through the application of airpower using the latest intelligence.  FY14 funding will continue fielding TBMCS-FL Spiral 1.1.3 Maintenance Release 2 to 35 locations (25 AD\/5 ANG\/5 AFR).  Funding for this effort is in PE 0207410F.\n\n     a.  TBMCS-FL PROGRAM MANAGEMENT ADMINISTRATION (PMA): FY14 funding includes provisions for government contract oversight, technical expertise, and program office support associated with the fielding of TBMCS-FL.  \n\n     b.  TBMCS-FL TRAINING & FIELDING: FY14 funding will support Type 1 training & fielding.  As contractors field the TBMCS-FL upgrades, they will provide specialized training at each location.\n\n     c-e.  TBMCS-FL Spiral 1.1.3: FY14 funds will be used to procure hardware and associated software licenses for fielding to various sites.\n\n2.  UNIT LEVEL\/UNIT COMMAND AND CONTROL (UL\/UC2): Provides the wing and base commanders, and their battle staffs with timely and accurate information for effective decision making.  UL\/UC2 also provides secure, automated, deployable, and distributed wing-level command and control system with connectivity to TBMCS-FL systems.  UL\/UC2 has operations and intelligence configurations.  FY14 funding will support fielding UL\/UC2 Ops Increment 2 to 45 active duty locations and fielding UL\/UC2 Intel Service Pack 12 to 137 active duty locations.  Funding for this effort is in PE 0207410F.\n\n     a.  UL\/UC2 HARDWARE AND COMMERCIAL-OFF-THE-SHELF (COTS) SOFTWARE: FY14 funds will replace clients, servers, miscellaneous hardware, and associated software licenses for UL\/UC2 Ops & Intel sites.\n\n     b.  UL\/UC2 PMA: FY14 funding includes provisions for government contract oversight, technical expertise, and program office support associated with the fielding of UL\/UC2.\n     \n3.  PERSONNEL RECOVERY COMMAND AND CONTROL (PRC2): Provides PRC2 services supporting all Combatant Commands, Joint Services and other non-government agencies.  Capabilities include web-based access to isolated personnel reports for all DoD personnel, C2 tools for performing command and control of recovery efforts for downed airmen\/isolated ground troops, and rapid identification of personnel in distress.  PRC2 is used within AOCs\/AORs, Joint Personnel Recovery Centers, and Rescue Coordination Centers to provide the capabilities and services for planning and executing recovery of isolated personnel, and rapidly collaborate, disseminate, and store time-sensitive personnel recovery information.  Funding for this effort is in PE 0207410F.\n\n     a.  PRC2 HARDWARE AND COTS SOFTWARE: FY14 funds will procure various hardware pieces and associated software licenses for fielding to various sites.\n\n     b.  PRC2 PMA: FY14 funding includes provisions for government contract oversight, technical expertise, and program office support associated with the fielding of PRC2.\n\nItems requested in FY14 are identified on the following P-5 and are representative of items to be procured.  Items procured during execution may change based on critical equipment needed to support current Air Force mission requirements."
