In this capacity, DSS is responsible for providing security oversight, counterintelligence coverage and support to almost 10,000 cleared companies (comprising over 13,500 + industrial facilities and about 1.2 million cleared contractors), and accreditation of more than 14,000 classified information technology systems in the NISP.  DSS also serves as the functional manager responsible for the execution and maintenance of DoD security training.  In support of this mission, DSS provides security education, training, and professionalization services for DoD and industry under the NISP.  \n\nThe DSS supports the Automated Information Systems (AIS) and telecommunications infrastructure and programs that include:  National Industrial Security Program (NISP), Counterintelligence (CI), Center for Defense Security Excellence (CDSE), and support elements.  The DSS IT infrastructure includes: desktops, networks: (Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System (JWCIS), Non-Secure Internet Protocol (NIPRNet), and Secure Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet), Help Desk operations and call center.  The DSS manages activities associated with the Enterprise Security System (ESS) which includes ongoing support and maintenance of the following legacy systems:  Industrial Security Facilities Database (ISFD), and Electronic Network Registration and On-Line Learning (ENROL).  \n\nPurpose and Scope\n\nThe funds requested provide resources necessary to replace mission-essential IT equipment and to procure new investment items for Enterprise Security Systems applications."

Enterprise VoIP: Provides a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) solution that will enhance telecommunications capabilities and increase productivity to the user community on the field.  VoIP integrates business communications into a single infrastructure as a component of the existing data network.  VoIP users will receive increased productivity, flexibility, lower costs, and leverage a secure infrastructure in their daily mission.  Enterprise VoIP combines voice, data, and video into a secure and easy-to-manage service while reducing total cost of ownership through \nelimination of legacy telecom solutions and stovepipe systems at each DSS facility.\n\n2.  Gateway Network Solutions: Is a form of controlled interface that provides the ability to manually and\/or automatically access and\/or transfer information between different security domains. [CNSSI No. 4009] A Security Domain is a system or network operating at a particular sensitivity level. This  program will provides DSS an  integrated system of hardware and software that enable the transfer of information among incompatible security domains or levels of classification based on  a risk management model that prevent classified leakage and unauthorized access to files and networks."
