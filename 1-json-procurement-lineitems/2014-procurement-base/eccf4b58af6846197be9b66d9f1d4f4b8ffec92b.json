            "val": "This budget line includes Simulators, All Types.\n\nE42801 M9 Simulator Projectile Airburst Liquid is used in training to provide a realistic chemical-biological defense system.  An electronic actuating charge propels the simulant-filled bottle into the air, then a one-second burn-through delay fuze sets off the burster charge at approximately a 30 foot or 50 foot height by a 150 foot width to disperse a vapor cloud spray, which triggers the chemical sensors by causing color changes to chemical agent detector paper; five projectors can be burst at the same time to increase the area.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.\n\nE49700 M115A2 Artillery Ground Burst Simulator is a hand thrown device that is used in training to simulate battle noise and effects (shell in flight and ground explosion) during troop maneuvers.  The simulator has a 6-10 second delay followed by a 2-4 second whistle ending with a flash and loud report; the surface danger zone is 35 meters.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.\n\nE49900 M117 Booby Trap Simulator is used in training to teach the installation, detection and use of booby traps, and to instill caution in troops exposed to traps set by the enemy.  The simulator is trip wire initiated and produces a flash and bang.  The surface danger zone is 6 feet.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.\n\nE50000 M118 Booby Trap Simulator is used in training to teach the installation, detection and use of booby traps, and to instill caution in troops exposed to traps set by the enemy.  The simulator is trip wire initiated and produces a flame for 28 seconds.  The surface danger zone is 6 feet.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.\n\nE50100 M119 Booby Trap Simulator is used in training to teach the installation, detection and use of booby traps, and to instill caution in troops exposed to traps set by the enemy.  The simulator is trip wire initiated and produces a whistle for 2.5 to 5 seconds.  The surface danger zone is 6 feet.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.\n\nE50200 M116A1 Hand Grenade Simulator is a hand-thrown device and is used in training to simulate battle noise and effects during troop maneuvers.  It has a 5 to 10 second delay and a 15 meter surface danger zone.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.\n\nE70600 M22 Anti-Tank Weapon Effect Signature Simulator (ATWESS) Guided Missile (GM) Rocket Simulator is used to simulate the TOW, DRAGON or VIPER, including report, flash and smoke through use of an adapter.  It is compatible with the Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (MILES).  This item is Code A, approved for service use.\nE88119 M34 Hostile Fire Simulator has replaced the M21 and is used for Force on Target training to simulate large caliber gunfire.  The simulator emits an orange flash and white smoke visible at 1800 meters.  The simulator is fired from the Omega 60B2 and the Omega 36.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.\n\nE88125 M35 Target Hit (White Star) Simulator has replaced the M25 and is used for Force on Target training to simulate a strike or target hit signal.  The Simulator emits 8-12 white burning stars visible at 1800 meters.  The simulator is fired from the Omega 60B2 and the Omega 36.  This item is Code A, approved for service use."

War reserve requirements support OSD-approved Combatant Commander Operational Plans, Homeland Defense, and other OSD-directed missions.  Training requirements support individual and collective training of Active and Reserve Component forces at Army schools, home station, and the combined training centers.  Test requirements support the development, fielding, safety, and quality assurance of Army munitions and equipment throughout their life-cycle.  \n\nFY 2014 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $5.228 million supports production of three variants of simulators."
