The Air Mobility Command (AMC) Airlift and Air Refueling Mission Area Plans identified a deficiency in the ability to protect MAF aircraft from hostilities during combat operations.  To enhance mission safety during these combat operations, it is critical to provide aircrews with timely and essential off-board information.  Enabling real-time information in the cockpit allows mission adjustments in response to rapidly changing combat conditions while in-flight.  The airborne broadcast intelligence (ABI) and combat track II (CTII) systems provide real-time intelligence, situational awareness (national\/theater intelligence and displays air\/land\/blue water threats), beyond line-of-sight C2 data, and secure text messaging, which enable aircrews to receive updated threat and mission information.  To limit system implementation costs, ABI\/CTII are roll-on\/roll-off systems enabling immediate employment on all MAF aircraft.  Without real-time information and C2 communications in the cockpit, MAF aircraft will be forced to continue to operate without secure access to mission critical beyond line-of-sight C2 and situational\/threat awareness leaving them vulnerable to enemy threats and hostile actions.  These systems are interchangeable between all MAF aircraft."

It will enable completion of activation of depot capabilities for the stores management system; hydraulic pumps and components; structural components to include canopy and weapons bay door hinges; and other CNI and electronic warfare system components.  The requirement includes the purchase of initial outfitting equipment (IOE) for individual activation packages."

The RQ-4A is an imagery-intelligence (IMINT) RPA designed to employ 2000 pounds of payload. The RQ-4A has one configuration known as the Block 10. The Block 10 employs an IMINT system comprised of a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensor and an electro-optical (EO)\/infrared (IR) sensor. These three sensors are called the integrated sensor suite (ISS). The RQ-4B RPA is designed to employ 3000 pounds of payload and enable multi-intelligence (multi-INT)collecting. The RQ-4B has three configurations: Block 20, Block 30, and Block 40. The Block 20 employs upgraded SAR and EO\/IR sensors known as the enhanced ISS (EISS) in an IMINT only configuration. The Block 30 employs the same EISS sensors as the Block 20 and also integrates a wide spectrum signals intelligence (SIGINT) sensor suite simultaneously to be used as a multi-INT platform. The Block 40 will only integrate the multi-platform radar technology insertion program (MP-RTIP) radar sensor. The user will ultimately determine the optimal quantities and payloads for each aircraft configuration based on operational requirements. The ground station (GS) includes the mission control element (MCE) and the launch and recovery element (LRE). The support segment includes aerospace ground equipment, tech orders, spares, support equipment, and training to enable the Global Hawk System.\n\nThis program has associated Research Development Test and Evaluation funding in PE 0305220F and PE 0304260F.\n\nNo funding requested for FY14."

                        "val": "This budget item covers two categories of pollution prevention activities at USAF industrial (government owned, contractor operated) facilities.  Both categories not only reduce emission of hazardous materials to air, land, and water, they also reduce cost to the Air Force as facility owner, as buyer of products manufactured in the plants, and through process improvements that can be transitioned to Air Force users.  The first category covers the demonstration, validation, and procurement of improved equipment and services provided by the Air Force as facility owner and direct manager of common areas and services at these facilities.  These activities meet Air Force pollution prevention goals and reduce the AF ownership cost of the facilities.  They include typical landlord initiatives such as recovery\/recycling equipment, energy conservation initiatives, and pollution prevention opportunity assessments.  The second category of expenditure invests in the demonstration and validation of improved manufacturing processes for plant contractors that reduce emissions, regulatory burdens, and costs.  These are usually cost-sharing initiatives, undertaken with the contractor because the government has required the use of hazardous materials through specifications, standards, drawing, contracts, and technical orders.  These investments over time can reduce the cost to the Air Force of the products produced in the plants.  In addition, the process improvements innovated at the plants often can be transitioned to Air Force depots, resulting in reduced maintenance costs, reduced depot flow time, and increases asset availability.  This budget activity supports Air Force goals under the Pollution Prevention Act, Executive Orders 13423 and 13514, the AF\/CV and SAF\/IE Pollution Prevention Policy, the USD(AT&L) hexavalent chromium reduction policy, and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act."

ATPs feature an infrared (IR) sensor, charged coupled device television (CCD-TV), laser designator, eye-safe laser, laser spot tracker, infrared marker, and real-time video data link for connectivity with ground forces.   ATP capabilities, such as high resolution imagery, eye safe laser, high system reliability and smaller deployment footprint provide greater combat effectiveness across several mission areas, including suppression\/destruction of enemy air defenses (SEAD\/DEAD), precision air interdiction, close air support (CAS), non-traditional intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (NT-ISR), reconnaissance, and time-sensitive targeting.  This funding supports the production, qualification and integration of ATPs to include all activities necessary for fielding. It includes, but is not limited to, Advanced Targeting Pod (ATP) procurements, OFP verification\/qualification testing and integration efforts, Interim Contractor Logistics (ICS) support, containers, site activations, technical data packages, depot standup and program management support. Laser Infrared Targeting and Navigating (LITENING) and Sniper are ATPs currently used by the active duty, Air National Guard (ANG), and Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC).  Advanced Targeting Pod - Sensor Enhancement (ATP-SE) is the next increment in ATP capability.  Low-Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infrared for Night (LANTIRN) and Pave Penny systems will be phased out as new ATP and ATP-SE systems are acquired.\n_____\nFY 2012 funding totals include $23.0M appropriated for Overseas Contingency Operations.\nFY 2013 funding totals include $55.0M requested for Overseas Contingency Operations.\n_____\n\nSchedules and quantities are adjusted based upon funding levels (buy to budget) and COCOM priorities."
