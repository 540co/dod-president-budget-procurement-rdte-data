This budget also provides funding which supports capital-type rehabilitation projects in the areas of environmental, safety, major repair, and energy conservation at the active Naval Industrial Reserve Ordnance Plant (NIROP) Allegany Ballistics Laboratory (ABL) and inactive NWIRP. Capital-type rehabilitation projects at the GOCO plant, NIROP ABL in Rocket Center, WV, supports weapons systems such as AARGM, RAM, Sparrow, ESSM, ERGM, AIM-9X, AGS, Tomahawk GG and Trident GG.\n\n[P40A \/ ENVIRONMENTAL]: Provides funds to eliminate environmental deficiencies in compliance with local, state, and federal OSHA regulations.  These regulations mandate requirements which must be met if plant shutdowns, criminal liability, and severe financial penalties are to be avoided.\n\n[P40A \/ SAFETY]: Provides funds to eliminate safety deficiencies in compliance with local, state, and federal OSHA regulations.  These regulations mandate requirements which must be met if plant shutdowns and severe financial penalties are to be avoided.\n\n[P40A \/ ENERGY CONSERVATION]: Provides funds to decrease energy consumption by installing new energy efficient systems and provides increased maintenance on these systems.  Mandated in 1993 by Congress (Defense Appropriations Committee).\n\n[P40A \/ MAJOR REPAIRS]: Provides funds for critical upgrades to maintain high liability areas such as fire and security systems, roofs, boilers, electrical distribution systems, bridge crane systems, and other structural repairs essential to maintain the industrial integrity of the plant.\n\n[P40A \/ FACILITIES RESTORATION (ABL)]: Provides funds for replacement of Weapons Industrial Facilities at NIROP ABL in Rocket Center, WV that have exceeded their useful life and deteriorated beyond safe operations (personnel & explosive).\n\n[P40A \/ NWIRP MCGREGOR]: This item provides funding to\/for property management, minor maintenance, environmental compliance, and divestiture support for Naval Weapons Industrial Reserve Plant in McGregor, TX."

        "Justification": {
            "val": "Funding is required in to address critical infrastructure issues. \n\nFY14 funding will support the $2.05M procurement of an explosive storage magazine for NIROP ABL.  Explosive storage magazine facilities provide storage space of ordnance produced at NIROP ABL, which is required for security and safety of the personnel, equipment and facilities producing warheads, rocket motors and fuzes.  Presently, storage in the existing magazines is at approximately 95% capacity based on floor space utilization.  Plant production of explosive ordnance is expected to grow by 40% to 50% over the next several years and with existing storage near capacity, additional magazines will be required to support this growth.  Existing small storage magazines are inefficient and in need of renovation.  Installation of new standard magazines will allow older magazines to be emptied for demolition or restoration, and will greatly enhance operational safety at ABL.\n\nFederal Acquisition Regulation Part 52.245-7 specifies that Facilities Use contracts require that the Government fund capital type rehabilitation projects to support and maintain these facilities. These plants have an average age of 45 years and lack of proper maintenance will limit capabilities to maintain scheduled production rates and overall productivity.  Funding is separated to reflect environmental, safety, major repair, energy conservation and facilities restoration."
