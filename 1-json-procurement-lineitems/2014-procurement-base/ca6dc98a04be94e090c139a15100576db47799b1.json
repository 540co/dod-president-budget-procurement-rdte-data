            "val": "The Department of Defense (DoD) Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is the key to abolishing anonymity on DoD Networks and is the mechanism for providing public key certificates to identify users accessing the DoD networks.  PKI supports the infrastructure for the entire DoD and is a key component for enabling information sharing in a secured environment.  PKI provides a framework for secure information sharing with external partners and meets the DoD\u2019s Information Assurance (IA) needs for data confidentiality, authentication, identification, data integrity, non-repudiation of communications or transactions, and digital signatures.  To continue supporting the expanding user community, new Certificate Authorities (CAs) must be purchased and fielded.  Without the ability to expand the infrastructure, the current PKI will not be able to meet the requirements of the DoD community for providing a capability to use digital certificates for securing web servers, signing and encrypting email and smart card logon support.  If digital certificates are not available, the entire DoD Community will revert back to user name and password for accessing computers which introduces significant network security vulnerabilities across the DoD.  DISA\u2019s strategic focus for PKI efforts are to continue to evolve and integrate into enterprise infrastructure and use strong cyber identity credentials for enterprise-level identity and access management for all GIG infrastructure components to include people and hardware.  Enhancements to PKI Non-Secure Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNet) and Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet) infrastructure will be provided to better support use in tactical environments."

            "val": "FY 2012: ($1.788) Purchased equipment and software (i.e., routers, servers, certification authorities, etc.) enhancements that supported a mandated Government-wide standard for secure and reliable identification in accordance with Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) to strengthen the security posture of the DoD PKI, support the warfighter in a tactical environment and maintain PKI Interoperability capabilities.  In addition, stood up new CAs in support of new capabilities and replaced CAs reaching their end of life (EOL), fielded additional CAs to support SIPRNet token issuance, enhanced Non-Person Entity (NPE) server count for full issuance automation and to evolve NPE that supported new devices.  \n\nFY 2013: ($1.827) Continue to procure equipment and software (i.e., routers, servers, certification authorities, etc.) enhancements that will support a mandated Government-wide standard for secure and reliable identification in accordance with HSPD-12 to strengthen the security posture of the DoD PKI, and maintain PKI Interoperability capabilities.  In addition, will standup new CAs in support of new capabilities and replace CAs reaching their EOL.  \n\nExplanation of Change from FY 2012 to FY 2013: The increase of +$0.039 from FY 2012 to FY 2013 will support the procurement of equipment and software for new deployments and enhancements of existing PKI capabilities.\n\nFY 2014: ($0.000) The PKI project has been transitioned to the Defense Working Capital Fund.\n\nExplanation of Change from FY 2013 to FY 2014:  The decrease of -$1.827 from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is the result of the PKI project being transitioned to the Defense Working Capital Fund.\n\nPerformance Metrics:\n1. Procure equipment to sustain certificate issuance to satisfy required 99.9% availability at all times\n2. Percent of SIPRNet users using hardware PKI tokens (FY 2012 = 100%; FY 2013 = 100%)\n3. Percent of devices issued NPE certificates (FY2012 = 20%; FY 2013 = 30%)"
