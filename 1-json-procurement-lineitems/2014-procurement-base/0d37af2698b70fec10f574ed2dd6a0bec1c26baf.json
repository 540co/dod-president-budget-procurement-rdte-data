These integrated automated translation capabilities will be applicable across three different system configurations; a hand-held\/wearable portable device, a laptop or mobile device, and in a networked\/web-enabled system. The software modules will translate English into a prioritized listing of languages in a prioritized collection of domains (i.g. medical, intelligence, base security). MFLTS will be interoperable with Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) or Government Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) automation equipment to include the Distributed Common Ground System-Army (DCGS-A), Ground Soldier Ensemble, Counterintelligence Human Intelligence Automated Reporting and Collection System (CHARCS)."
