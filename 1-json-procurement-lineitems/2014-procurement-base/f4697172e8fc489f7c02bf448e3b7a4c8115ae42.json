            "val": "The B-52 Combat Network Communication Technology (CONECT) acquisition program will support nuclear and conventional operations by upgrading the B-52 fleet with data link and voice communications capabilities along with improved threat and situational awareness to support participation in network centric operations. The CONECT upgrade installs new multi-functional color displays (MFCDs) and a digital interphone system, which will survive and function through the nuclear environment to enhance crew interaction and situational awareness. To enable net centric operations, the CONECT upgrade installs on-board client\/server architecture supporting distributed processing with independent control functions;  UHF Beyond Line-Of-Sight (BLOS) Joint Range Extension (JRE) capability via ARC-210 Warrior radio to exchange J-Series messaging within theater; Intelligence Broadcast Receiver; limited Internet Protocol (IP)-based UHF BLOS link supporting email and file transfers; and Improved Data Modem (IDM)-based digital Variable Message Format (VMF) datalink to significantly enhance close air support (CAS) missions. This integrated suite, when produced and installed, will provide the B-52 fleet with a machine-to-machine capability supporting aircraft re-tasking and re-targeting of Conventional Air Launched Cruise Missle (CALCM) and J-series weapons across the range of military operations the B-52 is assigned. \n  \nThis modification is planned to be done in conjunction with Programmed Depot Maintenance (PDM).  In addition, training devices will be upgraded to include CONECT functionality to meet user training requirements.\n\nPost Program Support funding supports the first year of Interim Contract Support (ICS) until the depot is established for CONECT, and will also be used to prepare for and repair the kit proof CONECT aircraft after fielding.  \n\nThis program will have associated Research Development Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) funding in PE 0101113F.  In FY12 and prior, CONECT was included in BPAC 675039.  A separate BPAC (675050) was established with the FY13 President's Budget."
