            "val": "This program procures modifications of small arms with a cost less than $5.000 million to include the procurement of accessory components of optics, protective lens coatings, mounting systems, bipods, and tripods. Optic sights allow the Soldier to identify and engage targets at longer ranges more effectively than standard iron sights. The M150 Rifle Combat Optic is a 4 powered scope with a ranging reticule enhancing the Soldier ability to engage targets out to 600 meters.  The improved optic combines the close range, rapid target acquisition capabilities of the M68 Close Combat Optic (CCO) and the magnified capabilities of the M150 Rifle Combat Optic (RCO) and M145 Machine Gun Optic (MGO).  Mounting systems provides a means to mount accessory components to weapons and mount weapon systems to platforms. Bipods and tripods are used to stabilize and maneuver a weapon to target. The M205 is a lightweight tripod for dismounted machine guns."

            "val": "FY 2014 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $ 1.569 million supports the Active Army by procuring 545 M205 tripods and providing protective lens coatings for optics.  The M205 Tripod reduces the Soldier's burden.  The M205 Tripod provides integral traverse and elevation mechanisms for easier, more accurate target engagement; adjustable traverse limit stop for night time missions; and a new lightweight pintle design.  Protective Lens Coatings provide an extremely high level of water-repellency, scratch resistance, and anti-reflectivity and significantly improve the effectiveness of current optics in the field. \n\nIn accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities."
