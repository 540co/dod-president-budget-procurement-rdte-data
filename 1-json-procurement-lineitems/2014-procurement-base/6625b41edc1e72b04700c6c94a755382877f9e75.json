            "val": "NAVY CASH PROGRAM - This program funds the procurement of the Navy CashTM system.  Navy CashTM is a teaming effort between the Naval Supply Systems Command (NAVSUP), U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treas, FMS), Industry, and the Fleet to replace the existing ATMs-at-Sea Program.  The program is essential to the Navy's Direct Deposit System.  Navy Cash improves the Quality of Life for Sailors and Marines on board ship by providing improved access to their financial accounts ashore and better service shipboard.  Navy Cash improves shipboard business practices by reducing the collecting, counting, recounting, sorting, moving, and monitoring of paper currency and coins for retail location, disbursing office, and other functions that collect funds.  By providing a form of electronic banking, Navy Cash provides fundamental support for other key initiatives in the Disbursing Office, Ship's Store, and Post Office and addresses optimal manning issues for retail and services operations on future ship classes.  This program is a direct improvement of fleet support.\n\nThe Program enhances morale and productivity aboard ships as well as cost savings to afloat disbursing operations by eliminating payroll and check preparation costs.\n\nAUTOMATIC IDENTIFICATION TECHNOLOGY (AIT) - The Department of Defense (DoD) promulgated Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Policy on 30 July 2004.  Current DoD RFID policy focuses on In-Transit Visibility (ITV) support of the Combatant Commanders (COCOMs) as the primary application of active RFID, and DoD Supply Management applications for passive RFID.  This effort will ensure Fleet and component commands have deployable active RFID capability to support contingencies and DoD\/Navy RFID policy.  Navy has invested in and taken action to support initial CENTCOM active RFID requirements.  These funds represent the Navy costs for the initial outfitting and life cycle costs to fully fund all currently identified COCOM ITV requirements."
