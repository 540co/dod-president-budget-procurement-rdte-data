            "val": "The Skid Steer Loader Family is a lift and load system with multiple attachments (auger, paver breaker, bucket and forklift), capable of executing a wide range of mobility, counter mobility, general engineering and force protection\/survivability missions.  Engineer squads are approximately 25% more productive with a SSL while performing field engineering Mission Training Plan Tasks (IAW a Army Concept Experimentation Program).  The SSL Family is a time and resource saving tool for completing a variety of labor and manpower intensive tasks.\n\nThe Type II Skid Steer Loader (SSL II) is a heavy tracked SSL with slightly less maneuverability but a greater lifting capability than the Type III.  The SSL II enables construction units (Combat Support Equipment Company (CSE)), Combat Heavy, Combat Support Company (CSC), Pipeline Construction Company, Utilities Team, Quarry Team, Well Drilling Team and Port Opening) to complete many tasks now performed by the Small Emplacement Excavator (SEE).  The Type II SSLs will be used for airfield damage repair, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) landing area development and repair, individual soldier fighting positions, obstacle emplacement and supporting pipeline pump station placement.\n\nThe Type III SSL is an air droppable, light SSL, with track over wheel capability aimed at meeting the combat mission needs of Light, Airborne, and Air Assault Engineer units.  Task emphasis is on general construction, lift and loading, base camp construction and maintenance.  It will also be used to lift palletized loads of engineer construction materials.  For force protection and force sustainment, the SSL will perform boring, lifting, loading and light leveling operations.  In support of major construction projects, the Type III SSL will be used to assist in construction of protective shelters\/bunkers, helipads and other structures and facilities; and assist with logistics base operations.  The Skid Steer Loaders are a commercial off the shelf (COTS) program.\n\nThe Army Acquisition Objective is 2,172 (SSL II: 801\/SSL III: 1,371).  This program is considered a Critical Dual Use (CDU) system enabling and supporting Defense Support to Civil Authorities (DSCA) operations."
