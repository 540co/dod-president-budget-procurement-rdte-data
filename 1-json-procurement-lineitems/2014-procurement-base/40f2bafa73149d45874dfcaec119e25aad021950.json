The level of armor is in accordance with the nature and type of threat in the area of use.  These vehicles are heavy duty passenger vehicles and are utilized by General Officers, dignitaries, embassy personnel, and other servicemen requiring protection.  These vehicles are essential for protecting lives.  Heavy Armored Sedan is a vehicle replacement program that does not have a set Approved Acquisition Objective (AAO).  Procurements are made when requirements arise based on threat conditions or when existing vehicles need to be replaced due to unserviceable condition or over-age and over-mileage status."
