Equipment unit cost must meet the currently approved Expense-Investment threshold of $250,000.00. The equipment supports recurring and generic activities typically performed by garrisons, such as material and cargo handling, engineering and public works, port and terminal operations support. Procures new investment items or replacements for existing equipment that is overaged, obsolete, or beyond economical repair."

Equipment is critical to maintaining installation roads and training areas needed by tactical units to maintain proficiency and combat readiness. Equipment supports maintaining road networks within the training areas; drop zones for airborne operations, landing zones for airmobile operations and ranges; and excavations supporting new range facilities, hard stands and emplacements. The equipment maintains road and parking drainage systems, and is also used for Force Protection operations to emplace concrete blocks and containers. Equipment replaces over-aged equipment with high utilization\/increased deadline rates and uneconomical maintenance and repair costs. Equipment supports garrison requirements to correct environmental deficiencies and violations by excavating and transporting clean earth to environmental clean-up sites. Material handling, cargo handling and port operations equipment improves capabilities to mobilize, demobilize and out-load warfighting units."
