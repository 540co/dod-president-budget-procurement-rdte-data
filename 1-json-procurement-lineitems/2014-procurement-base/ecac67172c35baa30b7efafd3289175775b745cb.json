Prior to FY11, AIR FORCE Intranet (AFNET), Base Information Transport Infrastructure (BITI), and Voice Switching System (VSS) programs were included as part of the overall Combat Information Transport System (CITS) program (program element 0303112F WSC 835070 funding line). The AF Service Acquisition Executive directed a re-structure of the CITS program. As part of this re-structure, AFNet, ITS, and VSS funding are identified as a separate line item starting in FY11. The following activities have transferred for FY11+ as indicated:\n\nA.  INFORMATION TRANSPORT SYSTEM(ITS): Requirements transferred to Information Transport System (ITS) P-1 Line.\n\nB. AIR FORCE INTRANET (AFNET) (Formerly NM\/ND): Requirements transferred to AIR FORCE INTRANET (AFNET) P-1 Line.\n\nC. VOICE SWITCHING SYSTEM (VSS): Requirements transferred to VOICE SWITCHING SYSTEM (VSS) P-1 Line.  \n  \n2. BASE INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE (BII): In addition to the changes mentioned above, starting in FY12 all the efforts previously reported under the BII budget effort (save one) have moved to one of the following budget lines: Base Information Transport Infrastructure, BITI (Formally known as ITS) , AFNet, and Voice.  These efforts included infrastructure licenses, help desk, and AF comm mods. The one effort left in this budget line is the Information Transport System (ITS) Support effort.  This effort will be described under the Base Information Transport Infrastructure budget line beginning in FY13.  \n\nBITI Modernization: Provides complete system life cycle support for all BITI fielded systems in accordance with Life Cycle Management Plans (LCMPs) and planning, including both hardware and software. Lifecycle support includes but is not limited to: (1) providing: modernization planning, capacity planning, acquisition planning, product integration, system optimization, updating system architectures, acquisition reporting, software patch management, enterprise license management, patch testing\/validation, mission operations support, warehouse for equipment, shipping to fielded locations, and maintaining system Certification and Accreditation, and (2) procuring: COTS hardware and software equipment for technology modernization, break\/fix actions, vendor warranties and support agreements with base and governmental agencies as required to accomplish support activities at fielded locations."
