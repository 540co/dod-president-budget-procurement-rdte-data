            "val": "The Ammunition Peculiar Equipment (APE) program provides support for ammunition operations including surveillance, demilitarization (demil), maintenance, renovation, modification, packaging, and preservation per Army Regulation 700-20, Ammunition Peculiar Equipment.  APE is developed, acquired, maintained, and supervised through the Single Manager for Conventional Ammunition per DoD Instruction 5160.68.  APE provides unique, low-density equipment items specifically designed, fabricated, tested, procured, and adopted for use in worldwide United States (US) military ammunition depot operations on conventional ammunition.  APE maintains a central source of standard, modern, safe, efficient, reliable, and environmentally acceptable equipment for ammunition operations.  This equipment is different from production line plant equipment as it disassembles ammunition items into components, sorts, removes hazardous materials to reduce human interaction and improves personnel safety.  Maintenance APE is also designed to perform cleaning and renovation functions on ammunition subjected to deterioration effects (rust, corrosion, weathering, etc) during its storage life.  APE supporting surveillance is keyed to stockpile sampling and function tests of the items to assure readiness for combat or training.  Demilitarization APE is similar to maintenance APE but must go further in disassembly to destroy hazardous components, sorts and reclaim salvageable parts or metals."

        "Justification": {
            "val": "FY 2014 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $16.604 million will support APE and replacement parts that must be on-hand to perform ammunition depot operations for conventional ammunition.  These operations cannot be accomplished if the required APE is not supplied in a timely manner.  The equipment is loaned to worldwide locations for the accomplishment of depot-type operations based on the ammunition requirements.  APE is required to support the Ammunition Stockpile Reliability Program, Surveillance Program, equipment for worldwide maintenance and demil, prepositioned ships, and Government-Owned, Contractor-Operated plants as Government Furnished Equipment for ammunition depot operations at those locations.  The APE assets maintain and verify the quality of the ammunition stockpile, thereby saving the cost of purchasing new replacement ammunition.  APE efficiently performs the ammunition demil mission to safely perform or support disassembly, destruction, or removal processes with an emphasis on recycling, re-utilization and preserving demil assets in a manner that supports ammunition sustainment, safety, and environmental compliance.\n\nAPE provides for operations and support of the Demilitarization Facility (DEFAC) in the Republic of Korea (ROK), which consists of standard APE items and will minimize retrograde costs to the US and provide a source of supply (reuse) for other production programs.  A Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) was signed on 4 November 2011 by US Forces Korea and the ROK permitting demil of US titled munitions.  Since then, the DEFAC has gone through final equipment assemble, testing, personnel training and Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) to full production.  From August 2012 to October 2012, the US processed 6,304 D680 eight-inch projectiles.  From November 2012 to May 2013, the Koreans will process their D680 assets.  The US will resume shared operation of processing D680s in May and will continue until November 2013.  \n\nThe program provides global support to the US Military Services for ammunition sustainment and demil operations, including deployment, operations and support of the Ammunition Supply Point (ASP) suites.  The ASP suites include APE, which will increase the efficiency of the receipt, inspection and issuance of ammunition to the warfighter.  Deployment of APE to support ASP suites will increase efficiencies for ammunition sustainment operations by reducing logistics burdens and related risks allowing better primary mission readiness, enhanced hazardous operations safety and more efficient operating conditions requiring less ammunition retrograde\/demil by providing capability to preserve ammunition assets."
