            "val": "The Biometrics Enabling Capability (BEC) is the Department of Defense's (DoD) authoritative biometric enterprise database repository. The current operational capability is the Next Generation Automated Biometrics Identification System (NG-ABIS); it will transition to the BEC Increment 0 Program of Record (POR) at the Full Deployment Decision (FDD). NG-ABIS receives multi-modal biometric submissions from collection devices allowing the Warfighter to distinguish friend from foe and enabling near real-time retention, capture or release decisions. The system has a direct impact on the availability of critical intelligence information that is of vital interest to DoD and other government agencies in efforts to capture, detain, question and deny access to known and emerging threats to our National Security. Latent fingerprint matching allows the Warfighter to accurately identify and detain those responsible for Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), weapons trafficking, and other terrorist attacks against US and partner nations' assets across the globe. NG-ABIS stores, processes, shares and matches four different biometric modalities (fingerprint, facial images, palm-prints and iris patterns) against over 9.5 million records as it searches for known and suspected terrorists, enemies and persons of interest. The system uses advanced algorithms to combine partial matches of multiple biometric modalities in order to increase the frequency of conclusive and automated matches, thereby decreasing the amount of manpower required.\n\nBEC Increment 1 will build upon the success of NG-ABIS\/BEC Increment 0 and will include a web-based interface and cross-domain security capabilities across the SECRET and UNCLASSIFIED security domains. It will also build upon the current capability with increased data matching throughput (number of records that can be processed within 24 hours), increased storage capacity and the ability to process bulk biometric submissions. BEC Inc 1 will have an automated, customizable Biometric Enabled Watch List (BEWL) that will be electronically input into the system and link an individual's record to the watchlist. This will facilitate on-demand access and development of watchlist data and will provide match alerts to the collector through their collection system as well as to the intelligence community. This future system will also streamline interoperability and data sharing with government agencies and stakeholders including the Department of Justice (DOJ), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), National Ground Intelligence Center (NGIC), Department of State (DOS), United States Central Command (CENTCOM), United States Special Operations Command (SOCOM) and other DoD and Federal agencies as required and in accordance with Homeland Security Presidential Directive 24\/National Security Presidential Directive 59.\n\nBEC Increment 1 is currently conducting Pre-Milestone B acquisition activities to support a Pre-EMD and Milestone B decision reviews planned for FY2014."

        "Justification": {
            "val": "$3.800 million of FY2014 base procurement funding will support technology refresh of BEC Increment 0. This technology refresh will ensure requirements for system availability, throughput and capacity continue to be met by refreshing the hardware infrastructure with latest generation technologies. Funds will support system lifecycle replacement and component spares. Funds provide for replacement of equipment at the end of the lifecycle.\n\nThis program has no FY 2014 Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) procurement request."
