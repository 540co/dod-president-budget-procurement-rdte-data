            "val": "Ground Based Air Defense Transformation (GBAD-T) supports the Low Altitude Air Defense (LAAD) Battalion's missions of Short Range Air Defense (SHORAD) and Force Protection.  The Advanced Man-Portable Air Defense System (A-MANPADS) Fire Unit is a mobile, Stinger missile-based low altitude surface-to-air weapons system designed to provide close-in short range air defense. A-MANPADS assets are organic to the Low Altitude Air-Defense (LAAD) Battalion of the Marine Air Control Group (MACG). LAAD Battalions support the Marine Air Ground Task Force by defending forward combat areas, maneuver forces, vital areas and installations, and units engaged in special or independent operations.  The LAAD Battalion consists of a headquarters and two A-MANPADS firing batteries. Each firing battery, in turn, consists of a battery headquarters and two A-MANPADS firing platoons.  Firing platoons include a platoon headquarters and three firing sections, the smallest tactical units of the LAAD Battalion.  The A-MANPADS Section is comprised of a Section Leader and five Fire Units.  The Section Leader oversees the deployment of the Fire Units and directs their fires in support of the overall air defense plan.  A major service-life extension must be conducted in order to mitigate the potential gap between the current and follow-on weapon system.  Therefore, GBAD is executing a Service Life Extension Program (SLEP), due to the approaching shelf life expiration of the Stinger Missile.  Additionally, GBAD received a Deliberate Universal Need Statement (D-UNS) for an Optics upgrade\/replacement of the current Stinger Missile Night Sight (AN\/PAS-18)."

Began Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) for the Stinger Missile inventory, as it is approaching shelf life expiration.  This initiative will replace degraded components to extend the life of the Stinger missile, bridging GBAD to the future GBAD Weapon System. The FY13 SLEP budget of $7.0M reflects the cost for a variety of components, such as replacement of rocket motors, with various procurement and installation unit costs.\n\n2014 Baseline Appropriation Request:\nGround Based Air Defense Transformation (GBAD-T) $15.713M - Continue data collection, training, support equipment and interim contractor support required to support the procurement of the end item.
