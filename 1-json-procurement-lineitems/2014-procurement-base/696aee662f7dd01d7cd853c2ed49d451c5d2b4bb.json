            "val": "CENTER FOR ADVANCED OPERATIONAL CULTURE LEARNING (CAOCL) provides a turnkey solution to support the growing demand for technologically enhanced foreign language training. This solution should be in the form of self-sustaining Language Learning Resource Centers (LLRCs) as training units. The USMC requires up to 30 LLRC units deployed to multiple CONUS and OCONUS locations. The USMC LLRCs will comprise the following basic requirements: be mobile with support for 16 students in a variety of ways, contain high speed unrestricted internet access, satellite radio and television capability, web based with a web server, contain a database server and 16 complete workstations, contain integrated Heating\/Ventilation Air Conditioning and Back-up Power generator. The USMC requirement is to implement a LLRC solution that has the ability to operate with minimum impact on resources from the hosting military installation.\n\nCOMBINED ARMS COMMAND AND CONTROL TRAINER UPGRADE SYSTEM (CACCTUS) upgrades Camp Lejeune Combined Arms Staff Trainer (CAST) facility to provide a more realistic training opportunity for Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) staff elements in the areas of fire support employment, coordination, and integration. The upgraded system will support Marine Expeditionary Battalion (MEB) level training and to effectively integrate current and emerging Communications Command Control Computers and Intelligence (C4I) systems. These funds will also support the procurement of lab developmental hardware.\n\nCOMMAND and CONTROL TRAINING and EDUCATION CENTER of EXCELLENCE (C2 TECOE) supports the five (5) MAGTF Integrated Systems Training Centers (MISTCs) located at Camp Johnson, NC, (MISTC East), Camp Pendleton, CA (MISTC West), Camp Hanson, Okinawa (MISTC Okinawa), Kaneohe Bay, HI (MISTC Hawaii), 29 Palms, CA (MISTC 29 Palms), and the C2TECOE located in Quantico, VA. The MISTCs, under the operational control of the C2 TECOE is the primary command and control (C2) training venue for the Marine Corps operating forces for both individual and collective C2 systems sustainment training. The yearly funding is for equipment refresh and procurement of new training systems. A portion of the C2 computer systems are replaced each year to provide current systems for classroom and combat operation training in battle staff training for commanders and unit personnel.\n\nDEPLOYABLE VIRTUAL TRAINING ENVIRONMENT (DVTE) is a laptop PC based simulation system capable of emulating organic and supporting Infantry Battalion weapons systems and training scenarios to facilitate T&R based training, currently being fielded at the Battalion level. Its portable configuration allows Marines to train when they otherwise could not; aboard ship, at remote reserve locations and deployed. The type of training able to be conducted with DVTE includes language and culture training, platoon and squad level tactics, employment of supporting arms, and various Recognition of Combatants (ROC) packages. DVTE is part of a Commander's \"training toolkit\" contributing to the building block approach to standards based training focusing on achieving an improved level of combat readiness. Funding supports hardware refresh and integration\/interoperability capabilities with operational forces' systems.\n\nDISTANCE LEARNING (DL), COLLEGE OF DISTANCE EDUCATION AND TRAINING (CDET) delivers effective training by using modern instructional technologies (interactive software\/courseware). The DL Program provides access to Marines to training and education products to increase operational readiness levels. The DL Program delivers courseware for both garrison and deployed Marines. In garrison, Marines use Learning Resource Centers (LRCs) that are NMCI seats, Deployed Marines access training through Deployable Learning Resource Centers (DLRCs) which are MCHS hardware. Both garrison and deployed access are supported by MCHS servers that provide student administration and deliver content over local and wide-area networks (LAN\/WAN) to include the MCEN\/NMCI. All DL PMC funds are for integration and installation and procurement of the hardware to support the current distance learning infrastructure which has a continuous expanding distance learning user population. Non-NMCI hardware is refreshed every 5 years.\n\nMINOR TRAINING DEVICES\/SIMULATORS (MTD) program encompasses the procurement of low density, minor (low cost) Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) ground training equipment, simulators and simulations. These devices such as Training-Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), Recognition of Combat Vehicles (ROC-V), climbing walls, Portable Infantry Target System (PITS), weapons models and mockups, enhance basic occupational and combat skills across the wide spectrum of tactics, techniques, procedures and firearms and weapon proficiency. MTDs are for the most part commercial\/service non-developmental training devices, used by Marine Corps Schools of Infantry, Marine Corps Martial Arts Program, Recruit Depots, operating forces, bases, stations and support combat readiness.\n\nRANGE MODERNIZATION\/TRANSFORMATION (RM\/T) Baseline and OCO program modernizes major USMC base and station live training ranges to provide enhanced after action review with ground truth feedback, realistic representation of opposing forces (OPFOR) and enhanced range and exercise command and control capabilities. Integrating live and simulated training technologies, the fielded capabilities enhance live-fire, force-on-target, and force-on-force training. Major system components of modernization include Military Operations on Urbanized Terrain (MOUT) facilities, inter-active targetry, battlefield effects simulators, individual and vehicle tracking systems, aviation tracking systems, Tactical Engagement Simulation Systems, simulated munitions, integrated simulation, and range control and exercise control information processing and situational awareness displays. Current combat Operations in Afghanistan (OEF) in support of OCO are being conducted in largely urban areas. Training is required to support the complexities of command and control, live-fire coordination in support of maneuver, and logistics operations in support of units at and above company level. Deploying Operational Units need access to instrumented, non live fire and live-fire capable MOUT training facilities, urban sniper training capabilities, convoy operation\/reaction course capability, Urban Close Air Support (CAS) ranges, and IED\/EOD training capability in order to accomplish this training and bring the Marine Corps into the 21st century, to include a fully immersive infantry trainer (IIT). These capabilities give deploying units the opportunity to better meet training requirements before exercising as a MAGTF at Mojave Viper and deploying to the combat theaters. Additionally lessons learned from OIF are driving the need for new training systems supporting a seamless training environment allowing crucial core capabilities to be available for all Marines at all sites at once.\n\nSUPPORTING ARMS VIRTUAL TRAINER (SAVT) provides a fixed institutional high fidelity immersive training capability that trains Marines for indirect fire, call for fire, and Type I, II and III Close air Support. Based on the Marine Corps requirement to train over 500 Joint Terminal Attack Controllers, an Urgent Universal Need Statement was developed and approved, which led to the MROC Decision Memorandum approval of SAVT.\n\nTRAINING SIMULATIONS SUPPORT (TSS) program encompasses the procurement of low density, minor (low cost) Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) ground training equipment, simulators and simulations. These devices such as Training-Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), Recognition of Combat Vehicles (ROC-V), climbing walls, Portable Infantry Target System (PITS), weapons models and mockups, enhance basic occupational and combat skills across the wide spectrum of tactics, techniques, procedures and firearms and weapon proficiency.  TSS for the most part is for commercial\/service non-developmental training devices, used by Marine Corps Schools of Infantry, Marine Corps Martial Arts Program, Recruit Depots, operating forces, bases, stations and support combat readiness. Funding provides capability for the USMC to conduct critical OCO training and participate as a full-fledged member of several Joint programs.\n\nUNITED STATES MARINE CORPS OPERATOR DRIVING SIMULATOR (USMC-ODS) trains vehicle operators on multiple vehicle platforms. The trainer uses a manufactured cab with interchangeable dash sets that replicate the look and functionality of the vehicle chosen for simulation. It also uses an appended armor kits emulate the appropriate field of view for the selected vehicle. Systems are equipped with three-degrees-of-freedom (3-DOF) seat motion for the driver and 180 degrees of visual display via three electronic displays. Systems can be installed in a fixed location or delivered on a mobile trailer. Mobile systems have the option of being purchased in a single (1 Student Training Station (STS)) or dual (2 STS) configuration. Current vehicles selectable on the USMC-ODS include: Medium Tactical Vehicle Replacement (MTVR), MTVR with MTVR Armor System (MAS), Up-Armored High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HWWMV), Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) Category l Cougar (4x4), Category II Cougar (6x6) and Category III Buffalo Variants. Procurement funding is used to acquire equipment for student training stations at Camp Johnson and Fort Leonard Wood and for the acquisition of generic cabs, interchangeable dashes, and steering wheels for the MTVR modules.  This expands use of the simulators to include the HMMWV and the family of MRAP vehicles, by providing capabilities that are not available on the current MTVR-TS system."
