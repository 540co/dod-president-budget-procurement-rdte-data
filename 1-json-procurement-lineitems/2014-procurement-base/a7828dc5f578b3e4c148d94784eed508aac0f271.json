The funding represents the storage costs for laid away production items from Watervliet Arsenal and Rock Island Arsenal.  The funds also pay for storage, facilities\/equipment maintenance, and inspection of Industrial Plant Equipment (IPE), laid away machine tools, gauges, special measuring equipment, tooling and fixturing stored at Watervliet Arsenal and Rock Island Arsenal."

Funds are used to perform periodic inspection and maintenance of the laid away equipment to prevent this unique equipment from deteriorating and jeopardizing planned reactivation capabilities and timelines.  This program also include recurring overhead costs associated with the laid away facilities and equipment such as roads and grounds maintenance, fire protection, plant security, and administrative support.  Funding supports Active Component."
