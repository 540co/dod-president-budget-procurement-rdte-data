The LM2500 is composed of two major sub-assemblies: the gas generator and power turbine sections. It is coupled to the ship drive-train by a high speed coupling shaft. The LM2500+ Marine Gas Turbine and its associated Engineering Control Systems provide main propulsion power for the Navy's amphibious assault ships including the LHD-8 USS MAKIN ISLAND, LHA-6 USS AMERICA and LHA-7 USS TRIPOLI. The LM2500+ is composed of two major sub-assemblies: the gas generator and power turbine sections. It is coupled to the ship drive-train by a high speed coupling shaft. The control system for both engines provides for both local and remote engine operations.\n\nThe Rolls Royce (Allison) 501-K Series Gas Turbines are used to drive electrical generators in Ship Service Gas Turbine Generators (SSGTG). The 501-K17 is used on the CG-47 Class ships. The 501-K34 is an upgraded version used on the DDG-51 Class ships and is not interchangeable with the 501-K17. The MT5S is a higher-power derivative of the 501-K engine family (utilizing Rolls Royce's new \"Marine Trent\" or \"MT\" naming convention vice the older \"501-K\" naming convention) used for auxiliary electrical generation on DDG-1000 class ships; the MT5S is not interchangeable with the 501-K17 or 501-K34. The Rolls Royce MT-30 is used on LCS-1 (Lockheed) Class for main propulsion and DDG 1000 for electrical generation. Rolls Royce 250-KS4 is used as a starter gas turbine for the 501-K34 on DDG 79 and follow.  The Rolls Royce MT7 gas turbine is used for both lift and propulsion fan power on the next generation of LCAC landing craft.\n\nThe budget funds the following:\n\n[P40A \/ GA009 GE Readiness Improvement Upgrade Kits]: GA009 - MODIFICATION KIT PROGRAM: This cost code procures modification kits listed below for the GE Gas Turbine Engine.

Each hull has a total of three (3) SSGTG units installed.  Each SSGTG is controlled by a Full Authority Digital Control (FADC).  CG-47 class uses the 501-K17 and DDG-51 class uses the 501-K34.  There are currently three variants of the 501-K34 SSGTG: AG9130, AG9140HF and AG9140RF. The AG9140RF also includes the Remote Independent Mechanical Starting System (RIMSS) consisting of the 250-KS4 engine.  The quantity of modification kits procured corresponds to the number of SSGTG units to be upgraded.  The type and scope of each modification required will vary from one ship to the next.  The type and scope of each modification required will vary from one ship to the next. The number and type of kits installed in any given Fiscal Year (FY) varies depending upon ship availability schedules during that FY.   FY2017 budget of $4,571K funds; Ship Change Document (SCD) ; FADC HMI Upgrade, Qty 21, $1,415 - System upgrage; SCD 5216, Qty 24, $173 - FADC 2-1 Conversion; SCD 10677, Qty 9, $234 - Off-Eng Fuel Valve (CG47); SCD 12115, Qty 18, $213 - RIMSS Tachometer; AYB 9130-021R1\/9140-018R1, Qty 99, $34 - HUM BRK; Digital Voltage Regulator (DVR) Upgrade, Qty 6, $2,406.  The remaining balance is for ancillary materials related to each of the aforementioned SCDs.   The increase in the GF007 budget from FY16 to FY17 represents a change in the types and quantities of modification kits purchased from one year to the next; these changes are driven by ship availability schedule and include both procurement and installation costs.",

In summary this modification is estimated to be 75% more reliable than old system. \nThis upgrade replaces the existing Hydro-mechanical main fuel control (MFC) system which was designed for aircraft; \nwith a Digital Fuel Control (DFC) system designed for military marine environment. This modification increases engine reliability, decreases periodic maintenance, enhances operational functions, and provides an automatic stall detection and shutdown capability.\n\nFY17-FY21 quantity changed to five (5) per year due to DDG modernization program schedule change."
