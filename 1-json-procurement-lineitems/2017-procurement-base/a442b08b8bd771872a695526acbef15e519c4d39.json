        "Description": {
            "val": "The Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN) is a satellite ground terminal network comprised of two communication nodes (Schriever AFB & Vandenberg AFB) and 15 antenna systems. The antennas are distributed around the world at seven locations -- Vandenberg Tracking Station (VTS), Diego Garcia Station (DGS), Guam Tracking Station (GTS), Hawaii Tracking Station (HTS), New Hampshire Tracking Station (NHS), Thule Tracking Station (TTS), and Telemetry and Commanding Station (TCS) at RAF Oakhanger, England -- to ensure global coverage for 140 satellites in various orbits. The AFSCN conducts an average of 450 satellite contacts per day supporting Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT); Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR); Missile Warning; Communications; Weather; and Research and Development (R&D) satellites for Department of Defense (DoD), Intelligence Community (IC), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) operations. While most of the 450 satellite contacts\/day are routine command and control activities, the AFSCN is also used for satellite emergencies (e.g. tumbling satellite) because its high power antennas are often the only earthbound assets that can contact a non-responsive satellite to re-establish command & control. During FY14 and FY15, the AFSCN supported 28 space vehicle emergencies resulting in the preservation of over $8.5B worth of satellites. In addition to routine and emergency satellite operations C2, the AFSCN provides support to launch vehicle and early orbit operations, ensuring worldwide antennas receive telemetry and transmit commands to newly orbiting satellites to initiate early orbit checkout. Finally, the AFSCN provides Factory Compatibility Testing (FCT) to ensure satellites and launch vehicles can communicate via the AFSCN before the satellite is launched. These efforts include systems engineering and integration (SE&I) activities.  \n  \nThese funds are used to procure modernized equipment for the AFSCN to ensure the capability is available to support DoD, Intelligence community, and civil users. \n\nPrincipal efforts include: \n\n1) AFSCN Interim Supply Support: procures support services, peculiar and common support materials, and required re-procurement data for the Satellite Control Network Contract, and to transition to government supply support. \n\n2) Remote Tracking Station (RTS) Block Change (RBC): The RBC Program was initiated in Dec 2001 to modernize the legacy system. The RBC program replaces legacy remote ground antenna systems that have reached end of life. To date, RBC systems have been installed at VTS, DGS, TCS, GTS, HTS, and NHS. TTS is projected to complete in 1Q FY16. In addition, the Air Force is upgrading the electronics in the remaining eight serviceable systems. This \"hybrid\" architecture couples the RBC electronics with existing antennas and normalizes electronics across the network. A prototype effort was implemented in FY12 to validate the approach and the first two hybrid articles were awarded in FY13 to upgrade legacy systems at GTS and HTS. A third article was awarded in FY14 to upgrade the legacy system at VTS.  Funds in FY15 (DGS, TTS), FY16 (TCS, NHS) and FY17 (TCS, a station with three antenna systems) continue RBC Hybrid procurement for the remaining locations; completion is projected by FY20. Finally, the Enhanced High Power Amplifier (EHPA) spacecraft anomaly resolution system is scheduled for first-article delivery in 4Q 2016 at GTS. Future EHPA buys include VTS in FY16, NHS and DGS in FY18.  Upon completion, EHPA will provide high-power anomaly resolution capability at four sites. The EHPA enables emergency satellite operations and is needed to replace obsolete parts.\n\n3) AIR FORCE SATELLITE CONTROL NETWORK RECAPITALIZATION: The Air Force will use various contract vehicles to address the highest priority upgrades.  Obsolescence and sustainment \"worst actors\" are prioritized annually in order of criticality to the mission. The potential for failed satellite contacts drives priority. In FY17, funds are planned to be used for Cyber Defense solutions, Wide Area Network Interface (WANIF) implementation and Electronic Scheduling Dissemination 3.0 Standard Space Training environment for external users. Other FYDP projects include: Authentication, Authorization, Auditing\/Host Based Security System (AAA\/HBSS) implementation to external users, AFSCN test bed upgrades, continued cyber defense work, network automation, moving the AFSCN Test Bed (ATB) from a leased contractor facility to a government facility, Range\/Network\/Communication obsolescence upgrades, and Multi-band & Phased Array projects.\n\nFunding for this effort is contained in PE 0305110F. As of the FY16 PB submission, space programs procurement funding has been re-categorized from appropriation 3080, Other Procurement Air Force (OPAF) to appropriation 3021, Space Procurement Air Force (SPAF), in FY16 and beyond.  This exhibit will display prior year and FY15 values. While FY16 and beyond will be displayed in the corresponding SPAF\/3021 exhibits. Total 3080\/3021 procurement funding is $370.095M."

            "val": "1) AFSCN Interim Supply Support (P-5): FY17 funding provides peculiar and common support material, required re-procurement data, and interim supply support management. In addition, funds procure the most urgently needed capital equipment replacements for items that exceed the O&M dollar threshold. This equipment replaces items such as, but not limited to, high power amplifiers, processors, archival event recorders, and router switches, AFSCN Link Projection System (ALPS) equipment, legacy Electronic Scheduling Dissemination (ESD) 2.7 equipment and Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS) items which are at the top of the sustainers \"worst actors\" list and account for significant maintenance effort, down time, and lost or failed contacts. \n\n2) RBC and AFSCN Recapitalization Projects (P-3As): These efforts are critical to ensuring telemetry, tracking, and commanding are provided for over 140 satellites and that satellite emergencies requiring high-power antennas can be supported.\n\nFY17 funds continue Advisory & Assistance Services (A&AS) to procure other support for the system program office including, but not limited to cost estimating, contract reconciliation, and configuration management. These Advisory and Assistance Services and FFRDC efforts support the functions of government personnel in managing the production activities to upgrade the AFSCN system, and include FFRDC analyses to support installation, integration, and testing, as well as the installs and integration of equipment for the ongoing upgrades."
