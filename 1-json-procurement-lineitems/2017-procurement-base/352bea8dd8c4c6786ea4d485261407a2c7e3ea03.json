Information from networked BAT-Clients is sent to BAT-Servers. The BAT-Servers update other BAT-Servers and provide information to the biometrics intelligence process for further analysis. Funding supports the hardware reset and technical refresh of the Family of Systems Biometrics equipment. The refresh will address hardware technology obsolescence, along with software updates to meet Electronic Biometric Transmission Specification (EBTS) compliance. Biometric identification has become a key capability in counter insurgency warfare in support of ongoing contingency operations. Without this critical capability, the Marine Corps loses the ability to provide the Combatant Commander with required Identity Operations\/Biometrics\/Forensics capabilities."
