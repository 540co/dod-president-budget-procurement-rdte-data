            "val": "This program provides a wide variety of base support and safety of flight items for warfighters with worldwide application. \n\nProcures safety and rescue equipment, developed in Program Element (PE) 0604706F, Life Support Systems, for increased protection of aircrew personnel operating manned, non-space aircraft to optimize weapon system effectiveness and capability throughout the full spectrum of military operations. In general, the purpose of the PE is to expand the combat capabilities of a weapon system an airman supports while balancing functionality, comfort, and safety. Representative items include flight helmets, oxygen breathing equipment, flame resistant\/retardant and blast protective gear, laser eye protection, personnel locator beacons, nuclear flash blindness devices, personnel parachutes, ejection seats\/equipment, survival radio test sets, life rafts, life preservers, anti-exposure coveralls, and other air\/ground crew equipment. \n\nGuardian Angel Family of Systems:\nGuardian Angel is an Air Force non-aircraft weapon system within the overarching Battlefield Airman Modernization Program. Guardian Angel is a family of systems based on human and equipment capabilities formulated to execute Air Force Combat Search and Rescue and personnel recovery across a full spectrum of military operations. Guardian Angel family of systems is employed by three distinct Air Force Specialties: Pararescuemen (PJ), Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape (SERE) and Combat Rescue Officer (CRO). Representative items include but are not limited to parachute equipment, technical rescue equipment, information management systems, rescue craft and a Live Virtual Constructive (LVC) Training Simulator (simulator, maintenance & mobile shelter costs) to supplement,  augment, and optimize current training events, independent of aircraft availability to align with strategic plans of the Next Generation LVC for training within the DoD.. Items procured during execution may change based on critical equipment needed to support current Air Force mission requirements. This includes applicable training, spares, and repairs. Due to rapidly changing threat environment, the acquisition program manager has the authority to redirect funding as necessary to meet current slated and emerging requirements.  Due to rapidly changing threat environment, the acquisition program manager has the authority to redirect funding as necessary to meet current slated and emerging requirements.\nGuardian Angel Enhanced Night Vision Systems:  Continued Procurement of Night Vision solutions that improve personnel recovery night visions systems with wider field of view, lower SWAP, and\/or enhanced vision in at least one spectral band other than Near-IR. Procurement is required to meet mission needs until the next generation of multi-spectral NVGs are developed and available for ground crew operators. Due to rapidly changing threat environment, the acquisition program manager has the authority to redirect funding as necessary to meet current slated and emerging requirements.\nAll funding and tasks from FY17-FY21 have been moved from Project 842140 Night Vision Goggles to Project 842990, Items Less than $5 Million.  \n\n\nSpecial Tactics\/Combat Control Battlefield Airmen program funds Air Force standardized equipment within the overarching Battlefield Airman Modernization program for Special Tactics combat  controllers, pararescue personnel, combat weather operators and tactical air control parties to\nperform their Air Force Special Operations Command mission. Funding for this effort is in program element 0408011F.  FY17 funds purchase of new DoD standardized  Military Freefall Parachutes\nfor USAF Special Tactics units.   \n\nModern warfare resulted in an increase in airborne combat under the cover of darkness. Night missions include ground operations, preparation of the aircraft for take-off and landings in complete darkness, lights-off air refueling, and visual identification of enemy targets hidden under the night sky. Consequently, ground personnel and aircrew require the capability to see in very low visibility conditions at night and high ambient light conditions such as full moon or heavily lighted residential areas. The use of Night Vision Goggles (NVG) is critical for combat rescue, special operations, and homeland security missions. \n\nA lack of night vision capability would significantly decrease combat effectiveness in night operations, risk flight safety, and increase the probability of fratricide. Aircraft such as HH-60 helicopters, HC-130s, F-16s, and special mission C-130s primarily operate in low altitude environments during covert night operations. Hence, NVGs are vital to the success of these missions, providing a dramatic increase in safety, situational awareness, and survivability during the execution of near daytime tactics, including visual formation criteria. Furthermore, the proliferation of NVG-equipped adversaries underscores the urgent need to supply ground and air forces with night vision equipment.\n\nFunding for this exhibit contained in Program Elements (PEs) 0702833F, 0207227F, 0202834F, and 0207588F.\n\nGround crew Goggles:\n\nAN\/PVS-14 Ground crew Goggle: This monocular night vision device is a hand-held, head-mounted, helmet-mounted, or weapon-mounted night vision system, which enables walking, weapon firing, short-range surveillance, map reading, vehicle maintenance, and first-aid administration during moonlight and starlight conditions. The AN\/PVS-14 supports a vast spectrum of ground and air operations to include aircraft maintenance, civil engineering, emergency response, security, and other missions.   \n\nAN\/PVS-15 Ground crew Goggle: This binocular NVG is a helmet-mounted or hand-held night vision system, which is primarily used by Special Forces during night drop operations. The AN\/PVS-15 can be used for all nighttime ground operations. An added benefit of this particular binocular goggle is the back-up capability in the event one of the two tubes fails.   \n\n \n    \nAircrew Goggles:     \n\nAN\/AVS-9 (F4949G-TG) Aircrew Goggle: This night vision goggle provides aircraft and ground personnel with the capability to see the horizon, terrain features and enemy ground fire, thereby reducing the potential for air-to-ground fratricide and mid-air collisions during night operations. The AN\/AVS-9 (F4949-TG) is a light-weight, helmet-mounted goggle equipped with pinnacle tube technology that mitigates effects of sudden bright light exposure. \n\nTest Sets: \n\nANV-20\/20 Test Set, Infinity Focus: The ANV-20\/20 is a portable instrument, which allows quick and accurate evaluation and adjustment of all goggle parameters. All NVGs require operational checkout.  \n\nANV-126A Test Set, Infrared Viewer: The ANV-126A is a commercial upgrade to the ANV-126, which is suitable for field operational checks and depot level NVG maintenance. This test set provides accurate checks for NVG resolution, gain, power drain, binocular goggle collimation, image quality, and image distortion. The ANV-126A uses state of the art technology and provides enhanced capabilities to the user.\n\nANV-126A-UGF Test Set, Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO) Kit: The ANV-126A-UGF is a commercial TCTO kit that converts the ANV-126 to the ANV-126A Test Set. \n   \nIn accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), capabilities under this line item are necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and military support to civil authorities. Projected allocations for reserve component requirements are subject to total force demand priorities.&lt;\/span&gt;\n\n\n\nFunding for this exhibit contained in PEs 0207227F, 0207433F, 0408011F, 0503113F and 0702833F.  \n\nProjected allocations for component requirements are subject to total force demands and priorities."
