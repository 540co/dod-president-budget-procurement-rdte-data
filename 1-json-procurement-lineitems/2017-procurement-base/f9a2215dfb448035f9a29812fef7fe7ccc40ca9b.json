The programs projected FY-18 in-service population of single shank propulsion gas turbine engines is estimated to be 382 due to new construction. Breakdown of ship class spare procurement is listed below. The procurement of these engines includes all required shipping\/storage containers. LM2500 gas generator procurements are presently scheduled to occur every other year. \n\nDDG LM2500 Single Shank \nBased on experience with 35 years of usage demand data on the LM2500 Engine and IAW 10 USC Sec. 2308, DFAR subpart 207.70 and DoDI 3110.06, a total of 36 spares are required to support the fleet requirements. Current onhand is 28 with a requirement for eight (8) additional gas generator units to be procured IAW projected class population in FY19.\n\nLCS 2 LM2500 Single Shank. \nBased on experience with 35 years of usage demand data on the LM2500 Engine and IAW 10 USC Sec. 2308, DFAR subpart 207.70 and DoDI 3110.06, a total of 3 spares are required to support the fleet requirements. Current onhand is 1 with one (1) procured in May FY12 which leaves the requirement for one (1) additional gas generator unit to be procured IAW projected class population in FY19.\n\nLHD8\/LHA6-LHA8 LM2500+ Single Shank.\nBased on experience with 35 years of usage demand data on the LM2500 Engine and IAW 10 USC Sec. 2308, DFAR subpart 207.70 and DoDI 3110.06, a total of 2 spares are required to support the fleet requirements. Current onhand is 1, which leaves the requirement for one (1) additional gas generator to be procured IAW projected class population. The program has budgeted to procure one (1) Power Turbine Assembly in FY18 to meet the baseline requirement. This engine represents a significantly different configuration than the standard LM2500 Single Shank Engine procured in previous fiscal years.\n\nLM2500 Hot Section Kits \nAre procured as required from the below list per quarterly failure analysis and maintained to replace High Pressure Turbine (HPT) components beyond economical repair (BER). Shortages of replacement blades increase engine repair turn-around time (RTAT) during engine refurbishment\/repair as a result of material shortages.\n\nProcurement quantities are a result of procuring various kits of various costs. The kits included in the cost code are as follows:\n--HPT Shrouds\n--HPT Seal Assembly\n--HPT Blades\n--HPT Nozzles\n--Compressor Blades\n\n[P40A \/ GA012 CONTROL SYSTEMS MODIFICATIONS]: GA012 - CONTROL SYSTEM MODIFICATIONS\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nThis cost code funds the procurement and installation of the Aft Steering Local Control Unit and Damage Control Hard Drives following control system modifications:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nAft steering local control unit single board computers are currently obsolete and require replacement.  \nInstallation is required to be completed on 24 ships. Installations do not require CNO availabilities.  Installations will be accomplished during pier side availability by NSWCCD Philadelphia.\t\t\t\t\t\nThere are 4 kits required per ship. The kits include the following hardware:  single board computer, daughter board, transceiver, power cables, and associated software packages.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\nCurrent Damage Control Workstation hard drives are currently obsolete and require replacement. In order to maintain commonality in configuration a one-time bulk buy in FY12 is required as vendor is phasing-out the production of this unit.\t\t\t\t\t\t\nInstallation is required to be completed on 24 ships. There are seven (7) hard drives required per ship. Installations do not require CNO availabilities.  Installations will be accomplished during pier side availability by NSWCCD Philadelphia.\n\n[P40A \/ GA015 LM2500 DIGITAL FUEL CONTROL]: GA015 - DIGITAL FUEL CONTROL (DFC)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nThis cost code procures the Digital Fuel Control (DFC) shipsets, ancillary equipment and install material to support the CG\/DDG modernization schedules. Procurement and installations are budgeted to correspond with CNO ship availabilities. One DFC Kit is required to upgrade each of the four LM2500 engines, which makes one DFC shipset.   \t\n\t\t\t\nThe DFC is the most significant change to the LM2500 engine since its inception into the USN that addresses obsolescence components which accounted for approximately 40% of all engine failures. This modification is estimated to be 75% more reliable than the old system. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nThis upgrade replaces the existing Hydro-mechanical main fuel control (MFC) system which was designed for aircraft; with a Digital Fuel Control (DFC) system designed for military marine environment. This modification increases engine reliability, decreases periodic maintenance, enhances operational functions, and provides an automatic stall detection and shutdown capability.\n\n[P40A \/ GA016 MANAGEMENT ENERGY INITIATIVES]: GA016 - MANAGEMENT ENERGY INITIATIVES\nFY15 funds for energy initiatives realigned to Surface Combatant HM&E, Ships Support Equipment and Maritime Energy Initiatives (BLI 0200, L7027) to more effectively meet the Departments energy initiatives goals.\n\n[P40A \/ GA830 PRODUCTION ENGINEERING]: GA830 - PRODUCTION ENGINEERING\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nThe review and approval of any production contract technical documentation, or the separate development of this documentation to include Technical Manuals, Signal Flow Diagrams, Planned Maintenance System (PMS), Level III Production Drawings, Provisioning Technical Documentation (PTD), Program Support Data, Allowance Parts Lists (APL's) and engineering in support of final design reviews.\n\n[P3A \/ GA015 DIGITAL FUEL CONTROL SHIPSET]: GA015 - DIGITAL FUEL CONTROL (DFC)This cost element procures the Digital Fuel Control (DFC) shipsets, ancillary equipment and install material to support the CG\/DDG modernization schedules. \n\nOne DFC Kit is required to upgrade each of the four DDG class LM2500 engines, which makes one DFC shipset. \n\n  \nThe DFC is the most significant change to the LM2500 engine since its inception into the USN that addresses obsolescence components which accounted for approximately 40% of all engine failures. In summary this modification is estimated to be 75% more reliable than the old system.\n\nThis upgrade replaces the existing Hydro-mechanical main fuel control (MFC) system which was designed for aircraft; with a Digital Fuel Control (DFC) system designed for military marine environment. This modification increases engine reliability, decreases periodic maintenance, enhances operational functions, and provides an automatic stall detection and shutdown capability.\n\nDFC ship-set procurement cost are updated based on actual prior year contract award prices.\n\nGA6IN - INSTALLATION FOR DIGITAL FUEL CONTROL (DFC) GA015\nFY17 planned installation of the FY16 procured units will be reflected in the Surface Power Equipment (BLI 0131) exhibit.\n\nThis cost element funds the installation of Cost element GA015-Digital Fuel Control (DFC) shipsets as part of the CG\/DDG HM&E modernization program.

The increase demand is due to the number of LM2500 overhauls, driven by increasing number of engines with high operating hours, along with increased amount of unserviceable hot section material.  50% of 1st stage blades and nozzles are now found to be unserviceable during overhaul, up from historical levels of roughly 20%, due to the higher operating hours and increased engine performance requirements.  Each individual LM2500 gas turbine has eighty eight (88) 1st stage turbine blades and thirty two (32) 1st stage nozzles; replacement part costs are on average $12K a unit for 1st stage blades and $22K a unit for 1st stage nozzles.  The basis for the FY15 hot section material requirement of $1.164M is 44 1st stage blades and 16 1st stage nozzles replacements during two (2) FY16 overhauls, at a cost of $880K per overhaul.  In FY15 the program is able to offset approximately $600K of this requirement by using material recovered from decommissioned LM2500 assets, leaving an overall requirement of $1.16M vice $1.76M.  The basis for the FY16 hot section material requirement of $335K for FY16, which will buy 27 1st stage blades replacements during FY17 overhauls.",

In summary this modification is estimated to be 75% more reliable than old system.\n \nThis upgrade replaces the existing Hydro-mechanical main fuel control (MFC) system which was designed for aircraft; \nwith a Digital Fuel Control (DFC) system designed for military marine environment. This modification increases engine reliability, decreases periodic maintenance, enhances operational functions, and provides an automatic stall detection and shutdown capability.\n\nDFC ship-set procurement cost are updated based on actual prior year contract award prices."
