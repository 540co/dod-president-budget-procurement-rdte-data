DoD ABIS is an information technology investment that supports identity superiority by providing the critical capability for Warfighters to identify known or suspected terrorists and third country nationals in the course of military operations.   DoD ABIS is the authoritative biometrics enterprise system that provides matching, sharing and storing of biometrics data.  The capability can receive multi-modal biometrics submissions to include iris, face, palm and finger prints from biometrics collection devices, which will support the Warfigher in making, retain, capture or release decisions.  The system has a direct impact on the availability of critical intelligence information that is of vital interest to DoD and other government agencies, including Department of Justice (DoJ), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and Department of State (DoS)."
