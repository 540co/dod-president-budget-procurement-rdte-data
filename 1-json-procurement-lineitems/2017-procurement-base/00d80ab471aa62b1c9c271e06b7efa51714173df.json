            "val": "The requirement for the RQ-21A Unmanned Aircraft System is defined in a Capability Development Document, dated 18 November 2008 and further defined in the Capability Production Document, dated 15 February 2013.  The RQ-21A program entered the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase of the acquisition process as an Acquisition Category III program on 26 July 2010. On 19 August 2014 RQ-21A was designated and Acquisition Category II program.\n\nThe RQ-21A system provides the Marine Expeditionary Force and subordinate commands (divisions and regiments) a dedicated Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance system capable of delivering intelligence products directly to the tactical commander in real time. The RQ-21A system is capable of providing actionable intelligence and communications relay for 12-hour continuous operations per day with a short surge capability of 24-hours continuous operations for l0 days. The system has an operating radius of 50 nautical miles, further extendable through hub and spoke operations. The Air Vehicle is capable of airspeeds up to 80 nautical miles per hour with a service ceiling of 15,000 feet.\n\nAn RQ-21A system consists of five air vehicles, two ground control stations, modular multi-mission plug and play payloads, one launcher, one recovery system, and support equipment. Standard payloads include a turret mounted EO\/IR camera and a communications relay package with automated identification ship capability, carried in the payload bay.\n\nThe RQ-21A system will continue to evolve and upgrade capabilities to satisfy capability shortfalls, new requirements, and reliability, maintainability, and safety issues.  Upgraded capabilities may include Command and Control integration, weapons, heavy fuel engine, laser designator, frequency agile communications relay, digital common data link, and cyclic refresh of the Electro-Optical\/Infrared camera.  RQ-21 will continue to expand shipboard capability across new ship classes.\n\nRequirements for training changes identified during IOT&E delayed the declaration of Marine Corps Initial Operational Capability (IOC) from 3QFY15 to 2QFY16.  Limited Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) procurements in prior years resulted in an immature production line and the need for additional LRIP lots to incorporate corrective actions and stabilize the supplier base, pushing Full Rate Production Decision (FRPD) from 4QFY15 to 4QFY16."

Ship installation equipment and labor is captured in a separate non-recurring flyaway cost element.  In the FY15 President's Budget and prior, ship installation equipment was included within ancillary equipment.   Increases in Ancillary equipment during FY16 are due to the procurement of TIPS BLK III systems.  TIPS BLK III integrates link 16, wireless intercom system, and the intelligence broadcast system.  Improvements shorten the kill chain, improve UAS operator communication, and improves battlespace awareness.     In FY19 two of the five RQ-21A systems procured will be used as training systems and do not require ancillary equipment.

RQ-21A has an associated Procurement Marine Corps (PMC) 7000 funding account that provides for the procurement of initial spares.

                                                    "@footnote": "Ship Installation includes the procurement of infrastructure hardware and equipment, and labor costs associated with actual amphibious ship class installations in support of the RQ-21A program.  Ship hardware and equipment consists of directional and omni-directional antennas, amplifiers, antenna interface modules, monitors, cross domain solution, power distribution panels, associated cables and fiber optics lines, operational system racks, cabinets, and connectors.  Labor associated with ship installation includes the contracted Alteration Installation Team conducting the ship installation and OEM post install system integration test support.    The program intends to complete three ship installs in FY17, tentatively planned for the forward deployed USS GREEN BAY (LPD 20) during the scheduled availability in Japan, newly commissioned USS MURTHA (LPD 26), and the first LHD class ship USS KEARSARGE (LHD 3).  Preliminary work for the LPD and LHD class ship installations including the planning yard ship check and Ship Installation Drawings was completed in FY16.  All commissioned LPD class ship installations will be completed in FY17.  There will be two remaining non-commissioned LPD class ships that require the RQ-21A ship installation; 1 in FY18 (USS PORTLAND (LPD 27)) and the second LPD 28 (TBD) in the FY20 timeframe.  Cost and schedule reductions from coordination with Commander Naval Surface Forces, the allowance of pier side installations, and realized efficiencies gained during installation have allowed the program to shift focus from LPD class ships to installation onboard LHD\/LHA class ships.    The FY17 installation schedule completes 2 ship installs in FY18, (LPD 27 and LHD 4); 2 in FY19 (LHD 2 and LHD 8): and 2 in FY20 (LPD 28 and LHA 6).  In FY20 and beyond, ship installation focuses solely on the LHD\/LHA class ship.",
