            "val": "Starting FY17, line items 7015 Materials Handling Equipment and 7050 Other Supply Support Equipment are being combined into line item 7025, Supply Equipment. \n\nNAVY CASH PROGRAM: This program funds the procurement of the Navy CashTM system. Navy Cash was developed to improve business processes, create workload efficiencies, and enhance the quality of life for Sailors and Marines on board ship. It enhances the efficiencies and security of automated pay delivery and safekeeping deposit provided by the ATMs-at-Sea system that Navy Cash replaced. Everyone on a ship receives a Navy Cash or Marine Cash card, a branded debit card that looks like a typical debit or check card. It utilizes a pre-paid debit model to provide for a cashless shipboard environment for all retail and other personal financial transactions and helps to reduce the workload for the Disbursing Office and retail locations throughout the ship. This affords more time for core functions and thereby increases readiness. It also improves shipboard business practices by automating and significantly reducing the handling of bills, coins, personal checks, and money orders, automating back-end financial processes and minimizing error-prone cash transactions while it reduces the workload associated with cash management and improves the efficiency and accuracy of fiscal accountability. This overall reduction in the need for cash decreases the costs associated with maintaining large amounts of cash in the safes of ships for the six or more months of deployment. \n\nNavy Cash Installation Program:\n2014 30 Installations (23 Small \/ 3 Med \/ 3 Large \/  1 CVN) - Shown under P-1 Line Item 7050\n2015 30 Installations (19 Small \/ 5 Med \/ 2 Large \/  4 CVN) - Shown under P-1 Line Item 7050     \n2016 38 Installations (20 Small \/ 10 Med \/ 5 Large \/ 3 CVN) - Shown under P-1 Line Item 7050\n2017  6 Installations ( 3 Small \/ 2 Med \/ 1 Large \/  0 CVN)\n2018  1 Installation  ( 1 Small)\n2019  1 Installation  ( 1 Large) \n\nAUTOMATIC IDENTIFICATION TECHNOLOGY (AIT): The Department of Defense (DoD) promulgated Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Policy on 30 July 2004. Current DoD RFID policy focuses on In-Transit Visibility (ITV) support of the Combatant Commanders (COCOMs) as the primary application of active RFID, and DoD Supply Management applications for passive RFID. This effort will ensure Fleet and component commands have deployable active RFID capability to support contingencies and DoD\/Navy RFID policy. Navy has invested in and taken action to support implementation of 35 CONUS and OCONUS locations. These funds represent the Navy costs for the initial outfitting and life cycle costs to fully fund all currently identified COCOM ITV requirements. The Navy continues to coordinate with the Army's Product Director Automated Movement and Identification Solutions (PD-AMIS) for all aRFID and DOD AIT RF-ITV Contract installations, upgrades, hardware, software and infrastructure procurement requirements for Navy sites. Recently AIT aRFID Program Management support changed from the NAVSUP Global Logistics Support to the Weapons Systems Support Transportation and Distribution which provides a unique integration of logistics and analysis capability.\n\nORDNANCE INFORMATION SYSTEM (OIS): Funding Ordnance Information System (OIS) program to complete conversation from Retail Ordnance Logistics Management System (ROLMS) with OIS Partial Connect installs for 75 ships including both USFF and CPF units.  Funding ended in FY14."
