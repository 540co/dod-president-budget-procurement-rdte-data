            "val": "This budget line provides funding for modernization efforts at Government-Owned, Contractor-Operated Army Ammunition Plants (AAPs) and commercial facilities, including replacement of obsolete or worn production equipment, correction of deficiencies and upgrade of infrastructures.  The Industrial Facilities (IF) budget line also establishes, augments and improves ammunition production capabilities through strategic modernization efforts, expands production capacity, maintains environmental compliance, and improves quality of work environment and safety at ammunition plants, as well as emergency modernization and associated construction to address production disruptions at various sites.\n\nThis budget line provides funding for preservation, storage and movement of real property facilities and equipment required for anticipated future requirements at active and inactive Army ammunition installations, also known as Layaway of Industrial Facilities (LIF) activities.  Funding will also support consolidation of laid-away production equipment and redistribution of production equipment that cannot be stored on-site.  Laid-away efforts will also include retaining critical operational and technical knowledge of production equipment, such as engineering designs, process data and control manufacturing practices.  Efforts will also include safety-related decontamination, disposal and demolition of production equipment and facilities, and environmental site assessments.\n\nProcurement funds also support the Maintenance of Inactive Facilities (MIF) to include utilities, buildings, plant equipment, special tooling, and special test equipment being retained to support future production requirements.  Additional efforts include support of associated MIF costs such as grounds maintenance, fire protection, equipment security, and administrative support."

            "val": "FY 2017 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $222.269 million will support modernization projects to include upgrades to the industrial wastewater treatment processes at Holston AAP, upgrades to the small caliber production lines at Lake City AAP, rail system upgrades at Iowa AAP, and modernization improvements to the Nitric Acid Concentrator\/Sulfuric Acid Concentrator at Radford AAP.  Funds will support critical work environmental projects, including improvements for personnel safety and health, and efforts to maintain environmental compliance at the ammunition plants.  Funds will also provide engineering support of industrial facilities, pre-design efforts for future-year modernization projects and procurement efforts at Aberdeen and Yuma Test Centers to include production acceptance tests for various ammunition end items.\n\nFY 2017 funding also supports the protection and preservation of industrial facilities at active and inactive Army ammunition installations and equipment that are no longer required for current production but must be retained for future peacetime or emergency production needs.  Funds support the fourth phase of the decontamination and disposal of excess buildings at Holston Army Ammunition Plant (AAP) and the layaway of various load, assemble and pack production lines at Milan AAP.  LIF efforts also include the removal and disposal of legacy Nitrocellulose (NC) present in Hill Tank 417 at Radford AAP, which will significantly reduce environmental and safety issues associated with large quantities of legacy NC.\n\nFY 2017 funding supports the care and maintenance of laid-away equipment and facilities at active and inactive ammunition installations."
