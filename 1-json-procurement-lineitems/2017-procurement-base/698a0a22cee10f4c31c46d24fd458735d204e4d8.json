            "val": "In FY2016, Appn 3020, BA:05 Line Item #MCOMSE, Spaceborne Equip transferred to Appn 3021. \n\nSpace Communications Security (COMSEC) procures cryptographic products to operate in the space environment. Space COMSEC equipment is a foundational element in achieving AF space and information superiority. Space COMSEC is an enabler for space system compliance with DoDI 8581.01 - Information Assurance (IA) Policy for Space Systems Used by the Department of Defense. Space COMSEC mission provides communications security products and lifecycle sustainment support to all DoD satellite systems and commercial systems supporting DOD missions. It enables secure Command and Control (C2) of satellites and prevents unauthorized access and destruction. It enables secure transmission of satellite systems' health and status telemetry data (satellite health and relative orbital position) to ground control stations, thus protecting critical information about the capabilities of DoD satellite systems. The capability of a system must be protected from an adversary to avoid exploitation of a system weakness\/limitation, knowledge of which could assist an adversary in a successful mission against DoD military forces and potential loss of life. Space COMSEC also provides secure transmission of information collected by satellite sensors, which provides the warfighter an integrated view of the battle space. Space COMSEC provides for secure SATCOM, positioning, navigation, timing, weather, nuclear detection and early warning missions. Space COMSEC also enables Transmission Security (TRANSEC) for space platforms. Space COMSEC mission procures crypto end items and logistics elements to support developing and operational space systems. \n\nFunding for this effort is in program element (PE) 0303140F."

            "val": "a. Products: FY17 funding provides for the production of Space COMSEC products to meet developing and operational space program needs. Space COMSEC products include End Crypto Units (ECU), Embedded Solutions (ES), TRANSEC and ancillaries. Due to low volume production quantities and high reliability design, Space COMSEC products can range in price from $10K per unit to $2M per unit. As a commodity item, Space COMSEC procures standard crypto products which enable minimized lifecycle footprints. Space COMSEC procures from multiple crypto vendors, however, with the low volume consumption by space programs, the space crypto industry base is less than a dozen companies. Items requested in FY16 are identified on the following P-5 and are representative of items to be procured. Items procured during execution may change based on critical equipment needed to support current Air Force mission requirements. Contractor support costs are included as part of the Space COMSEC products funding line in order to provide for end item operational capability.\n\n\nb. Logistics: FY17 funding provides for the production of Space COMSEC Logistics elements. Space COMSEC products typically have a 20 to 40 year lifecycle to support development, launch and operation of multiple Air Force and DoD space systems. Space COMSEC is provided as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) to the space system developing contractors and operational ground stations. Space COMSEC products are high cost critical assets and are organically sustained to include component level maintenance exclusively by the Air Force. Logistics procures the necessary lifecycle sustainment elements required to meet the 40 year mission requirements. Logistics elements include, but not limited to, specialized test sets, certified training materials and courses, maintenance manuals, provisioning, spare components, and modifications. Contractor support costs are included as part of the Space COMSEC logistics funding line in order to provide for end item operational capability."
