Weapons and auxiliary components procured under this budget activity in prior years consist of MK48 Machine Guns, M9 Pistols and associated Basic Issue Items (BII), GO Pistols, M500 Mossberg Shotguns, M3 Multi-Role Anti-Armor Anti-Personnel Weapon System (MAAWS) and MP5KA Submachine Guns to include magazines, clamps, holsters, lanyards and cleaning kits.  Funding will also purchase world class Olympic Grade marksmanship weapons and accessories to support the Army Marksmanship Unit (AMU) in maintaining and procuring the specialized target rifles, pistols and accessories:  Air Rifles, 22 caliber Pistols, Shooting glasses and scopes, Free Pistols, Shot Guns and bolt action rifles."

            "val": "FY 2017 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $2.331 million supports the Active Army by providing funding for stand-alone shotguns, Pistols, associated BII, fieldings, and other enhanced capabilities. The funding also supports the Army Marksmanship Unit (AMU).  The AMU competes worldwide on a regular basis.  The man\/weapon interface at this competitive level is important.   Between competitions the AMU fires constantly to hone their skills and maintain their competitive edge.  Weapons of all types are fired, and even with the extremely high level of maintenance provided, these weapons exceed their stated effective life projections faster.  This requires the weapons to be coded out and replaced regularly. Funding will also provide for the procurement and training of various Non-Standard Weapons to support the regionally engaged Active Army.  These weapons are required to facilitate training of US Army units on host nation weapon systems prior to deployment in support of regionally aligned force missions.   \n\nIn accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities."
