            "val": "Decrease in Tomahawk Support Equipment by $2.958M as required for the Department of the Navy to comply with the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015.  \n\nThe Theater Mission Planning Center (TMPC) consists of Commercial and Government Off-The-Shelf (COTS\/GOTS) software and COTS hardware. TMPC provides targeting, mission planning, strike planning and execution, mission distribution, and operational employment capabilities for the Tomahawk Land Attack Missile (TLAM). Continuous TMPC software development decreases mission planning time and increases the quality and accuracy of each mission while reducing complexity. TMPC provides mission planning at the theater and operational levels and is designed for high rate mission planning production responsive to national strategic, operational, and tactical requirements.  TMPC develops and distributes missions for the Tomahawk Missile; provides command information services for TWS; provides strike planning, execution, coordination, control and reporting, and provides Maritime Component Commanders (MCC) the capability to plan or modify conventional TLAM missions.  TMPC has evolved into scalable configurations deployed in four configurations at 180 sites: Cruise Missile Support Activities (CMSAs) (3+1 FMS), Tomahawk Strike and Mission Planning Cells (TSMPCs) (3 - C5F, C6F, C7F), Carrier Strike Groups (CSGs) (16 - 10 CVN), Firing Units (FRUs) (84 Surface\/56 Submarines), and Fleet Training Sites and Labs (17).  TMPC supports major joint combat operations and Overseas Contingency Operations.  TMPC was previously referred to as the Tomahawk Command and Control System (TC2S).\n\nFunds provide for systems engineering, testing, Independent Verification & Validation (IV&V), Security Accreditation, installation, site acceptance testing, user familiarization of products and hardware.  The Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM) Global Positioning System (GPS) capability, workflow improvements to Mission Planning, Strike Planning & Execution and TWS Single System initiative are included in this line to transition to a Service Oriented Architecture, improve TCS \"Kill Chain\" planning and communications architecture and system effectiveness.  Also, this funding line provides for COTS\/GOTS refreshment, engineering changes, software upgrades, and associated SSNs\/DDGs\/CGs\/CVN logistics, and infrastructure to maintain compatibility and interoperability with existing and future TMPC system configurations. \n\nSurface and Submarine Tactical Tomahawk Weapon Control System (TTWCS) is a post milestone III program executing its first major tech refresh since its 2004 IOC. The first phase of this tech refresh partially resolves processor component obsolescence. The final phase completes all hardware and software obsolescence efforts and will be fleet released in 2016. TTWCS functions include: Tasking validation (missile mission matching), planning of over the water routes, initialization, preparation and launch of BLK III\/IV missiles. TTWCS reduced response time and increased operational flexibility through addition of Launch Platform Mission Planning (LPMP), and in-flight monitoring and control of Blk IV missiles.  Final Phase efforts began in FY12 and consist of the completion of full TTWCS hardware technology refresh, C4I Web services interfaces and operability to be fielded in backfit firing units. In addition, funds provided to continue TTWCS viability in TTWCS v5.6 and ensure compliance with cyber security mandates, continue to address hardware obsolescence through periodic COTS hardware refresh and periodically refresh of GOTS software to address obsolescence, support migration from 32 bit to 64 bit architecture and migrate away from legacy Ada code. Finally it will allow reduction of system complexity and incorporation of critical software fixes. Program options are being identified that will enable TWS integration into future platforms. Included in those options will be changes necessary for TTWCS to ensure required functionality as the missile is modernized beginning in FY19."

            "val": "Funding is required to continue fielding version 5.4.0 and begin fielding of TTWCS hardware\/software obsolescence updates (v5.4.0.2)  Funds also provide for integration, modernization and interoperability efforts necessary to keep pace with changes, retain capability and exploit capabilities of internal (TWS All-Up-Round missile and TTWCS) and external (Modernized Integrated Data Base (MIDB)), National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA) products, Distributed Common Ground Systems (DCGS) Integrated Backbone (DIB) compliance, Future Imagery Architecture (FIA) imagery formats and Intelligence Surveillance & Reconnaissance (ISR) interfaces, Network Centric Enterprise Services (NCES), Global Information Grid\/Internet Protocol (GIG\/IP) (V)6, FORCEnet compliance systems\/interfaces to the effectiveness of the TWS, into TMPC deployed configurations. Funding supporting TTWCS is appropriately phased to complete the 1st major tech refresh since IOC in 2004. Funding is required in FY17 to comply with commercial hardware\/software supportability mandates, obsolescence, information assurance requirements and to maintain pace with modern computing architectures.\n\nFunding is required to initiate and continue the upgrade of unsupportable and obsolete TMPC software to insure compliance with DoD cyber security mandates. Funding also addresses a National Technical Means (NTM) imagery format change. The NTM change requires TMPC upgrades to be fielded to all TLAM mission planning sites by 3QFY18. The Tomahawk Weapon System cannot execute a mission successfully without the NTM imagery as it is used by TMPC for precision targeting and mission planning. This line also funds the implementation of the TMPC Enterprise Network (TEN) necessary to rapidly and effectively manage the distribution of software patches to all operational sites without compromising TMPC's Authority to Operate (ATO). Instead of funding costly site installation teams, new TMPC software releases and patches would be deployed to operational sites electronically. The TEN would be capable of: (1) remote promulgation of security policies, Information Assurance Vulnerability Assessments (IAVA) security patches, and anti-virus definitions to keep pace with increasing cyber security mandates; (2) remote Configuration Management (CM) from a central location for the definition, control, distribution and implementation of official releases and configurations; (3) remote audit and help desk maintenance support for all TMPC configurations; and (4) Continuity of Operations (COOP) during site system failures or natural disasters.  FY17 continues TEN Implementation and TMPC 6.0 modernization upgrade."
