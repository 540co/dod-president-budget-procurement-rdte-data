Mission equipment on the OC-135B includes wet film optical framing and panoramic cameras. Open Skies Sensors program addresses the requirements in the Presidential Policy Directive-15 (PPD-15), which states,\" The United States shall begin budgeting no later than Fiscal Year 2014 to upgrade the sensors on the current aircraft by replacing film-based cameras with available electro-optical sensors.(U)\" Additionally, current cameras are nearly obsolete, frequently unreliable, hard and increasingly expensive to maintain, and repair parts must be individually manufactured. In addition, the web film manufacturers are discontinuing production of the film stock.\n\nThis camera replacement program will replace the wet film cameras with modern, digital cameras. This program will result in modern, digital cameras with higher reliability, maintainability and cost effectiveness. The customer of the imagery will be able to more readily use the imagery products and the equipment service life will be extended significantly.\n\nOC-135B fleet consists of two aircraft. Both aircraft will be modified. One aircraft will be modified during development using RDT&E funds. Each aircraft will receive one A-kit and two B-kits to comply with treaty requirements."

These activities reduce emission of hazardous materials to air, land, and water, while reducing the cost to the Air Force as facility owner, as a customer for products manufactured in the plants, and through process improvements that can be transitioned to Air Force users.  The first category covers the demonstration, validation, and procurement of improved equipment and services provided by the Air Force as facility owner and direct manager of common areas and services at these facilities. These activities meet Air Force pollution prevention goals and reduce the AF ownership cost of the facilities and weapon systems (WS).  They include typical landlord initiatives such as recovery\/recycling equipment, energy conservation initiatives, and pollution prevention opportunity assessments. The second category of expenditure invests in the demonstration and validation of improved manufacturing processes for plant contractors that reduce emissions, regulatory burdens, and WS life cycle costs. These are usually cost-sharing initiatives, undertaken with the contractor because the government has required the use of hazardous materials through specifications, standards, drawing, contracts, and technical orders. In addition, the process improvements innovated at the plants often can be transitioned to Air Force depots, resulting in reduced operation & maintenance costs, reduced depot flow time, and increases asset availability. This budget activity supports Air Force goals under the Pollution Prevention Act, Executive Orders 13423 and 13514, the AF\/CV and SAF\/IE Pollution Prevention Policy, the USD(AT&L) hexavalent chromium reduction policy, and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.  Prior to FY15, these funds were previously provided through PE 078054F.\n\nFunding for this exhibit is contained in PE 78011F."

ATPs feature an infrared (IR) sensor, charged coupled device television (CCD-TV), laser designator, eye-safe laser, laser spot tracker, infrared marker, and real-time video data link for connectivity with ground forces.   ATP capabilities, such as high resolution imagery, eye safe laser, high system reliability and smaller deployment footprint provide greater combat effectiveness across several mission areas, including suppression\/destruction of enemy air defenses (SEAD\/DEAD), precision air interdiction, close air support (CAS), non-traditional intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (NT-ISR), reconnaissance, and time-sensitive targeting.  This funding supports the production, qualification and integration of ATPs to include all activities necessary for fielding. It includes, but is not limited to, Advanced Targeting Pod (ATP) procurements, OFP verification\/qualification testing and integration efforts, Interim Contractor Logistics (ICS) support, containers, site activations, technical data packages, depot standup and program management support. Laser Infrared Targeting and Navigating (LITENING) and Sniper are ATPs currently used by the active duty, Air National Guard (ANG), and Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC).  Advanced Targeting Pod - Sensor Enhancement (ATP-SE) is the next increment in ATP capability.  Low-Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infrared for Night (LANTIRN) and Pave Penny systems will be phased out as new ATP and ATP-SE systems are acquired.\n\nFY17 OCO funds of $8.4M will be used for procurement modification on the Advanced Targeting Pods to add Eye-Safe Spot Tracker\/Laser Spot Search.  Eye-safe Laser Spot Tracker\/Laser Spot Search is essential for protection of US ground and coalition forces during the combat identification process.  The capability will prevent  potential eye damage to friendly forces during ID of targets in urban Environments. \n\n\n\n_____\n\nSchedules and quantities are adjusted based upon COCOM priorities."
