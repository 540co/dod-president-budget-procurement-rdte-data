The JUONF provides a mechanism to fund urgent requirements that will prevent critical mission failure or casualties and  allows immediate action to mitigate emergent critical time sensitive capability gaps.  Amounts in the fund are to be available to the Secretary of Defense for capabilities that are determined by the Secretary, pursuant to the review process required by section 804(b) of the Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011 (10 U.S.C. 2302 note), to be suitable for rapid fielding in response to urgent operational needs. \n\nAmounts authorized for the JUONF will be transferred to other accounts to address Urgent Operational Needs as directed by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology & Logistics).  The JUONF will compliment and not compete with other similar funds.  The JUONF is expected to be a ready source of funds that rapidly addresses the broadest range of urgent needs."
