        "Description": {
            "val": "BASE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE (BTI) provides Marine Corps installations with the base area network communications infrastructure that connects the end-user to the DISA network.  BTI supports, upgrades, and enhances the telecommunications systems infrastructure for all Marine Corps installations in order to meet the demands required to support the 5th Element of the Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF).  BTI is designed to maintain current industry standards as they relate to technological capabilities for all voice, video, and data services and are transported via each installation's infrastructure.  These data services include support for, but are not limited to: video-teleconferencing, integrated services digital network, Marine Corps enterprise network, energy monitoring control systems, intrusion detection systems, access control systems, fire alarm control networks, and fleet training systems.  This includes supporting systems such as optical networks, telecommunications management systems, primary power, voice mail, and teleconferencing.  The ongoing focus is technology refresh and standardization on DISA Unified Capabilities (voice, video, collaboration, and data) through modernization of installation infrastructure in order to maintain connection to the DISA network.  The BTI program is to implement the DISA UC Requirement at 17 Marine installations world-wide.  The upgrades of the installations are required to meet the BTI program Full Operational Capability (FOC) for Unified Capability (UC) for the telephone switch and Dense Wave Division Multiplexing (DWDM) for the transport.\n\nPUBLIC KEY INFRASTRUCTURE (PKI) is a framework of laws, policies, procedures, and technologies for the use of digital credentials, which provide confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, and non-repudiation in electronic communications and transactions. PKI allows secure access to IT systems. PKI has the ability to electronically sign documents, encrypt messages and documents, and to authenticate and protect web access... In compliance with DOD policy and direction, the USMC Public Key Infrastructure Program (PKI) program provides the resources, manpower and equipment (hardware and software), dedicated to the management (i.e.: generation, production, distribution, control, accounting and destruction) of keys and certificates used by public key-based security services to include NIPRNet and SIPRNet both garrison and deployed.  The PKI program operates the USMC Certificate Validation Infrastructure necessary to ensure that only authorized users and server based applications are allowed to operate on the Marine Corps Enterprise Network (MCEN).  These services are required for user access to all information system components on the MCEN including network accounts, applications and web sites.  PKI must be operable in garrison and tactical\/deployed environments.\n\nCONSOLIDATED EMERGENCY RESPONSE SYSTEM (CERS) is hardware and software components that facilitates expedient dispatching of emergency response when calls for service are received. CERS provides command and coordination dispatch functions for first responders to support All-Hazard missions. It standardizes dispatch centers to provide notification functions, resource management, and situational awareness in order to increase efficient emergency and day-to-day first responder operations. CERS capability is achieved through delivery of Enhanced 911 (E911) and upward compatibility with future 9-1-1 standards, and emergency dispatch capabilities consisting of computer aided dispatch, fire and emergency services paging and alerting, and mobile data computers for first responder's vehicles. CERS began fielding during FY13 to support USMC E911 requirements established by 18 Aug 2011 SecDef memo on the Final Recommendations of the Ft. Hood Review. CERS capabilities will continue to be fielded in conjunction with base telecommunications modernization efforts and be accomplished with existing wireless (land mobile radio) and wired (base telecommunications infrastructure) programs.\n  \n\nENTERPRISE LAND MOBILE RADIOS (E-LMR): E-LMR is a modern, digital, Association of Public Safety Communications Officials Project 25 Trunked radio system at all Marine Corps Bases, Posts and Stations (BPS).   It provides the wireless Radio Frequency (RF) communications that is required to support the Consolidated Emergency Response System and First Responders (i.e. Police, Fire, Emergency Medical Services) as part of the Emergency Management Command and Coordination initiative.  Specifically, the radio system provides RF coverage to BPS populated areas, permitting positive command and coordination between Dispatchers and First Responders thereby enabling their ability to respond to incidents during normal, crisis, and recovery operations.  In the wake of 9\/11 and the Ft. Hood incident, it was recognized that effective emergency communications and mutual aid support operation are key elements in providing homeland security, reducing the loss of life and the preservation of property.  Thus, the objective for the E-LMR acquisition is to bring forth a reliable interoperability wireless communication system with a limited data capability.  \n\nTEST, EVALUATION, & ENGINEER ENVIRONMENT: Marine Corps Tactical Systems Support Activity (MCTSSA) provides the only Marine Corps organic, operationally relevant, Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) Command, Control, Communication, and Computer (C4) architecture for testing and other engineering tasks. This environment is the sole organic solution in the Corps for Link-16 Tactical Data Link Networks for air-to- air, ship, and shore targeting and messaging, validated at MCTSSA before Marine\/Navy use in theater.  The environment also provides Marine Corps organic equipment, environments, operators, and testers for Joint Communications Exercises, Joint Interoperability Testing, and Systems of System testing.  Funding supports maintenance and expansion of the MAGTF Systems Integration Environment at MCTSSA for non-Table of Equipment items: Communications Backbone, Test Tool\/Data Collection Hardware\/Software, and Computers.  The environment is essential to operating forces support for fielded C4 systems, as well as evaluating USMC and Joint C4 systems in a controlled, repeatable, and re-configurable manner that reduces program risk and identifies significant deficiencies prior to fielding to the operating forces.  More than forty Marine Corps C4 programs and systems rely on this support.\n\nMARINE CORPS INFORMATION OPERATIONS PROGRAM (MCIOP) provides MAGTF commanders and the Marine Corps a responsive and effective full-spectrum information operations (IO) planning and psychological operations delivery capability by means of deployable support teams and a comprehensive general support IO reach-back capability in order to integrate IO into Marine Corps operations.  Multiple classification levels require separate Information Technology (IT) infrastructure to support each classification level in accordance with National Security Agency and Defense Intelligence Agency standards.  This includes equipment necessary for connecting internal MCIOC IT infrastructure (voice, video, and data) with the existing Marine Corps Base Quantico support infrastructure."
