            "val": "MOD OF IN-SERVICE EQUIPMENT (Firefinder Radars) funds the modifications to the AN\/TPQ-36 Mortar Locating Radar and the AN\/TPQ-37 Artillery Locating Radar.  The Firefinder Radars use a combination of radar techniques and computer controlled signal processing to detect and locate enemy Rockets, Artillery and Mortar (RAM) with sufficient accuracy, and transmit the target data to appropriate counter fire elements in near real time.  The AN\/TPQ-36 is phased-array radar which automatically locates mortar and short range rocket launchers.  The system is configured on three (3) High Mobility Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWVs) making it highly mobile and transportable.  The AN\/TPQ-37 is a phased-array radar with a longer target acquisition range allowing it to locate RAM.  The system is configured on a M1048A1 6-ton trailer which is towed by a 5-ton prime mover. The system has a spare 5-ton cargo truck and the Operations Central (OC) is mounted on a M1113 HMMWV truck.  \nOperationally-required software enhancements and technology insertions for parts obsolescence are necessary to maintain both radars' ability to locate current and emerging threats such as rockets normally used for direct fire. Both systems will receive a ruggedized laptop computer refresh in order to stay up to date and ensure interoperability.  The new ruggedized laptop computer will be interchangeable between the AN\/TPQ-36 and AN\/TPQ-37.\n\nArmy Acquisition Objective (AAO):  \nAN\/TPQ-36 - 116 (1 per Brigade Combat Team (BCT); Armored, Stryker & Light)    \nAN\/TPQ-37 - 70  (1 per Armored and Stryker BCT; 2 per Active Component (AC) Field Artillery Brigade; 1 per AC Division Artillery; 1 per National Guard (NG) Fires Brigade)"
