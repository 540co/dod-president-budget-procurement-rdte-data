Tech Refresh of ENFIRE is on a five year cycle and is the replacement of the laptop and selected perpherials.\n\nENFIRE is a tactical engineering tool set designed to modernize the collection and dissemination of engineer related information while minimizing exposure to enemy observation. ENFIRE incorporates the ability to automatically populate field data on digital forms used for road, bridge, hasty minefield, and Improvised Explosive Device (IED) reconnaissance\/reporting with relevant information from peripheral devices included in the ENFIRE set.   ENFIRE sets are used at the company, platoon, and squad levels as a means to facilitate rapid collection and dissemination of information to commanders in the field.   Information may be disseminated via the Battle Command Common Services (BCCS) to other ENFIRE sets and to other Mission Command (MC) systems.   ENFIRE also has broad area application as a common computing platform for the engineer platoon; with plans to incorporate the Engineer Rapid Airfield Construction Capability (ERACC) Type 1 software solution.\n\nThe long distance laser range finder allows soldiers to quickly and accurately determine a target's bearing and distance from the users' location at a significant standoff range.   Used in conjunction with the Defense Advanced GPS Receiver (DAGR) and ArcMap software, ENFIRE users are able to create overlays of bridges, roads, hasty minefields, and IEDs on digital maps as they collect information related to these targets.   Using the video camcorder and digital scanner, ENFIRE users can also collect picture and scanned image files that can be associated with bridge, road, hasty minefield and IED information for reporting purposes. Reports can be generated in hard or soft copy for quick dissemination enabling the \"Every Soldier as a Sensor\" concept.\n\nENFIRE also offers agile and adaptive tools to help construction and facilities engineers effectively plan and efficiently undertake projects. ENFIRE's construction site-planning software supports structure design, cut and fills requirements, material needs, and personnel and time requirement calculations. ENFIRE's project management tools can create Gantt charts to track project progress and milestones. ENFIRE provides a bar code scanning capability which makes inventory management faster and more accurate.\n\nENFIRE Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) = 2748 (Department of the Army AAO increase based on a revised Army Force structure of 450,000) ENFIRE Hardware and Software are 100% Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) and Government Off the Shelf (GOTS) procurements.\n\nThis program is a new start in FY 2016."
