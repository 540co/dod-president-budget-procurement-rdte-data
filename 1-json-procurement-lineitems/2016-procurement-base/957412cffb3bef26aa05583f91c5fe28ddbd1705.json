            "val": "DCMA's mission is to provide Contract Administration Services (CAS) to the Department of Defense (DoD) Acquisition Enterprise and its partners to ensure delivery of quality products and services to the warfighter; on time and on cost. DCMA has two primary objectives, 1) providing CAS to the military services and other authorized customers worldwide and 2) providing contingency contract support in theater.  The Agency has worldwide acquisition impact through three Field Directorates (Operations, International, and Special Programs). The Agency's Field Directorates are regionally based. The Agency's civilian and military personnel manages over 20,063 contractors and approximately 348,000 active contracts.  \n\nTo assist in managing its diverse activities across the Department, DCMA relies on the use of Information Technology Systems  most of which allow internal DCMA and external DCMA users to collect, aggregate, and analyze DoD contract information.  Without investment in these systems DCMA would not be able to effectively administer and report on the health on the contracts and contractor's performing the work.  In addition DCMA must procure passenger carrying vehicles in support of DCMA's overseas contract management operations."

            "val": "DCMA continues to procure replacement passenger carrying vehicles in support of DCMA's overseas contract administration operations conducted throughout the world.  DCMA is working to convert a limited number of overseas owned passenger carrying vehicles to long-term commercial leases where available.  With the General Services Administration's (GSA) limited support of leasing vehicle outside of Germany, DCMA will continue to require passenger carrying vehicles procurement authority.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nDCMA is developing an integrated enterprise architecture to maximize existing capabilities and provide situational awareness, acquisition insight, and business intelligence to both internal CAS mission users and DoD users, such as Defense Procurement Acquisition Policy (DPAP).   DCMA will need to purchase and deploy a Contract Writing\/Administration System (CWAS) that can collect and prepopulate Contract PDS data from the DoD system of records by the time PDS goes Department-wide.  The DCMA CWS Contract Writing System (CWAS) that will streamline the Contract Modification process and alert our DoD customers of the modification as well as automate the obligation of funds to that customer's financial recording system in accordance with the Procure-to-Pay Handshake guidance.   This effort will help to reduce system and data redundancy and aid in the consolidation of systems within DCMA's portfolio as well as alleviate the need for two different contracting system procurements.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nDCMA's primary focus from FY16 through FY 20 is to invigorate efforts to adjust to the changing environment by creating an agile and flexible learning organization\/culture to support future customer programs, initiating and strengthening acquisition processes and optimizing mission execution to support the acquisition enterprise through agile business practices.  We are centered on the reengineering of DCMA's Contract Administration and Line of Service business processes and the toolsets that provide the needed capabilities.  Our goal is to streamline the business processes and consolidate the toolsets that enable those capabilities to reduce operations and sustainment costs for the Department and where applicable for DCMA.  In order to accomplish this goal DCMA will need to invest in the research, purchase, development and deployment of the new capabilities."

We are completing the system modification necessary for the Procurement Data Standardization (PDS).  DCMA will need to purchase and deploy a Contract Writing\/Administration System (CWAS) that can collect and prepopulate Contract PDS data from the DoD system of records by the time PDS goes Department-wide.  The DCMA CWS Contract Writing System (CWAS) that will streamline the Contract Modification process and alert our DoD customers of the modification as well as automate the obligation of funds to that customer's financial recording system in accordance with the Procure-to-Pay Handshake guidance.   This effort will help to reduce system and data redundancy and aid in the consolidation of systems within DCMA's portfolio as well as alleviate the need for two different Contracting system procurements.\n\nDCMA's primary focus from FY16 through FY 20 is to invigorate efforts to adjust to the changing environment by creating an agile and flexible learning organization\/culture to support future customer programs, initiating and strengthening acquisition processes and optimizing mission execution to support the acquisition enterprise through agile business practices.  We are centered on the reengineering of DCMA's Contract Administration and Line of Service business processes and the toolsets that provide the needed capabilities.  Our goal is to streamline the business processes and consolidate the toolsets that enable those capabilities to reduce operations and sustainment costs for the Department and where applicable for DCMA.  In order to accomplish this goal DCMA will need to invest in the research, purchase, development and deployment of the new capabilities in compliance with DoDI 8115.02.  Some of these include Asset and Property Management initiatives."
