            "val": "Soldier and Small Unit Power (SUP) Systems enable dismounted Soldiers and squads to execute their missions with significantly less battery weight and enable longer missions without a daily unit re-supply of batteries.  These improved renewable systems enable the warfighter to sustain themselves for extended mission duration in the most austere operating environments.  An advanced, Integrated Soldier Power\/Data System (ISPDS) provides the Soldier with a body-worn power\/data capability that is significantly more efficient and lighter than carrying separate batteries for each device.  Soldier and Small Unit Power systems address the power and energy capability gap created by the increase in mission essential, Soldier-portable power consumers, such as Situational Awareness (SA) displays, Global Positioning System (GPS) navigation, weapon sensors, precision targeting systems and portable Soldier radios. This effort began as a Congressional add for development and system improvement for early fuel cell and battery technology and has developed into a line of power sources and solutions suited for not only the individual Soldier, but for the small unit as well. These power solutions include, but are not limited to, Soldier-worn power systems, integrated power vests, power management devices and small unit generators including the platoon power generator (PPG), chargers, scavengers or harvesters; all intended for use in the most austere operating environments. Soldier-portable power systems reduce the weight and logistical burden associated with moving fuel and primary (disposable) batteries across the conventional battlefield.  By using renewable energy and power scavenging technology, Soldiers and small units are able to operate independently for longer durations without being tethered to a large generator, vehicle, or supply train. This effort supports the following requirements: August 2013 Small Unit Power MDD, September 2013 Small Unit Power Capability Development Document (CDD), March 2011 Soldier Protection CDD, the December 2011 Operational Energy Initial Capabilities Document (ICD), the Army Chief of Staff's Squad: Foundation of the Decisive Force initiative, and the December 2011 Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) Operational Energy directives. \n\n\nPlatoon Power Generator: (FY18-FY20)\n\nThis funding supports the procurement of a Platoon Power Generator (PPG). The SUP PPG (1kW Generator) will provide small units with sufficient portable power to sustain Modified Table of Organizational Equipment (MTOE) unit power demand in support of 48 to 72 hour missions using a common logistical fuel (JP-8). It will be used for charging batteries and powering various types of Army communications and electronics devices. It will provide sufficient power to recharge and power all Platoon equipment and fulfill residual power gaps at the Squad and Soldier level. The generator will provide Platoon power for charging batteries when away from vehicles in Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (SBCT), Armor Brigade Combat Team (ABCT) and as a power source for Infantry Brigade Combat Teams (IBCT) in austere environments. FY18 funds allow for the award and management of a procurement contract. This funding will allow for procurement of the AAO of this PPG system.\n\nBy reducing Soldier's load and energy resupply, SUP contributes to the reduction of logistical burden associated with transporting\/supplying fuel in the battlefield and gives small units autonomy to operate on extended duration missions. SUP will employ commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) solution(s), government-off-the-shelf (GOTS) and developmental items"

        "Justification": {
            "val": "FY 2016 base procurement dollars in the amount of $43.639 million procures commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) solution(s), government-off-the-shelf (GOTS) and developmental items for Small Unit Power systems. \n\nThe increased digital capability of electronic devices generates an increased demand for power. Historically, innovations in Soldier power struggle to keep pace with the growing power requirements that accompany these increased capabilities. Additionally, batteries add weight that consumes more space in the combat load.  Power management is a significant mission planning consideration for the dismounted squad leader who manages combat loads. Dismounted squads operating in the most austere environments have traditionally carried enough batteries to sustain individual Soldier devices for up to 72 hours before resupply. Small Unit Power seeks to reduce the number of batteries that the Soldier must carry to reduce the combat load. The Soldier and the squad are the centerpiece of the modernization strategy, as the U.S. Army develops strategies to effectively equip and train the Soldier of Force 2025; it must reconcile how to power the growing number of Soldier-worn devices while also reducing the Soldier's battery load and decreasing the logistical demand for battery resupply.  Therefore, Small Unit Power reduces the number of logistical convoys pushing supplies to the forward edge of the battlefield and significantly reducing the cost and risk involved with battery and fuel resupply missions."
