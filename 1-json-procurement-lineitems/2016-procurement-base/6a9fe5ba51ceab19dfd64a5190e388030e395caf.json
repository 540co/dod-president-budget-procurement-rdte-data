Many of these systems have exceeded the life expectancy of 12-15 years. The PCCIE program is structured into small projects (less than 125 kilovolt amps (kva)) and large projects (greater than 125 kva) and includes associated ancillary equipment.\n\nPEs associated with this P-1 Line are: 0202834F, 0205219F, 0208534F, 0305534F, 0402834F, 0502834F, 0502844F, 0702834F, 0802834F, 0804721F, 0804731F, 0804743F, 0804752F, 0808534F, 0901212F \n\nProjected allocations for Reserve Component Requirements (subject to Total Force demand and priority)."

In FY16 they plan to buy a Satellite\/Space Assembly, Horiba Raman Microscope System and a 3D Printer. \n\nPower Conditioning & Continuation Interfacing Equipment (PCCIE):\nThe new systems collectively satisfy critical user requirements and will:\n1. Reduce overall footprint and weight by 50-60%.\n2. Reduce operating and sustainment costs by 30%-50%.\n3. Reduce acquisition costs as it applies to installation since many newer systems consist of more internal pre-wiring.\n4. Lower parts count dramatically improves reliability by reducing the potential points of failure within the system.\n5. Produce greater energy savings and higher operating efficiency in all configurations, typically between 92% and 93.5%; with all types of loads.\nThe Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) systems protect sensitive electronic equipment\/systems such as command and control centers, intelligence missions, radars, etc."
