It sustains Army production test capabilities through upgrade and replacement of instrumentation and equipment that is technologically and\/or economically obsolete. Modernization of test instrumentation and equipment provides increased automation and efficiencies, improved data quality and quantity and cost avoidances to Army Program Managers.  Programmed funding will be used to upgrade or replace production test instrumentation and equipment at the Electronic Proving Ground (EPG), Fort Huachuca, AZ."

            "val": "FY 2016 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $0.425 million supports the ongoing modernization of EPG's Global Positioning System (GPS) testing lab to the new military signal standards.  It will purchase two differential GPS receivers for ground truth, upgrade GPS transmitter system and upgrade GPS data collection software to collect and analyze new coded data blocks.  The majority of the instrumentation being upgraded or replaced is obsolete and has met or exceeded its economic life.  This instrumentation is required to ensure complete and accurate test data is collected and safety and environmental hazards are minimized.  Benefits of this project include increased test efficiencies and decreased costs and risks to Army Program Managers.\n\nIAW Section 1815 of the FY08 NDAA this item is necessary for use by the active components and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities."
