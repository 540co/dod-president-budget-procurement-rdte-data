            "val": "This program provides funding to the Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) to establish, modernize, expand or replace test facilities used in production testing of General Support Equipment (including trucks, trailers, generators, soldier support equipment, etc.).  It sustains Army production test capabilities through upgrade and replacement of instrumentation and equipment that is technologically and\/or economically obsolete. Modernization of test instrumentation and equipment provides increased automation and efficiencies, improved data quality and quantity and cost avoidances to Army Program Managers. Programmed funding will be used to upgrade or replace production test instrumentation and equipment at Aberdeen Test Center (ATC), Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD; and Yuma Test Center (YTC), Yuma Proving Ground, AZ (including YTCs Cold Regions Test Center (CRTC), Fort Greely, AK)."

            "val": "FY2016 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $1.525 million support the following:  At ATC, procures modern industrial shop equipment (welding and cutting machines) used in fabrication of support items required for Production Qualification Testing (such as rotors, stands, sleighs, camera mounts and instrumentation brackets); replaces old instrumentation used to test combat vehicle fire suppression systems and procures instrumentation and equipment (such as abrators, laundering, self-contained color and flammability, wear, weathering,  plus other textile testers and controlled temperature and humidity test equipment) to perform non-ballistic testing on soldier clothing and equipment.  At YTC, procures replacement transducers used to collect performance data during automotive tests (including sensors, load cells, thermocouple amplifiers, pressure transducers, embedded wireless sensors, strain gages, current transducers and thermocouples); replaces obsolete air delivery aircraft and airdrop load instrumentation  in the areas of aircraft telemetry, aircraft on-board video, payload telemetry, and payload data recorders and purchases on-board data acquisition and recording equipment for collecting vehicle performance data in harsh desert environments.  \n\nThe majority of the instrumentation being upgraded or replaced is obsolete and has met or exceeded its economic life. This instrumentation is required to ensure complete and accurate test data is collected and safety and environmental hazards are minimized. Benefits of this project include increased test efficiencies and decreased costs and risks to Army Program Managers.\n."
