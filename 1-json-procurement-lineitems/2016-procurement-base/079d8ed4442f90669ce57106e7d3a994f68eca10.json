            "val": "This program procures modifications of small arms with a cost less than $5.000 million to include the procurement of accessory components of optics, protective lens coatings, mounting systems and mount improvements, bipods, tripods and tripods improvements\/upgrades.  Optic sights allow the Soldier to identify and engage targets at longer ranges more effectively than standard iron sights.  The M150 Rifle Combat Optic is a 4-powered scope with a ranging reticule enhancing the Soldier ability to engage targets out to 600 meters.  The improved optic combines the close range, rapid target acquisition capabilities of the M68 Close Combat Optic (CCO) and the magnified capabilities of the M150 Rifle Combat Optic (RCO) and M145 Machine Gun Optic (MGO).  Mounting systems provide a means to mount accessory components to weapons and mount weapon systems to platforms.  The M197 Vehicle Mount is the current standard used to mount the M249 and M240B machine guns to most vehicle platforms.  A system improvement will add a link\/spent case deflector and ammo handling system to provide capability upgrades addressing issues that Soldiers have identified as shortcomings of the current system.  Bipods and tripods are used to stabilize and maneuver a weapon to target.  The M205 is a lightweight tripod for dismounted M2\/M2A1\/MK19 machine guns; it weighs 16 lbs (32%) less than the currently used M3 Tripod.  The M192 is the primary ground mount for the M240B\/L and M249 machine guns.  Based on recent combat experience, improvements are required to address identified shortcomings in the design and to enhance operational performance."

            "val": "FY 2016 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $3.737 million supports the Active Army by procuring 402 M205 tripods and providing 1,300 M197 Modification Work Order (MWO) Kits and 1,786 M192 MWO kits to modify fielded system.  The M205 Tripod reduces the Soldier's burden by providing a stable firing platform at 16 lbs (32%) less than the current M3.  The M205 Tripod also provides integral traverse and elevation mechanisms for easier, more accurate target engagement; adjustable traverse limit stop for night time missions; and a new lightweight pintle design.  The M197 MWO Kit will upgrade the existing M197 Vehicle Mounts to add a link\/spent case deflector and ammo handling system.  These upgrades provide capability improvements addressing issues that Soldiers have identified as shortcomings of the current system.  The M192 MWO Kit delivers a system improvement to this lightweight tripod. Fielded in 2005, the M192 is no longer compatible with the various body armor designs fielded in recent years.  The M192 MWO Kit addresses identified shortcomings in the design and provides increased height of the pintle as well as improved performance of the traversing and elevation mechanism.\n\nIn accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities."
