Engineer divers support Corps\/Theater level operations as a force multiplier by performing current diving missions in South West Asia to include debris removal, bridge construction, salvage operations, underwater mine and explosive detection, and personnel recovery operations.  Special operations dive teams use the sets for clandestine combat waterborne infiltration\/ex-filtration and to aid in search and recovery operations.  \n\nDeep Sea Set (DSS): The Deep Sea Set provides diver-worn critical life support and safety related equipment required to conduct surface supplied diving operations in accordance with all commercial and military safety standards.  It includes a full helmet diving assembly that provides air, and protection from pollution, falling debris, and other hazards.  It allows for communications with the surface in a dry environment, and is required equipment for construction, cutting and welding, and salvage operations.  The set also includes an umbilical assembly that supplies breathing air, depth monitoring and a communications\/strength member capable of supporting the diver's weight. The communications assembly allows three divers and the diving supervisor to communicate.  The set can be used to a depth of 250 feet and is the only system that protects the diver while conducting heavy construction and salvage operations.  Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) for DSS is 6.\n\nFunds in this program are a realignment of funds from program Items Less Than $5 million, SSN ML5301 for more efficient, effective program management."
