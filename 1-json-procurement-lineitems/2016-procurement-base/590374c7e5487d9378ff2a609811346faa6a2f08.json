(2) the Next Generation Diagnostic System (NGDS) program is a DoD effort to develop and field a common medical test equipment and diagnostic platform among all Military Services.  A multi-incremental configuration, evolutionary development and fielding approach is proposed which will provide expanded capability for an early warning tool of health threats, early detection of health events, and overall situational awareness.  NGDS will identify both BW agents and pathogens of operational concern (Increment 1).  (3) the DoD Biological Vaccines Procurement acquisition components of the Joint Biological Defense Program are focused on a prime (systems) contract approach in which the prime contractor will manage biological defense medical products.  (4) the Critical Reagents Program (CRP) integrates and consolidates all DoD reagents\/antibodies\/DNA biological detection requirements.  (5) Biosurveillance (BSV) requirements address medical and physical CBRN mission needs for the Joint Biosurveillance Common Framework (JBCF), which will provide a single enterprise environment that supports collaboration, data sharing and coordination between multiple BSV stakeholders."

            "val": "Continues support of the current national military strategy, specifically, a worldwide force projection capability that requires BW detection in order to protect the Force against potential threats.  Operational forces, contingency, special operations\/low intensity conflict, counter narcotics, and other high-risk missions, have the immediate need to survive and sustain operations in a biological agent threat environment.  Operating forces have a critical need for defense from worldwide proliferation of BW capabilities and medical treatment of BW related casualties.  The Joint Biological Defense Program will provide a tiered strategy for detection and warning comprised of complementary detection\/identification systems to provide theater protection against a large area and point attacks.  The other biological defense mission requirement is to provide US Forces with enhanced survivability and force protection through the introduction of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved vaccines to protect against current and emerging threats, which could be deployed against maneuver units, or stationary facilities in the theater of operations."

These products directly support the Secretary of Defense program to maintain a DoD capability to acquire and stockpile adequate quantities of all Biological Warfare (BW) vaccines to protect the programmed force against validated BW agents.  Items currently in the stockpile are the FDA licensed Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed (AVA), Smallpox vaccine, and Vaccinia Immune Globulin Intravenous (VIGIV).  Funding supports vaccine and licensed biologic production, quality assurance and control, equipment validation, process change management, documentation control, and all FDA license maintenance and post-approval commitments (Phase 4 clinical trials).  The annual vaccination program for the Services is funded by the Defense Health Program.\n\n\nJustification: \n\nRDT&E Code B Item: 0603884BP\/Proj MB4; 0604384BP\/Proj MB5\n\nMB4\/VAC BOT: RDT&E FY14 and Prior - 106.426M; FY21 - 14.084M\nMB4\/VACCINES: RDT&E FY14 and Prior - 59.662M\nMB5\/VAC BOT: RDT&E FY14 and Prior - 236.825M; FY15 - 52.562M; FY16 - 16.774M; FY17 - 13.607M; FY18 - 37.625M; FY19 - 49.633M; FY20 - 46.732M\nMB5\/VAC PLG: RDT&E FY14 and Prior - 313.677M; FY15 - 36.214M; FY16 - 17.498M; FY17 - 47.298M; FY18 - 43.739M; FY19 - 10.324M; FY20 - 9.659M\nMB5\/VACCINES: RDT&E FY14 and Prior - 74.717M"
