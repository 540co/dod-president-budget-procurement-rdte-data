            "val": "The Air Force (AF) Physical Security Systems program provides turnkey procurement, installation, integration, and acceptance testing of base defense physical security systems to protect aircraft, to include remotely pilot aircraft and infrastructure required to operate them, missiles, nuclear weapons, and other critical war fighting resources on more than 200 locations worldwide to include active AF, Air Force Reserve, and Air National Guard locations as well as numerous expeditionary, temporary, and semi-fixed locations.  At some locations, the AF has a need to provide initial physical security systems.  At other locations, there is a continuing need to upgrade and modernize existing physical security systems presently installed at fixed sites worldwide.  These existing systems must be replaced or upgraded approximately every five years, depending on environmental conditions, type of sensor, and availability of spare parts due to technical obsolescence.  The program funds modern security systems such as, but not limited to, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS); Visual Detection and Assessment Systems (VDAS), ground surveillance radar systems; explosive detection systems; physical delay and\/or denial systems; fence-mounted sensor systems which can include integration into an existing fence, refurbishment\/replacement of an existing fence or initial installation of a fence\/lighting\/refurbishment\/installation of lighting to support visuals assessment systems; access control systems; identity management systems; and annunciator\/data fusion systems that provide comprehensive battle-space awareness.  The program also funds night vision\/reconnaissance, surveillance and target acquisition technologies required for Air Force Security Forces personnel to engage enemy forces twenty-four hours a day under conditions of degraded visibility due to darkness, adverse weather, battlefield obscurants, foliage and man-made structures.  These devices enable near to long range target acquisition, identification and engagement to include significant fratricide reduction, which improves battlefield command and control 24\/7 home station and combat operations.  It focuses on technology that can bring an immediate improvement to the mounted\/dismounted Airman's equipment.  It develops or enhances equipment that provides the individual Airman day\/night situational awareness and individual targeting capability as a complete weapon system; funds also support the use of investment equipment for major range and test facilities.  Program funds are also used to pay for power and communication infrastructure and other IDS support requirements (e.g. HVAC for temperature control within server and annunciator control rooms).  IDS are required for Protection Levels (PL) 1 - 4 assets and facilities (ex. AF aircraft parking areas).  The program will respond to transient and on-going security threats and provide tactical, semi-permanent and fixed site security systems which may require design & engineering, installation, infrastructure and allied support, integration, acceptance testing, modeling and simulation, training, Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (MILES) Gear, and interim contractor support.  This program also directly supports the Homeland Defense elements of antiterrorism, counterterrorism, critical infrastructure protection, intelligence, and consequence management.  Other physical security delay\/denial systems funded in this program include remotely operated mobile sensor systems to include directed energy weapons for force protection applications, non-lethal weapons, and remotely operated weapons mounting & fire control systems.  This program also funds testing of physical security systems and equipment at various test locations.  Provides Tactical and Expeditionary Security Systems  (TESS) designed to provide deployable perimeter base defense worldwide. These Tactical & Expeditionary security systems employs sensors, assessment devices, alarm monitors, data communications links and power equipment to form a continuous electronic security envelope around critical resources and installation perimeters, improving the ability of Air Force (AF) Security Forces (SF) to see, understand and act first to defeat our enemies.  Designs are modular and tailored to support any requirement and include line and wide area detection and assessment systems such as ground surveillance radar and unmanned ground\/airborne surveillance systems.\n\nPE 0101122F AIR-LAUNCHED CRUISE MISSLE (ALCM)\n\nAIR LAUNCHED CRUISE MISSILE (ALCM) SECURITY SYSTEMS: Funds procurement of intrusion detection sensors, alarm annunciators, surveillance systems and related security system equipment needed to replace unsupportable, aging and obsolete ALCM security command and control systems\/equipment.\n\nPE 0101213F MINUTEMAN SQUADRONS\n\nMinuteman Security Equipment: Funds procurement of intrusion detection sensors, alarm annunciators, and surveillance systems required to maintain and replace critical Minuteman warhead storage security command and control subsystems that can no longer be supported.\n\nPE 0207588F: AIR BASE GROUND DEFENSE (ABD)\n\nAir Force Tactical Security Equipment: The Tactical Automated Security System (TASS) is designed to be rapidly deployed to austere, temporary and semi-permanent locations in order to enforce circulation control, detect\/assess intrusion attempts, and delay\/deny hostile elements. When correctly configured, TASS will provide an additional layer of protection to deployed service members. The personnel and equipment provided by this program contributes to the overall Air Force antiterrorism\/force protection program. It enhances security forces ability to provide rapid responses by building more deployable, flexible, and sustainable forces capable of operating from other than main operating bases to support sustained sortie generation and air operations. Tactical\/Expeditionary capability provided through TASS will undergo modernization investment to address aging components in the systems that are becoming obsolete. The Tactical\/Expeditionary equipment is required to provide robust force protection capabilities worldwide. Equipment includes, but is not limited to various personnel, vehicle and movement sensors; fixed and mobile alarm annunciation equipment; devices capable of providing all weather day\/night remote visual assessment in fixed or 360 degree direction (PTZ); recordable CCTV; C3 nodes.\n\nPE 0207589F: BASE PHYSICAL SECURITY SYSTEM (BPSS)\n\nINTEGRATED BASE DEFENSE SECURITY SYSTEM (IBDSS): Reduces the risk to AF personnel; nuclear (PL-1N), and non-nuclear (PL1-4) assets (weapon systems, aircraft, command &control systems, etc.) and facilities (hangars, SCIFs, etc.) at AF, ANG, and AFR installations globally. DoD downsizing, reductions in forward basing, and aircraft technology advances evolved AF weapons systems into increasingly valuable national power projection capabilities.  However, the security afforded most AF aircraft, weapon systems, other critical resources, and associated personnel and facilities in terms of equipment or manpower has not kept pace with the changing world environment, state-of-the-art technology and potential threats. The emergence of Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) has led to additional command, control and communications nodes that require Protection Level security to enable effective Air Force power projection. Force Protection BPSS projects support long-term physical security requirements which allow security forces to adapt to and counter enduring and emerging threats to high priority to meet both BPSS and critical security requirements in accordance with the Aerospace Expeditionary Force concept.  This continuing effort was previously named Base Physical Security Systems and is not a New Start.\n\nPE 0208047F ANTI-TERRORISM  \n\nTactical and Expeditionary Security Systems: This activity procures non-developmental solutions and Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) technologies to satisfy requirements.  Each system purchased costs in excess of $250K\/unit. Defense Biometrics Identification System (DBIDS) is fully accredited through the Department of Defense Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process and complies with Homeland Security Presidential Directives 6, 11, 12 and 24, and the Federal Information Processing Standard 201. DBIDS is already installed at more than 100 sites across the Air Force; this line funds procurement for the remaining required sites.  Furthermore, targeted and rapid procurement\/installation of TASS is often required to protect resources that have been evaluated as potentially soft targets for terrorist attacks. The system itself functions as an enrollment station for all personnel who require routine and short term access to installations.  It collects biographic and biometric information and is capable of issuing locally produced credentials and temporary passes. DBIDS procurement and installation also supports the Ft Hood Report recommendation #31.4."
