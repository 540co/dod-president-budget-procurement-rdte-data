This budget also provides funding which supports capital-type rehabilitation projects in the areas of environmental, safety, major repair, and energy conservation at the active Naval Industrial Reserve Ordnance Plant (NIROP), Allegany Ballistics Laboratory (ABL), and inactive NWIRP. Capital-type rehabilitation projects at the GOCO plant, NIROP ABL in Rocket Center, WV, supports weapons systems such as AARGM, RAM, Sparrow, ESSM, ERGM, AIM-9X, AGS, Tomahawk GG and Trident GG.\n\n[P5 \/ FU002 Capital Type Rehabilitation]: Provides funds to close, deactivate, prepare, and convey the Government-Owned Contractor Operated (GOCO), Naval Weapons Industrial Reserve Plant (NWIRP) in Bedford, MA, under the cognizance of NAVSEA, supported by WPN funds.  Provides support for Capital Type Rehabilitation projects at the GOCO plant, Naval Industrial Reserve Ordnance Plant (NIROP) Allegany Ballistics Laboratory (ABL) in Rocket Center, WV.  NIROP ABL supports weapons systems such as AARGM, RAM, Sparrow, ESSM, ERGM, AIM-9X, AGS, Tomahawk GG and Trident GG.\n\nThis program funds projects that eliminate environmental deficiencies to comply with local, state, and federal OSHA regulations. These regulations mandate requirements, which must be met if plant shutdowns in order to avoid criminal liability, and severe financial penalties.  Projects to eliminate safety deficiencies in compliance with local, state, and federal OSHA regulations are also funded by this program. These regulations mandate requirements, which must be met if plant shut-downs in order to avoid severe financial penalties.  The program also includes critical upgrades to maintain high liability areas such as fire and security systems, roofs, boilers, electrical distribution systems, bridge crane systems, and other structural repairs essential to maintain the industrial integrity of the plant.  This line also supports projects that decrease energy consumption by installing new energy efficient systems and provides increased maintenance on these systems.  Mandated in 1993 by Congress (Defense Appropriations Committee).\n\n[P5 \/ FUCA1 Facilities Restoration (ABL)]: Provides funds for replacement of Weapons Industrial Facilities at NIROP ABL in Rocket Center, WV that have exceeded their useful life and deteriorated beyond safe operations (personnel & explosive).\n\n[P5 \/ FU020 NWIRP MCGREGOR]: This item provides funding to\/for property management, minor maintenance, environmental compliance, and divestiture support for Naval Weapons Industrial Reserve Plant in McGregor, TX."

        "Justification": {
            "val": "Funding is required to address critical infrastructure issues. The plants have an average age of 45 years and lack of proper maintenance will limit capabilities to maintain scheduled production rates and overall productivity. \n\nFY16 funding will support a $2M Coal Boiler recapitalization project for the Steam and Electric Plant at Naval Industrial Reserve Ordnance Plant, Allegany Ballistics Laboratory.  The project replaces 20-30 year old coal fired boilers with new ones fueled by natural gas. The aging boilers in the steam generation plant require significant upkeep to maintain steam production.  New boilers will result in a lower operating cost, a much lower air pollution discharge, and a more reliable operation. The new boiler house will also have the capability of generating electricity which will provide a more secure facility in case of national emergency. Generating electricity on-site will reduce plant downtime due to electrical utility outages.  FY16 funding will also support the requirement of a new pad designed for hazardous materials storage.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nFederal Acquisition Regulation Part 52.245-7 specifies that facilities use contracts require that the government fund capital type rehabilitation projects to support and maintain these facilities.  Funding is separated to reflect environmental, safety, major repair, energy conservation, and facilities restoration."
