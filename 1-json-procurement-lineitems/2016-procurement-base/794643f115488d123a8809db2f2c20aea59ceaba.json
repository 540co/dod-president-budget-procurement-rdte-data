The BSS is composed of several subsystems, including the Anchorage Kit, Bridge Protection Device, Site Stability, Power Generator, and Special Tools as well as Containers and\/or Racks for storage, organization, and transport. The Anchorage kit is a means to hold float bridging such as Improved Ribbon Bridge (IRB) in place during extended emplacements. The Bridge Protection Device is utilized to stop debris from contacting float bridging assets while emplaced. The Site Stability enhances traction for traffic to and from the bridging site in soft, muddy, or sandy crossing conditions. The Power Generator and Special tools will come from existing Army inventory through General Service Agency (GSA). An M1077 flatracks or equivalent will be utilized for protection, security, transportation, and storage of all the sub-systems based on architecture or layout. All of the sub-systems (Anchorage, Site Stability, Bridge Protection, Power Generation and Special Tools) must be transported on a total of four or fewer M1077 Pallets or equivalent and be capable of being transported by the Common Bridge Transporter (under 22,000 Lbs per load). A load is described as one pallet and its contents to include the weight of the pallet itself.  The BSS unit of issue will be two per Multi-Role Bridge Company (MRBC).\nAAO: 56"
