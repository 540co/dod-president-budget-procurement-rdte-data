            "val": "Funding for Missile Industrial Facilities provides for capital maintenance projects at Navy-owned Naval Industrial Reserve Ordnance Plants (NIROPS) at Sunnyvale and Santa Cruz, California, and Bacchus, Utah, in support of the Fleet Ballistic Missile program. The Bacchus, Utah, ATK facility alone consists of 583 acres, over 130 buildings and over 13 miles of road.  The Sunnyvale, California facility consists of 49 acres of land and 10 buildings and the Santa Cruz, California facility consists of 271 acres of land and 29 buildings."
        },
        "Justification": {
            "val": "As NIROP buildings are vital to D5 motor production, they must be maintained in an operational state until the D5 missile retirement.  Most buildings are already over 50 years old and have exceeded their useful life. Safety related maintenance projects were originally deferred when the Department did not have a program of record to remotor the D5 missile to support its extended deployment.  Subsequently, the Department approved and funded the re-motoring of D5 missiles.  Additional repairs and upgrades are necessary to ensure NIROP buildings are properly maintained because of this significant extension of motor procurement.  Incidents that stress the need for additional funds include: a leak in the fire branch line which left a few energetic buildings without fire protection, failure of an exhaust fan which halted operations until the unit was replaced, failure of a pneumatic valve which halted HMX production, and a failure in the liquid nitrogen pump system which shut down hardware testing. Projects planned in FY 2016 include modifications and rehabilitation of civil works, non-severable equipment, and real property.  Among these projects are roof replacements, upgrades and improvements to building electrical systems, upgrades to heating and air conditioning systems, resurfacing of roads and parking areas (focusing on Motor transportation routes), and general facilities maintenance. Major drivers of FY 2016 cost growth include a fanhouse replacement and a boiler and electrical substation and water tower pump house upgrade."
