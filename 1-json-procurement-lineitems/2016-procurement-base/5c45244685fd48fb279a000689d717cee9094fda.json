        "Description": {
            "val": "FAMILY OF POWER EQUIPMENT - This family is comprised of four major elements (sub-families) that provide power generation, power distribution, and tactical external lighting to all user communities across the active Marine Corps and Reserves.  These are centrally managed items.\n\nThe first element is the sub-family of Department of Defense Standard Tactical Generators USMC (and all services) procures from the DOD Project Manager for Expeditionary Energy and Sustainment Systems (PM E2S2).  USMC procures and manages standard generator models in the power output range of 2 kilowatts (kW) to 100 kW. Included in this for medium size models (5 kW to 60 kW) is the new Advanced Medium Mobile Power Sources (AMMPS) that USMC first began procuring in 2012 and will continue procuring through 2015. The AMMPS provides improved fuel economy, improved maintainability, and reduced weight.\n\nThe second element is the sub-family for Mobile Electric Power Distribution Systems - Replacement (MEPDIS-R) which provides a modernized, standard suite of electric power distribution panels and cabling assemblies to meet Marine Corps power requirements to support a variety of command and control systems and expeditionary forces. MEPDIS-R, as a highly tailorable system, consists of 20 separate components that are configured into capability sets by all using units.\n\nThe third element is the Floodlight Set (FLS), a self-contained external lighting system with a power plant and light tower assembly.  The FLS is capable of providing up to five acres of area illumination and is used extensively for security purposes. For flexibility, the set is configured so it can be mounted on all trailer systems or ground mounted and plugged into grid power.\n\nThe fourth element is the sub-family of support equipment to support elements of the Power Equipment Family.  This includes unique trailer mounting kits for all systems onto USMC standard trailers, software planning tools for emplacement of power and power distribution, unique training aids, and general purpose electrician toolkits.\n\n\nFAMILY OF ALTERNATIVE POWER SOURCES FOR COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT (APSCE) - This family consists of multiple suites of devices, grouped into sub-families, that are used to provide highly expeditionary power (worn on the Marine, hand-carried, or vehicle mounted) to operate communications equipment, computers and peripheral equipment in place of disposable batteries, and for scenarios where fuel powered generators are too large, too heavy, unsuitable for use, or provide undue logistics burden due to refueling needs.\n\nThe first suite of devices encompasses renewable energy based systems, and includes the man-portable Ground Renewable Expeditionary Energy Network System (GREENS) that supports a company level operations center and Forward Operating Base, and the man-portable Solar Portable Alternative Communications Energy Systems (SPACES) that supports Combat Outposts and Observation Points.  Both of these exploit the use of solar energy technology to recharge batteries and directly power electronic equipment without the need for re-fueling generators.\n\nThe second suite of devices is the Family of USMC Tactical Power Supplies.  This includes both shelter based (semi-rugged) and fully ruggedized power supplies (operate outdoors) that convert grid power (alternating current) to vehicle based power (direct current).  These power supplies support all elements across the USMC with standard models that provide variable electrical output to support a wide electrical range of operation.  The suite also includes vehicle mounted inverters that convert vehicle 24 Volt direct current to 120 Volt alternating current to allow on-the-move operation of equipment that previously was only able to be used while stationary.\n\nThe third suite of devices is On-Board Vehicle Power (OBVP) systems, that modify and implement power generation onboard multiple vehicles (High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle and Medium Tactical Vehicle).  The HMMWV based system provides engine drive, electric AC power comparable to what a HMMWV towable, trailer mounted generator could provide (25 kilowatts).  This saves embark space and weight for highly expeditionary applications.  The MTV based system provides engine drive, electric AC power comparable to what a generator mounted to the bed of the truck could provide (100 kilowatts).  This frees up cargo space, while saving space and weight also for highly expeditionary applications.\n\nThe fourth suite of devices is the Family of Radio Power Adaptors (RPA), which provide an alternative power source for each radio in the Marine Corps (seven different models).  Instead of consuming batteries when in garrison\/shelter operations, RPAs allow the radios to be operated from central power sources (such as GREENS and SPACES) or grid power (120 volt AC generator).  This provides cost avoidance, conservation of batteries, and flexibility of operations.\n\nThe fifth suite is the Battery Management and Sustainment Systems (BMASS) that support all lead-acid batteries used in vehicles and artillery systems, and lithium ion rechargeable batteries used in command, control and communications systems.  The suite consists of battery chargers, battery analyzers, and battery safety management systems for both chemistry of batteries, and for both garrison (semi-rugged) and deployed operations (ruggedized).  As the USMC (and all services) move towards fully adopting rechargeable batteries for energy efficiency and logistics demand reduction, BMASS is critical to support numerous weapons, engineer, vehicle, and communication systems that are highly dependent on batteries for their operation."

Funding required to meet the Approved Acquisition Objectives outlined in the Total Force Structure Management System.\n\nADVANCED POWER SOURCES $25.956M   \nFunds procured SPACES, GREENS, High Energy Density Batteries, Solar Panel Cases and Lithium Battery Support. Power Supplies consists of 117F Radio Power Adaptors.  \n\nFY2015 Base Appropriation Request: ($8,985)\n\nMOBILE POWER EQUIPMENT $4.890M\nFunds the procurement of 2KW,10KW,15KW,30KW,60KW 60 HZ AMMPS, A-MEPDIS, AMEPDIS-R ADAPTERS, Pulse Solar Chargers, First Destination Transportation (FDT) shipping charges for AMMPS and ILS Support. Continues the replacement of about 7,000 medium TQGs with more reliable, fuel-efficient and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-approved AMMPS generators. \n\nADVANCED POWER SOURCES $4.095M \nFunds the procurement of Ground Renewable Expeditionary Energy Network System (GREENS).  Funding is required to meet the Approved Acquisition Objectives outlined in the Total Force Structure Management System.\n\nFY2016 Base Appropriation Request: ($10,792)\n\nMOBILE POWER EQUIPMENT $0.738K\nFunds will procure Advanced A-MEPDIS components and ILS support. The funding decrease of $4.145M from FY15 to FY16 reflects the requirements and resource realignment to support other MC requirements. \n\nADVANCED POWER SOURCES  $10.054M\nFunds the procurement of 117F Radio Power Adapters (RPA), Advanced Battery Chargers (ABC), On-board Vehicle Power (OBVP) and the Advanced Improved Solar Panel Case Assemblies (AISPCA).  Procurement of these systems enables the Marine Corps to reduce its dependency on fossil fuels to generate battlefield power, and enables the use of rechargeable batteries, with subsequent reductions in operations and maintenance costs and HazMat waste streams.  These systems improve tactical flexibility by reducing logistics (sustainment) demand.  Increase of $10.460M from FY15 to FY16 due to restored funds for expeditionary energy investments to meet the Expeditionary Energy Strategy goals.\n\nOCO: \nFY14 Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) Request: ($2,004)\nFunds the procurement of the Mobile Electric Power Distribution Systems - Replacement (MEPDIS-R) and associated logistics support for replacement of combat losses in theater.\n\nFY15 Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) Request: N\/A\n\nFY16 Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) Request:  N\/A"
