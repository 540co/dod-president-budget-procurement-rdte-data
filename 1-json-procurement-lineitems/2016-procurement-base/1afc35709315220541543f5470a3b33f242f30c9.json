            "val": "The Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense (AIAMD) Program is a direct response to the U.S. Army AMD Concept and Operational and Organizational (O&O) Plan for the Future Force, the Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense System of Systems (SoS) Capabilities Development Document (CDD) and the new Air and Missile Defense Task Force Concept of Operations (CONOPS).   The AIAMD Program is uniquely structured to enable the development of an overarching system of systems (SoS) capability with all participating Air Defense Artillery (ADA) components functioning interdependently to provide total operational capabilities not achievable by the individual element systems. The AIAMD program achieves this objective by establishing the AIAMD architecture and developing (1) the IAMD Battle Command Systems (IBCS) Engagement Operations Center (EOC) that provides the common Mission Command capability, (2) the Integrated Fire Control Network (IFCN) capability for fire control connectivity and distributed operations, and (3) the common Plug and Fight (P&F) Kits that network enable multiple sensor components, weapon components, and the IBCS EOC.\n\nThe AIAMD Program will provide advanced capabilities to the Army and the soldier by allowing transformation to a network-centric system-of-systems capability (also referred to as \"Plug and Fight\") that integrates Army Air and Missile Defense (AMD) sensors and weapons with the IBCS EOC.  The AIAMD SoS architecture will enable extended range and non-line-of-sight engagements, to include joint kill chain engagements across the full spectrum of aerial threats, providing fire control quality data to the most appropriate weapon to complete the mission successfully.  Further, it will mitigate the coverage gaps and the single points of failure that have plagued AMD defense design in the past.  The AIAMD program will provide the user with the ability to train on a single C2 system that will result in overall training savings. The AIAMD program will also provide the Army with the ability to procure components that will build to established interfaces allowing them to \"connect\" to the IFC network alleviating the cost of procuring total system capabilities in the future. \n\nThe FY18 Initial Operational Capability is delivered through the fielding of the IBCS EOC-based AIAMD architecture including the IBCS EOC, Sentinel and Patriot components connected via an IFCN, working in an integrated manner. Additional capabilities include the incorporation of IBCS functionality into Air Defense Airspace Management (ADAM) Cells, ADA Brigade Headquarters and Army Air and Missile Defense Command (AAMDC) Headquarters. Future additional capabilities include incorporation of Terminal High Altitude Air Defense (THAAD) batteries and composite Indirect Fire Protection Capability (IFPC)\/Avenger battalions into the AIAMD architecture.\n\nAIAMD is a designated Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP).\n\nThis program is a new start in FY 2016.\n\nFY16 funding goes to the Active Component. Army National Guard funding starts in FY2020."

Funding includes the cost of fabrication, assembly and installation of tools, inspection equipment and test equipment to support the manufacture of IBCS components. Funding includes the cost for the modification and rework of the required developmental tools for production purposes as well as duplicate sets of tools.\n\nFY 2016 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $7.997 million is required for Long Lead-time Items (LLI) IBCS components required to protect the production schedule and to maintain critical manufacturing skills for both the prime and sub-contractors.
