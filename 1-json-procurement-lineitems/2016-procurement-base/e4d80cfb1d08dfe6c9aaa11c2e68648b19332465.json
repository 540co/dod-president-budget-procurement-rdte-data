            "val": "The Weapons Enhancement Program provides funding for various force protection items and marine upgrades. The program funds urgently required commercially available equipment and non-developmental items (NDI) that can be rapidly fielded to support the Operating Forces such as the Family of Ballistic Protection Systems which includes Full Spectrum Battlefield Equipment (FSBE), Marine Enhancement Program (MEP), Escalation of Force - Equipment (EoF-E), and Ocular Interruption (OI). FSBE is used to address the needs of Marines performing Special Operations Capable missions in Maritime Special Purpose Force (MSPF) (i.e. MSPF detachment and helicopter Assault Company). Less weight, increased positive buoyancy, spare air source, and a cutaway system are all desired quality changes under this program. MEP is a Congressionally initiated program that provides an avenue for obtaining equipment and end items that would otherwise be considered low visibility, low cost. The MEP Program funding focuses on equipment that will benefit the individual Marine by reducing load, increasing survivability, enhancing safety, and improving combat effectiveness. EoF-E funding provides support and sustainment of all fielded equipment and capabilities. Additionally, EoF-E supports type-classification, testing and procurement of new advancements and technologies to provide an increased capability over existing or outdated equipment currently or associated in the Escalation of Force- Mission Modules (EoF-MMs). OI is the replacement of the 'Dazzling Laser' program for the LA-9\/P and the Non Glare Mount 532P-M (Mini Green) laser. OI is a \"Non-damaging\" dazzling system that will be used in Escalation of Force-Missions to provide a non-lethal, force protection capability to warn and visually suppress targeted personnel at ranges from 10 to 500 meters."
