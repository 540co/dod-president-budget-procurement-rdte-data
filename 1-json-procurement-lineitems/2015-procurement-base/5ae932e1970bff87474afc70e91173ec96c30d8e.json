            "val": "This Robotic Combat Support System (RCSS) Budget line procures the M160,the Man Transportable Robot System (MTRS)Inc II and the Robotic Clearance Integration System (RCIS). \n\nThe M160 is a 6.1-ton tracked, combat engineer vehicle designed for teleoperation by soldiers from either mounted or dismounted positions to perform area clearance of antipersonnel mine-sown areas. The Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) is 39. The M160 detonates or destroys anti-personnel mines in a 68-inch wide path through the action of a rotating chain and hammer flail system. The M160 provides standoff and increased protection for engineer units in conducting route and area clearance missions. It fills the Light Flail mission in the Area Clearance Family of Systems. The M160 is a modified Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) system. \n\nThe Man Transportable Robotic System (MTRS) Inc II is designed for route clearance and reconnaissance. It provides the Soldiers with the ability to locate, identify, and clear landmines, unexploded ordnance and Improvised Explosive Devices in the path of maneuvering US Army or Joint Forces. It also provides Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear (CBRN) Soldiers with the capability to employ CBRN sensors from a standoff distance. The robot is a teleoperated platform and contains both an arm and cameras. In addition, the unit has an Operator Control Unit, a handheld controller that allows the operator standoff to operate the vehicle from a mounted or dismounted location. The operator uses the Operator Control Unit to receive video and vehicle control data and to transmit commands to the vehicle. An Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) will be completed in FY15 and may result in a common medium weight class robot across the Army, to include Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) teams.\n\nThe Robotic Clearance Integration System (RCIS) Type I and II will allow the tele-operation of Type I (High Mobility Engineering Excavator (HMEE)) and the semi-autonomous control of Type II (RG-31). The RCIS Type I (HMEE) enables the soldier to interrogate, classify and excavate deep buried explosive hazards, Improvise Explosive Devices (IEDs), and caches in a wide range of road surfaces and soil conditions.  The RCIS Type II (RG-31) enables soldiers to semi-autonomously control the RG-31 and its payloads. RCIS procurement is scheduled to start in FY17."

            "val": "FY15 Base procurement dollars in the amount $4.701 million will procure Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) equipment to support M160 recapitalization and Engineering Change Proposal (ECPs) kits. The MTRS Inc II presented a shaping brief for the Material Development Decision (MDD) in 4Q13. The MTRS Inc II program will complete an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) in FY15. The AoA will determine whether or not the Army procures a common, medium-class robot for all Army requirements, to include Explosive Ordinance Disposal (EOD) teams. Acquisition strategy will be based on the outcome of the AoA.  The RCIS Capabilities Requirements Document was approved on 17 December 2012. \n\nThe RCIS MDD was conducted in 4Q13 with LRIP planned for 2Q17."
