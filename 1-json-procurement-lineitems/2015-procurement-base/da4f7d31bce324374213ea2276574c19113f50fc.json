            "val": "PE 0102890F VISUAL INFORMATION ACTIVITIES - STRATEGIC\n\nImagery Acquisition and Audiovisual (AV) systems and their products are used throughout the Air Force to inform and train warfighters and to document combat operations and other events of historical significance. Combat video documentation is used for operational reporting and analysis, situational awareness, battle damage assessment, intelligence and operational analysis, casualty identification, and the historical record. In addition, video and multimedia based products are developed for warfighter operations, readiness training, medical videography, public and internal information, testing and evaluation, and corporate communications. Commanders recognize that imagery quickly conveys very accurate and unbiased information, and are requiring greater amounts of video imagery to help meet the challenges of a very active warfighting force. The Air Force is meeting this challenge by dedicating funding to procure and sustain this important capability by replacing older video studio systems with newer and more capable equipment and systems for both Air Force video production and combat\/contingency documentation teams. Imagery acquisition systems are centrally managed to establish and maintain standardization of systems, as well as to ensure full interoperability with all other electronic image acquisition, transmission system formats, and presentation systems used in the Air Force.\n\nPE 0305550F IT SERVICES MANAGEMENT - OTHER\n\nWESTERN TEST RANGE DIGITAL IMAGING SYSTEMS: This program replaces obsolete, 35 year-old high-speed engineering film cameras with high-speed digital imaging systems. This capital equipment replacement procures items to maintain current capability. These cameras are mounted on mobile optical tracking systems and on camera towers next to the launch pad to provide detailed slow motion photography of the launch events. The cameras support satellite, ballistic, missile defense, and aeronautical missions on the Western Test Range and at Kodiak Island, Alaska. The optical data acquired by these engineering camera systems is a vital part of post flight performance analysis of all space and ballistic launch operations and is critical for Test and Evaluation programs now being conducted by the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) at Vandenberg AFB. Optical tracking provides detailed engineering sequential photography for anomaly resolution and accident reconstruction at distances up to 60 kilometers, and is required for all current and future MDA tests and Delta IV, Atlas IV, Delta II, Peacekeeper, Minuteman, Airborne Laser, Kinetic Kill Vehicle, and commercial space launches. These digital systems replace film camera systems that are no longer logistically supportable."

These policy documents exist to ensure DoD and AF compliance with public laws: 36 CFR 1237\/1220 and Title 44 Chapters 3301\/3101.  These funds are used for audio\/visual equipment funding at the only three AF active duty COMCAM squadrons, which provide lobal\/deployable rapid response during wartime operations, worldwide crises, contingencies, joint exercises, and humanitarian operations.  Additionally, these funds procure audio\/visual equipment supporting AF-wide(garrison and deployed) needs for photo, graphics and video products that aid public diplomacy, internal\/external communication, information operations, operational\/planning efforts, and effective\/efficient training. \n\nPE 0305550F IT SERVICES MANAGEMENT - OTHER\n\nWESTERN TEST RANGE DIGITAL IMAGING SYSTEMS: FY15 funding continues the multiyear replacement of engineering film cameras with high-speed digital imaging and infrared (IR) systems along with mobile tracking mounts to support digital cameras. Funding provides life cycle replacement of obsolete equipment with high speed definition cameras for recording optical data for launch requirements, mid-wave IR sensors and recorders for engine performance and accident investigation details to aid evaluation teams, and near IR cameras that operate below the range of visible sensors."
