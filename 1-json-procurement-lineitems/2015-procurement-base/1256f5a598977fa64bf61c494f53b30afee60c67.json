NGEN forms the foundation for the DON's future Naval Networking Environment (NNE) , is interoperable with and leverages other DOD provided Net-Centric Enterprise Services and supports the Joint Information Environment (JIE).  The formal transition to NGEN began in FY 2011 with the execution of the Continuity of Services Contract (CoSC) awarded 8 Jul 2010 with a period of performance ending April 2014. For the Marine Corps, NGEN is a Government Owned\/Government Operated (GO\/GO) model augmented by NGEN contractors with the garrison Marine Corps Enterprise Network (MCEN) representing NGEN Marine Corps management domain. NGEN provides Operations & Maintenance and Procurement funding to transition the Marine Corps from the Navy and Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI) contractor owned and operated environment\/capability, with no break in service, through the CoSC as a bridge contract with the NMCI incumbent and other NGEN early transition activities.  \n\nNote: Line Item 4625 was established for NGEN for PB15; funds prior to FY 2015 are in Line Item 4630."

NGEN transition actions include acquiring services, hardware and software in support of the MCEN Unification Campaign Plan, Cyberspace Operations requirements, the Marine Corps's portion of the JIE, and refreshed hardware including, but not limited to, end user devices, physical and virtual servers, routers, switches, Cyber Defense assets, software, and Information Technology Service Management (ITSM) processes and tools.  \n\nFY15: Funding will procure services, hardware and software supporting end user devices and networked infrastructure technical refresh. Technical refresh hardware and software will occur in support of the MCEN Unification Campaign Plan, Cyberspace Operations requirements, the Marine Corps's portion of the JIE, and refreshed hardware including, but not limited to, end user devices, physical and virtual servers, routers, switches, Cyber Defense assets, and software, and Information Technology Service Management processes and tools.  The hardware and software for this refresh differs in quantities and costs based on varying requirements including the current pricing, the quantities that are ordered based on hardware\/software end of service\/life and the operational balance between security and risk management.\n\n$2.073M funding will support the refresh of end user equipment and non-end-user (network infrastructure) hardware.
