            "val": "A-10C Full Mission Trainer (FMT) supports procurement of high fidelity, Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) capable flight simulators for A-10C weapon systems. Each FMT includes a high fidelity FMT Cockpit, Instructor Operator Stations, Threat Server, and modifications of visuals, image generators, host computers and software. Each FMT is capable of linking to geographically distributed high-fidelity combat and combat support training devices including Command and Control (C2) and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) systems. The FMT allows the warfighters at home station to exercise and train at the operational and strategic levels of war as well as conduct networked unit-level training. FMT training supports Air Force Distributed Mission Operations, an operational readiness initiative enabling the USAF to exercise and train at the operational and strategic levels of war while facilitating unit level training. Networked Live-Virtual-Constructive components form the integrated DMO battlespace by linking geographically distributed high fidelity combat and combat support training devices including C2 and ISR systems.\n\nThe A-10C FMT provides essential emergency and tactical training that is difficult or impossible to obtain in the aircraft in-flight. A-10C FMTs are required to provide quality training in the following areas: egress, cockpit familiarization, emergency procedures, instrument flight, weapons employment and tactics, new weapons systems, and to support all A-10 upgrade programs in a realistic day and night environment including distributed operations and NVG training. Some training aspects (e.g. emergency procedures, instruments, threat reactions) can only be accomplished in an FMT or not at all. Use of an A-10C FMT significantly improves safety, pilot proficiency and combat capability."

Funding acquires an A-10C FMT with 360 degree visual displays, brief\/debrief systems, modifications of visuals, image generators, host computers\/software and instructors\/technicians. The FMT is required to execute the FY11 CSAF directed Ready Aircrew Program (RAP) realignment with C-NAF War Planning. A-10C FMT training requirements increased 600% as a result of the RAP realignment and decreases to the Flying Hour Program. Pilots have mandatory RAP training in large and small force exercises designed to prepare them for current OCO missions with the latest AC sensor and weapons. Replacement of the FMT is required for Total Force Integration RAP training of 65 A-10C pilots at Moody AFB."
