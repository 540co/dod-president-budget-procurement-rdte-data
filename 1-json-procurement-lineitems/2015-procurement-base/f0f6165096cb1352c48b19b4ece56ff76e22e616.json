            "val": "The MK48 Mod 7 Heavyweight Torpedo (HWT) is the U.S. Navy's primary submarine launched Anti-Submarine Warefare (ASW) and Anti-Surface Warfare (ASuW) weapon.  The Navy's decision to increase torpedo inventory by restarting the MK48 Mod 7 CBASS Torpedo production was documented in a CNO N97 Letter ser.  N97\/12U144399 dated 13 June 2012.  The MK48 Mod 7 HWT production restart effort is planned to be an Acquisition Category (ACAT) III  program based on current projected costs and planned inventory.\n\n[P5 \/ G5001 - Hardware]: Funding under this cost code supports the award of two competitive contracts for the MK48 Mod 7 Torpedo G&C and afterbody tail cone sections from the prime contractors, production test equipment upgrades,  engineering change proposals and non-recurring engineering to resolve production issues including obsolescence. Nonrecurring Engineering (NRE) funds base contract year technology refresh due to obsolescence issues and non-deliverable hardware consumed in production acceptance testing.  Engineering services and Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) pays for studies, plans, design changes and implementation of design changes at the contractor(s), primarily due to obsolescence that occurs during the contract performance.  Also included in this cost code is the cost of government installation and integration of MK48 Mod 7 G&C and afterbody tail cone torpedo sections procured in prior years that will be integrated with war reserve MK48 Mod 4 MK107 warhead components and fuel tanks into an AUR.  The AUR is then loaded with the operational software and completes quality assurance check-out prior to issue the MK48 Mod 7 Torpedo as a warshot or exercise torpedo.\n\n[P5 \/ G5003 - Support and Ancillary Equipment]: Funding under this cost code provides procurement and maintenance of support and technology refresh of test equipment at Naval Undersea Warfare Centers (NUWC) Keyport and Newport and the contractor facility for assembly, testing and integration.\n\n[P5 \/ G5830 - Production Engineering]: Funding under this cost code provides for production tasks performed by NUWC NPT and KPT and includes review of contractor generated Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs), review and resolution of contractor failures and proposed corrective action, configuration management activities, contractor monitoring, risk analysis, technical problem resolution, software engineering, safety, integrated logistics support, environmental engineering, and information systems. Funding maintains production specification in accordance with production processes and provides subject matter experts to support root cause analysis of failed contractor hardware and monitor contractor defect and reduction processes to ensure deficiencies are effectively addressed. Funding is also provided for program office acquisition support.\n\n[P5 \/ G5840 - Quality Assurance]: Funding under this cost code provides for quality assurance (QA) tasks performed by NUWC Keyport and Newport including: QA reviews of the contractor and subcontractors data and documentation indicating conformity to product performance requirements and review of objective quality evidence.\n\n[P5 \/ G5860 - Acceptance T&E]: Funding under this cost code provides for integration and production acceptance testing of prime contractor hardware sections and warhead into an MK48 Mod 7 AUR Torpedo."

The second competitive contract will procure the torpedo afterbody tailcone section, which will include the steering assembly, tailcone assembly, engine assembly coolant system, fuel delivery assembly, hydraulic system, alternator\/regulator, lube oil pump, and type 2 cables.  The MK48 Torpedo G&C sections and afterbody tail cone sections will then be fully integrated with war reserve MK48 Mod 4 MK107 warheads and fuel tanks, at NUWC Keyport, WA IMA, into an All-Up-Round (AUR) warshot or exercise MK48 Mod 7 Torpedo.  NUWC Keyport, WA IMA will perform production acceptance on these MK48 Mod 7 torpedo sections."
