These funds also provide for the procurement and installation of Network hardware\/software products\/components, which are not a part of a current Program of Record (POR) and have been evaluated and approved through the Army's Agile NIE process for inclusion into the Army's Tactical Capability Sets (TCS) Synchronized Fielding plan.  Some of the potential commodities under consideration are; Ring Tail\/Common Tactical Viewer (CTV), Blue Sky Mast, Tactical Data Router\/Voice over IP.   These funds also provide for vehicle mounting equipment and installation of the network components to include power amplifiers\/splitters, GPS units, loudspeakers, routers, and battery isolators, filters, cables, connectors, AC inverters, utility outlets, environmental control units (ECU), fans, thermal & power switches, diplexers, and antennas.\n\nOperational impact:\nThe Tactical Capability Sets are installed on Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP), Light Tactical Vehicle (LTV), and Stryker tactical vehicles which provide the Brigade Combat Team with the enhanced ability to effectively communicate through voice and digital data while operating in a highly mobile environment.  As a result of the Army's Agile process the procurement time from the gap identification to the product, which can close the Gap, being fielded into the BCT for use in the theater of operation is reduced from an average time of eight-to-twelve years, down to less than two years"
