Initial FSP tasks confirmed the quality of design, materials, procedures, and processes used in the manufacture of the system.  After missile deployment, results from surveillance firings, inspections, functional tests, Storage and Aging Programs, and depot level missile maintenance processing provide the data required for the assessment of reliability, performance, and safety of the missile stockpile.  The PAC-3 missile is fielded under the Certified Round Concept.  Under this approved concept, the PAC-3 missile is capable of being placed in extended storage as part of war reserve stocks or deployed in operational units for variable periods and then fired without intervening tests or checkouts.  In accordance with the Certified Round Concept, the reliability\/performance of the missile is certified by the Lower Tier Project Office (LTPO) to be at an acceptable level for a stated period of time.\n\nThe certification of reliability is made possible through the use of the PAC-3 Missile Support Center (P3MSC) contract to use technical support and knowledge of the testing of discrete lots of component parts, subassemblies and assemblies which the prime contractor (LMMFC) provides as the only source of technical knowledge, expertise, and facilities to perform FSP activities and process PAC-3 missiles.\n\nThe PATRIOT International Engineering Services Program provides continuing engineering support for system software and hardware for the life of the PATRIOT Air Defense System for US and international partners. The Engineering Services Program is designed to sustain, maintain, and improve the PATRIOT system within the performance envelope described in the system specification. The support provided under this program includes PATRIOT software engineering and testing, engineering support for PATRIOT peculiar hardware, Government Furnished Equipment, Logistics, Technical Data Package, Trainers, and Integrated Diagnostics Support System. This is accomplished through the investigation, analysis, and development of solutions to identified problems as well as the incorporation of new or improved technologies. Modifications to hardware are engineered for manufacturing implementation and retrofit of fielded hardware through the modification process. The program is also used as a vehicle to engineer and maintain PATRIOT software. The majority of the software effort involves the engineering of post deployment software builds. \n\nProcurement funded Systems engineering and project management support to the PATRIOT Weapon System.  This support encompasses the overall planning, direction, and control of the production of the system\/program, including functions of logistics engineering and Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) management, e.g., maintenance support, facilities, personnel, training, testing, and activation of a system."
