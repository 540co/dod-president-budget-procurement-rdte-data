This budget also provides funding which supports capital-type rehabilitation projects in the areas of environmental, safety, major repair, and energy conservation at the active Naval Industrial Reserve Ordnance Plant (NIROP) Allegany Ballistics Laboratory (ABL) and inactive NWIRP. Capital-type rehabilitation projects at the GOCO plant, NIROP ABL in Rocket Center, WV, supports weapons systems such as AARGM, RAM, Sparrow, ESSM, ERGM, AIM-9X, AGS, Tomahawk GG and Trident GG.\n\n[P5 \/ FU002 Capital Type Rehabilitation]: Provides funds to close, deactivate, prepare, and convey the Government-Owned Contractor Operated (GOCO), Naval Weapons Industrial Reserve Plant (NWIRP) in Bedford, MA under the cognizance of NAVSEA, supported by WPN funds.\n\nThis program funds projects that eliminate environmental deficiencies in compliance with local, state, and federal OSHA regulations. These regulations mandate requirements which must be met if plant shutdowns, criminal liability, and severe financial penalties are to be avoided.  Projects to eliminate safety deficiencies in compliance with local, state, and federal OSHA regulations are also funded by this program. These regulations mandate requirements which must be met if plant shut-downs and severe financial penalties are to be avoided.  The program also includes critical upgrades to maintain high liability areas such as fire and security systems, roofs, boilers, electrical distribution systems, bridge crane systems, and other structural repairs essential to maintain the industrial integrity of the plant.  This line also supports projects that decrease energy consumption by installing new energy efficient systems and provides increased maintenance on these systems.  Mandated in 1993 by Congress (Defense Appropriations Committee).\n\n[P5 \/ FUCA1 Facilities Restoration (ABL)]: Provides funds for replacement of Weapons Industrial Facilities at NIROP ABL in Rocket Center, WV that have exceeded their useful life and deteriorated beyond safe operations (personnel & explosive).\n\n[P5 \/ FU020 NWIRP MCGREGOR]: This item provides funding to\/for property management, minor maintenance, environmental compliance, and divestiture support for Naval Weapons Industrial Reserve Plant in McGregor, TX."

            "val": "Funding is required to address critical infrastructure issues. The plants have an average age of 45 years and lack of proper maintenance will limit capabilities to maintain scheduled production rates and overall productivity. \n\nFY15 funding will support a $2M Test Facility Recapitalization project.  Equipment recapitalization included in this project are data acquisition systems, standard and high-speed video equipment, hydroproof cylinders, temperature conditioning controls and temperature logging equipment. These facilities play an important role of testing support most programs on the plant, whether it be rocket motor, composite, or metal manufacturing.  Maintaining capability and capacity for present programs and projected growing product line is critical to production.  Funding will also support the $0.6M Reactive Waste Staging Facility Recapitalization project which will outfit a new, consolidated storage facility to replace small, aging storage sheds which have become inadequate to house explosive waste materials. This new storage area would allow for easier identification and processing of the materials for disposal.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nFederal Acquisition Regulation Part 52.245-7 specifies that Facilities Use contracts require that the Government fund capital type rehabilitation projects to support and maintain these facilities. These plants have an average age of 45 years and lack of proper maintenance will limit capabilities to maintain scheduled production rates and overall productivity.  Funding is separated to reflect environmental, safety, major repair, energy conservation and facilities restoration."
