When used to search for radioactive material, they provide an extremely reliable method of identifying radioactive material while minimizing the risk to personnel conducting these operations.\n\n[P40A \/ M2200 - Dosimetry]: In accordance with 10CFR20, dosimetry is required to be worn by personnel who work with sources of radioactivity.  In the Navy this includes personnel in the Nuclear Propulsion, Nuclear Weapons, and Medical and Radiological Affairs Support programs.  In these programs radiation exposure is measured by dosimetry and recorded in individual medical records for tracking purposes.  Dosimetry is also worn by personnel responding to casualties involving radioactivity to control their exposure within acceptable levels.\n\n[P40A \/ M2400 - Other RADIAC]: Supports instruments that are disparate in functionality and cannot be readily grouped into the other RADIAC Cost Codes.\n\n[P40A \/ M2500 - Air Sampling Systems]: Monitoring for airborne radioactivity is done to detect leaks from nuclear reactors or associated systems to ensure that radioactivity is not inadvertently released to the environment from these operations.\n\n[P40A \/ M2600 - Laboratory Test Equipment]: This Cost Code supports specialized equipment usually found in laboratories, hospitals and research facilities.\n\n[P40A \/ M2830 - Support - Production Engineering]: Labor cost of the Engineers, Health Physicists, Scientists and others who prepare the acquisitions."

This includes Navy programs such as Nuclear Propulsion, Explosive Ordnance Disposal, Nuclear Weapons, Industrial Radiography and Medical.  The DT-702 provides primary dosimetry, whereby dosage accumulated on this card can be entered into the respective permanent medical files of each wearer.  The processes associated with the DT-702 also are compliant with 10CFR20 by being approved by the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP), which is administered by the National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST).  The cards are issued to individuals and tracked by serial numbers.  The cards are periodically turned in (and another card is issued so there is no coverage gap) to have the dose extracted by an 8800 Reader.  The process by which the cards are read include several heating cycles that eventually make the receptor elements unusable, so the life of a TLD is finite -- about 100 reads -- and then they have to be replaced.",

These dosimeters are worn by personnel who might be exposed to effects of a nuclear explosion or the associated fallout.  The original concept was to replace the IM-270\/PD with something similar, i.e., an inexpensive ($22 each) wrist watch device with a digital display that records radioactive dose starting at the high level of 10 rem (Roentgen Equivalent in Man).  The concept of operations for such a dosimeter is that it is issued at MOP III to every sailor in order for recovery teams to perform triage on casualties after a nuclear detonation.  A rem is a large dose of radiation, so the millirem (mrem), which is one thousandth of a rem, is often used for the dosages commonly encountered, such as the amount of radiation received from medical x-rays, background sources and the lower levels of radiation normally associated with occupational radiological workers, which they receive on a continual basis and why their exposures are monitored and recorded.  Dosimeters for these latter Navy programs use dosimeters that measure dose in the millirem range (see CEs 2.1 and 2.10).    Subsequent to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant disaster, a capability gap was identified wherein ships in the deployed Battle Group were exposed to the lower levels of radiation normally associated with occupational radiological workers.  This hampered the continuity of operations and exposed sailors to risk.  Therefore, specifications were added to the Battlefield Dosimeter for a device that could provide real-time feedback of doses at occupational ranges, but not be as expensive as an EPD (CE 2.10, approximately $330 each at FY13 prices).  Nonetheless, the Unit Cost of the Battlefield Dosimeter will increase exponentially due to the added capabilities.  While the final Unit Cost has not been determined because there has not been a selection of a winning design, costs are expected to be tempered somewhat because this buy will be Joint to satisfy similar requirements for Army and Marine Corps units, so an EOQ buy above the Navy requirements alone are expected to help in that regard.",

The RADIAC Program fields 70 different families of instruments, consisting of a total of almost 43,000 instruments and 400,000 dosimeters.  Those families that fall into similar functionality have been grouped here into the M2100, M2200, M2500 and M2600 Cost Codes.  This Cost Code consists of instruments that have specialized functions that only they perform, and therefore would require an unmanageable and meaningless number of additional Cost Codes if each were addressed individually.  In the context of the family metaphor used here, these instruments are no less important but are orphans in the sense there are not many of similar functionality that they could be grouped with. This Cost Code also supports replenishment of Ready for Issue (RFI) stocks when instruments in any Cost Code fall below stock levels sufficient to meet quarterly demand.  This Cost Element (Spares) is a Continuing element that varies year-to-year based on emergent requirements and the quantity and unit cost of the item(s) being replenished.",

Monitoring for airborne radioactivity is done to detect leaks from nuclear reactors or associated systems to ensure that radioactivity is not inadvertently released to the environment from these operations.  Additionally, monitoring for airborne radioactivity is performed during maintenance on radioactive components or during events that might cause radioactivity to be released to the air.  Monitoring for airborne radioactivity is normally done by drawing air across filter paper to collect airborne radioactive particles.  This filter paper is then evaluated by radiation detectors and the concentration of airborne radioactivity is calculated.  The types of airborne radioactivity monitoring systems include fixed systems and portable systems. Fixed systems sample air from pre-determined locations and normally include built-in radiation detectors for determining the airborne radioactivity concentration.  Portable systems can be used to sample air at any desired location, but normally require the use of separate radiation detection instruments to measure the radioactive particles deposited on the filter paper to determine the airborne radioactivity concentration.",

Initial plan was to procure 600 new units at approximately $3,500 each to supplement existing fielded inventory of 1,200 units, many of which were failing and could not be repaired due to parts obsolescence.
