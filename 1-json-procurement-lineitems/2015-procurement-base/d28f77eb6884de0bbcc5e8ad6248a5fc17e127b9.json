The HMMWV ECV serves as the primary light tactical ground vehicle for command and control, troop transport, light cargo transport, shelter carrier, towed weapons prime mover, and weapons platform throughout all areas of the battlefield or mission area.\n\nECV upgrades include: improved brakes, suspension, cooling system, a more powerful Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) compliant engine, increased payload, improved corrosion prevention, and access panels to facilitate maintenance.\n\nThe HMMWV Sustainment Modification Program will restore selected variants of the armored ECV fleet to 2004 HMMWV Operational Requirements Document (ORD) performance parameters. This will be accomplished via a modification through kitting approach. The improvements will focus on restoring the vehicles to safe operating parameters over the expeditionary mission profile, restoring reliability, payload, and mobility to ORD thresholds. The HMMWV Sustainment Modification Program restores payload and performance to extend the service life and enhance the durability of those ECVs not replaced by JLTV out to 2030."

            "val": "FY 2013 Base Appropriation: $5.925M\n\nThe HMMWV Sustainment Modification Program provided a \"drop-in\" solution in the form of upgraded component kits that can be installed in the field or at the depots. The request funded the procurement of an initial quantity of production kits to support evaluation and subsequent fielding.\n\nFY 2014 Base Appropriation: $1.224M\n\nThe HMMWV Sustainment Modification Program restores payload and performance to extend the service life and enhance the durability of those ECVs not replaced by JLTV out to 2030. This will be accomplished by exploring\/evaluating various solutions based upon cost, weight, performance, and durability. The program provides a \"drop-in\" solution in the form of upgraded component kits that can be installed in the field or at the depots. The request initiates Pre-Production Qualification Testing (PPQT).  Testing will be non-destructive and upon completion vehicles will be refurbished and fielded. HMMWV fleet performance, reliability and safety will be improved.  \n\nFY 2015 Base Appropriation Request: $57.255M\n\nThe HMMWV Sustainment Modification Initiative is expecting a Milestone C decision in 2Q FY15 with the subsequent Production Contract Award for modification kits in 3Q FY15. The increase of funding in FY15 provides for the procurement of modification kits and subsequent fielding. The modification kits consist of upgrading major subsystems (frame, suspension, power train, cooling, brakes) and subcomponents needed to modify armored HMMWV ECVs, in order to achieve pre-armoring levels of safety, performance, payload capacity, and reliability.  The increase will allow the program to procure modification kits to support the modification and improvement of the HMMWV ECV fleet, and will increase the program's ability to procure the AAO within an operationally relevant timeframe. The Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) modification kits will be delivered shortly after the Production Contract Award, in support of non-destructive Production Verification Testing (PVT), and vehicles will be refurbished and fielded upon the completion of testing. These modification kits will restore operational viability and increase the safety and reliability of the fielded vehicles the operating forces deploy in harm's way."
