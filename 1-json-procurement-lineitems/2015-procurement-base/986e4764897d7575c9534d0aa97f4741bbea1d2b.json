These items support gunnery tables, aerial target tracking (Captive Flight Trainer (CFT), and Tracking Head Trainer (THT)) training, Missile Live Fire training when missiles are allocated in accordance with (IAW) the Missile Distribution Plan), and U.S. Army Avenger systems worldwide. Training requirements are generated by Department of the Army Major Field Commands, Training Centers, Division Level Commands, and real world mission rehearsals.  These field requirements have been reviewed and validated against ongoing force restructuring and are consistent with the approved training doctrine.  These targets are necessary to meet Army Regulation 220-1 (Unit Status Reporting) training requirements, training strategies and gunnery standards, and soldier qualification in support of unit readiness.\n\nIn accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities."
