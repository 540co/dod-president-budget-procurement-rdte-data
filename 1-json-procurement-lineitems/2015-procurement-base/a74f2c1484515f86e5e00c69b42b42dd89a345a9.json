            "val": "Under the umbrella of the Theater Mission Planning Center (TMPC), the Tomahawk Command and Control System (TC2S) is the mission planning segment of the Tomahawk Weapons System (TWS) that provides systems for the precision targeting, route planning, mission distribution, and strike management of Tomahawk cruise missile missions from sites located ashore and afloat. TMPC optimizes all aspects of the Tomahawk missile mission to successfully engage a target and has evolved into five scalable configurations at 179 sites: Cruise Missile Support Activities (CMSAs) (3), Tomahawk Strike Mission Planning Cells (TSMPCs) (3 - C5F, C6F, C7F), Carrier Strike Groups (CSGs) (10 CVN's\/5 CTF's), Firing Units (FRUs) (84 Surface\/56 Submarines), Command & Control Nodes (C2 Nodes) (6), Labs (6), and training classrooms (6). Systems fielded at the CMSAs and TSMPCs provide mission planning and employment support information for conventional TLAM, including the distribution of mission data and command information essential to TLAM employment via the mission distribution system and associated communications infrastructure.\n\nFunds provide for systems engineering, testing, Independent Verification & Validation (IV&V), security accreditation, installation, Site Acceptance Testing (SAT), user familiarization of products and hardware to support command and control nodes. The Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM) Global Positioning System (GPS) capability, workflow improvements to mission planning, strike planning & execution and TWS obsolescence are included in this line to transition to a service oriented architecture, improve TCS \"Kill Chain\" planning and communications architecture and system effectiveness. Also, this funding line provides for Commercial-off-the-Shelf\/Government-off-the-Shelf (COTS\/GOTS) refreshment, engineering changes, software upgrades, and associated SSNs\/SSGNs\/DDGs\/CGs\/CVN logistics, and infrastructure to maintain compatibility and interoperability with existing and future TC2S system configurations. \n\nSurface and Submarine Tactical Tomahawk Weapon Control System (TTWCS) is a post milestone III program executing its first major tech refresh since its 2004 IOC. The first phase of this tech refresh partially resolves processor component obsolescence. The final phase completes all hardware and software obsolescence efforts and will be fleet released in 2016. TTWCS functions include: Tasking validation (missile mission matching), planning of over the water routes, initialization, preparation and launch of BLK III\/IV missiles. TTWCS reduced response time and increased operational flexibility through addition of Launch Platform Mission Planning (LPMP), and in-flight monitoring and control of Blk IV missiles.  Final Phase efforts began in FY12 and consist of the completion of full TTWCS hardware technology refresh, C4I Web services interfaces and operability to be fielded in DDG 113 and follow-on FLIGHT III DDG's.  Program options are being identified that will enable TWS integration into future platforms."

        "Justification": {
            "val": "Funding is required to initiate and continue the upgrade of unsupportable and obsolete software in the Tomahawk Planning System (TPS).  The current TPS software is rapidly becoming obsolete, unsupportable, and incompatible with DoD security mandates making it more susceptible to Cyber-attack.  Funding also addresses the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) imagery format change planned for June 2018.  The Tomahawk Weapon System cannot execute a mission successfully without  the NGA imagery used by TC2S for precision targeting and mission planning. This line also funds the implementation of the TC2S Enterprise Network (TEN) necessary to rapidly and effectively manage the distribution of software patches to all operational sites without compromising system's Authority to Operate (ATO).  Instead of funding costly site installation teams, new TC2S software releases and patches would be deployed to all operational sites electronically. The TEN would be capable of:  (1) remote promulgation of security policies, Information Assurance Vulnerability Assessments (IAVA) security patches, and anti-virus definitions to keep pace with increasing IA mandates; (2) remote Configuration Management (CM) from a central location for the definition, control, distribution and implementation of official releases and configurations; (3) remote audit and help desk maintenance support for all TC2S configurations; and (4) Continuity of Operations (COOP) during site system failures or natural disasters.  FY15 continues TEN implementation and the TPS rewrite upgrade. \n\nFunds are also required to resolve remaining TTWCS hardware\/software obsolescence issues (v5.4.0.2) and continue fielding version 5.4.0. Funds also provide for integration, modernization and interoperability efforts necessary to keep pace with changes, retain capability and exploit capabilities of internal (TWS All-Up-Round missile and TTWCS) and external (Modernized Integrated Data Base (MIDB)), National Geospatial Inteligence Agency (NGA) products, Distributed Common Ground Systems (DCGS) Integrated Backbone (DIB) compliance, Future Imagery Architecture (FIA) imagery formats and Intelligence Surveillance & Reconnaissance (ISR) interfaces, Network Centric Enterprise Services (NCES), Global Information Grid\/Internet Protocal (GIG\/IP) (V)6, FORCEnet compliance systems\/interfaces to the effectiveness of the TWS, into TC2S deployed configurations. Funding supporting TTWCS is appropriately phased to complete the 1st major tech refresh since IOC in 2004. Overall funding decreases in FY15 as compared to FY14 due to software development transitioning to testing."

Funding also addresses the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) imagery format change planned for June 2018.  The Tomahawk Weapon System cannot execute a mission successfully without  the NGA imagery used by TC2S for precision targeting and mission planning. This line also funds the release of TC2S 6.0 which will field the next generation architecture to achieve greater reuse of products across multiple domains.  In FY14-19 this line also funds the implementation of TEN which is necessary to rapidly and effectively manage the distribution of software patches to all operational sites without compromising system's ATO, and system software upgrades for the submarine community to specifically address system interfaces.",
