            "val": "The Strategic Command and Control (C2) program procures mission critical communications and computer systems required to ensure the United States has the capability for effective C2 of the New Triad (nuclear, conventional, and missile defense).  It procures hardware replacements\/upgrades to maintain the only computer systems that produce the Nation's nuclear war plan and performs conventional\/contingency war planning.  Also, the program supports life-cycle replacement of outdated and unreliable communications equipment in support of the B-2 program.\n\nPE 0101127F - B-2 SQUADRONS:\n\nB-2 SUPPORT: The B-2 weapon system relies heavily on C2 equipment to meet its operational capability. Funding is used to replace obsolete computer equipment, backbone infrastructure hardware and software, and long haul communications equipment at the Weapon System Support Center (WSSC) Ground Test Facility (GTF), and contractor software laboratories. This includes COTS items such as computers, displays, printers, disk and tape drives, software (e.g. computer-aided design (CAD) and analysis software) as well as engineering and logistical support. Funds also procure specialized computers that provide on-line access to B-2 aircraft data and low observable analysis capabilities. Unique B-2 security and communication infrastructure needs are also addressed. \n\nThe B-2 Weapon System Support Center (WSSC) Ground Test Facility (GTF), located at Oklahoma Air Logistics Center, Tinker AFB, OK, supports two critical functions: aircraft software development and maintenance\/support, plus systems engineering support for the fielded weapon system. Software maintenance fixes to aircraft systems include flight controls, flight management, navigation systems, weapons\/armament and the defensive management system. These software fixes are accomplished and tested with the use of the WSSC software development system and integration\/test laboratory complex by analyzing and designing fixes to the existing aircraft software. The WSSC GTF also provides engineering support with specialized computer systems that provide online access to B-2 aircraft data. This data consists of items such as engineering and organic low observable analysis, manufacturing, aircraft design data used to help solve technical issues on the B-2. Locations where this data is used include Tinker AFB, Whiteman AFB, Wright-Patterson AFB, Northrop-Grumman in Palmdale, CA and forward operating locations (FOL).\n\nPE 0101313F - STRATEGIC WAR PLANNING SYSTEM - USSTRATCOM:\n\nINTEGRATED STRATEGIC PLANNING AND ANALYSIS NETWORK (ISPAN):  The mission of USSTRATCOM is to conduct global operations in coordination with other Combatant Commands, Services, and appropriate U.S. Government agencies to deter and detect strategic attacks against the U.S. and its allies.  It provides full-spectrum global strike, and coordinated space, missile defense, and information operations capabilities to meet both deterrent and decisive national security objectives.  USSTRATCOM will also provide operational space support, integrated missile defense, global command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR), and specialized planning expertise to the joint warfighter.  ISPAN enables USSTRATCOM to carry out these missions.  It is one of the DoD?s most complex, classified, computer-based, mission planning systems and the only national-level force planning system.\n\nThe ISPAN system is comprised of two independent but complementary planning systems; the Mission Planning and Analysis System (MPAS) and the Global Adaptive Planning Collaborative Information Environment (GAP-CIE).  MPAS is an automated information system to support Global Strike nuclear and conventional target development and weaponeering.  It includes mission planning, analysis, decision support tools and an enterprise database to sustain and support nuclear and conventional strategic war planning.  GAP CIE provides web-enabled adaptive planning, rapid distributed course of action development and global situational awareness supporting both contingency and crisis action planning.  As a system of systems, ISPAN enables an effects-based approach to planning and operations, cross domain information sharing, while serving multiple planning environments.\n\nThe ISPAN mission system infrastructure capabilities develop, verify, and produce Operational Plan 8010 and support the USSTRATCOM family of plans construct as well as current Concept of Operations.  It performs tasks ranging from creating and running courses of action on threat scenarios to providing data for developing bomber aircraft strike mission data in digital and hard copy formats.  The ISPAN planning system includes automated data processing equipment (ADPE), multiple networks, unique processes and procedures, software, training, associated deployable and distributed data processing nodes, a test\/development environment, and subsidiary systems.  The newly modernized system will migrate to the new USSTRATCOM Command and Control Facility.\n\nISPAN uses funding to implement a four-year life cycle replacement plan to procure required Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) hardware (e.g. servers, storage devices, workstations, peripherals and other network components).  Funding procures mission system infrastructure, architecture, and related support components.  This includes replenishment hardware and software for an operational capability lab environment to certify ISPAN applications for operational use.  In some instances the hardware must be combined with commercially available software to form unique planning and networking environments.  The program's life cycle hardware replacement plan follows industry standards and is used to eliminate the peaks and valleys associated with maintaining compatibility with the fast moving COTS hardware technology improvement cycle.  It also allows the program to better utilize existing manpower to install and configure the new hardware to provide an incremental and efficient update of critical infrastructure components as they become obsolete.  Hardware and software procured within the program is used to support all increments of the overarching ISPAN program.\nThe Strategic Command and Control (C2) program procures mission critical communications and computer systems required to ensure the United States has the capability for effective C2 of the New Triad (nuclear, conventional and missile defense). It procures hardware replacements\/upgrades to maintain the only computer systems that produce the Nation's nuclear war plan and performs conventional\/contingency war planning. \n\nPE 0303255F - COMMAND, CONTROL, COMMUNICATION AND COMPUTERS (C4) STRATCOM:\n\nNUCLEAR PLANNING AND EXECUTION SYSTEM (NPES): NPES is the single, survivable national C2 automated information system (AIS) supporting the President, Secretary of Defense, Joint Staff, and nuclear Combatant Commanders in the transition\/post phases of nuclear conflict. The requirement includes NPES communication systems and operational server integration with fixed command centers, distributed sites, and mobile platforms (USNORTHCOM's Mobile Consolidated Command Center, Navy E-6B Airborne National Command Post, Air Force E-4B National Airborne Operations Center). NPES is a joint program with the Air Force assigned lead service responsibilities. Programmed funds support the integration of an upgraded communication interface, new test suites, and deployable ruggedized prototypes for the mobile platforms. They also support the technical refresh of all NPES fixed and mobile sites and the migration of them into a net centric environment. \n\nC2 MODERNIZATION: USSTRATCOM and Air Force Space Command C2 modernization programs provide the infrastructure and hardware to acquire, process, and deliver information, as needed, to enhance decision making. This employs a set of underlying information services, technologies, and tools that enable the Commander of USSTRATCOM to achieve the broad operational warfighting capabilities described in the 2002 Unified Command Plans (UCP) with changes 1 and 2.  The USSTRATCOM's C2 modernization program adds capability as it builds to a final architecture. The cyber architecture is a collection of distributed databases and applications, integrated through a grid of supporting services. In addition to C2 Modernization, Nuclear Deterrence Operations activities\/funding are included within the scope of this effort. \n\nFORCE SURVIVABILITY, ANALYSIS, AND MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (FSAM):  FSAM is a decision support system and is designed to provide the commander with Force Management (pre attack) and Force Survival (post attack) information needed to ensure survival of strategic forces. FSAM provides the commander vital decision making data by correlating strategic force status reported by Force Status Reporting (FSR) with missile attack warning information. FSAM replaces the Force Management\/Force Survival capabilities of the  Strategic Threat Analysis and Reporting System (STARS). Processing and Display Subsystem - Migration (PDS-M) will continue to provide the commander with missile attack warning information. There is no change to this effort.\n\nDISTRIBUTIVE COMMAND AND CONTROL NODE (DC2N): The Combatant Commander's DC2N program provides contingency reconstitution and continuity of national command capabilities to accomplish directed Combatant Commander missions in the event primary C2 facilities are incapacitated. Funding will procure COTS backbone network components; satellite, line-of-sight and terrestrial communications systems; message distribution system components; battle staff work station components; and High Altitude Electromagnetic Pulse (HEMP) protection for both ground and maritime sites\/nodes. Replacement components and spare parts will ensure COTS products remain fully mission capable and technologically current (within the manufacturer recommended end of life cycle). The Data Federation & Synchronization (DF&S) backup server effort will purchase capabilities that will reside throughout undisclosed locations. This is in cooperation with DISA and OSD Policy.\n\nUSSTRATCOM Replacement Facility Fit-Out: USSTRATCOM is tasked with the vital roles of strategic deterrence, space operations, and cyberspace operations in our nation's defense. Nuclear, space, and network command and control operations require secure and survivable infrastructure. The facility must include secure High-Altitude Electromagnetic Pulse (HEMP) Shielded Command and Control Center, mainframe computer data centers, multiple 24\/7 mission operations centers, storage and maintenance areas, labs\/workrooms, back-up generators, Uninterruptible Power Source, Technical Control Facility, Fiber Ring."
