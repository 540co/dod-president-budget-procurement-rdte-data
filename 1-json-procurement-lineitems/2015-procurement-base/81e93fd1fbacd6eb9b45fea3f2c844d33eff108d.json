The MMTS facilitates fabrication, repair, and modifications of metallic and nonmetallic parts, and supports metalworking shop activities.  The MMTS supplements the Metal Working & Machining Shop Set (MWMSS) by providing an authorized set of hand tools and personal protective equipment necessary for the 91E Soldier to conduct the full spectrum of welding and machining operations.The set consists of a tool box and 33 tools (i.e. gauges, calipers, rulers, hammer, punches, etc.). Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) for MMTS is 2449.\n\n\nThe Load Bank System Tactical Electric Power (TEP) maintenance equipment enables units to properly maintain equipment and perform the mandatory maintenance operations as well as perform diagnostics and post-verification testing on all small and medium tactical generators (2 to 75 kw) which enable readiness of weapons systems.  This equipment allows soldiers to properly and adequately maintain reliable systems that meet Soldier safety, supportability, and mobility requirements, thereby reducing the risk to the warfighter.\n\n\nThe Load Bank System is a key maintenance enabler for the Tactical Electric Power (TEP) generator sets. TEP generator sets provide power to critical life saving operations such as field hospitals that provide medical support to combat wounded soldiers, satellite and land communication systems to communicate with soldiers in convoys and foot patrols, Tactical Operation Centers and various soldier life support operations. The Load Bank is a critical maintenance tool for TEP generators. It is a soldier-portable system required for performing diagnostics, repairs and post verification testing on all small and medium tactical generators of the Army's tactical fleet. Load Banks are required to: verify the generator can provide clean uninterrupted  power output without electrical fluctuations which can injure soldiers and damage Army equipment, perform accurate diagnostic, repair, scheduled maintenance, troubleshooting and post repair performance verification testing; verify that small and medium generator sets can provide 100% of rated power output; allows maintainers to 'burn out' fuel\/carbon accumulations due to under-loading the generator set for extended periods. The capability that Load Banks provide to load test generator sets is an essential function that Army maintenance units require to support combat and peacetime operations. This is an Army requirement expressed in generator set field level maintenance technical manuals. There is a recognized Table of Equipment (TOE)\/Modified TOE (MTOE) requirement for TEP generator sets. Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) for Load Bank System Tactical Electric Power (TEP) is 774."

            "val": "FY15 Base funding in the amount of $2.789 million will procure 489 Measuring Machinist Tool Sets, and 96 Load Bank System Tactical Electric Power (TEP).  The maintenance equipment is essential for units to properly maintain equipment and perform the mandatory maintenance operations and perform diagnostic testing which maintains the readiness of weapons systems. This equipment allows soldiers to properly and adequately maintain vehicles and systems. Properly maintained systems perform at maximum capability, with improved safety and reduced risk to the warfighter. This equipment supports combat operations, Army Force Regeneration and unit Mission Essential Task List (METL) requirements. Army modularity requires reliable systems that support soldier safety, supportability, and mobility requirements. SKOT systems require continuous review, revision, and upgrades to support modularity requirements.\n\nIn accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities."
