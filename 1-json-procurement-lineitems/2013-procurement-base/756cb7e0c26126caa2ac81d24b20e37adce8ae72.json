            "val": "These physical security vehicles are specialized commercial design vehicles that are armored to meet specific threat conditions within the guidelines\/requirements established by the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Special Operations and Low Intensity Conflict (SOLIC) for Heavy Armored Vehicles (HAV). These vehicles provide inconspicuous protection and transportation for U.S. personnel and cargo in high threat areas, such as Europe, Korea, and Southwest Asia.  The level of armor is in accordance with the nature and type of threat in the area of use.  These vehicles are heavy duty passenger vehicles and are utilized by General Officers, dignitaries, embassy personnel, and other servicemen requiring protection.  These vehicles are essential for protecting lives.  Heavy Armored Sedan is a vehicle replacement program that does not have a set Approved Acquisition Objective (AAO).  Procurements are made when requirements arise based on threat conditions or when existing vehicles need to be replaced due to unserviceable condition or over-age and over-mileage status. Although there are no costs reflected in FY2013 to FY2017, this is a continuing program that will have replacement requirements in future years."
