            "val": "The MK-19 Mod 3 is a self-powered, air-cooled, 40mm automatic grenade machine gun capable of a firing rate of 325-375 rounds per minute.  It is used to engage point targets up to 1,500 meters and provide suppressive fire at ranges up to 2,200 meters.  Since the initial fielding of the MK-19, various system enhancements have been identified that further improve the system by increasing operational capabilities and improving reliability, readiness, maintainability, and safety.  These improvements include a lightweight adjustable sight bracket; a weapon-sight bracket interface; improved firing pin sear with modified firing pin; an adjustable secondary drive lever; a Tactical Engagement Simulator (TES) to support Force-on-Force Training; and improved sighting systems that enhance accuracy of the system.  The MK-19 is fielded with the MK93 mount.  The weapon is mounted on select Stryker vehicles, High Mobility Multi-Purpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWVs), the M113 Armored Personnel Carrier family of vehicles, M88A1 Recovery Vehicle and Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles.  During static defensive operations it is ground employed utilizing the M3 or XM205 Tripod Mount."
