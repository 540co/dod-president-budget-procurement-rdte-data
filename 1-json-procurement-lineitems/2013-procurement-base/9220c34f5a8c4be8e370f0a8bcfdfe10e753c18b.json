        "Description": {
            "val": "The Digital Topographic Support System (DTSS) provides digital terrain analysis and map updates to commanders and weapons platforms in support of mission planning (e.g., imagery exploitation, Cover and Concealment, other Intelligence Preparation Battlespace (IPB)), rehearsal (e.g., 3D fly through, simulations) and execution (e.g., Common Operating Picture, route planning). The DTSS automates terrain analysis and visualization, data base development, updates, management, dissemination, and graphics reproduction. The Combat Terrain Information Systems (CTIS) Modernization Plan emphasizes the development of a combined, integrated, tactically deployable, fully autonomous terrain analysis and graphics reproduction capability. CTIS consists of the Digital Topographic Support System-Light (DTSS-L) (High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV)), DTSS-Deployable (DTSS-D), DTSS-Base (DTSS-B) and the High Volume Map Production (HVMP) equipment. The DTSS-L is a highly mobile sheltered system which is capable of supporting a full range of military operations, as well as peacetime stability and support operations. The DTSS-D provides a Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) configuration in transit cases that is capable of operating all of the terrain analysis software. The DTSS-D consists of transportable workstations and peripherals that can be set up to augment the tactical configurations. The DTSS-D does not include tactically deployable shelters and vehicles or tactical communications. The DTSS-B was procured in response to an initiative to develop the capability to generate terrain information over sparsely mapped areas to support contingency, mission rehearsal and training operations. The DTSS-B is designed to augment National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) capabilities at the Echelons above Corps (EAC) level by providing quick response data generation, special purpose mapping, and terrain analysis. The DTSS-B includes a component that is capable of handling National Technical Means (NTM) information in a secure environment. The HVMP provides a tactical capability to rapidly reproduce large volumes of digital topographic materiel. HVMP is capable of reproducing information from a variety of digital and hardcopy sources via direct digital interfaces. Additionally, an institutional training classroom environment for all DTSS configurations has been delivered to the NGA School of Geospatial-Intelligence (TSG)(formerly the Defense Mapping School). TSG provides critical MOS specific training on the operation of CTIS developed systems. CTIS systems operate within the Battle Command System architecture and are deployed from Brigade through EAC, Stryker Brigades and Special Forces Groups."
