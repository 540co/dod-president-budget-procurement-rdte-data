            "val": "The Improved Target Acquisition System (ITAS) is a combat proven system that provides long-range, lethal anti-armor and precision assault fires capability for Active Component and Army National Guard Infantry Brigade Combat Teams (IBCT) and Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (SBCT) across the spectrum of contemporary operational environments. ITAS is a replacement for the Light Infantry's TOW 2 weapon system, and it provides the capability to defeat armored vehicles, bunkers, and buildings at extended ranges in all battlefield conditions. Far Target Locator (cut into production in FY 2006) adds a GPS based position and attitude determination subsystem to ITAS, enabling the system to generate a 10 digit grid coordinate of a target location. ITAS is integrated into the Stryker Anti-Tank Guided Missile (ATGM) vehicle of the SBCT anti-tank company. ITAS's superior surveillance capability also enables the soldier to shape the battlefield by detecting targets at long range and either engaging with TOW missiles or other weapon systems to destroy those targets. ITAS is replacing all of the United States Marine Corps (USMC) ground TOW systems, and it has been sold to FMS customers. Canada and Portugal have purchased ITAS for their forces. ITAS continues to be the weapon of choice in precision combat engagements in Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF)."
