It sustains Army production test capabilities through upgrade and replacement of instrumentation and equipment that is technologically and\/or economically obsolete.  Modernization of test instrumentation and equipment provides increased automation and efficiencies, improved data quality and quantity and cost avoidances to Army Program Managers.  Programmed funding will be used to upgrade or replace production test instrumentation and equipment at Aberdeen Test Center (ATC), Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD; and Yuma Proving Ground (YPG), Yuma, AZ including YPGs Cold Regions Test Center (CRTC), Fort Greely, AK."

        "Justification": {
            "val": "FY13 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $2.412 million support the following:  At ATC, procures modern industrial shop equipment (welding and cutting machines) used in fabrication of support items required for Production Qualification Testing (such as rotors, stands, sleighs, camera mounts and instrumentation brackets); automated systems with laser scanning capability for physical measurements of subsystems and parts for comparison against engineering design and tolerances; replacement of old surveying equipment with modern digital systems used for surveying test sites; engineering analysis instruments used to examine material properties and failure regions of weapons components to identify material shortfalls; replacement human factors instrumentation for assessing soldier-machine interface; replacement Chemistry lab equipment (such as Mass Spectrometers) used in analyzing hazardous wastes and emissions from test items and non-destructive laboratory instrumentation and equipment used to test exotic materials being used in the design and fabrication of military systems such as ceramics, composites, and polymers.  At YTC, procures replacement transducers used to collect performance data during automotive tests (including sensors, load cells, thermocouple amplifiers, pressure transducers, embedded wireless sensors, strain gages, current transducers and thermocouples); and Improved Vehicle Tracking System (IVTS) boxes that provide the capability to track airdrop parachute systems in a real-time situation to support air delivery testing. The majority of the instrumentation being upgraded or replaced is obsolete and has met or exceeded its economic life.  This instrumentation is required to ensure complete and accurate test data is collected and safety and environmental hazards are minimized.  Benefits of this project include increased test efficiencies and decreased costs and risks to Army Program Managers."
