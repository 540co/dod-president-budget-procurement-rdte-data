In order to efficiently perform our audit reviews, it is essential that DCAA auditors be provided with equipment and software that are compatible with defense contractors\u2019 information technology systems, that provide access to the Agency\u2019s Management Information System and to the Internet for researching audit issues, and that provide the capability to securely electronically transmit and receive audit documents.  In addition, up-to-date equipment is needed to satisfy the hardware\/software\/communication requirements for Information Assurance compliance as well as to interface with a variety of DoD standard systems such as:  Defense Business Management System (DBMS), Defense Civilian Personnel Data System (DCPDS), Defense Civilian Pay System (DCPS), Defense Property Accountability System (DPAS), Defense Travel System (DTS), Program Budget and Accounting System (PBAS), and the Standard Procurement System (SPS).  Procurement funds will be applied to the continued upgrading of DCAA\u2019s Integrated Information Network automation efforts.\n\nFY 2011\nDCAA Integrated Information Network. ($1.469 million)  In FY 2011, funding in the amount of $633,000 is required to support the Agency\u2019s communication projects involving access to DoD standard systems and to the Internet and World Wide Web.  Funding in the amount of $760,000 is required for the replacement of local area network servers that have reached the end of their useful systems life.  The components will replace those that are technologically obsolete and no longer capable of running current applications software or that are non-operational and the cost to repair exceeds the cost to replace.  Funding in the amount of $76,000 is required to replace 1\/3 of the Agency's printers and other system peripherals that have become technologically obsolete and the cost to repair exceeds the cost to replace. \n\nFY 2012\nDCAA Integrated Information Network. ($1.473 million)  In FY 2012, funding in the amount of $626,000 is required to support the Agency\u2019s communication projects involving access to DoD standard systems and to the Internet and World Wide Web.  Funding in the amount of $587,000 is required for the replacement of local area network servers that have reached the end of their useful systems life.  The components will replace those that are technologically obsolete and no longer capable of running current applications software or that are non-operational and the cost to repair exceeds the cost to replace.  Funding in the amount of $260,000 is required to replace 1\/3 of the Agency's printers and other system peripherals that have become technologically obsolete and the cost to repair exceeds the cost to replace.\n \nFY 2013\nDCAA Integrated Information Network. ($1.486 million)  In FY 2013, funding in the amount of $686,000 is required to support the Agency\u2019s communication projects involving access to DoD standard systems and to the Internet and World Wide Web.  Funding in the amount of $600,000 is required for the replacement of local area network servers that have reached the end of their useful systems life.  The components will replace those that are technologically obsolete and no longer capable of running current applications software or that are non-operational and the cost to repair exceeds the cost to replace.
