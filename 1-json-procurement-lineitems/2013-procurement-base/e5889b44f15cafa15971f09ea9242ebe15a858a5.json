The device transforms a Truck Tractor into an evacuation vehicle capable of recovery, lift-towing or flat-towing another disabled truck.  It is capable of lift-towing 30,000 pounds. It also provides a unit the capability to recover vehicles without the use of a wrecker, especially in Line Haul missions. It provides worldwide service to evacuate, tow, and deliver, and has limited recovery capability.  When the FWTD is not in use, it can be dismounted and the tractor can perform its normal trailer-towing mission. \n\nApproved Acquisition Objective (AA0) has been met at 106."
