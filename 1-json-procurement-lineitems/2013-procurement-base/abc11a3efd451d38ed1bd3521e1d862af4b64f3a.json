These assets support the warfighter's ability to deploy rapidly and immediately provide the positive command and control required. This support includes contingency and crisis communications for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Combatant Commands, Services, Defense agencies, non-Defense agencies, and foreign governments. The modernization program goals include meeting emerging real-world operational requirements with improved capabilities, smaller footprint, reduced operations and maintenance costs, and seamless integration with the global information grid. Per Defense Planning Guidance (DPG), the Army is mandated to fund 1\/3rd fair share of JCSE's validated equipment modernization plan."

Current employed commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) EOIP and satellite terminal equipment are approaching the end of their 6-year lifecycle and need to be replaced. The Phase 1 EOIP equipment requires replacement, along with technology refreshment, to meet evolving war fighter requirements. The program through FY16 is phased to accomplish lifecycle replacement and technology refresh of the multiple systems as they reach end of life. We will establish the GIG Convergence Master Plan (GCMP) as the mechanism to govern all DISA-provided capabilities, services, and technical solutions and provide a roadmap for future capabilities and innovation."
