            "val": "NOTE:  Beginning in FY 2012, a new Underwater Systems P-1 line item was established to reflect the command\u2019s new Undersea Mobility Acquisition Strategy.  FY 2012 resources were moved from the following P-1 line items: Maritime Equipment, SEAL Delivery Vehicle and Maritime Equipment Modifications.\n\nThe Underwater Systems line item procures dry and wet combat submersibles, technology insertions for the SEAL Delivery Vehicle (SDV) fleet, and modifications and field changes to the Dry Deck Shelter (DDS). Acquisition programs of record that will continue are the Shallow Water Combat Submersible program, technology upgrades for the current SDV and modifications to the current DDS.  Shallow Water Combat Submersible (SWCS) Block 1 is the next generation free-flooding combat submersible that transports Special Operations Forces (SOF) personnel and their combat equipment in hostile waters for a variety of missions.  The SWCS Block II will be the next evolution which is planned to consist of a dry combat submersibles.  SOF units require specialized underwater systems that improve their warfighting capability and survivability in harsh operating environments. Other examples of underwater systems and maritime equipment include, but may not be limited to underwater navigation, diving equipment, and underwater propulsion systems.   \n\nSystems and equipment are used in the conduct of infiltration\/extraction, reconnaissance, beach obstacle clearance, and other missions. The capabilities of submersible systems and unique equipment provides small, highly trained forces the ability to successfully engage the enemy and conduct operations associated with SOF maritime missions. The associated RDT&E funds are in Program Element 1160483BB."

            "val": "1. DDS. The DDS is a certified diving system that attaches to modified host submarines. Program provides certification, field changes, and minor modifications for the DDS.\n\nFY 2013 PROGRAM JUSTIFICATION:  Funds minor modification efforts and field changes to the current class of DDS.  Funding continues engineering design, fabrication, assembly, acceptance, and testing for field change kits.\n\n2. SDV.  The SDV is a small battery-powered, free-flooding combat submersible that transports SOF personnel and their combat equipment in hostile waters. This program corrects sustainability and maintainability issues within subsystems in response to obsolescence of imbedded commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) electronics hardware and software.\n\nFY 2013 PROGRAM JUSTIFICATION:  Continue technology refresh and electronic upgrades for SDV fleet.  Example of items required include, but are not limited to, improved sonar systems, increased battery performance, additional power display unit ports, upgraded navigation and communications systems, and migration of Command Display Unit software\/architecture to a Service Oriented Architecture.\n\n3.  SWCS.  The Shallow Water Combat Submersible (SWCS) Block 1 is the replacement for the SEAL Delivery Vehicle.  SWCS Block 1 is the next generation free-flooding combat submersible that transports SOF personnel and their combat equipment in hostile waters for a variety of missions.  This is the first year of funds for the replacement system and provides long-lead materials and subsystems required for SWCS Block 1 that will include the SWCS vehicle, trailer, system equipment comprised of mission support equipment, a pack up kit, and transportation and handling equipment.  The Shallow Water Combat Submersible Block II will be the next evolution which is planned to consist of a family of dry combat submersibles.  \n\nFY2013 PROGRAM JUSTIFICATION:  Purchases long-lead materials for two vehicles, trailers, and government furnished equipment."
