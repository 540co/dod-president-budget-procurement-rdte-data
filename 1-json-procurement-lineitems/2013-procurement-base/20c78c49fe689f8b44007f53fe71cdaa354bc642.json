            "val": "The Enhanced Manpack Ultra High Frequency (UHF) Terminal (i.e., EMUT and also known as Spitfire\/Shadowfire) program replaces the existing inventory of single channel Satellite Communications (SATCOM) radios to add embedded Communications Security  (COMSEC) and Demand Assigned Multiple Access (DAMA) capability to support all DoD, Special Operations Forces and other Agencies.  The Spitfire\/Shadowfire is a small, lightweight manpack radio that provides the reach-back capability between the forward deployed force and the Continental United States sustaining base required to support power projection.  The Joint Staff has mandated that all Ultra High Frequency (UHF) satellite manpack terminals are secure and have DAMA capability.  The Army has designated the Spitfire\/Shadowfire terminal as the standard UHF Satellite Terminal for the current force.  The Spitfire\/Shadowfire possesses the UHF DAMA capability which allows more efficient use of limited satellite resources.  Additionally, the Spitfire\/Shadowfire Terminal has been selected to provide Narrowband Range Extension of both voice and data to Mobile Tactical Vehicles.  The unique Narrowband Range Extension capability, through the SATCOM-On-The-Move (SOTM) functionality, allows extension of both voice and data to occur in moving vehicular platforms (versus stationary).  This system supports the Stryker Brigade Combat Team (SBCT).  This program is considered a DoD Space Program.\n\nAll funding supports Active component."
