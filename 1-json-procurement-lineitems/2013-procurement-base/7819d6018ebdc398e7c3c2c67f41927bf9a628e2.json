Approximately 100 BASs in Post Production Software Support (PPSS) directly depend on LCSE support to maintain a posture of mission critical readiness.  LCSE system support and services are essential to maintain BASs in the state of operational readiness.  Policy for Post Production Software Support (PPSS) requires that system managers provide initial host capabilities for new systems and that the Life Cycle Software Engineering Centers (LCSEC) provide upgrades and replacement of obsolete equipment.  Significant portions of host and network equipment are no longer economically repairable and\/or are reaching obsolescence.  There is a requirement to respond to emergency requests from the field for Software Engineering support, in order to maintain operational readiness of deployed BASs.  With host computers and peripherals having a life span of approximately five years and SEC performing its mission over a continuous period of time beyond five years, equipment must be replaced and\/or upgraded regularly to deal with obsolescence and take advantage of the continual improvements in technology that are indigenous to high-technology based weapon systems and their software support environments.  SEC must purchase these items to meet systems mission requirements."
