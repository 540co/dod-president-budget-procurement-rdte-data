Capability provides increased air carrier survivability; ground accuracy; standoff delivery; and improved effectiveness and assessment feedback for airdrop missions.  JPADS family consists of end items and support to include Mission Planners (laptops with airdrop mission planning software ), and variants based on gross rigged weight to include the 2K System.\n\nUnderwater Reconnaissance Capability (URC) $2.583M - Overarching Family of Systems which sustains\/enhances\/supports capabilities of current and future combatant diving systems to include Combat Rubber Reconnaissance Craft (CRRC), Underwater Breathing Apparatus, Combatant Diver Full Face Mask, Waterproof Bag System, Expeditionary Hyperbaric Chamber System, and the Non-gasoline Burning Outboard Engine in support of MAGTF expeditionary operations.\n\nFY12 Base Appropriation Request:  $5.5M\nFamily of Raid\/Recon Equipment (FRRE) $3.253M - Roll-up line with multiple specialized raid projects encompassing the close quarter battle ensemble used in various Marine units and parachuting equipment used for reconnaissance in support of MAGTF operations.  Includes kits, component sets, ancillary equipment and support which will provide integration to warfighting concepts of the 21st century.  Program will enhance the means to systemize equipment and increase combat multipliers, survivability, durability and functionality over that of the current inventory items.\n\nJoint Precision Air Drop System (JPADS)  $0.693M - Parachute delivery system consists of a decelerator (parachute) guided by an Autonomous Guidance Unit attached to a Container Delivery System that interfaces with cargo aircraft for autonomous delivery of airborne cargo from high altitudes and lateral separation to predetermined small drop zone.  Capability provides increased air carrier survivability; ground accuracy; standoff delivery; and improved effectiveness and assessment feedback for airdrop missions.  JPADS family consists of end items, component pieces and support to include Mission Planners (laptops with airdrop mission planning software) and variants based on gross rigged weight to include the 10K System.   Program completes in FY12 for all procurement systems.\n\nUnderwater Reconnaissance Capability (URC)  $1.587M - Overarching Family of Systems which sustains\/enhances\/supports capabilities of current and future combatant diving systems to include CRRC, Underwater Breathing Apparatus, Combatant Diver Full Face Mask, Waterproof Bag System, Expeditionary Hyperbaric Chamber System, and the Non-gasoline Burning Outboard Engine in support of MAGTF expeditionary operations.\n\nFY13 Base Appropriation Request:  $13.1M\nFamily of Raid\/Recon Equipment (FRRE)  $3.288M - Roll-up line with multiple specialized raid projects encompassing the close quarter battle ensemble used in various Marine units and parachuting equipment used for reconnaissance in support of MAGTF operations.
