This program enables procurement of equipment essential to the efficiency and economy of storage\/packaging operations, maximizes and improves the utilization of manpower, cubic storage space, and provides timely support for deployment actions.\n\nGarrison Mobile Engineer Equipment (GMEE) - Funds in this line provide for the procurement of centrally managed GMEE for United States Marine Corps Bases and Stations.  This replacement has been developed on an as-required basis because most commercial engineer construction equipment exceeds life expectancy.  The procurement source is Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP).\n\nMaterial Handling Equipment (MHE) (Bases and Stations) - Funds in this line provide for the replacement of centrally managed forklifts, warehouse cranes, and platform trucks.  This replacement program has been developed on an as-required basis because most commercial MHE exceeds life expectancies developed and promulgated by Department of Defense (DOD) directives.\n\nFY2011 Base Appropriation Request: procures multiple variants of Material Handling Equipment and Garrison Mobile Engineering Equipment, provides Command Support Equipment and supports Warehouse Modernization.\n\nFY2012 Base Appropriation Request: procures multiple variants of Material Handling Equipment and Garrison Mobile Engineering Equipment, provides Command Support Equipment and supports Warehouse Modernization.\n\nFY2013 Base Appropriation Request: procures multiple variants of Material Handling Equipment and Garrison Mobile Engineering Equipment, provides Command Support Equipment and supports Warehouse Modernization."

Without this funding, mission critical items will not be available to meet recurring and unexpected operations as they arise.\n\nFY13 Base Appropriation Request - $352K Warehouse Modernization - FY13 Warehouse Modernization funds will continue providing procurement of essential equipment used to increase efficiency, maximize economy of storage and improve total warehouse operations. Without these funds, the utilization of excessive manpower will increase, cubic space will continue to be unutilized, and timely support for deployed units will decrease drastically.\n\nFY13 Base Appropriation Request - $3,802K Garrison Mobile Engineer Equipment (GMEE)- FY13 funding will procure various pieces of GMEE items (road grader, scoop loader\/backhoe, bulldozer, land fill compactor, sewer\/septic cleaner, warehouse\/runway sweeper and industrial tractor).  Failure to provide funds will result in increased maintenance cost of limited local O&MMC funds due to increased utilization and extended operational life.  Operating maintenance intense and over-aged equipment increases the risk for potential component failure and unsafe operating condition.\n\nFY13 Base Appropriation Request - $6,859K Material Handling Equipment (MHE) (Bases and Stations) - FY13 funding will procure various pieces of MHE items (forklifts - fuel and electric 3K - 93K lbs, stock selectors and warehouse cranes).
