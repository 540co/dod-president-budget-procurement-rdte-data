Vehicles also provide transportation for over 24,000 CAP cadets to support execution of the Aerospace Education and Cadet Program missions as directed by 36 U.S.C Section 403, 10 U.S.C.

CAPs vehicle fleet (all passenger vehicles) includes vans, sedans, trucks, and SUVs.  Vehicle procurements are also a critical element in supporting CAP Cadet and Aerospace education programs as CAP encourages and develops by example the voluntary contribution of private citizens to the public welfare.  Various types of vehicles are used to transport cadets and search & rescue\/disaster relief ground teams.\n\nItems requested in FY13 are a continuing requirement, are identified on the following P-40A, and are representative of items to be procured.
