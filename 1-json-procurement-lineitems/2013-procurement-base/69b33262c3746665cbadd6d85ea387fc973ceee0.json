The equipment supports training for intelligence officers, geospatial analysts, targeteers, operations analysts, linguists, network analysts, all communications (except communications security) and electronic intelligence analysts, and intelligence system maintainers.  The systems support intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance applications, and the major focus of this program is to support functional training on the newest generation of intelligence systems with an emphasis on computer-based training systems through modeling and simulation.  This equipment is essential for preparing military intelligence personnel to support warfighting commanders.  The equipment supports intelligence training for AF personnel and members of all DoD services at Goodfellow AFB, TX."

GOODFELLOW INTELLIGENCE TRAINING ARCHITECTURE (GITA) UPGRADE:  The GITA upgrade encompasses consolidation of the unclassified and classified training networks at Goodfellow AFB.  All current intelligence training equipment, including Intelligence Training Architecture (ITA) and other legacy intelligence training systems, will be incorporated in GITA. The FY13 funds procure specific infrastructure upgrades for the replacement of servers, and increased storage capacity for required intelligence training systems that support intelligence initial skills and advanced skills training courses.  The increased student throughput for Linguists and Intelligence Analysts required this upgrade and increase of servers\/data storage.  These funds also support the development of the enterprise architecture, which consolidates multiple networks and systems into an integrated GITA.  The FY13 funds will also procure additional hardware for modernizing interactive courseware development labs, workstations supporting scenario based exercise training, and servers and network equipment needed to support software used in the field and combatant commands.  Funding for this program is in program element 0804733F.\n\nItems requested in FY13 are identified on the following P-40A and are \nrepresentative of items to be procured. Items procured during execution may change based on critical equipment needed to support current Air Force mission requirements."
