            "val": "The AN\/TMQ-52 Meteorological Measuring Set-Profiler (MMS-P) uses a ground tactical meteorological (TACMET) sensor and Meteorological (MET) data from communication satellites along with an advanced weather model to provide highly accurate MET data covering an operational area of 500 kilometers with a tested range of 60 kilometers. Profiler provides MET information such as wind speed, wind direction, temperature, pressure, humidity, rate of precipitation, visibility, cloud height and cloud ceiling. All of these are required for precise targeting and terminal guidance. Profiler uses this information to build a four-dimensional MET model (height, width, depth and time) that includes terrain effects. By providing more accurate MET messages, Profiler will enable the artillery to have a greater probability of a first round hit with indirect fire systems. The new capabilities will increase the lethality of field artillery systems such as Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (MLRS), Paladin, and self-propelled or towed howitzers. In order to address hardware end-of-life issues, communications upgrades and software updates, Profiler will be retrofitted and upgraded to accommodate the latest hardware and software, as required, ensuring continued support of the mission.  \n\nAll funds support the Active component."
