            "val": "Bridge Boats (FY11 Base $12.524M): The Bridge Erection Boat (BEB) with trailer replaced the legacy MK II BEB. The BEB is designed to support wet gap bridging and amphibious operations. It may also be used as a general-purpose workboat in support of diving operations and maritime projects, for inland water patrols, and as a safety boat for amphibious river crossings. When used to ferry troops or cargo, it may safely transport a maximum of 15 fully equipped men or 4,400 pounds of cargo. In conjunction with the MK 18 Logistics Vehicle System (LVS) rear body unit a boat cradle is used to transport the boat.  A commercial boat trailer designed to tow the BEB behind the Medium Tactical Vehicle Replacement (MTVR) was also procured. The Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and Operating forces have identified issues related to the BEB and Boat cradle. The issues regarding Exhaust, Flapper and Insulation, Electrical Fan Bracket, Storage Bin, Cradle Kits, Fuel System, Swim Platform and Throttle Relocation have become severe enough to warrant modernization upgrades in the configuration of this peripheral equipment associated with the BEB and BEB engines.  The upgrade kit will be assembled at Marine Corps Maintenance Center Albany, GA (MCA) Maintenance Section and each kit will be packaged and shipped to the respective units with appropriate quantities and includes the Technical Data Package."
