Fiscal Year Defense Plan funding provides the required U.S. contribution for projects defined by the NATO Airborne Early Warning and Control (NAEWC) Board of Directors and approved by the U.S. government.  These projects include but are not limited to the NATO Mid-Term (NMT) project, the Large Aircraft Infrared Counter-Measures (LAIRCM) project, the Follow-on Upgrade I (FUP I) project, and future modernization projects.  The NMT project upgrades the mission computers, provides improved man-machine interfaces, Multi-Sensor Integration (MSI), digital communications, satellite communications, and adds 5 new consoles to the aircraft.  These Mid-Term projects will update the NATO E-3 aircraft with capabilities to maintain fleet operational effectiveness and interoperability well into the 21st century.  The LAIRCM project installs a self-defense capability into the NATO E-3 fleet enabling contingency operations, to include participation in the NATO Response Force (NRF), beyond NATO Area of Operations while continuing to maintain a level of security for the aircraft.  The FUP I project satisfies international airspace mandates for upgraded Communications Navigation Surveillance\/Air Traffic Management (CNS\/ATM) as well as transponder upgrades for Mode 5 and Enhanced Mode S.  Future efforts include but are not limited to FUP II efforts and other modernization projects.  These future projects will enable the aircraft to maintain interoperability, meet emerging military requirements and sustain the NATO fleet for the future needs of NATO."

The Air Mobility Command (AMC) Airlift and Air Refueling Mission Area Plans identified a deficiency in the ability to protect MAF aircraft from hostilities during combat operations.  To enhance mission safety during these combat operations, it is critical to provide aircrews with timely and essential off-board information.  Enabling real-time information in the cockpit allows mission adjustments in response to rapidly changing combat conditions while in-flight.  The airborne broadcast intelligence (ABI) and combat track II (CTII) systems provide real-time intelligence, situational awareness (national\/theater intelligence and displays air\/land\/blue water threats), beyond line-of-sight C2 data, and secure text messaging, which enable aircrews to receive updated threat and mission information.  To limit system implementation costs, ABI\/CTII are roll-on\/roll-off systems enabling immediate employment on all MAF aircraft.  Without real-time information and C2 communications in the cockpit, MAF aircraft will be forced to continue to operate without secure access to mission critical beyond line-of-sight C2 and situational\/threat awareness leaving them vulnerable to enemy threats and hostile actions.  These systems are interchangeable between all MAF aircraft."

The system also provides the capability to train aircrews in electronic warfare during joint-force training exercises.  In addition to the acquisition of the airborne subsystems, funding will also be used to purchase related airborne subsystems equipment such as peculiar support equipment and umbilicals and to purchase engineering, technical and operational services applicable to the acquisition, fielding and support of the airborne subsystems."

The RQ-4A is an imagery-intelligence (IMINT) RPA designed to employ 2000 pounds of payload. The RQ-4A has one configuration\nknown as the Block 10. The Block 10 employs an IMINT system comprised of a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensor and an electro-optical (EO)\/infrared (IR) sensor. These three sensors are called the integrated sensor suite\n(ISS). The RQ-4B RPA is designed to employ 3000 pounds of payload and enable multi-intelligence (multi-INT)collecting. The RQ-4B has three configurations: Block 20, Block 30, and Block 40. The Block 20 employs upgraded SAR and EO\/IR sensors known as the enhanced ISS (EISS) in an IMINT only configuration. The Block 30 employs the same EISS sensors as the Block 20 and also integrates a wide spectrum signals intelligence (SIGINT) sensor suite simultaneously to be used as a multi-INT platform. The Block 40 will only integrate the multi-platform radar technology insertion program (MP-RTIP) radar sensor. The user will ultimately determine the optimal quantities and payloads for each aircraft configuration based on operational requirements. The ground station (GS) includes the mission control element (MCE) and the launch and recovery element (LRE). The support segment includes aerospace ground equipment, tech orders, spares, support equipment, and training to enable the Global Hawk System.\n\nThis program has associated Research Development Test and Evaluation funding in PE 0305220F and PE 0304260F.\n\nNote:\nFY13 and Out: Sensor Depots standup is discontinued."

                        "val": "Advanced Targeting Pods (ATPs) provide long-range target acquisition and expanded weapon delivery envelopes for greater aircraft survivability.  ATPs feature an infrared (IR) sensor, charged coupled device television (CCD-TV), laser designator, eye-safe laser, laser spot tracker, infrared marker, and real-time video data link for connectivity with ground forces.   ATP capabilities, such as high resolution imagery, eye safe laser, high system reliability and smaller deployment footprint provide greater combat effectiveness across several mission areas, including suppression\/destruction of enemy air defenses (SEAD\/DEAD), precision air interdiction, close air support (CAS), non-traditional intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (NT-ISR), reconnaissance, and time-sensitive targeting.  This funding supports the production, qualification and integration of ATPs to include all activities necessary for fielding. It includes, but is not limited to, Advanced Targeting Pod (ATP) procurements, verification\/qualification testing and integration efforts, Interim Contractor Logistics (ICS) support, containers, site activations, technical data packages, depot standup and program management support. Laser Infrared Targeting and Navigating (LITENING) and Sniper are ATPs currently used by the active duty, Air National Guard (ANG), and Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC).  Advanced Targeting Pod - Sensor Enhancement (ATP-SE) is the next increment in ATP capability.  Low-Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infrared for Night (LANTIRN) and Pave Penny systems will be phased out as new ATP and ATP-SE systems are acquired.\n_____\nFY 2011 funding totals include $218.138M appropriated for Overseas Contingency Operations.\nFY 2012 funding totals include $23.0M appropriated for Overseas Contingency Operations. \n_____\nCurrent Production schedule\n\nLegacy Sniper:  \n - Lot 9 Buy 1, 20 Legacy Sniper Pods (FY09 funds) Awarded Sep 09, delivery Jul 11 - Jun 12.\n - Lot 9 Buy 2, 35 Legacy Sniper Pods (FY09 funds) Awarded Sep 09, delivery Jul 11 - June 12.\n\nLegacy LITENING:\n- Lot 2, 41 Legacy LITENING Pods (FY09 funds) Awarded Sep 10, delivery May 11 - April 12.\n\nATP SE:\n - Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) 1 Lot 1, 6 LITENING Pods, 6 Sniper Pods (FY10 funds) Awarded Sep 10, to be delivered Jan 12.
