            "val": "This line item provides funding to procure Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS) workstations, Software\/Production Engineering Support and Integrated Logistics Support (ILS).  JMPS is the Chief of Naval Operation's (CNO) designated automated mission planning system for the Navy.  JMPS enables weapon system employment by providing the information and decision aids needed to rapidly plan aircraft, weapon or sensor missions, load mission data into aircraft and weapons, and conduct post mission analysis.   JMPS consists of two types of  workstations - Maritime (JMPS-M) and Expeditionary (JMPS-E).  JMPS-M is the primary product within the Naval Mission Planning System (NavMPS).  The Navy's modern aircraft need data loaded from JMPS-M to fly their missions.  JMPS-M flight planning seats refer to the computer workstations that employ the JMPS framework software.  JMPS-E is a tailorable and collaborative web-based mission planning system for the Amphibious Ready Group (ARG) Amphibious Squadron (PHIBRON).  Program cost is not directly related to FY hardware quantity; software is a cost factor independent of FY hardware quantity and cost.  Funding profile accounts for required four year workstations refresh to preclude aging hardware, increased failure rates, emerging technology and increased memory requirements."

        "Justification": {
            "val": "Items to be funded in this line include:\n\nWorkstation Components - JMPS-M and JMPS-E procure tactical computer hardware through a non-developmental item acquisition strategy.  Tactical computer equipment is used to plan and analyze expeditionary missions and aircraft routes under various mission configurations and operational threat environments.  Primary outputs are tasking orders, courses of action (COAs), route plans, and mission essential data loads for mission execution.  New workstations consist of aircraft unique data transfer devices and interfaces, Memory Data Loader Receptacles (MDLR) Small Computer Standard Interface (SCSI) (MDLR-S), Data Storage Unit Receptacle SCSI (DSUR-S), network hubs, printers, fleet training school workstations and other peripheral devices for USN\/USNR\/USMC\/USMCR missions.  Legacy data loader receptacle failures in addition to computer interface obsolescence and an inability to influence airframe changes for legacy aircraft in sustainment, drive a need to obtain a new data loader using a more extensive interface.\n\nSoftware\/Production Engineering Support - The NavMPS program produces software releases via an evolutionary development process.  These releases contain enhancements based on fleet inputs and technology challenges.  They also contain changes required to retain compatibility with supported platforms, associated weapons, and threat and imagery databases providing input to NavMPS.  Software releases are independent of hardware buys.  Cost element includes production support services, engineering support services, independent verification and validation test and acceptance, site activation, and quality assurance efforts.\n\nIntegrated Logistics Support - Site surveys, prepare site installation drawings, on-site engineering and logistics evaluations for installations and delivery systems comply with the specified configuration.  This includes the production and delivery of technical documentation and training materials such as OPNOTES, installation instructions, user manuals required during the fielding of NavMPS products. ILS is a cost factor independent of FY hardware quantity and cost.\n\nFY11 provided funding to procure six hundred (600) JMPS-M flight planning seats and fifty-four (54) JMPS-E workstations, the continuation of enhancements of software releases based on fleet inputs, emerging technologies and associated logistics support.\n\nFY12 provides funding to procure seven hundred fifty (750) JMPS-M flight planning seats and fifty-three (53) JMPS-E workstations, the continuation of enhancements of software releases based on fleet inputs, emerging technologies and associated logistics support.\n\nFY13 provides funding to procure eight hundred fifty eight (858) JMPS-M flight planning seats, two hundred (200) JMPS-M fleet training school workstations and five (5) JMPS-E workstations, the continuation of enhancements of software releases based on fleet inputs, emerging technologies and associated logistics support."
