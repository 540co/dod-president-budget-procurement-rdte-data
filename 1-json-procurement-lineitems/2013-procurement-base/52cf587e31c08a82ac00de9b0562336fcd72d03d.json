Information from networked BAT-Clients will be sent to BAT-Servers.  The BAT-Servers will update other BAT-Servers and will provide information to the biometrics intelligence process for further analysis.  Funding procures printers, laptop computers and Client Suites to support the Biometric Automated Toolset System (BATS), which is a fully-fielded capability with a three-year refresh cycle.\n\nIntelligence Analysis System Mod (IAS) Family of Systems (FoS) provides intelligence support to Marines garrison, shipboard, and battlefield missions at all levels of the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF).  This support includes the formulation and\/or compilation of the commander's Priority Intelligence Requirements (PIR), Essential Elements of Information (EEI), and Other Intelligence Requirements (OIR); contingency planning; management of MAGTF collection assets; all-source intelligence analysis, briefing support, intelligence product fusion, production, reporting dissemination and training.  The IAS FoS has proven to be the All-Source Fusion Center that provides interoperable scalable, semi-automated capabilities to receive, process, analyze, display and disseminate all-source intelligence, including imagery, to support timely tactical decision-making across MAGTF.\n\nFY11 Overseas Contingency Operations Request (OCO):\nBATS: $2.695M This funding procured 335 Printers, Laptop computers and Client Suites to support Biometric Automated Toolset System (BATS).  BATS is a fully fielded capability with a three-year refresh cycle.  This funding refreshed Badge Printers and Client Suites for the MAGTF Integrated Systems Training Center (MISTC) supporting Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF).\n\nIAS: $.650M: The FY11 OCO supports the IAS Tier 1 MEF IAS refresh new equipment training.\n\nFY12 Overseas Contingency Operations Request (OCO):\nBATS: $2.331M The FY12 OCO funding procures printers, laptop computers and Client Suites and Servers to support the Biometric Automated Toolset System (BATS) for forces in OEF, as well as refresh both Badge Printers and Client Suites for the MAGTF Integrated Systems Training Center (MISTC) supporting Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF).\n\nFY13 Baseline Request:\nBATS: $2.831M The FY13 Baseline funding will procure printers, laptop computers and Client Suites and Servers to support the Biometric Automated Toolset System (BATS), as well as refresh both Badge Printers and Client Suites for the MAGTF Integrated Systems Training Center (MISTC).\n\nFY13 Overseas Contingency Operations Request (OCO):\nBATS: $2.831M The FY13 OCO funding will procure additional printers, laptop computers and Client Suites and Servers to support the Biometric Automated Toolset System (BATS) for forces in OEF.  Funding also provides for the initial support by the Biometrics Systems Analysts (BSA's) in theater, whose responsibilities are training users on new equipment fielded, ensuring 24\/7 \"help-desk\" support to the users, and providing the logistics support for the myriad system components."
