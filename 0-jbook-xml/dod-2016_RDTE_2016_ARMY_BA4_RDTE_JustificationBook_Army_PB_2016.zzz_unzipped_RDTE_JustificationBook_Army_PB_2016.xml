F. Major Performer 

Work is currently being performed under the COSMIC Contract Vehicle.  The two primes awarded work under COSMIC are BAE Systems (W91260-06-D-0005) and Quantum Research International (QRI) (W91260-06-D-0006).  All Task Orders under COSMIC are competed between the two prime contractors.  Beginning in FY16 efforts may be competed under the Design, Development Demonstration and Integration (D3I) contract scheduled to be awarded in late FY16.

QRI, as a Prime on contract W91260-06-D-0006, along with its team of sub-contractors, is responsible for the development of software to support integration of new tracking data services into the J-FFT and support special tracking capabilities.  This ensures 24/7 J-FFT data is available to support Combatant Commanders as coalition forces and technology change.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) provides for the Concept Exploration and Refinement of a Deep-Range employed Networked Obstacle.  This PE develops alternatives to the aging inventory of the Family of Scatterable Mines systems.

Project 606 enables component development of improved counter explosive hazard systems that focus on detecting, marking, and neutralizing mines and improvised explosive devices (IED).  These capabilities will enhance the effectiveness of the Route Clearance Platoon within the Engineer Company, the Brigade Combat Team as well as other related Army missions.  

Project EK7 Area Denial Capability Development will evaluate integrated technologies and prototype systems in a realistic operating environment to expedite technology transition for a Deep-Range employed Networked Obstacle that denies the enemy terrain and freedom of action while allowing friendly forces to maneuver freely within the same battlespace.  Area Denial Capability Development provides Man-in-the-Loop (MITL) controlled scalable effects against mounted and dismounted enemy forces that disrupt, turn, fix or block their ability to maneuver.  Area Denial Capability Development enables the Combatant Commander to establish early Situational Awareness of an area without exposing friendly forces to enemy engagement, and to actively detect, identify, discriminate, and engage the enemy in order to shape the battlespace at deep operational ranges.  Area Denial Capability Development will utilize an open system, modular architecture to facilitate future development, maintenance, repair, and product improvements.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project enables component development of new counter explosive hazard systems that focus on detecting, marking, and neutralizing mines and improvised explosive devices (IED).  These capabilities will enhance the effectiveness of the Route Clearance Platoon within the Engineer Company, the Brigade Combat Team as well as other related Army missions.  

The Forward Reconnaissance and Explosive Hazard Detection (FREHD) system will provide a suite of vehicle-mounted capabilities that enable route clearance patrols to achieve higher rates of advance by accurately detecting and adjudicating potential explosive hazards with reduced hazard interrogation time.  The system will automatically nominate potential hazards on the move and at standoff distance, and then let route clearance teams decide whether to perform more detailed examinations and identification of those hazards using additional tools within the FREHD suite.   FREHD will also provide threat visualization and control capabilities that enable route clearance and allow Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) and related mission personnel to remotely view video feeds of the hazard and remotely control the apparatus.  The increased rate of advance will improve route clearance time, while the increased standoff improves force protection.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides for the Concept Exploration and Refinement of a Deep-Range employed Networked Obstacle.  This project develops alternatives to the aging inventory of the Family of Scatterable Mines systems.

Area Denial Capability Development will evaluate integrated technologies and prototype systems in a realistic operating environment to expedite technology transition for a Deep-Range employed Networked Obstacle that denies the enemy terrain and freedom of action while allowing friendly forces to maneuver freely within the same battlespace.  Area Denial Capability Development provides Man-in-the-Loop (MITL) controlled scalable effects against mounted and dismounted enemy forces that disrupt, turn, fix or block their ability to maneuver.  Area Denial Capability Development enables the Combatant Commander to establish early Situational Awareness of an area without exposing friendly forces to enemy engagement, and to actively detect, identify, discriminate, and engage the enemy in order to shape the battlespace at deep operational ranges.  Area Denial Capability Development will utilize an open system, modular architecture to facilitate future development, maintenance, repair, and product improvements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>An Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) will be conducted to assess the feasibility and affordability of various system concepts.  The AoA will be informed by previously executed studies and input from Government, Industry and Academia.  In parallel to the AoA, up to 5 Concept Prototype awards will be provided to industry to develop representative prototypes (hardware and/or models) that will be used to assess the technology risks and costs associated with multiple system level concepts.  The results of the AoA and evaluation of representative prototypes will support a Milestone A Decision and lead to up to 5 Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) contract awards based on Full and Open competition.  Technologies that support the selected system level concepts will be matured during TMRR, and a Capability Development Document (CDD) will be developed.  At the end of TMRR, and after a successful Milestone B Decision, up to 2 Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contracts will be awarded to further mature the technology associated with the most affordable and achievable materiel solution(s).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>SOM: US Forces must be able to effectively neutralize and degrade energy weapon systems and electro-optical systems/smart weapons that operate in the full range of the electromagnetic spectrum to improve platform survivability and soldier protection levels of maneuver forces on the battlefield.  Improvements are sought across the entire multi-spectral range from visual through infrared (IR) and millimeter wavelengths (MMW) radar for incorporation into self-protection using sustained generated obscuration technology.  SOM will be man portable and modular to facilitate quick mounting on manned/unmanned platforms and dismounted operations.

NBCRV: This program upgrades the Stryker Nuclear Biological Chemical Radiological Vehicle Sensor Suite (NBCRVSS)for increased sensitivity, chemical detection at increased maneuver speeds, and increased reliability.  The NBCRVSS consists of a chemical point detector for solid, liquid, and vapor Chemical Warfare Agents, a biological point detection system, a Chemical Vapor Sampling System, a Training Aids, Devices, and Simulation System, and the Sensor Processing Group.  The NBCRVSS provides the Stryker NBCRV the ability to detect, identify, collect, report, and mark NBC hazards.  NBCRVSS funding is expected to move to a separate Program Element during the FY16 President's Budget cycle.  It will be reflected under PE 655038, Project Code EQ7.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

NBCRV: The Nuclear Biological Chemical Radiological Vehicle Sensor Suite (NBCRVSS) is a Component of End Item to the Stryker Nuclear Biological Chemical Radiological Vehicle (NBCRV) designed to detect, identify, collect, report, and mark NBC hazards while integrated on the Stryker NBCRV.  The NBCRVSS is a single step in the evolutionary acquisition strategy of the Stryker NBCRV.  The NBCRSS program will design, develop, integrate, test, procure, and field systems that will allow increased manuever speeds when sampling liquid/solid ground contamination, increase chemical point identification sensitivity, lower sustainment costs, and increase reliability.  Full and Open competition will be used for the development of the NBCRVSS with options for Low Rate Initial Production and Full Rate Production.  The NBCRVSS will utilize competitive prototyping and a best value approach.  

SOM: The Screening Obscuration Module (SOM) acquisition strategy is a single step Technology Development (TD) phase leading to a Milestone B/C production decision.  The path forward for the TD phase will include the release of a formal request for proposal (RFP) to develop, test, and produce a SOM system capable of obscuring the Visual through Near IR wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum.  The SOM RFP will utilize a cost plus fixed fee best value contract approach to execute the TD phase and a firm fixed price contract option for production. This acquisition strategy includes system development and demonstration, full system integration, design for producibility and a demonstration of interoperability, safety and utility.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Title changed from Tank and Medium Caliber Ammunition to Weapons and Munitions Advanced Development.

The Weapons and Munitions Advanced Development Program Element (PE) encompasses a comprehensive program to develop, rapidly transition to production, and field advanced weapons and munitions.  These programs will ensure continued battlefield overmatch and lethality of U.S. maneuver forces against the full range of modern battlefield threats.  To achieve this, Weapons and Munitions Engineering Development Program will identify and develop promising technologies through competitive development and streamlined acquisition procedures.

M829E4:The M829E4 cartridge is an Abrams delivered Line of Sight (LOS) munition that will provide capability for the current force Armored Brigade Combat Team's (ABCT) commander to conduct decisive operations and destroy current and future enemy Main Battle Tanks (MBTs) equipped with Explosive Reactive Armor (ERA) and Active Protective System (APS) at ranges from 0-2km (T) and 0-4km (O).  The M829E4 equips ABCT commanders with a unique capability which will increase the ABCT's lethality and ability to seize the initiative during unified land operations.  

One Way Luminescence (OWL): Current legacy small caliber ammunition tracer rounds are comprised of a pyrotechnic tracer mix that allows enemy forces to visually see the trace round and track its trajectory back to the shooter. The objective of the OWL program is to develop and field a full day/night tracer technology to replace the current pyrotechnic trace cartridges, with new trace cartridges that are only visible to the shooter and those soldiers in close proximity, thereby increasing soldier survivability. Additional benefits of the OWL program, depending on the technology that is selected include a possible reduction in unit cost compared to the pyrotechnic trace round and the potential for every round to have a trace capability. 7.62mm will be the critical focus followed by development of 5.56mm and .50 caliber OWL cartridges.

Advanced Multi Purpose (AMP):The Advanced Multi Purpose (AMP) program is a direct fire line of sight 120mm large caliber munition under development for the Abrams Main Battle Tank.  It has three modes of operation including point detonate, delay and airburst.  AMP is the material solution for breaching reinforced concrete walls and defeating Anti Tank Guided Missile (ATGM) teams from 50m to 2000m (T) and 50m to 4500m (O), a validated gap that cannot currently be met with existing stockpiled ammunition.  In addition to added capability, AMP will also consolidate the capabilities of four existing stockpiled 120mm munitions, thereby addressing the users' battlecarry dilemma by allowing them to load a single munition that is capable of defeating multiple targets including ATGM teams, reinforced walls, personnel, light armor, bunkers, and obstacles.  The full performance of the AMP is obtained with an Abrams equipped Ammunition Data Link breech modification, the same required by the 120mm M829E4 cartridge that achieved Milestone C in FY 2014.  FY 2016 supports multiple contracts with competing prototypes in Phase I of II for Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD). 

Medium Caliber Ammunition: The Target Practice Day Night Thermal (TP-DNT) cartridges are 40mm grenade training cartridges.  The low velocity variant is for training with the M203/M320 grenade launchers; the high velocity variant is for training with the Mk19 grenade machine gun.  Both cartridges will provide the Warfighter with a non-dud producing, environmentally friendly training cartridge that provides a visual impact signature seen day or night, by the naked eye, through night vision devices, and thermal weapon sights.  These cartridges will replace the 40mm Target Practice, M918/M385A1 (Mixed Belt) cartridges and the 40mm M781 cartridges.  It is expected that the unit price for high velocity cartridges will be lower than the Mixed Belt cartridges.  Funding for FY 2015 activities transitions to PE 0654802/Project EC1.  In FY 2018 funding is in place to start an Increased Range Anti-Personnel (IRAP) Program which will extend the range of conventional 40mm Low Velocity grenades from 300 meters to 600 meters.

Tunable Pyrotechnic Aircraft Countermeasure: This project will support research, development and testing to field new expendable countermeasure munitions that will protect Army aircraft from advanced and current guided-missile threats. Advances in the capability of threat systems necessitate development of new expendable countermeasures decoys. This program is considered essential to provide Army Aircraft and aircrews protection against surface-to-air weapon systems.

Ammunition Logistics Prototyping:This project supports the future force by improving the distribution, management, reliability and survivability of ammunition through the advanced development, integration, and demonstration of logistics system enablers. These enablers will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of ammunition operations, to include retrograde, while reducing the logistics footprint on the battlefield. Technology areas addressed include handling, distribution, and management (strategic and tactical), prognostics, diagnostics, and asset visibility, explosives safety, and adaptive and environmentally friendly packaging and palletization. The efficient deployment and sustainment of reliable ammunition is vital to success on the battlefield. This project enhances the operational effectiveness of the ammunition logistics system to ensure the distribution of reliable ammunition to the warfighter.

Adv Armor Piercing (ADVAP): The overall objective of the XM1158 Small Caliber Ammo program is to develop and field a 7.62mm XM1158 cartridge variant followed by a 5.56mm cartridge variant that will provide overmatch capability to defeat advanced light armored threats within typical machine gun ranges. Current XM1158 ammunition performance has been stagnant over the last 20 years, which has led to known deficiencies against current and future hard target threats. The 7.62mm XM1158 cartridge will be designed specifically for use in the M240 Machine Gun and will replace the older M993 Armor Piercing cartridge.

Lightweight Cartridge Case for Small Caliber: The overall objective of the Lightweight Small Caliber Ammunition (LSCA) program is to develop and field 7.62mm LSCA cartridges that will provide the same capabilities as the M80A1 and M62A1 cartridges while achieving up to twenty percent weight savings at the cartridge level. The LSCA cartridge will be designed to be compatible with all Army 7.62mm weapons, but specifically optimized to work in the M240 Machine Gun. After the 7.62mm cartridge is matured a .50 Caliber variant will be developed.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The M829E4 equips ABCT commanders with a unique capability which will increase the ABCT's lethality and ability to seize the initiative during unified land operations.  After an Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase I competitive shoot off in FY 2011, Alliant Techsystems (ATK) was awarded the option to continue with Phase II until its conclusion in FY 2015.  FY 2012 supported the continuation of Phase II of the M829E4 cartridge.  FY 2013 funding supported design finalization, design verification, fabrication and initial testing of Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&amp;E) hardware.  The full performance of the M829E4 is obtained with an Abrams equipped with an Ammunition Data Link breech modification.  FY 2014 supported hardware and performance testing, mandated Live Fire Test &amp; Evaluation (LFT&amp;E) and completion of Milestone C.  FY 2015 supported qualifying a second source for the composite sabot material.  The current single source supplier for this material had significantly increased the cost for this material, more than doubled in cost, and expressed intentions of possibly getting out of this business.  Qualification of this second source has occurred and has resulted in competitive pricing thus driving down the unit price cost.  The aforementioned selection has mitigated the risk of the current supplier exiting as a supplier of this material.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Milestone B Decision was obtained in 4Q FY 2009, and the program entered Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) in FY 2010.  EMD consists of two phases; the Phase I contract was awarded in 2Q FY 2010 and Phase II contract was awarded in 3Q FY 2011.  During Phase I (15 months), the Government awarded two separate Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contracts culminating in a demonstration test and competitive source selection to down select to one contractor for the 31 month Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF) Phase II.  The down select was based on the demonstrated performance of the cartridge design, proposed systems engineering and management approach for Phase II, and the total program cost estimate for each contractor at the time of the demonstration test.  ATK was awarded the option to continue EMD Phase II until its conclusion in FY 2015.  Milestone C was granted on 1 July 2014.  RDT&amp;E will be completed in FY 2015 after the qualification of a second source for the production of sabot material.  After Milesetone C was granted, Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) option was awarded to ATK on 1 July 2014.  The contract also contains options for two additional production years.  All production options are Firm Fixed Price (FFP).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Advanced Multi Purpose (AMP) program is a direct fire line of sight 120mm large caliber munition under development for the Abrams Main Battle Tank.  It has three modes of operation including point detonate, delay and airburst.  AMP is the material solution for breaching reinforced concrete walls and defeating Anti Tank Guided Missile (ATGM) teams from 50m to 2000m (T) and 50m to 4500m (O), a validated gap that cannot currently be met with existing stockpiled ammunition.  In addition to added capability, AMP will also consolidate the capabilities of four existing stockpiled 120mm munitions, thereby addressing the users' battlecarry dilemma by allowing them to load a single munition that is capable of defeating multiple targets including ATGM teams, reinforced walls, personnel, light armor, bunkers, and obstacles.  The full performance of the AMP is obtained with an Abrams equipped Ammunition Data Link breech modification, the same required by the 120mm M829E4 cartridge that achieved Milestone C in FY 2014.  FY 2016 supports multiple contracts with competing prototypes in Phase I of II for Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Target Practice Day Night Thermal (TP-DNT) cartridges are 40mm grenade training cartridges.  The low velocity variant is for training with the M203/M320 grenade launchers; the high velocity variant is for training with the Mk19 grenade machine gun.  Both cartridges will provide the Warfighter with a non-dud producing, environmentally friendly training cartridge that provides a visual impact signature seen day or night, by the naked eye, through night vision devices, and thermal weapon sights.  These cartridges will replace the 40mm Target Practice, M918/M385A1 (Mixed Belt) cartridges and the 40mm M781 cartridges.  It is expected that the unit price for high velocity cartridges will be lower than the Mixed Belt cartridges.  Funding for FY 2015 activities transitions to PE 0654802/Project EC1.  In FY 2018 funding is in place to start an Increased Range Anti-Personnel (IRAP) Program which will extend the range of conventional 40mm Low Velocity grenades from 300 meters to 600 meters.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The TP-DNT cartridges will be developed through a competitive Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) program.  The EMD phase will develop both High Velocity (HV) and Low Velocity (LV) variants that will most likely utilize the same critical technologies, making concurrent acquisitions a logical approach to reduce overall acquisition costs.  As part of the EMD source selection, a Bid Sample shoot-off competition is underway to evaluate potential designs.  Within funding constraints, multiple contractor designs will be awarded EMD contracts with intent to down select to one contractor for the HV variant and one contractor for the LV variant. Following the down select, begin Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) and two production year options.  Milestone C scheduled for 3Q FY 2017.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>This program develops a new tracer technology and applies it to multiple calibers. The intial focus will be on 7.62mm ammunition in FY 2015 followed by 5.56mm in FY 2018 and .50 Caliber ammunition in FY 2019.  As the technology matures it will be transitioned to Project 654802 EP4 starting in FY 2018 for 7.62mm, FY 2020 for 5.56mm and .50 Caliber.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>One Way Luminescence (OWL): Current legacy small caliber ammunition tracer rounds are comprised of a pyrotechnic tracer mix that allows enemy forces to visually see the trace round and track its trajectory back to the shooter. The objective of the OWL program is to develop and field a full day/night tracer technology to replace the current pyrotechnic trace cartridges, with new trace cartridges that are only visible to the shooter and those soldiers in close proximity, thereby increasing soldier survivability. Additional benefits of the OWL program, depending on the technology that is selected include a possible reduction in unit cost compared to the pyrotechnic trace round and the potential for every round to have a trace capability. 7.62mm will be the critical focus followed by development of 5.56mm and .50 caliber OWL cartridges.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The OWL concept will be developed through government and industry prototyping efforts. An annual Technology Readiness Assessment (TRA) will be conducted in FY 2015, FY 2016, and FY 2017 to measure the progress of the designs. If the technology matures to a Technology Readiness Level of 6 (prototypes fired from the M240 machine gun) by FY 2017 for 7.62mm, there will be a down select to one design for Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) program. The 5.56mm and .50 Caliber cartridges will follow the 7.62mm schedule with Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) starting at the end of FY 2020. These new tracer cartridges will then replace the old tracers in each of the various small caliber configurations purchased by the Army.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The overall objective of the XM1158 Small Caliber Ammo program is to develop and field a 7.62mm XM1158 cartridge variant followed by a 5.56mm cartridge variant that will provide overmatch capability to defeat advanced light armored threats within typical machine gun ranges. Current XM1158 ammunition performance has been stagnant over the last 20 years, which has led to known deficiencies against current and future hard target threats. The 7.62mm XM1158 cartridge will be designed specifically for use in the M240 Machine Gun and will replace the older M993 Armor Piercing cartridge.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The overall objective of the Lightweight Small Caliber Ammunition (LSCA) program is to develop and field 7.62mm LSCA cartridges that will provide the same capabilities as the M80A1 and M62A1 cartridges while achieving up to twenty percent weight savings at the cartridge level. The LSCA cartridge will be designed to be compatible with all Army 7.62mm weapons, but specifically optimized to work in the M240 Machine Gun. After the 7.62mm cartridge is matured a .50 Caliber variant will be developed.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The 7.62mm LSCA cartridge will be a contractor design that the government plans to transition to production at Lake City Army Ammunition Plant after the Full Materiel Release (FMR). The government plans to award up to three contracts for initial prototype evaluation in FY 2016. After Milestone B in 1QTR FY 2017, the government intends to award one contract under full and open competition to complete the development and transition into production. The .50 Caliber program will follow the same strategy but start in FY 2017.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) supports the development of the Stryker Family of vehicles (FOV) in two projects: 
 
The Interim Armored Vehicle Family Project (C03) supports the use of the common platform/common chassis design reducing requirements for repair parts and logistics support in the area of operations.

Engineering Change Proposal 1 (ECP 1) (C51), will enable the Stryker FOV to host the future network without further degrading vehicle performance.  The upgrade will increase available electrical power while ensuring adequate mechanical power, weight margin, and cooling.  Combined with an in-vehicle network, this will ensure the FOV can host the future network while retaining its protection and mobility.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Stryker ECP 1 effort will enable the Stryker Double-V Hull (DVH) fleet to buy back the Space, Weight, and Power-Cooling (SWaP-C) that has been lost as a result of vehicle changes required to counter the evolving threats that were present in theater of operations.  This ECP 1 will also allow the DVH fleet to host the future network without further degrading vehicle performance.  The upgrade will increase available electrical power while ensuring adequate mechanical power, weight margin, and cooling.  Combined with a digital backbone, this will ensure that the DVH fleet can host the future network while retaining its protection and mobility.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Funding for the 4th DVH ECP 1 Brigade will begin in FY16 and will be funded in Stryker Upgrade (G85200).  Stryker MOD (GM0100) is for Stryker Fleet modifications to include ECP 1 retrofits to the Stryker fleet starting in FY19. Beginning in FY15, PE Number 0203735A/Project EE2 will continue to fund the Stryker Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) 1 program.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Stryker ECP 1 effort will buy back the vehicle space, weight, and power margin lost due to the addition of numerous kits in response to eleven years of war (20-combat rotations &amp; 37+ million total miles), in order to allow integration of the future network (as directed by VCSA in August 2011) without further degrading the performance of the platform.  In May 2012, Stryker ECP 1 program (Phase I) was approved, permitting preliminary design and integration efforts on both the Flat Bottom (FB) and Double-V Hull (DVH) variants.  In March 2013, Phase II approved upgrading the mechanical power, electrical power generation, chassis upgrades and the in-vehicle network for the DVH vehicles.  Based on additional testing conducted in the summer of 2013, the decision was made to focus ECP efforts on the DVH and defer efforts on flat bottom Strykers.  ECP 1 Phase II contract awarded November 25, 2013, which continues development engineering, prototype build test and evaluation.  The Production decision (Phase III) will determine the production requirements of the technologies selected in Phase II.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides for the advanced component development and prototyping of joint service food and combat feeding equipment designed to reduce the logistics burden and Operation and Support (O&amp;S) costs of subsistence support to service personnel. Project supports development of rations and rapidly deployable field food service equipment.  Project conducts demonstration and validation of improved subsistence and subsistence support items used to enhance soldier effectiveness and quality of life in all four Services, as part of an integrated Department of Defense (DoD) Food Research, Development, Test, Evaluation and Engineering Program. The Program is reviewed and validated twice annually by the DoD Combat Feeding Research and Engineering Board (CFREB) as part of the Joint Service Food Program.  This project develops critical enablers that support the Joint Future Force Capabilities and the Joint expeditionary mindset by maintaining readiness through fielding and integrating new equipment. This equipment enhances the field soldier's well-being and provides the soldier with usable equipment, in addition to reducing sustainment requirements, related Combat Support/Combat Service Support (CS/CSS) demands on lift, combat zone footprint, and costs for logistical support.

This PE/Project supports Field Feeding Programs for all the services.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Rapid Equipping Force (REF) supports Combatant Command (COCOM)/Army Service Component Command (ASCC) based on emerging rapid equipment requirements.   The REF is an enduring organization (Base funded) per Headquarters, Department of the Army, memo, SUBJECT:  Implementation Plan for Stabilization of the Rapid Equipping Force (REF), signed by the Under Secretary of the Army:  Joseph W. Westphal, dated 30 January 2014. 

The REF harnesses current and emerging technologies to provide rapid solutions to U.S. Army Forces employed globally.  The REF combines and integrates functions that cross several Army staff elements and ASCCs to accelerate materiel solutions and technology insertion to U.S. Army Forces employed globally.  The REF is the Army's quick reaction capability with the ability to develop, prototype, acquire, integrate and sustain Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS), Government Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) and Non-Developmental Item (NDI) solutions to meet urgent combat requirements for forces employed globally.  It develops and inserts selected future force technologies, capabilities, and surrogate materiel solutions into deployed, deploying, select prepared to deploy, and transformational forces for operational evaluation, assessment, and evolutionary development.  The REF plans and executes assessments and studies of Army practices and issues concerning operational needs, desired future force capabilities, and relevant Army business practices to provide feedback to Army Senior Leaders.  

The REF bridges the gap between the traditional acquisition process and immediate equipping needs.  The REF pursues tangible solutions that can be equipped rapidly with a goal of 180 days.  The REF focuses on finding effective game-changing capabilities to increase Soldier effectiveness, protection, and lethality in any operational environment.  The REF process provides the mechanism to respond rapidly to an adaptive enemy who changes in days and months, not years.  The REF coordinates in theater work with the ASCC of the COCOMs to understand their urgent needs, for which the REF acquisition capability may identify, procure, deliver, and sustain solutions to the deployed units.  This fiscal flexibility is significant in that it permits the REF to allocate funds against emerging threats and requirements in the year of fiscal execution.  

The REF works directly with Operational Commanders at all levels, but focuses on Brigade level and below to find solutions to identified capability gaps.  These solutions may result in procurement of new or existing military/commercial materiel equipment, or accelerated development of a future force materiel solution for insertion into the current force now.  

In accordance with Ms. Heidi Shyu (Army Acquisition Executive) Memorandum, Subject:  Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) to Change the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) for the Rapid Equipping Force (REF) Program, dated May 28, 2014, the overarching goal of institutionalizing the acquisition authorities within the REF is to preserve the autonomy of action that has proven successful through the past decade of war.  Program Executive Office (PEO) Soldier has been assigned as the MDA to provide proper acquisition oversight while enhancing visibility of these efforts.  The MDA will ensure flexibility and speed focused on the needs of Soldiers serviced by the dedicated REF Program Management Office (PMO).   A formal reporting scheme leveraging existing venues, (e.g., Program Status Reviews (PSR) Acquisition Category (ACAT) III Reporting, will ensure ASA (ALT) visibility, oversight, and direction.

The REF key tasks are:

- Partner with the Asymmetric Warfare Group (AWG) and the ASCCs to be responsive to tactical unit commanders in a global operating environment.
- Bridge specific Operational Needs Statement (ONS)/Joint Urgent Operational Needs Statement (JUONS)/Joint Emergent Operational Needs Statement (JEONS) gaps to meet urgent needs.
- Develop materiel solutions to counter emerging global asymmetric threats with reduced Soldiers in the operational environment.
- Ensure training, transportation, and sustainment are provided with every capability.
- Cultivate and rapidly insert emerging technologies into Soldiers' hands.
- Conduct operational assessments to provide useful operator feedback to the Army. 
- Transition effective projects through the appropriate Army process for long-term sustainment.
- Be aggressive and push the acquisition envelope, but operate within the law.
- Integrate with existing Army organizations and systems to enable them to recognize and solve problems for tactical units.

The current REF Integrated Priority List (RIPL) consists of the REF top priorities based on requirements received from deployed units and drives all REF efforts.  

1.   Dismounted Improvised Explosive Device (IED) Defeat 
2.   Small Combat Outpost (COP)/Patrol Base (PB) Sustainment 
3.   Small Combat Outpost (COP)/Patrol Base (PB) Force Protection 
4.   Dismounted Operations Support 
5.   Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) Shortfalls in Environmentally Inhospitable Operational Environments (OEs) 
6.   Dismounted Blue Force Tracking and Mission Command 
7.   Other

The Army anticipates the REF working similar priorities in FY16 and beyond.   The REF average cost per requirement is ~$1.1 based on historical data.

The REF FY16 RDT&amp;E request $5.957million (Base) and $1.500 million (OCO) is for system integration, Testing and Evaluation to support project requirements.   The REF requires RDT&amp;E funds to test technologies in order to ensure suitability and safety before equipping the Soldier – any modified COTS/GOTS/NDI items have to be tested.  RDT&amp;E integrates, modifies, and equips urgent materiel capabilities to units in support of Joint and Army Forces Commanders to enhance the combat effectiveness of the operating force.  
The RDT&amp;E funding also provides the REF the flexibility to invest in near-term, innovative solutions.  RDT&amp;E funds are necessary in the vast majority of all REF projects.  REF uses RDT&amp;E funds to work with industry and Other Governmental Agencies (OGAs) in order to further develop high (>6) Technology Readiness Level (TRL) systems or advanced technologies that often only need small amounts of funding in order to help them achieve a maturity level that is suitable to solve deployed U.S. Army Forces problems.  The REF requires RDT&amp;E funds to integrate several different COTS/GOTS/NDI technologies into one capability that solves the tougher and more complex problems.  The REF uses RDT&amp;E funds to conduct demonstrations and tests to validate technology solutions.   The REF requires RDT&amp;E funds in order to modify existing technologies that were developed for one purpose, but now may be suitable to solve another problem.  The REF Expeditionary Labs use RDT&amp;E funds to develop and adapt technologies that meet immediate requirements forward in the theaters of operation with the active assistance of the Soldier in the solution development process.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:Text>The demand for REF 10-liner requirements has levels based on the increased tempo of transitioning brigades in Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) with nine (9) month deployments; the expansion of brigades' operational environments (OEs) that required smaller units to operate in more isolated areas; the expansion of Army Special Operation Forces Village Stability Operations (VSO) efforts; and the introduction of Security Force Advisory Assistance Teams (SFAATs) – a new force structure and role in OEF.  At the end of FY14, the REF had 554 total requirements -494 were OCO requirements.  For FY15 the REF projected 600 requirements (540 Base, 60 OCO).   As of 31 Dec 2014, the REF had 180 total requirements – 167 were OCO requirements.</r2:Text>

REF's Expeditionary Labs are deployed to provide engineer support directly to Battalion and Brigade Forward Operating Bases/Combat Outposts/Patrol Bases and work side-by-side with Soldiers as they execute their missions.  Engineers connect directly to Army, DoD and National Labs to design and fabricate potential solutions while including the users' immediate feedback.

The REF anticipates an increased need for flexibility to develop technological solutions supporting the reduced numbers of Soldiers operating globally in order to fill force protection gaps in the face of a smaller and more lethal terrorism threat.  The REF expects to increase our engagement with the ASCCs in order to address capability gaps generated by geographical and environmental constraints and improve our understanding of evolving threats and operating conditions within the respective ASCC areas of operations.   The REF's Expeditionary Lab is deployed to provide engineer support directly to Soldiers as they execute their missions in austere environments within a smaller logistical footprint.   Engineers connect directly to Army, Department of Defense (DoD), and National Labs to conduct design and fabrication while including the user's immediate feedback.  The REF expects to insert emerging technologies into ASCC level exercises in order to validate concept of operations (CONOPS) and Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTP).  The REF also expects to play a much more deliberate role in providing support to the Global Response Force as they prepare for a wider range of response missions.  We anticipate increased coordination with various Army technology demonstrations and Joint Capabilities Technology Demonstrations in order to leverage developed residual technologies to rapidly address indentified critical capability gaps and gain immediate feedback through limited user evaluations.   In accordance with REF's participation in the Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD) led quick reaction capability effort, the Army determined the REF would provide the Army's warm base capability with 71 requirements in FY16 and beyond.

For FY16 the REF projects 71 requirements in the following REF Integrated Priority List (RIPL).

1.  Dismounted Improvised Explosive Device (IED) Defeat ($220K)
2.  Small Combat Outpost (COP)/Patrol Base (PB) Sustainment ($110K)
3.  Small Combat Outpost (COP)/Patrol Base (PB) Force Protection ($716K)
4.  Dismounted Operations Support ($1,845K)
5.  Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) Shortfalls in Environmentally Inhospitable Operational Environments (OEs) ($248K)
6.  Dismounted Blue Force Tracking and Mission Command ($55K)
7.  Other ($1,763K)

The REF anticipates ATEC testing and evaluation cost of $1.00M.  The REF requires RDT&amp;E funds to test technologies in order to ensure suitability and safety before equipping the Soldier – any modified COTS/GOTS/NDI items has to be tested.</r2:Text>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The REF harnesses current and emerging technologies to provide rapid solutions to the urgently required capabilities of U.S. Army Forces employed globally. The REF focus is on rapidly placing capabilities into Soldiers' hands.  This mission is accomplished in one of two ways: rapidly adapting COTS/GOTS/NDI equipment to meet operational needs and developing emerging deployable capability via interaction with research and development organizations and academia.  All capabilities are safety tested prior to insertion into operational environments. Training and sustainment are provided for every capability until it is transitioned to an approved acquisition program or terminated through an approved Army process. Operational assessments are conducted to provide feedback in support of Army equipping and fielding decisions. REF capabilities routinely serve to as a bridge to specific ONS, JUONS, and JEONS gaps to meet urgent operational requirements.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides for the advanced component development and prototyping of Army food and combat feeding equipment designed to reduce the logistics burden and Operation and Support (O&amp;S) costs of subsistence support to service personnel. Project supports development of rapidly deployable field food service equipment in coordination with ration development efforts. Project conducts demonstration and validation of improved subsistence support items used to enhance soldier effectiveness and quality of life in the Army and the other military Services, as coordinated with the Department of Defense (DoD) Food Research, Development, Test, Evaluation and Engineering Program. This project develops critical enablers that support the Joint Future Force Capabilities and the Joint expeditionary mindset by maintaining readiness through fielding and integrating new equipment. This equipment enhances the field soldier's well-being and provides the soldier with usable equipment, in addition to reducing sustainment requirements, related Combat Support/Combat Service Support (CS/CSS) demands on lift, combat zone footprint, and costs for logistical support.

This PE/Project supports Field Feeding programs for the Army.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Tactical Exploitation of National Capabilities (TENCAP) program serves as the Army's centralized lead to perform National Intelligence cross-agency engineering to evaluate, enhance, prototype, and transition Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) technologies/capabilities developed by Science and Technology (S&amp;T) and other activities across the National Intelligence Community (IC) into Army systems and architectures.  TENCAP (1) ensures continued access to current National and Theater sensors and supporting tactical architectures; and (2) exploits new developments that focus on improving the analysis and tasking, collection, processing, exploitation, dissemination and feedback (TCPEDF) of intelligence data.  This includes efforts to: (1) shorten targeting timelines down to Platoon level; (2) enhance target identification; (3) provide better target location (accuracy); (4) provide continued coverage of a target; and (5) develop in-theater analytic tools to enable data exploitation in near-real-time support to contingency operations.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Tactical Exploitation of National Capabilities (TENCAP) program serves as the Army's centralized lead to perform National Intelligence cross-agency engineering to evaluate, enhance, prototype, and transition Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) technologies/capabilities developed by Science and Technology (S&amp;T) and other activities across the National Intelligence Community (IC) into Army systems and architectures. TENCAP (1) ensures continued access to current National and Theater sensors and supporting tactical architectures; and (2) exploits new developments that focus on improving the analysis and tasking, collection, processing, exploitation, dissemination and feedback (TCPEDF) of intelligence data.  This includes efforts to: (1) shorten targeting timelines down to Platoon level; (2) enhance target identification; (3) provide better target location (accuracy); (4) provide continued coverage of a target; and (5) develop in-theater analytic tools to enable data exploitation in near-real-time support to contingency operations.  

FY2016 Base funding in the amount of $13.472 million provides for: (1) engineering and collaborative development on multiple validated National Intelligence Community (IC) advanced developments to ensure continuous Army interoperability with those IC assets and architectures; (2) advanced development of more effective intelligence collection, processing, exploitation and dissemination (PED); and (3) advanced development of sensor capabilities for Air Vigilance (AV) Army Program of Record.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Army Tactical Exploitation of National Capabilities (TENCAP) mission is a Congressionally mandated and chartered enduring requirement to leverage National intelligence capabilities useful to the tactical Army.  The Army TENCAP acquisition strategy is driven by an annual TENCAP General Officer Steering Group (TGOSG), co-chaired by the Army G2; Army G8; and the Military Deputy to the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology [ASA(ALT)]; and includes representatives from the Army G3; Army G6; Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC); and the Program Executive Office for Intelligence, Electronic Warfare and Sensors (PEO IEW&amp;S).  The TGOSG reviews, validates, prioritizes, and guides Army TENCAP efforts, according to Army and Defense strategy. Based on this TGOSG guidance, Army TENCAP invests BA 6.4 RDTE in Intelligence Community (IC) developments during the more cost-effective advanced development phase to ensure Army requirements are met with minimal redundancy.  Army TENCAP then uses BA 6.5 RDTE to manage the transition of these advanced development efforts through system development and integration into Army Programs of Record (POR).  This strategy ensures these leveraged investments remain viable through multiple budget cycles, significantly increasing successful transition to recipient Army POR.  With acquisition discipline and oversight provided by PEO IEW&amp;S, Army TENCAP executes the TGOSG approved efforts through use of multiple contracts and agreements with the military, National agencies, Labs, Industry Partners and Academia for the full duration required to complete development and transition these National capabilities into enduring Army programs.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                    <r2:Title>Family of Weapon Sights (FWS)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>FWS is a family of weapon sights that enable combat forces to acquire and engage targets with small arms and to conduct surveillance and Enhanced Target Engagement under day/night obscurants, no-light, and adverse weather conditions. The family utilizes advancements in thermal and low light level sensor to produce Individual (I), Crew-Served (CS), and Sniper (S) weapon sights operable in-line with a day optic or in stand-alone mode. This project integrates a smaller pixel focal plane array in multiple large format sizes to improve sensitivity, clarity, and range, while simultaneously reducing the size, weight and power consumption of both the Crew-Served and Sniper variants.  The FWS-I variant is a weapon mounted long-wave infrared sensor that enables Soldiers to fire quickly and accurately from any carry position and with significantly reduced exposure to enemy fire by providing a wireless zeroed weapon aimpoint in the Soldier's goggle.   Leveraging the success of the Individual variant development, the FWS-CS variant operates as the primary sight; it includes a wireless Helmet Mount Display (HMD) and provides the Soldier, with input from a laser range device, a more accurate aimpoint that adjust automatically for range, ammunition characteristics, and vertical angle.The FWS-S variant will provide Snipers with a large format high-definition display enabling forces to acquire and engage targets faster with small arms at longer ranges.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>PTD provides dismounted units, at the squad level, with pre-shot counter sniper-counter shooter-counter surveillance capabilities.  Detecting enemy weapon and surveillance optics increases the dismounted leader's situational awareness/understanding (SA/SU) in complex environments. The objective of PTD is to provide pre-shot threat detection and increase survivability and lethality for dismounted Soldiers through battle systems integration.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>There is a broad application potential for environmental quality technology (EQT) to be applied to multiple Army weapon systems and installations.  However technology must be demonstrated and validated (total ownership cost and performance data identified) before potential users will consider exploiting it.  This program element includes projects focused on validating the general military utility or cost reduction potential of technology when applied to different types of infrastructure, military equipment or techniques.  It may include validations and proof-of-principle demonstrations in field exercises to evaluate upgrades or provide new operational capabilities.  The validation of technologies will be in as realistic an operating environment as possible to assess performance or cost reduction potential.  EQT demonstration/validation is systemic; i.e., applies to a class of systems (e.g., vehicles or aircraft) or to a Department of Army-wide, multiple site/installation problem (e.g., unexploded ordnance detection and discrimination).  This program will address, and eventually resource, programs in each of the Army environmental quality technology pillars (military materials in the environment, sustainable ranges and lands, compliance, and pollution prevention).  All work must be endorsed by potential users and supported by a state-of-the-art assessment (i.e., "technology is heading for user to implement").</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The National Defense Center for Environmental Excellence (NDCEE) was established by Congress in 1990 with a directive to "serve as a national leadership organization to address high priority environmental problems for the Department of Defense (DoD), other government organizations, and the industrial community."  The NDCEE Program is a national resource for developing and disseminating advanced environmental technologies.  The NDCEE is used to demonstrate environmentally acceptable technology to industry; validate new technology prior to transferring that technology; and assist in the training of potential users as part of that technology transfer process.  The NDCEE is a DoD resource for environmental quality management and technology validation.  This program is managed by the Army on behalf of the Office of the Assistant Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Environment.  In May 2008, the program name was redesignated from the National Defense for Environmental Excellence to the National Defense Center for Energy and Environment to ensure that the Center's mission recognizes and addresses the strategic interdependence of energy and environmental technology requirements within an overall sustainability framework in support of our installations, weapons systems and war fighters.  This name change also directly supports the DoD's proactive implementation of Executive Order 13423, "Strengthening Federal Environmental, Energy and Transportation Management."

Our broadly encompassing and growing mobile, personal and stationary advanced energy technology requirements include infrastructure, alternative and synthetic fuels, surety, renewables, storage, distribution, advanced power, micro-grids, transportation, systems integration and others.  Further, to train as we fight, validated energy and environmental technologies need to be available and implemented at our installations.  The NDCEE will continue to demonstrate, validate, and transfer these technologies supporting our integrated environment, safety, occupational health and energy objectives with full consideration of the triple bottom line of mission, environment and community.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The NDCEE is a national asset focused on DoD applications that include technology transfer to appropriate DoD organizations.  The NDCEE fosters an outreach program to describe its products and capabilities that include publication of results and participation in professional meetings, symposia, conferences, and appropriate coordination with industry.  The management strategy for the NDCEE centers on a DoD Executive Advisory Board (EAB) chaired by the DoD NDCEE Executive Agent on behalf of the Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Installations and Environment and composed of senior DoD leadership to oversee NDCEE operations.  The EAB is supported by the NDCEE Technical Working Group (TWG) that includes senior level staff members from each of the offices represented on the EAB.  The NDCEE TWG coordinates all NDCEE activities, votes on proposed joint NDCEE projects, and reports back to the EAB Principals.  Working at the tactical levels, three Focus Groups (evironment, safety/occupational health, and energy) were established to develop joint projects.  The Army's Environmental Quality Technology Program participating in the the Focus Groups also assists in the formulation of suggested environmental technology projects to be demonstrated within the NDCEE Program.  The contracting strategy of the NDCEE is based on using an NDCEE Contracting Officer's Representative to validate all the contractual portions of the NDCEE and by technical monitors (TM) to oversee the technical aspects of each contracted task.  A prime contractor operates NDCEE test facility to validate environmentally compatible technologies on a representative "shop floor".  The NDCEE accounts for and conducts work for: (1) direct funded Army tasks; (2) reimbursable tasks from within DoD and from other Government agencies; and (3) when applicable Congressionally directed and funded tasks.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Environmental Information Technology Management (EITM) Program is an Office of the Secretary of Defense sponsored program that was assigned to the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army for Environment, Safety and Occupational Health as the Department of Defense (DoD) Executive Agent by the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics in 2001.  The DoD Directive 4715.1E defined EITM mission is to ensure efficient use of enterprise environment, safety and occupational health (ESOH) corporate information management processes by providing and sustaining requirement-driven ESOH corporate data management, Congressional-reporting and public outreach tools to the DoD, and other DoD stakeholders.  Funding provided for this program will allow EITM to develop a Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Installations and Environment directed Chemical Management Enterprise Information Integration capability that will allow Army net-centric hazardous material and ESOH 2.0 NetCentric data management capabilities per the Secretary of the Army Directive 2009-03 "Army Data Management" and DoD Directive 8320.2 "Data Sharing in a Net-Centric Department of Defense."  Prior to funding being committed, Army and DoD environmental information technology stakeholders meet to determine which high priority EITM interface requirements need upgrades to incorporate new security and other information technology requirements.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports Advanced Component Development and Prototypes of environmental quality technologies developed within the Army Environmental Quality Technology program.  The project increases operational sustainment and warfighter training capabilities by reducing soldier and worker health risks and environmental quality impacts that would otherwise result in restoration needs and compliance enforcement actions against installations while simultaneously increasing performance and standardization across the Army.  The project expedites technology transition from the laboratory to operational use by demonstrating new materials and processes to fulfill the performance requirements outlined in Material Specifications, Depot Maintenance Work Requirements, Technical Manuals, Drawings and other technical data.  Materials and processes demonstrated under this project are inherently more sustainable than the baseline with respect to environmental, safety and occupational health concerns, thereby reducing life cycle costs incurred by acquisition, industrial base and installation end users.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Warfighter Information Network (WIN-T) Increment (Inc) 2 provides the Army with On-The-Move (OTM) networking capability. The Inc 2 network retains capabilities delivered by WIN-T Inc 1 and by leveraging proven government and commercial technologies, adds greater network throughput and automated Network Management to optimize planning (to include spectrum use), initialization, monitoring and troubleshooting. WIN-T Inc 2 employs Satellite Communications (SATCOM) OTM to extend the network in maneuver Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs) to Company level for the first time.  Using equipment mounted on combat platforms, WIN-T Inc 2 delivers a mobile capability that reduces reliance on fixed infrastructure and allows key leaders to move on the battlefield while retaining Situational Awareness and Mission Command capabilities. Using the Highband Networking Radio (HNR), with the Highband Networking Waveform (HNW) and high performance antennas, the WIN-T Inc 2 Line-of-Sight (LoS) network offers an adaptive 30 Megabit per second (Mbps) aggregate throughput to key leaders in their Command Post or in their vehicle. The WIN-T Inc 2 network is self-forming, which means that it automatically creates transmission paths based on terrain and environmental conditions; and self-healing, meaning that the paths will automatically re-route traffic to complete network transactions and calls even if one or more nodes break down or loses connectivity.  This offers greater network reliability and better end-to-end connectivity than traditional point-to-point networks.  WIN-T Inc 2 introduces the network management capability needed to keep the mobile and dispersed forces networked together through automated planning, initialization, monitoring, and troubleshooting.  Finally, WIN-T adopts "Colorless Core" technology that encrypts both classified and unclassified user information in the network and minimizes the number of users on the "core" of the network.  The Colorless Core allows commanders to utilize the tactical network without fear of the enemy intercepting information. Colorless Core is a technical insertion in the WIN-T Inc 1b network which enables information sharing between Inc 1b and Inc 2.
 
WIN-T Inc 3 mature NetOps technologies will be inserted into Increment 2 units.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Defense Acquisition Executive (DAE), through the Nunn-McCurdy certification process, certified a restructured WIN-T program on June 5, 2007.  The certification Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) stated that the Army will restructure the WIN-T Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP) to absorb the former Joint Network Node (JNN) Network program.  It further stated that the restructured program will consist of four Increments: Incs 1, 2, 3, and 4.

The ADM of September 27, 2013 authorized the procurement of 98 additional communications nodes for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP), bringing the total LRIP quantity to 1,030 communications nodes. The Project Manager (PM) procured the authorized quantities on the current initial production contract (W15P7T-10-D-C007). This contract was awarded in 2010 as a three year contract with three option years. Lots 1, 2, 3, 4 (minus SNEs) and Lot 5 training bases have been procured. Lot 4 SNEs and Lot 5 configuration items will be awarded in May 2015, following a successful Full Rate Production Decision. 

Inc 2 provides the Army with On-The-Move (OTM) networking capability.  Inc 3 NetOps will be technically inserted into Inc 2 and these inserts will be tested in subsequent Network Integration Evaluation (NIE) events.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Defense Acquisition Executive (DAE), through the Nunn-McCurdy certification process, certified a restructured WIN-T program on June 5, 2007.  The certification Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) stated that the Army will restructure the WIN-T Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP) to absorb the former Joint Network Node (JNN) Network program.  It further stated that the restructured program will consist of four Increments: Incs 1, 2, 3, and 4.

An evolutionary acquisition strategy is being utilized to provide for the timely insertion of new technologies into Army communication systems by adhering to the basic principles of the DoD Modular Open Systems Approach (MOSA).  This allows the Army to keep pace with changing commercial technology and maintain required interoperability with other joint, strategic and commercial standards-based networks. Applying integrated Network Operations (NetOps) capability, WIN-T provides the capability to manage, prioritize, and protect information. It ensures NetOps commonality with Joint, Allied, Coalition, Current Force, and Commercial voice and data networks.   

The program is presently in its Engineering, Manufacturing, and Development (EMD) phase. WIN-T Inc 3 technology is being tested and released over time and will be inserted into WIN-T Inc 1 and Inc 2.  

The ADM dated 30 May 2014 directed the restructure of the Inc 3 program. Software development for NetOps Build 4/5 and NCW 10.x is to be completed in FY2015 and tested in FY2016. The ADM allowed for the development and demonstration of HNW 3.0. The program will also cease all efforts associated with development of Increment 3 unique hardware items.

An updated Acquisition Program Baseline (APB) was approved by the AAE on 15 Sep 14 and shows no Nunn-McCurdy risk due to the program quantity being zero. Likewise, the Program Acquisition Unit Cost/Average Procurement Unit Cost (PAUC/APUC) are no longer applicable.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>Reduction attributed to realignment to other higher priority Army programs.

Additional FY16 funds will be used to persue cooperative projects that were postponed or not persue due to funding reductions in previous years such as the Coalition Wideband Networking  Waveform Phase II, 5-Power-Net-centric Command and Control Interoperability projects. Land Warfare Concept Experimentation, projects to enhance information processing, exploitation, and dissemination capabilities, and multilateral cooperative projects in electronic warfare. 
Technology Research and Development Projects (TRDP) moved under several other programs such as: Aviation Systems Technologies, Soldier Technologies, Missile and Rocket Technologies, Chem/Bio Technologies, and Weapons and Munitions Technologies. 
Missile and Rocket technologies will be funded in FY16.
Soldier Technologies includes former Force Protection Projects amd TRDP.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program implements the provisions of Title 10 U.S. Code, Section 2350a, Cooperative Research and Development (R&amp;D) Projects: Allied Countries.  The objective is to improve, through the application of emerging technologies, the conventional defense capabilities of the United States and our cooperative partners, including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), U.S. major non-NATO allies and Friendly Foreign countries. Through technology sharing and joint equipment development these projects help reduce U.S. acquisition costs and leverage important technologies for the Army Transformation and the development of the Future Combat system. Cooperative efforts also improve multinational force compatibility with potential coalition partners through the development and use of similar equipment and improved interfaces. The program focuses specifically on international cooperative technology demonstration, validation, and interoperability of Army weapon and command, control, communications and information (C3I) systems, including the NATO Defense Against Terrorism initiatives. Projects are implemented through international agreements with foreign partners that define scope, cost and work sharing arrangements, management, contracting, security, data protection and third party transfers.  Funds are used to pay for only the U.S. work share that occurs in the United States at U.S. Government and U.S. contractor facilities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program implements the provisions of Title 10 U.S. Code, Section 2350a, Cooperative Research and Development (R&amp;D) Projects: Allied Countries.  The objective is to improve, through the application of emerging technologies, the conventional defense capabilities of the United States and our cooperative partners, including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), U.S. major non-NATO allies and Friendly Foreign countries. Through technology sharing and joint equipment development these projects help reduce U.S. acquisition costs and leverage important technologies for the Army Transformation and the development of the Future Combat system. Cooperative efforts also improve multinational force compatibility with potential coalition partners through the development and use of similar equipment and improved interfaces. The program focuses specifically on international cooperative technology demonstration, validation, and interoperability of Army weapon and command, control, communications and information (C3I) systems, including the NATO Defense Against Terrorism initiatives. Projects are implemented through international agreements with foreign partners that define scope, cost and work sharing arrangements, management, contracting, security, data protection and third party transfers.  Funds are used to pay for only the U.S. work share that occurs in the United States at U.S. Government and U.S. contractor facilities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Support project advanced component development, and prototype of equipment and sub-systems supporting the Army Watercraft mission to provide critical capabilities in support of Unified Land Operations (ULO), by extending the Commander's available maneuver space into and throughout the littorals, inland waterways and near coastal regions. Army watercraft equipment supports the conduct of riverine, Logistics Over The Shore (LOTS), Joint Logistics Over The Shore (JLOTS), inter and intratheater transport, movement and maneuver, mission command and sustainment, as identified in DODD 5100.01 (Functions of the Department of Defense and its Major Components). Army Watercraft exploit the inland waterways and littoral regions as waterborne maneuver and supply routes, conducting operations through littoral entry points (developed, undeveloped, and austere access points) and in non-permissive, and/or denied access scenarios. The Army uses a spectrum of Army Watercraft Systems, from heavy sustainment ocean going landing craft capable of intratheater and ship to shore transport and undeveloped beach or harbor access, to ocean-going and harbor utility tug boats and barge derricks for transport and denied port/salvage operations, and modular causeway systems to support LOTS/JLOTS. The funding supports initiatives to enhance the seaworthiness, safety, survivability, supportability, energy efficiency, environmental, regulatory compliance and reliability of existing systems.  Funded efforts will advance critical gaps in these areas for the current fleet, while at the same time researching, developing and testing emergent technologies in a manner to support future acquisitions and future fleet planning, as informed by the Army Watercraft Systems Board of Directors (AWS BOD).

FY16 funding will support the maturation of a Uniform National Discharge Standards (UNDS) project, maturation of an At-Sea Transfer project, refinement of the Army Watercraft Module Berthing (AWMB) and maturation of an Escalation of Force initiative.  A statutory requirement, UNDS resulted from Section 325 of the National Defense Authorization Act of 1996, which amended Sections 312 and 502(6) of the Clean Water Act and further amends Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).  Army vessels operate nationwide in coastal and inland waters. Because they may enter waters of more than one state in their normal operations, these vessels would be subject to different environmental requirements for their discharges, depending upon vessel location.  The UNDS program establishes national standards for these vessels".

FY15 funding supports development of program Milestone B for Maneuver Support Vessel Light (MSV(L)), a program to be initiated in FY16 with funding on APE 0604804, project EJ9; continues maturation of a Force Protection project, environmental compliance project, maturation of an energy compliance project, and will initiate an At-Sea Transfer project, and corrections to Army Watercraft Module Berthing (AWMBs) based on user evaluations.

Major accomplishments from FY14 funding were the delivery of four Army Watercraft Module Berthing (AWMBs) for user evaluation on a Landing Craft Utility (LCU) and a Logistics Support Vessel (LSV).  Design modification to the four prototypes will be awarded in FY15 and work will continue through FY16.  Integration and testing of Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station (CROWS II) on a LSV, and initiation of an Energy Compliance project.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Tactical Electric Power (TEP) program was established by the Department of Defense to develop modernized, standard families of mobile electric power sources and power distribution systems for all Services throughout the Department of Defense.  Project Manager Expeditionary Energy &amp; Sustainment Systems (PM E2S2) derives concept and technology developments that will improve the performance, mobility, readiness and survivability of the next generation of tactical power sources in support of all Services.  It supports initiatives that are essential to the development and fielding of modernized TEP sources from Watts to Megawatts level that comply with environmental statues and provide noise and signature-suppressed, energy-efficient, lightweight, deployable and reliable equipment.  FY15 &amp; FY16 funding will support test and evaluation of technologies for Small Tactical Electric Power (STEP), Mobile Electric Hybrid Power Sources (MEHPS), and Intelligent Power Management and Distribution Systems (IPMDS). Also funding will support a holistic Modeling and Simulation approach to the evaluation of Operational Energy (OE)-related impacts, systems, and improvements; with the vision of reducing Army energy dependency and demand, increasing systems and contingency bases energy efficiency, seeking alternative energy sources and supporting a culture of energy responsibility while sustaining or enhancing operational capabilities.  Out years will support investigation of general advancements in engine, power equipment and power distribution equipment that are applicable to current equipment and emerging requirements.  Programs include costs for developing concept hardware and executing system evaluations at the Network Integration Evaluation (NIE) events at Ft. Bliss.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Conduct trades between cost and improved maintainability and environmental risk reduction.  Process engineering change proposals, update technical manuals and training materials, and prepare supporting acquisition documents and data to procure new training aids. Develop additional capabilities for existing systems such as the LCRTF, RTCH, and ATLAS which will allow for improved safety, autonomous or semi automonous operation.  Award contracts with vehicle or Autonomus System Developer/TARDEC Robotics to integrate existing technologies onto the platforms to allow for ease of operation or removal of the operator from vehicle.  Testing will be conducted at Aberdeen Proving Grounds, MD.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports development of critical soldier support and sustainment systems for cargo aerial delivery capabilities. These systems will fill identified theater distribution and services capability gaps, improve unit sustainability, and increase combat effectiveness. This project supports Advanced Component Development and Prototyping of Critical Distribution Capabilities which provide improved safety and accuracy while increasing survivability of aircraft, personnel, and equipment. This project develops critical enablers that support the Quartermaster (QM) Force Transformation Strategy and The Army's Modular Capabilities by maintaining readiness through fielding and integrating new equipment. This project also ensures Army Expeditionary Forces are capable of rapid deployment through aerial delivery initiatives and reduces sustainment requirements, related Combat Support/Combat Service Support (CS/CSS) demands in lift, combat zone footprint, and costs for logistical support.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Title>Advanced Low Velocity Airdrop System Light and Heavy (ALVADS-L or ALVADS-H)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>ALVADS provides critical airdrop of supplies and equipment to Global Response Force (GRF) airborne Brigade Combat Teams (BCT) and resupply of non-airborne BCT's, Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (SBCT), Special Operations Forces (SOF), and other future forces for strategic, operational, and tactical military operations.  This capability is essential in providing the strategic responsiveness, full spectrum versatility, and sustainability demanded by Joint and Service Visions and concepts.  GRF, non-airborne BCT, SBCT, SOF, and other future forces require mission-critical equipment delivered by airdrop when air-land is not possible due to anti-access conditions.  ALVADS enhances the commander's ability to deliver heavy loads, conduct resupply activities, and provide accurate, timely delivery of needed equipment in all operational environments and in all types of weather while reducing the aircraft vulnerability to threat weaponry.  The ALVADS-Light capability includes loads in the weight range from 2,520 to 22,000 lbs being deployed from altitudes as low as 750 Above Ground Level (AGL) (T) and 500 (AGL) (O).  The ALVADS-Heavy load range is 22,001 - 42,000 lbs to accommodate heavier cargo loads and possesses a slightly increased minimum deployment altitude requirement of 975 (AGL) (T) and 500 (AGL) (O).</r2:Description>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project develops and demonstrates the potential of prototype equipment and technologies to satisfy petroleum storage, distribution, and quality surveillance system requirements.  The Technology Development programs support the development and enhancement of rapidly deployable Petroleum and Water equipment.  The mission includes developing onboard fuel quality analysis systems; achieving greater capabilities in the removal of Nuclear, Biological, Chemical (NBC) and other contaminants from water sources; reducing the logistics footprint; developing water reutilization systems to reduce the requirement for transport of water into the theater; and material systems to decrease the logistics footprint and employment time for the transfer of liquid logistics in joint operations area.  This vital equipment enables the Army to achieve its mission by providing the Army with the means to be highly mobile and self-sustaining in very hostile joint operations areas.  Future Force operations demand that combat systems be rapidly deployable to the theater, rapidly emplaced upon arrival, and rapidly relocated to support a fast moving non-linear battlefield.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports development of critical soldier support and sustainment systems including shelter systems (rigid and soft wall), base camp subsystems, field service systems, mortuary affairs equipment, heaters, camouflage systems to counter emerging enemy threat technologies, and other combat service support equipment. These systems will fill identified theater distribution and services capability gaps, improve unit sustainability, improve resource and energy efficiency and increase combat effectiveness. This project supports Advanced Component Development and Prototyping of critical tactical support systems that support mobile Joint Service command and control, medical, and maintenance platforms. This project develops critical enablers that support the Quartermaster (QM) Force Transformation Strategy and The Army's Modular Capabilities by maintaining readiness through fielding and integrating new equipment. This project also ensures Army Expeditionary Forces are capable of rapid deployment and reduces sustainment requirements, related Combat Support/Combat Service Support (CS/CSS) demands in lift, combat zone footprint, and costs for logistical support.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>Zero-Footprint Base Camp reduces the operational energy and logistics footprint of the expeditionary base camp system, with the goal being a significant reduction in fuel, water, and power requirements to sustain operations in the field. Operating a base camp such as Force Provider requires a significant amount of logistics support and also produces an enormous amount of by products, both of which cost money, human effort (that means a risk in the form of soldiers on the road), and represents a potential vulnerability.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Net-Zero Energy Efficiency Solutions reduce the logistics footprint of the expeditionary base camp system, with the goal being a significant reduction in fuel, water, material and power requirements to sustain operations in the field. The effort includes reducing site preparation, maintenance and spare parts requirements. Operating a base camp such as Force Provider requires a significant amount of logistics support and also produces an enormous amount of by products, both of which cost money, human effort (that means a risk in the form of soldiers on the road), and represents a potential vulnerability.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element (PE) funds development of medical materiel within the early system integration portion of the System Development and Demonstration phase of the acquisition life cycle using 6.4 funding.  Program efforts support transition of promising Science and Technology candidate medical technologies (drugs, vaccines, medical devices, diagnostics, and mechanisms for detection and control of disease carrying insects) to larger scale testing in humans for safety and effectiveness.  Programs are aligned to meet future force requirements identified within concept documents and organizational structures.  This Program Element also provides funding for Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulated human clinical trials to gain additional information about safety and effectiveness on the path to licensure for use in humans.  The Projects supported by this PE are: 

(PROJ 808) funds development of candidate medical countermeasures for infectious diseases of military relevance. Efforts include vaccines, drugs, diagnostic kits/devices, and insect control measures.  These funds support human clinical efficacy trials of the drug/vaccine in a larger group that are designed to assess performance and to continue safety assessments in a larger group of volunteers. Products from this project will transition to 849.

(PROJ 811) funds the development of military relevant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) medical countermeasures.  It provides funding for planning and conducting of human clinical trials in a group of healthy volunteers to assess the drug/vaccine for safety, tolerability, how the drug/vaccine is distributed, metabolized, and excreted from the body, and investigate the appropriate dose for therapeutic use.  Products from this project will transition to Project 812.

(PROJ 836) funds the demonstration and validation of medical products for enhanced combat casualty care and follow-on care, including rehabilitation.  This project also funds the human clinical trials that test the safety and effectiveness of biologics, devices and demonstration.  Clinical trials are conducted in accordance with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations.  Products from this project will transition to 832. 

(PROJ VS7) funds program upgrades, retrofits, trains, and sustains the fleet of Medical Evacuation legacy helicopters that continue to play a major role in Iraq and Afghanistan. The approved force design increased the number of air frames in the force from 12 to 15 aircraft for 37 MEDEVAC companies.  All products from this project will transition to VS8 in FY16.

This program is managed by U.S. Army Medical Materiel Development Activity (USAMMDA) and U.S. Army Medical Materiel Agency (USAMMA)  of the US Army Medical Research and Materiel Command.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project funds development of candidate medical countermeasures for infectious diseases of military relevance.  These efforts are in: vaccines, drugs, diagnostic kits/devices, and determining if insects are infected with pathogenic organisms capable of infecting service members/preventive medicine measures.  These funds support human clinical effectiveness (capacity to produce a desired size of an effect under ideal or optimal conditions) trials of the drug/vaccine in larger groups that are designed to assess how well the drug/vaccine works, and to continue safety assessments in a larger group of volunteers.  Funding supports both technical evaluations and human clinical testing to assure the safety and effectiveness of medical diagnostic kits and devices.  This work, which is performed in military laboratories or civilian pharmaceutical firms, is directed toward the prevention of disease, early diagnosis, and accelerated recovery time once diagnosed; to enhance battlefield readiness.  All clinical trials are conducted in accordance with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations, a mandatory obligation for all military products placed into the hands of medical providers or service members.  Product development priorities are determined based upon four major factors: (1) the extent and threat of the disease within the Combatant Commands theater of operations, (2) the clinical severity of the disease, (3) the technical maturity of the proposed solution, and (4) the affordability of the solution (development and production).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Dengue Tetravalent Vaccine: Continued volunteer follow up and subsequent analysis of data from pivotal Phase 3  (safety and effectiveness in 10 countries, over 30000 volunteers) endemic region studies of Dengue Tetravalent Vaccine with commercial partner Sanofi Pasteur, provided Go/No Go decision for pursuit of compressed vaccination schedule for US traveler/military indication.  Joint Biological Agent identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS): Completed Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) and requirements analysis helped to determine that The Dengue JBAIDS capability does not meet user needs; therefore, the project has been terminated.  Leishmania Rapid Diagnostic Device (LRDD): Transitioned LRDD to Project 849 (Drugs and Vaccines - 6.5) after completion of the analytical testing and Good Manufacturing Practices manufacturing reviews.  Preventive Medicine Products: These products for the control/mitigation of arthropod (insect) borne diseases field testing and evaluation were delayed for several product candidates to include: field deployable detection devices for Chikungunya, Rift Valley Fever, Sand Fly Fever, Crimean-Congo Fever, advanced arthropod collection devices, Saliva Capture RTA card, spatial repellents, and advanced pesticides.  Infectious Disease Diagnostic: These products field testing and evaluation were delayed for several product candidates to include: Scrub Typhus, Rickettsiae, and Sand Fly Fever based on decrement due to poor disbursements in FY2012.</r2:Text>

Expanded Access Treatment Program will continue until FDA approved product is available.  Dengue Tetravalent Vaccine: Dengue Tetravalent Vaccine transitioned in FY14 to Project 849 after completion of volunteer follow up and data analysis on pivotal Phase 3 safety and effectiveness clinical trials.  Preventive Medicine Products: These products fall into the category military operational requirements and are Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS).  As such, they have moved to a more appropriate Program Element (PE 836 or 832) and will be listed as separate products when they are considered for military use.</r2:Text>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project funds development of militarily relevant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) medical countermeasures.  It provides funding for the planning and conducting of human clinical trials in a group of healthy volunteers to assess the drug/vaccine for safety, tolerability, how the drug/vaccine is distributed, metabolized, and excreted from the body, and to investigate the appropriate dose for therapeutic use.  Development efforts are focused on militarily unique needs effecting manning, mobilization, and deployment.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Original models of Army Black Hawk MEDEVAC helicopters continue to play a major role in maintaining high US troop survival rates in Iraq and Afghanistan by evacuating wounded troops in less than one-hour.  In 2009 a VCSA-approved force design update increased the number of air frames in the force from 12 to 15 aircraft for 37 MEDEVAC companies to better meet operational needs.  In 2010, the AMEDD accepted life-cycle management of the MEDEVAC MEP from PEO Aviation.  In order to achieve required operational capability and enhance commonality across the MEDEVAC fleet, the MEDEVAC MEP program upgrades, retrofits, trains, and sustains the 256 MEDEVAC legacy helicopters to achieve the medical capability provided by the HH-60M, which is factory built for the MEDEVAC mission.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports the Advanced Component Development and Prototyping of select Air Soldier System (Air SS) technologies. The Air SS provides improved safety, survivability, and human performance that amplifies the Warfighter's effectiveness and facilitates full-spectrum dominance of Army aircraft. The Air SS addresses capability gaps identified during combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan including the effects of weight and bulk, limited situational awareness, and lack of functionally integrated aircrew member life support equipment. The Air SS follows an evolutionary acquisition approach that integrates mature technologies to build to the full capability. Air SS reduces overall weight and bulk of aircrew equipment, increases situational awareness, and enhances aircrew mobility. This funding provides advanced development for the Air SS in technology areas supporting improved laser eye protection, integrated power, wireless personal area networks, lightweight protective clothing, and tactile situational awareness cueing.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Joint Program Office (JPO) for Integrated Broadcast Service (IBS) Terminals supports all of the Joint Services and Special Operations Command (SOCOM). The IBS is the worldwide Department of Defense (DoD) standard network enterprise for transmitting time-sensitive tactical and strategic intelligence and targeting data to all echelons of Joint Service operational users. The JPO's role is to coordinate sustainment and modernization of IBS terminals compatible with the Common Interactive Broadcast (CIB). The JTT family of systems currently consists of the JTT-Senior and JTT-IBS systems, and they satisfy Radio Frequency (RF) Key Performance Parameters (KPPs) for the IBS Program. The JTT is the official IBS producer system, and ensures continued IBS interoperability to a variety of tactical producers/consumers across the Joint Services. JPO IBS Terminals performs JTT life cycle program management through fielding and sustainment of recently upgraded JTT equipment which includes technical fixes as needed in the newly upgraded IBS network that now uses new crypto, a new Common Interactive Broadcast (CIB), and the Common Message Format (CMF). Funds support continued technical fixes/enhancements, configuration management for JTT crypto/CIB/CMF capabilities after the FY14 Initial Operational Capability (IOC) of the newly upgraded IBS network enterprise.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The JPO for IBS Terminals supports all of the Joint Services and SOCOM. The IBS is the worldwide DoD standard network enterprise for transmitting time-sensitive tactical and strategic intelligence and targeting data to all echelons of Joint Service operational users. The JPO's role is to coordinate sustainment and modernization of IBS terminals compatible with the CIB. The JTT family of systems currently consists of the JTT-Senior and JTT-IBS systems, and they satisfy RF KPPs for the IBS Program. The JTT is the official IBS producer system, and ensures continued IBS interoperability to a variety of tactical producers/consumers across the Joint Services. JPO IBS Terminals performs JTT life cycle program management through fielding and sustainment of recently upgraded JTT equipment which includes technical fixes as needed in the newly upgraded IBS network that now uses new crypto, a new CIB, and the CMF. Funds support continued technical fixes/enhancements, configuration management for JTT crypto/CIB/CMF capabilities after the FY14 IOC of the newly upgraded IBS network enterprise.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This PE provides funding for analytical support of Analysis of Alternatives (AoA). Based on Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 5000.02, AoAs are required to be completed for a new program start prior to its first Milestone (MS) Decision. AoAs are a statutory requirement for ACAT I and ACAT II programs and regulatory for ACAT III programs.  The AoAs support the preparation of the Capability Development Document (CDD), Key Performance Parameters (KPP) and Thresholds within the CDDs and tradeoff analysis.  The Army must complete and approve an AoA prior to the MS A Decision in order to successfully achieve a MS A decision for new start programs.  This PE provides central funding for new start programs prior to a materiel development decision and which do not yet have a Program Manager assigned for materiel development.  The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy and Plan.  Work in this PE is performed by analytical agencies such as U.S. Army TRADOC Analysis Center and U.S. Army Materiel Systems Analysis Activity.

The Army is projecting to start work on several AoAs beginning in FY 2015, and will assess and fund the highest Army priorities during the year of execution.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>This Program Element (PE) contains funding for Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) support in FY 2016 PE 0604100, AoA (project EC7), consistent with Congressional direction.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This PE provides funding for analytical support of AoAs. Based on Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 5000.02, AoAs are required to be completed for a new program start prior to its first Milestone (MS) Decision. AoAs are a statutory requirement for ACAT I and ACAT II programs and regulatory for ACAT III programs.  The AoAs support the preparation of the Capability Development Document, Key Performance Parameters and Thresholds within the CDDs and tradeoff analysis.  The Army must complete and approve an AoA prior to the MS A Decision in order to successfully achieve a MS A decision for new start programs.  This PE provides central funding for new start programs prior to a materiel development decision and do not yet have a Program Manager assigned for materiel development.  The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy and Plan.  Work in this PE is performed by analytical agencies such as U.S. Army TRADOC Analysis Center and U.S. Army Materiel Systems Analysis Activity.

The Army will assess and fund the highest Army priorities during the year of execution.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) funds prototyping and demonstration of selected technology enabled capabilities to support advanced ground and aviation systems, precision weapons, and Soldier equipment.  Funding facilitates maturation and demonstration of advanced technologies and systems in relevant environments and tactical/operational scenarios, taking technologies to a goal of Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 7 and reducing risk for acquisition programs of record.  Efforts include competitive prototyping earlier in development to facilitate transition of new capabilities into acquisition programs.  Efforts are directed by an Army Senior Executive Steering Group to ensure that demonstrations have high potential for filling capability gaps and transition.  This PE provides the Army an improved mechanism for fulfilling the goals of the Weapon Systems Acquisition Reform Act (WSARA) of 2009 by enabling greater competition in the latter stages of technology maturation and establishes a closer alignment between Science and Technology (S&amp;T) programs and acquisition programs.  

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

                                            <r2:Text>Will begin multi-year effort to fabricate, integrate, and evaluate critical subsystem prototypes in support of the Combat Vehicle Prototyping (CVP) program, reducing the risk of transitioning next-generation and leap-ahead technologies to the Army’s Future Fighting Vehicle.  Will build mature, CVP sub-system prototypes for vehicle blast mitigation, including seat, restraint, hull and floor components; fabricate test fixtures and evaluate component prototypes’ ability to reduce dynamic deformation, blast loading, and occupant injury against increased blast threats; complete foundational seat and restraint specifications and build final products for testing, integrated system demonstration, and risk reduction activities.  Will begin CVP advanced engine and transmission component prototype builds for performance evaluation.  Will begin multi-year effort to mature, demonstrate, and test modular Active Protection System (APS) common architecture, components, and controller that will provide future fighting vehicles with increased protection against current and emerging advanced threats, while maintaining or reducing vehicle weight.  Will verify APS common architecture performance and flexibility in soft-kill configurations by integrating and testing interchangeable soft-kill sensors and countermeasures; conduct maturation testing of these components for performance in realistic and operational environments and to ensure their ability to operate across all relevant scenarios; evaluate APS subsystem interoperability with other ground vehicle subsystems.</r2:Text>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Assured Positioning, Navigation and Timing will provide Army forces with unhindered access to trusted Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) information under conditions where space based PNT (Global Positioning System (GPS)) may be limited or denied. Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memo (JROCM) 049-10, dated April 5th 2010, approved the Positioning, Navigation and Timing Assurance Initial Capabilities Document and designated the Army as the Lead Component for Assured PNT. The Material Development Decision (MDD) was approved on July 30th 2013.  The Assured PNT draft Capabilities Development Document was validated by the Army Requirements Oversight Council (AROC) on July 28th 2014. 

PNT is a critical enabler of many Army systems. The current capability, GPS, is a fixed frequency system which can be impacted by current and emerging threats and field conditions, which means that PNT access and integrity to the Warfighter cannot be guaranteed. This situation degrades mission performance to an unacceptable level. Therefore, current Army systems cannot operate at the required PNT Assurance Levels with GPS alone.

Assured PNT is a family of solutions which includes four subprograms: (1) The Pseudolites subprogram provides PNT Assurance in GPS denied environments by providing terrestrial radio navigation (GPS-like) service in electronically or physically challenged environments using a higher power signal. (2) The Mounted PNT subprogram is the integration of multiple sensors and provides PNT platform distribution. The Mounted PNT subprogram incorporates a System of Systems architecture that acquires, protects and distributes secure PNT on stationary and vehicular platforms. (3) The Dismounted PNT subprogram is the integration of multiple sensors for platform distribution of PNT on the Soldier. The Dismounted PNT subprogram incorporates a System of Systems architecture that acquires, protects and distributes secure PNT wirelessly on the soldier; (4) The Anti-Jam subprogram provides GPS signal protection and PNT Assurance in challenged environments through anti-jam technologies. Anti-jam enables tactical capabilities through assured signal acquisition in challenged environments. 

0604120/ED5 funding has transitioned into four (4) separate project lines for each Assured PNT subprogram. EH8 – Dismounted subprogram. EH9 – Pseudolites subprogram. EJ2 – Mounted subprogram. EJ3 Anti-jam Antenna subprogram.

FY 2016 Base funds in the amount of $30.058 million are provided to continue the development of the Pseudolite sub-program; program planning and technical evaluation of the Assured PNT sub-system and architecture development; integration of M-Code in accordance with Public Law 111-383 Sec 913; participation in various Navigation Warfare (NAVWAR) test events and support to the Military GPS User Equipment (MGUE) Precision Guided Munitions.

ED5 - Assured PNT FY 2015 Base funds in the amount of $9.925 million are associated with EH9 - Pseudolites Subprogram. FY 2015 funds were provided as a new start for the Assured PNT Program to initiate the development of Psuedolites.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Planned Acquisition Strategy for the Pseudolite subprogram includes: 1) Technology maturation of the Transmitter segment through the use of two competitive prototyping, cost-plus fixed fee (CPFF) contracts. 2) Command and Control (C2) segment will leverage the development by other DoD agencies to the greatest extent possible, specifically, the Electronic Warfare Planning and Management Tool (EWPMT); this will be a Government Off the Shelf (GOTS) product. 3) Receiver segment will make the use of multiple contracts through existing vehicles for Pseudolite Receiver SW Prototype Development.

The acquisition strategy includes the acceleration of Military GPS User Equipment (MGUE) Increment 2 for Precision Guided Munitions (AM2P).  This will provide a technology maturity assessment of MGUE Increment 1 technology and increase supply chain competition for subsequent use by Joint Precision Guided Munitions (PGM) to avoid potential significant performance and operation risks. The Joint Common GPS Specification and Interface Control Document will be validated through live fire Technology Readiness Level 6 (TRL6) demonstration. The M-Code GPS enables essential PGM-based lethality capabilities in potential "M-Code Only" GPS combat scenarios and maintains combat overmatch enabled by Joint GPS-based PGMs.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Highly accurate Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) data is a key enabler and a cross cutting capability for Army forces to execute their mission. Army Forces require unhindered access to trusted PNT information under conditions where space based PNT may be limited or denied to maintain its Global Positioning System military advantage on the battlefield. The current capability, Global Positioning System (GPS), is a fixed frequency system which is vulnerable to current and emerging threats and field condition.

Pseudolites provide GPS protection by providing PNT data using terrestrial and airborne based radio navigation GPS satellite-like transmitters in electronically or physically challenged environments using a higher power signal. Area protection can be provided through the deployment of Pseudolite transmitters supporting a Brigade Combat Team area of operations. The Pseudolites subprogram enables continued operations of PNT-enabled systems such as Blue Force Tracker, Communications Networks and Precision Guided Munitions. The PNT Pseudolite sub-program will consist of three segments: 
1.  Pseudolite Transmitter segment provides terrestrial and airborne radio navigation (GPS-like) service in electronically or physically challenged environments using a high power signal.
2.  Command and Control (C2) segment to control the Pseudolites transmitters on the battlefield.
3.  Receiver segment, which will develop software upgrades to current and future military GPS receivers to receive and process the Pseudolite signals.  

FY 2016 Base funds in the amount of $20.358 million are provided to continue the development of the Pseudolite sub-program; program planning and technical evaluation of the Assured PNT sub-system and architecture development; integration of M-Code in accordance with Public Law 111-383 Sec 913; participation in various Navigation Warfare (NAVWAR) test events.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Assured Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) Acquisition Strategy is focused on the acquisition of a family of systems required to achieve the Assured PNT capability. The materiel solutions are partitioned into subprograms (Pseudolites, Mounted PNT, Dismounted PNT, and Anti-jam) to allow for the optimization of solutions for various Army formations.  EH9 is specifically for the acquisition of Pseudolites. 

The acquisition strategy is pending approval by the Milestone Decision Authority, Milestone A is scheduled for 2QFY15. 

Pseudolite Milestone B is planned for FY 2018. After a successful MS B approval the proposed strategy is to award a single Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract with priced options for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) and for the procurement of all technical data relevant to the performance of this contract or life cycle of this program.

The Planned Acquisition Strategy for the Pseudolite subprogram includes: 1) Technology maturation of the Transmitter segment through the use of two competitive prototyping, cost-plus fixed fee (CPFF) contracts. 2) Command and Control (C2) segment will leverage the development by other DoD agencies to the greatest extent possible, specifically, the Electronic Warfare Planning and Management Tool (EWPMT); this will be a Government Off the Shelf (GOTS) product. 3) Receiver segment will make the use of multiple contracts through existing vehicles for Pseudolite Receiver SW Prototype Development.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program supports the overall Air and Missile Defense (AMD) architecture and provides a robust intercept capability against Cruise Missiles (CM), Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) and Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar (RAM) threats for deployed forces.  The Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment 2 - Intercept (IFPC Inc 2-I) is a ground-based weapon system that will be designed to acquire, track, engage, and defeat UAS, CM, and RAM. The System will provide 360-degree protection and will simultaneously engage threats arriving from different azimuths. A block acquisition approach will be used to provide this capability. The Block 1 system will consist of an existing interceptor and sensor and development of technical fire control and a Multi-Mission Launcher (MML) to support the UAS and CM mission. The IFPC Inc 2-I System will be compatible with the Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) Command and Control (C2) architecture. The IFPC Inc 2-I System will be transportable by Army common mobile platforms.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>
