                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Defense Research Sciences consists of extramural research activities in academia and industry along with in-house investigations performed in the Air Force Research Laboratory. This program funds fundamental broad-based scientific and engineering research in areas critical to Air Force weapon, sensor, and support systems.  All research areas are subject to long-range planning and technical review by both Air Force and tri-Service scientific planning groups. Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication. 

This program is in Budget Activity 1, Basic Research, because this budget activity includes scientific study and experimentation directed toward increasing fundamental knowledge and understanding in those fields of the physical, engineering, environmental, and life sciences related to long-term national security needs.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Basic research in the Physics and Electronics Project seeks to enable revolutionary advances and expand the fundamental knowledge supporting technologies critical to the future of the Air Force. Research stresses high-risk, far-term, game-changing capability breakthroughs essential for future leaps in warfighter system performance, functionality, reliability, and survivability while simultaneously reducing component and system power, size, mass, and life cycle costs. Major thrust areas being investigated in this project are complex electronics and fundamental quantum processes; plasma physics and high energy density non-equilibrium processes; and lasers and optics, electromagnetics, communication, and signal processing. Although the major thrust descriptions that follow are specific sub-areas of focus within this project, there is interest in exploring novel ideas that may bridge these major thrusts as well as those in the other projects within this program.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Basic research in the Aerospace, Chemical, and Materials Sciences Project seeks to enable revolutionary advances and expand the fundamental knowledge supporting technologies critical to the future of the Air Force. Research stresses high-risk, far-term, game-changing capability breakthroughs essential for future leaps in warfighter system performance, functionality, reliability, and survivability while simultaneously reducing component and system power, size, mass, and life cycle costs. Major thrust areas being investigated in this project are aero-structure interactions and control; energy, power, and propulsion; and complex materials and structures. Although the major thrust descriptions that follow are specific sub-areas of focus within this project, there is interest in exploring novel ideas that may bridge these major thrusts as well as those in the other projects within this program.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program supports defense-related basic research in a wide range of scientific and engineering disciplines relevant to maintaining U.S. military technology superiority. Research topics include, but are not limited to, transformational and high priority technologies such as nanotechnology, sensor networks, intelligence information fusion, smart materials and structures, efficient energy and power conversion, and high-energy materials for propulsion and control. The program also enhances and promotes the education of U.S. scientists and engineers in disciplines critical to maintaining, advancing, and enabling future U.S. defense technologies. For example, the National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate (NDSEG) program awards fellowships to train U.S citizens in science and engineering disciplines of military importance under a joint tri-Service and Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering competition. Finally, this program assists universities in establishing superior instrumentation capabilities needed to improve the quality of defense-related research and education. A fundamental component of this program is the recognition that future technologies and technology exploitations require highly coordinated and concerted multi- and inter-disciplinary efforts. Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication. 
 
This program is in Budget Activity 1, Basic Research because this budget activity includes scientific study and experimentation directed toward increasing fundamental knowledge and understanding in those fields of the physical, engineering, environmental, and life sciences related to long-term national security needs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program funds basic research aimed at developing fundamental scientific knowledge to support future Department of Defense (DoD) high energy laser (HEL) systems.  This programs funds multi-disciplinary research institutes to conduct research on laser and beam control technologies.  In addition, this program supports educational grants to stimulate interest in HELs.  These educational grants are used for educational tools, scholarships, and summer intern employees in military laboratories.  Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the DoD Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.  

This program is in Budget Activity 1, Basic Research because this budget activity includes scientific study and experimentation directed toward increasing fundamental knowledge and understanding in those fields of the physical, engineering, environmental, and life sciences related to long-term national security needs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program develops advanced materials, processing, and inspection technologies to reduce life cycle costs and improve performance, sustainability, availability, affordability, supportability, reliability, and survivability of current and future Air Force systems and operations.  The program has three projects that develop: structural, propulsion, and sub-systems materials and processes technologies; electronic, optical, and survivability materials and processes technologies; and sustainment materials, processes technologies, and advanced non-destructive inspection methodologies.  Efforts in the program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication. 

This program is in Budget Activity 2, Applied Research because this budget activity includes studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts directed toward general military needs with a view toward developing and evaluating the feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions and determining their parameters.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project develops the materials and processing technology base for aircraft, spacecraft, launch systems, and missiles to improve affordability, maintainability, and performance of current and future Air Force systems. A family of affordable lightweight materials is being developed, including metals, polymers, ceramics, metallic and nonmetallic composites, and hybrid materials to provide upgraded capabilities for existing aircraft, missile, and propulsion systems to meet the future system requirements. The project develops high-temperature turbine engine materials that will enable engine designs to double the turbine engine thrust-to-weight ratio. Advanced high temperature protection materials are being developed that are affordable, lightweight, dimensionally stable, thermally conductive, and/or ablation and erosion resistant to meet aerospace and missile requirements. Alternative or replacement materials are being developed to maintain the performance of aging operational systems. Materials for thermal management including coolants, adaptive thermally conductive materials, coatings, friction and wear-resistant materials, and other pervasive nonstructural materials technologies are being developed for directed energy, propulsion, and subsystems on aircraft, spacecraft, and missiles. The project concurrently develops advanced processing methods to enable adaptive processing of aerospace materials.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Materials for protection of aircrews, sensors, and aircraft from laser and high-power microwave directed energy threats are also developed.  Electronic and optical materials are being developed to enable surveillance and situational awareness with faster operating speeds, greater tunability, higher power output, improved thermal management (including higher operating temperatures), greater sensitivity, and extended dynamic range.  New materials are being developed to counter the most prominent laser threats and to respond to emerging and agile threat wavelengths without impairing mission effectiveness. The project develops nanostructured and biological materials for aircraft structures, munitions, air vehicle subsystems, and personnel. The project develops novel materials for electromagnetic interactions with matter for electromagnetic pulse, high power microwave, and lightning strike protection.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project develops materials and processing technologies to support operational Air Force mission areas by providing the ability to inspect the quality of delivered systems, transitioning more reliable and maintainable materials, establishing a capability to detect and characterize performance threatening defects, characterizing materials processes and properties necessary for materials transition, and providing quick reaction support and failure analysis to the operational commands and repair centers.  Repair techniques and nondestructive inspection/evaluation (NDI/E) methods are developed that are needed for metallic and non-metallic structures, coatings, corrosion control processes, and to support integration of composite structures for aerospace systems.  Various NDI/E methods are essential to ensure optimum quality in the design and production of aircraft, propulsion, and missile systems.  These NDI/E methods are also essential to monitor and detect the onset of any service-initiated damage and/or deterioration due to aging of operational systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program investigates, develops, and analyzes aerospace vehicle technologies in the three primary areas of structures, controls, and aerodynamics for legacy and future aerospace vehicles. Advanced structures concepts are explored and developed to exploit new materials, fabrication processes, and design techniques. Flight control technologies are developed and simulated for aerospace vehicles. Advanced aerodynamic vehicle configurations are developed and analyzed through simulations, experiments, and multi-disciplinary analyses. Resulting technologies improve performance of existing and future manned and remotely piloted air vehicles, sustained high speed, and space access vehicles. Improvements include, but are not limited to, reduced energy use by efficient air platform designs, use of lightweight composite structures and improved sustainment methods based on the condition of the platform and sub-systems. Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication. 

This program is in Budget Activity 2, Applied Research because this budget activity includes studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts directed toward general military needs with a view toward developing and evaluating the feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions and determining their parameters.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project conducts applied research to advance machine intelligence, information operations, and operator-aiding technologies for advanced ISR capabilities. Research is focused in the following areas: human analyst augmentation, human trust and interaction, and human signatures. The human analyst augmentation area develops, integrates, and evaluates human-centric analyst technology to develop cognitive systems engineering solutions for airman data overload, work integration, and mission performance, enhancing operationally effective ISR for the Air Force. The human trust and interaction area seeks to advance human language technologies to benefit military linguists and analysts as well as to understand, quantify, and calibrate trust factors influencing airman interaction with autonomous systems that can be applied to airman-machine teaming in future weapon systems. The human signatures area develops and applies S&amp;T to detect and exploit a variety of human-centered signatures, including behavioral and anthropometric aspects of existing and emerging adversaries as well as nano, bio, and molecular signatures of airman performance.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project conducts applied research on the effects of human exposure to nanomaterials, EM energy (radio frequency to optical), scalable directed energy weapons, and non-lethal weapons.  This research addresses fundamental physical principles, as well as the psychophysical interaction between directed energy and the individual or groups of individuals.  Research is divided into three core focus areas:  optical radiation bioeffects; radio frequency radiation (RFR) bioeffects; and molecular bioeffects.  Optical radiation bioeffects research enhances combat survivability and systems effectiveness through technologies that enable deployed forces to counter optical threats and exploit optical systems for offensive applications.  The RFR bioeffects research investigates basic biological mechanisms of RFR, conducts theoretical and empirical dosimetry, conducts research of bioeffects from short- and long-term exposures, develops methods to counter RFR threats, and performs research for exploitation of directed energy systems for offensive capabilities.  Molecular bioeffects research is conducted to protect airmen from the effects of toxic chemicals and materials and to monitor and enhance cognitive and physiological performance.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program develops propulsion and power technologies to achieve enabling and revolutionary aerospace technology capabilities. The program has six projects, each focusing on a technology area critical to the Air Force. The Advanced Propulsion Technology project develops high-speed air breathing propulsion engines to include combined cycle, ramjet, and hypersonic scramjet technologies to enable revolutionary propulsion capability for the Air Force. The Combustion and Mechanical Systems project evaluates lubricants and combustion concepts and technologies for new and existing engines. The Turbine Engine Technology project develops enabling capabilities to enhance performance and affordability of existing weapon systems and develops component technologies for ultra high pressure ratio, substantially improved durability, and adaptive cycle engine architecture to provide optimized performance, fuel efficiency, and life for widely varying mission needs. The Aerospace Power Technology project develops electrical power and thermal management technologies for military applications that are part of energy optimized aircraft development. The Rocket Propulsion Technology project develops advances in rocket propulsion technologies for space access, space maneuver, missiles, the sustainment of strategic systems, and tactical rockets. The Aerospace Fuel Technology project evaluates hydrocarbon-based fuels for legacy and advanced turbine engines, scramjets, pulse detonation, and combined-cycle engines. Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication. 

This program is in Budget Activity 2, Applied Research because this budget activity includes studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts directed toward general military needs with a view toward developing and evaluating the feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions and determining their parameters.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project evaluates lubricants, mechanical systems, and combustion concepts for advanced turbine engines, pulse detonation engines, and combined cycle engines. This project also develops technologies to increase turbine engine operational reliability, durability, mission flexibility, maintainability, and performance while reducing weight, fuel consumption, and cost of ownership. Applications include missiles, aircraft, and re-usable high-speed vehicles. Analytical and experimental areas of emphasis include lubricants, bearings, mechanical systems diagnostics, mechanical systems prognostics, rotor dynamics, oil-less engine technology, optical diagnostics, fundamental combustion, detonations, combustors, and afterburners. Lubricants for these engines must be thermally stable, cost-effective, and operate over a broad range of conditions. Advanced combustion concepts must be cost-effective, durable, and reduce pollutant emissions. A portion of this project supports adaptive cycle technologies. This effort develops component technology for an adaptive cycle engine architecture that provides both optimized performance and fuel efficiency for widely varying mission needs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project develops rocket propulsion technologies for space access, space maneuver, the sustainment of strategic systems (including solid boost/missile propulsion, post boost control, aging and surveillance efforts), and tactical missiles. Analytical and experimental areas of emphasis are propellants, propellant management, combustion, rocket material applications, technology for sustainment of strategic systems, and innovative space propulsion concepts. Technologies of interest will improve reliability, performance, survivability, affordability, and environmental compatibility of these systems. Technologies are developed to reduce the weight and cost of components using new materials and improved designs and manufacturing techniques. All efforts in this project contribute to the sustainment of the rocket propulsion industry, providing rocket propulsion technology for the entire DoD. Technologies developed under this program enable capabilities of interest to both DoD and NASA. Efforts include modeling and simulation, proof of concept tests of critical components, advanced component development, and ground-based tests. Aging and surveillance efforts could reduce lifetime prediction uncertainties for individual motors by 50%, enabling motor replacement for cause. All efforts are part of the Rocket Propulsion 21 (RP21) program and reviewed by a DoD level steering committee yearly for relevance to DoD missions and achievement of RP21 Goals.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program develops the technology base for Air Force aerospace sensors and electronic combat.  Advances in aerospace sensors are required to increase combat effectiveness by providing anytime, anywhere surveillance, reconnaissance, precision targeting, and electronic warfare capabilities.  To achieve this progress, this program pursues simultaneous advances in:  1) generating, controlling, receiving, and processing electronic and photonic signals for radio frequency (RF) sensor aerospace applications; 2) electro-optical (EO) aerospace sensor technologies for a variety of offensive and defensive uses; 3) RF antennas and associated electronics for airborne and space surveillance, together with active and passive EO sensors; 4) technologies to manage and fuse on-board sensor information for timely, comprehensive situational awareness; and 5) technology for reliable, all-weather surveillance, reconnaissance, and precision strike RF sensors and electronic combat systems.  This program has been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.  

This program is in Budget Activity 2, Applied Research because this budget activity includes scientific study and experimentation directed toward increasing fundamental knowledge and understanding in those fields of the physical, engineering, environmental, and life sciences related to long-term national security needs.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project develops the technologies required to perform management and fusion of sensor information for timely, comprehensive situational awareness, automatic target recognition, integrated fire control, and bomb damage assessment.  This project determines the feasibility of technologies and concepts for fire control that help to precisely locate, identify, and target airborne and surface targets.  The project emphasizes finding reduced signature targets and targets of opportunity.  It will enable new covert tactics for successful air-to-air and air-to-surface strikes.  This project also develops the technologies required to create trusted autonomic, distributed, collaborative, and self-organizing sensor systems that provide anticipatory and persistent intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), situational awareness, and decision support for multi-layered sensing.  This program provides the technologies for:  1) trusted sensors and trusted sensor systems that will deter reverse engineering and exploitation of our critical hardware and software technology and impede unwanted technology transfer, alteration of system capability, and prevent the development of countermeasures to U.S. systems; 2) collaborative tasking of our own distributed heterogeneous sensor networks across a region and co-opted tasking of both traditional and non-traditional adversary sensors; 3) secure sensor web backbone technologies, sensor web physical topologies, and related protocols to assure reliable trusted sensor interactions; and 4) defining architectures for distributed trusted collaborative heterogeneous sensor systems and semantic sensor networks, developing new methodologies for system of systems sensor engineering and analysis, and new techniques for sensor network situation awareness and predictive analytics.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project develops and assesses affordable, reliable all weather radio frequency (RF) sensing and countermeasure concepts for aerospace applications covering the range of RF sensors including communications, navigation, intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance (ISR), and radar, both active and passive, across the air, land, sea, space and cyber domains.  This project also develops and evaluates technology for ISR sensors, fire control radars, electronic warfare, integrated radar and electronic warfare systems, and offensive information operations systems.  It emphasizes the detection and tracking of surface and airborne targets with RF signatures that are difficult to detect due to reduced radar cross sections, concealment and camouflage measures, severe clutter, or heavy jamming.  Techniques exploited include the use of multiple RF phenomenologies, multi-dimensional adaptive processing, advanced waveforms and knowledge-aided processing techniques.  This project also develops the RF warning and countermeasure technology for advanced electronic warfare and information operations applications. Specifically, it develops techniques and technologies to detect and counter the communications links and sensors of threat air defense systems and hostile command and control networks.  The project also exploits emerging technologies and components to provide increased capability for offensive and defensive RF sensors, including radar warning, RF electronic warfare, and electronic intelligence applications.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element focuses on four major areas.  First, space survivability and surveillance develops technologies to understand space weather and the geophysics environment for mitigation and exploitation of these effects to Air Force systems.  Second, spacecraft payload technologies improve satellite payload operations by developing advanced component and subsystem capabilities.  Third, spacecraft protection develops technologies for protecting U.S. space assets in potential hostile settings.  The last major area, spacecraft vehicles, focuses on spacecraft platform and control technologies, and their interactions.  Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.  This program is in Budget Activity 2, Applied Research because this budget activity includes studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts directed toward general military needs with a view toward developing and evaluating the feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions and determining their parameters.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program investigates, develops, and establishes the technical feasibility and military utility of guidance and ordnance technologies for conventional air-launched munitions.  Program supports core technical competencies of fuze technology; energetic materials; damage mechanisms; munitions aerodynamics, guidance, navigation, and control; terminal seeker sciences; and munition systems effects.  Technologies to be developed include blast, fragmentation, penetrating and low-collateral damage warheads, hard target fuzing, precise terminal guidance, and high performance and insensitive explosives.  Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.  

This program is in Budget Activity 2, Applied Research because this budget activity includes studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts directed toward general military needs with a view toward developing and evaluating the feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions and determining their parameters.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program covers research in directed energy (DE) technologies, primarily high energy lasers (HELs), including devices, optical beam control, and integration; ground-based optical space situational awareness (SSA); and high power electromagnetics (HPEM).  Laser research includes moderate to high power laser devices that are applicable to a wide range of applications, optical technologies to propagate lasers beams from a device, and integration of these technologies.  In SSA, this research uses the Starfire Optical Range and the Maui Space Surveillance System to develop and implement technologies to identify visual characteristics such as status and health of orbiting space objects.  In HPEM, this research examines technologies for applications such as counter-electronics and non-lethal weapons.  Research into other novel DE applications will be conducted.  DE vulnerability/lethality assessments are conducted and protection technologies are developed.  Research into other advanced non-conventional/innovative weapons will be conducted.  Tools are developed and used to compare solutions and to determine the most effective and efficient DE technologies to meet Air Force needs.  Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.  

This program is in Budget Activity 2, Applied Research because this budget activity includes studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts directed toward general military needs with a view toward developing and evaluating the feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions and determining their parameters.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program develops enterprise-centric information technology for the Air Force. Advances in enterprise-centric information technologies are required to increase warfighter readiness and effectiveness by providing the right information, at the right time, in the right format, anytime, anywhere in the world. The Connectivity and Protection Tech project provides the technologies for multi-level, secure, seamless networks; advanced communications processors; anti-jam and low probability of intercept techniques, as well as technologies that deter any adversary from attacking computer systems while allowing access to, presence on, manipulation of, and operational effects on adversary computer systems. This project also develops the technology base for the next generation of ultra-wide-bandwidth, multi-channeled, air- and space-based communications networks. The Information Management and Computational Tech project provides advances in information management and dissemination technologies to ensure the delivery of high-quality, timely, secure information to the warfighter, and develop technologies to produce both advanced on demand computational processing and computer architectures with greater capacity and sophistication for addressing dynamic mission objectives under constraints imposed by Air Force systems. The Information Decision Making Tech project develops the technology to support the commander and staff's ability to command all viable options to achieve desired effects across the full spectrum of operations. The Operational Awareness Tech project develops technologies that improve their capability to generate, process, manage, fuse, exploit, interpret, and disseminate timely and accurate information. The Research Site Support project provides the Rome Research Site infrastructure at Rome, NY and provides for the continued operations of all Rome Research Site properties, buildings, and services necessary for the research mission. This program has been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication. 

This program is in Budget Activity 2, Applied Research because this budget activity includes studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts directed toward general military needs with a view toward developing and evaluating the feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions and determining their parameters.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Air Force requires the capability to maximize the value, sharing, management, and use of its information and information assets in achieving its mission objectives as the importance of information grows in the current net-centric environment.  Technology development in this project must be capable of taking advantage of future net-centric environments including new structured and ad hoc processes in response to rapidly changing warfare challenges.  Advances in robust information management focus on quality of service and flow of information within the enterprise, information transformation and brokering, secure information sharing across and among domains, and collaboration of workflow within the enterprise.  Technologies addressed in this project include the ability to globally share, discover, and access information across organizational, functional, and coalition boundaries and between and among domains, the timely delivery of information to tactical assets, the tailoring and prioritization of  information based on mission needs and importance, and the scaling, robustness, and collaboration features required of the Air Force net-centric information management environment.  In addition, the Air Force requires the development of superior, intelligent, on-demand computing to enable information superiority.  Technology development in this project focuses on producing: computer architectures with greater capacity and sophistication for addressing constrained, dynamic mission objectives; "game-changing" computing power to the warfighter; disruptive computing power at the tactical edge and for federated grid services; and interactive and real-time computing improving the usability of high-performance computing to the Air Force.  It includes technologies in computational sciences and engineering, computer architectures, and software intensive systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Air Force requires technologies that improve and automate the capability to generate, process, manage, fuse, exploit, interpret, and disseminate timely and accurate information.  This project provides not only a network-centric, collaborative intelligence analysis capability that enables the fusion of multi-intelligence and sensor sources to provide timely situational awareness, understanding, and anticipation of the threats in the battlespace, but also the advanced, novel exploitation technologies needed to intercept, collect, locate, and process both covert and overt raw data from intelligence and sensor sources.  It leads the research, discovery, and development of technology that enables the fusion of multi-intelligence sources to provide accurate object tracking and identification (ID), situational awareness, understanding, and anticipation of the threats in the battlespace (air, ground, space, and cyber).  It also leads in the development of advanced exploitation technologies to maximize the intelligence gained from our adversaries in the areas of spectral detection and geolocation, signal recognition and analysis, and the data tagging, tracking, and tracing via the insertion of secure, imperceptible signal embedding for future fusion and understanding of the information.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Air Force Research Laboratory Information Directorate leads the discovery, development and implementation of information science and technology to drive transformation within the Air Force and across the DoD. The focus of the work is to provide the warfighter with the required technology-based capabilities to defend the Nation by unleashing the power of innovative information science and technology to anticipate, find, fix, track, target, engage, and assess anything, anytime, anywhere. Since the site is a single-purpose location not located on a military installation, the Information Directorate has unique requirements for supporting its S&amp;T mission.  As the host unit, the directorate is responsible to provide the Rome Research Site infrastructure at Rome, NY and provide for the continued operations of all Rome Research Site properties, buildings, and services necessary for the research mission.  Operations include: logistics and communication services, utilities, maintenance of facilities and structures, safety and security of the workforce and visiting researchers, and ensures compliance with the laws, regulations and directives that pertain to site operations.  These services are host unit responsibilities and are necessary to provide a safe and effective environment for the Research Site's workforce and mission.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program funds Department of Defense (DoD) high energy laser (HEL) applied research through the HEL Joint Technology Office (JTO).  This program is part of an overall DoD HEL Science and Technology (S&amp;T) program.  HEL weapon systems have many potential advantages including speed-of-light delivery, precision target engagement, significant magazine depth, low-cost per kill, and reduced logistics requirements.  HELs have the potential to perform a wide variety of military missions including defeat of high-speed, maneuvering anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles and the ultra-precision negation of targets in urban environments with minimal collateral damage.  Efforts funded under this program are generally chosen for their potential to have an impact on multiple HEL systems and multiple Service missions while complimenting Service/Agency programs that are directed at specific Service needs.  A broad range of technologies are addressed in key areas such as laser sources, laser beam control, modeling and simulation, and laser lethality mechanisms.  Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the DoD S&amp;T Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.  

This program is in Budget Activity 2, Applied Research because this budget activity includes studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts directed toward general military needs with a view toward developing and evaluating the feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions and determining their parameters.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program develops and demonstrates materials technology for transition into Air Force systems.  The program has four projects which develop: hardened materials technologies for the protection of aircrews and sensors; non-destructive inspection and evaluation technologies; transition data on structural and non-structural materials for aerospace applications; and airbase operations technologies including deployable base infrastructure, force protection, and fire fighting capabilities. Efforts in the program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense Science and Technology Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication. 

This program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development because this budget activity includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and/or tests in a simulated environment.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project develops and demonstrates mature Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) sustainment technologies such as: materials, corrosion, maintenance/repair techniques, state awareness/non-destructive inspection, health management, life prediction, composite certification and logistics for transition into fielded Air Force systems to reduce life cycle sustainment costs and increase readiness. Technologies matured and demonstrated impact affordability and availability of fielded aerospace weapon systems by reducing sustainment costs, extending service life, and maintaining mission readiness and capability. This project develops and demonstrates maintenance, life cycle management, and system/ fleet decision making technologies that can be implemented to address operational sustainment issues and could influence future system sustainability decisions via risk reduction to support inclusion into new systems. Studies are conducted to analyze processes and methodologies for application of technologies to address sustainment issues across the force, identifying cross cutting applications for fielded systems, and opportunities for building in sustainability into future applications. Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&amp;T) process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication. 

This program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development because this budget activity includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and/or tests in a simulated environment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Divided into two broad project areas, Advanced Aerospace Sensors develops technologies to enable the continued superiority of sensors from aerospace platforms. The first project area develops and demonstrates advanced technologies for electro-optical sensors, radar sensors and electronic counter-countermeasures, and components and algorithms. The second project area develops and demonstrates radio frequency (RF) and electro-optical (EO) sensors for detecting, locating, and targeting airborne, fixed, and time-critical mobile ground targets obscured by natural or man-made means. Together, the projects in this program develop the means to find, fix, target, track, and engage air and ground targets anytime, anywhere, and in any weather. This program has been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication. 

This program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development because this budget activity includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and/or tests in a simulated environment.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project area develops and demonstrates advanced technologies for attack management, fire control, and target identification and recognition.  This includes developing and demonstrating integrated and cooperative fire control techniques to provide for adverse-weather precision air strikes against multiple targets per pass and at maximum weapon launch ranges.  Specific fire control technologies under development include attack management, sensor fusion, automated decision aids, advanced tracking for low radar cross section threats, and targeting using both on-board and off-board sensor information.  This project area also evaluates targeting techniques to support theater missile defense efforts in surveillance and attack.  These fire control technologies will provide force multiplication and reduce warfighter exposure to hostile fire.  This project area also develops and demonstrates target identification and recognition technologies for positive, high confidence cueing, recognition, and identification of airborne and ground-based, high-value, time-critical targets at longer ranges than are currently possible.  The goal is to apply these technologies to tactical air-to-air and air-to-surface weapon systems so they are able to operate in all weather conditions, during day or night, and in high-threat, multiple target environments.  Model-based vision algorithms and target signature development techniques are the key to target identification and recognition.  This project is maturing these technologies in partnership with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and evaluating the techniques to support theater missile defense efforts in surveillance and attack.  Fire control and recognition technologies developed and demonstrated in this project area are high leverage efforts, providing for significant advancements in operational capabilities largely through software improvements readily transitionable to new and existing weapon systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>These projects support Department of Defense (DoD) priorities for demonstrations in hypersonics and unmanned systems, respectively.  This program integrates and demonstrates advanced flight vehicle technologies that improve the performance and supportability of existing and future aerospace vehicles. System level integration brings together aerospace vehicle technologies along with avionics, propulsion, and weapon systems for demonstration in a near-realistic operational environment. Integration and technology demonstrations reduce the risk and time required to transition technologies into operational aircraft.  In FY 2015, this program has two new projects, High Speed/Hypersonic Integration and Demonstration and Flight Systems Control. Efforts  in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.  This program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development because this budget activity includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and/or tests in a simulated environment.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program develops and demonstrates technologies to achieve enabling and revolutionary advances in turbine, advanced cycle, rocket, and space propulsion as well as electrical power, thermal management and fuels. The program has six projects, each focusing on technologies with a high potential to enhance the performance of existing and future Air Force weapons systems. The Aerospace Fuels project develops and demonstrates improved hydrocarbon fuels and advanced propulsion systems, including those for air-breathing high-speed/hypersonic flight. The Aerospace Power Technology project develops and demonstrates power and thermal management systems for weapons and aircraft as part of energy-optimized aircraft development. The Aircraft Propulsion Subsystems Integration project integrates the engine cores demonstrated in the Advanced Turbine Engine Gas Generator project with low-pressure components into demonstrator engines. The Space and Missile Rocket Propulsion project develops and demonstrates innovative rocket propulsion technologies, propellants, and manufacturing techniques. The Advanced Aerospace Propulsion project develops the scramjet propulsion cycle to a technology readiness level appropriate for in-flight demonstration and for full integration with other engine cycles (including turbine and rocket based). The Advanced Turbine Engine Gas Generator project develops and demonstrates core turbine engine technologies for current and future aircraft propulsion systems. Portions of the Aerospace Fuels, Advanced Turbine Engine Gas Generator, and Aerospace Propulsion Subsystems Integration projects support adaptive cycle technology demonstrations, which develop component technology for an adaptive cycle engine architecture that provides optimized performance, fuel efficiency, and durability for widely varying mission needs. Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication. 

This program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development because this budget activity includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and/or tests in a simulated environment.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project develops and demonstrates technology to increase turbine engine operational reliability, durability, mission flexibility, and performance while reducing weight, fuel consumption, and cost of ownership. The Aerospace Propulsion Subsystems Integration (APSI) project includes demonstrator engines for manned systems and concept and efficient small-scale propulsion for remotely piloted aircraft and cruise missile applications. The demonstrator engines integrate the core (high-pressure spool) technology developed under the Advanced Turbine Engine Gas Generator (ATEGG) project with the engine (low-pressure spool) technology such as fans, turbines, engine controls, mechanical systems, exhaust nozzles, and augmentors. Additionally, this project includes activities to improve propulsion safety and readiness. This project also focuses on integration of inlets, nozzles, engine-to-airframe compatibility, and power and thermal management subsystemstechnologies. The APSI project provides aircraft with potential for longer range and higher cruise speeds with lower specific fuel consumption, surge power for successful engagements, high sortie rates with reduced maintenance, reduced life cycle cost, and improved survivability, resulting in increased mission effectiveness. Technologies developed are applicable to sustained high-speed vehicles and responsive space launch. The APSI project is focused on improving propulsion capabilities while at the same time reducing the cost of ownership. Anticipated technology advances include turbine engine improvements providing approximately twice the range for a sustained supersonic combat aircraft, doubling the time on station with ten times the power output for surveillance aircraft and propulsion for a high speed supersonic missile with double the range for time sensitive targets. A portion of this project supports the demonstration of adaptive cycle technologies, which develop component technology for an adaptive cycle engine architecture that provides optimized performance, fuel efficiency, and durability for widely varying mission needs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project develops and demonstrates advanced and innovative low-cost rocket turbo-machinery and components, and low-cost space launch propulsion technologies.  Additionally, this project develops technologies for the sustainment of strategic systems (including solid rocket motor boosters and missile propulsion, post boost control, and aging and surveillance efforts) and tactical rockets. Characteristics such as environmental acceptability, affordability, reliability, responsiveness, reduced weight, and reduced operation and launch costs are emphasized. Increased life and performance of propulsion systems are key goals. Technology areas investigated include ground demonstrations of compact, lightweight, advanced propulsion technologies, higher efficiency energy conversion systems (derived from an improved understanding of combustion fundamentals), and high-energy propellants. Technological advances developed in this program could improve the performance of expendable payload capabilities by approximately twenty to fifty percent and reduce launch, operations, and support costs by approximately thirty percent. Responsiveness and operability of propulsion systems will be enhanced for reusable launch systems. Aging and surveillance efforts for solid rocket motors could reduce lifetime prediction uncertainties for individual motors by fifty percent, enabling motor replacement for cause. The efforts in this project contribute to the sustainment of the rocket propulsion industry, providing rocket propulsion technology for the entire Department of Defense and NASA. The project efforts are part of the Rocket Propulsion 21 (RP21) program. The project efforts are reviewed by a DoD level steering committee annually for relevance to DoD missions and achievement of technical goals defined by the RP21 program.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project develops and demonstrates, via ground and flight tests, the scramjet propulsion cycle to a technology readiness level appropriate for full integration with other engine cycles (including turbine and rocket-based) to provide the Air Force with transformational military capabilities. The primary focus is on the hydrocarbon- fueled, scramjet engine. Multi-cycle engines will provide the propulsion systems for possible application to support aircraft and weapon platforms operating up to Mach 7. Efforts include scramjet flow-path optimization to enable operation over the widest possible range of Mach numbers, active combustion control to assure continuous positive thrust (even during mode transition), robust flame-holding to maintain stability through flow distortions, and maximized volume-to-surface area to minimize the thermal load imposed by the high-speed engine. Thermal management plays a vital role in scramjet and combined cycle engines, including considerations for protecting low speed propulsion systems (e.g., turbine engines) during hypersonic flight.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project develops and demonstrates technology to increase turbine engine operational reliability, durability, mission flexibility, and performance while reducing weight, fuel consumption, and cost of ownership. The objective is to provide the continued evolution of technologies into an advanced gas generator in which the performance, cost, durability, repairability, and maintainability can be assessed in a realistic engine environment. The gas generator, or core, is the basic building block of the engine and nominally consists of a compressor, a combustor, a high-pressure turbine, mechanical systems, and core subsystems. Experimental core engine demonstration validates engineering design tools and enhances rapid, low-risk transition of key engine technologies into engineering development, where they can be applied to derivative and/or new systems. These technologies are applicable to a wide range of military and commercial systems including aircraft, missiles, land combat vehicles, ships, and responsive space launch. Component technologies are demonstrated in a core (sub-engine). This project also assesses the impact of low spool components such as; inlet systems, fans, low pressure turbines,exhaust systems, and system level technologies such as; integrated power generators and thermal management systems on core engine performance, and durability in ground demonstrations of engine cores. The core performances of this project are validated on demonstrator engines in the Aerospace Propulsion Subsystems Integration Project of this program. A portion of this project supports the demonstration of adaptive cycle technologies, which develop component technology for an adaptive cycle engine architecture that provides optimized performance, fuel efficiency, and durability for widely varying mission needs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program develops and demonstrates technologies to support Air Force electronic combat warfighting capabilities.  The program focuses on developing components, subsystems, and technologies with potential aerospace combat, special operations, and airlift electronic combat applications in four project areas.  The first project develops and demonstrates technologies for integrating electronic combat sensors and systems into a fused and seamless whole.  The second project integrates and focuses research efforts in electronic warfare (EW), directed energy weapons (DEW), and cyber warfare to rapidly demonstrate a capability for rapid fielding.  The third project develops and demonstrates advanced technologies for radio-frequency electronic combat suites.  The fourth project develops and demonstrates advanced warning and countermeasure technologies to defeat electro-optical, infrared, and laser threats to aerospace platforms.  This program has been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.  

This program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development because this budget activity includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and/or tests in a simulated environment.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project funds the development, demonstration, and evaluation of radiation-hardened space electronic hardware, satellite control hardware, and software for advanced satellite surveillance operations.  Future improved space-qualifiable electronics and software for data and signal processing will be more interchangeable, interoperable, and standardized.  In the near-term, this project's work concentrates on converting (i.e., radiation-hardening) commercial data and signal processor technologies for use in Air Force space systems.  For mid-term applications, this project merges advanced, radiation-hardened space processor, memory, and interconnect technologies with commercially-derived, open system architectures to develop and demonstrate robust, on-board processing capabilities for 21st century Department of Defense (DoD) satellites.  In the long-term, this project area focuses on developing low-cost, easily modifiable software and hardware architectures for fully autonomous constellations of intelligent satellites capable of performing all mission related functions without operator intervention.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program develops and demonstrates technologies to enhance airman performance and effectiveness in the aerospace force.  State-of-the-science advances are made in warfighter training, warfighter system interfaces, directed energy bioeffects, deployment and sustainment of warfighters in extreme environments, and understanding and shaping adversarial behavior.  The Directed Energy Bioeffects Parameters project develops, demonstrates, and transitions technologies to predict, evaluate, and mitigate the effects of directed energy on personnel and mission performance, and exploits the offensive capabilities of directed energy systems.  The Human Dynamics and Terrain Demonstration project develops, demonstrates, and transitions human-centric technologies to address processing, exploitation, and dissemination of intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capability needs.  The Mission Effective Performance project develops, demonstrates, and transitions advanced training, simulation, mission rehearsal, and other performance-aiding methods and technologies to enhance warfighter readiness.  The Warfighter Interfaces project develops, demonstrates, and transitions technologies to revolutionize the way airmen synergistically use Air Force systems, including autonomous machines and adaptive teams of airmen and machines.  Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.  

This program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development because this budget activity includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and/or tests in a simulated environment.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project develops, demonstrates, and integrates advanced ordnance and guidance technologies for air-launched conventional weapons.  The program focuses on conventional ordnance component technologies such as warheads, fuzes, and explosives, as well as munition guidance component technologies such as navigation and control systems and seekers.  Technologies to be developed, demonstrated, and integrated address blast, fragmentation, penetration, low-collateral damage, variable depth/location fuzing, precise guidance, and high performance and insensitive explosives.  Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.  

This program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development because this budget activity includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and/or tests in a simulated environment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program provides for the development, integration, demonstration, and detailed assessment of directed energy weapon technologies including high energy laser (HEL), high power electromagnetics (HPEM), and other unconventional weapon generation and transmission technologies, which can support a wide range of Air Force applications.  The program develops a corresponding susceptibility, vulnerability, and lethality database for directed energy weapons.  Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.  

This program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development because this budget activity includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and/or tests in a simulated environment.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Manufacturing Technology program executes technical programs to maintain and develop an affordable and reliable industrial base and manufacturing capability that will be responsive to warfighter needs.  The program develops and improves manufacturing technologies and processes to enable cost reduction, improve component and system quality, and enhance industrial capability.  Value stream modifications and manufacturing throughput improvements are effected to shorten cycle times of weapon systems during design, development, production and sustainment.  Manufacturing Technologies objectives are conducted through industrial partnerships which enable the demonstration of manufacturing technologies for existing weapon system upgrades and/or for new warfighter systems.  Efforts in the program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense Science and Technology Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.  Manufacturing Technologies is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development, since it develops and demonstrates manufacturing technologies for existing upgrades and/or new system developments that have military utility and address warfighter needs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program develops and demonstrates Air Force enterprise-centric information technologies for the warfighter. The Global Battlespace Awareness project develops, integrates, and demonstrates advanced technologies to achieve comprehensive net-centric operations and total battlespace awareness by using and exploiting information from all sources. The Assured Worldwide Connectivity project provides advanced net-enabled architectures and communications technologies in support of global military operations, including a secure information grid for worldwide information exchange of near-real-time multimedia (i.e., voice, data, video, and imagery) information. In addition, this project develops and demonstrates advanced optical networking and communications for Air Force air- and space-based information exchange on and between platforms. These optical networks will be rapidly deployable, mobile, interoperable, and seamless between Air and Space Operations Centers (AOCs) and air- and space- based platforms either en route or in theater. This project also provides tools and applications leading to the development and integration of cyber deterrence technologies resulting in a strategic capability of cyber dominance within the secure information grid. The Knowledge Management and Computing project develops the technology applications that will provide for a secure, tailored, seamless exchange of information among producers, consumers, and managers of information relevant to a particular community of interest (COI). The project also provides the development of interactive and real-time computing technologies that greatly improve the usability of high performance computing for the exchange, utilization, and management of information in the enterprise. The Anticipatory Operations Intent and Response project develops the technologies for dynamic planning and execution with the accuracy, fidelity, and timeliness needed to dominate the battlespace. This program has been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication. 

This program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development because this budget activity includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and/or tests in a simulated environment.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>In order to achieve information dominance, the Air Force must be able to monitor, assess, plan, and execute missions rapidly across the full spectrum of operations (air, space, and cyberspace) at all levels of war (strategic, operational, and tactical) and during all phases of conflict (pre-conflict, conflict through stability operations). This project develops and integrates decision support technologies that will enhance the commander's ability to anticipate and dominate the future battlespace by more effectively forecasting the evolution of the battlespace and by more rapidly generating options to "virtually checkmate" the adversary. It develops the decision aid technologies and processes to plan the use of various assets and assess their effects in the battlespace. It provides a tailorable information environment to effectively portray complex data sets accurately in real-time.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Air Force requires advanced net-enabled architectures and communications technologies in support of global kinetic and non-kinetic military operations including a secure information grid for worldwide information delivery and exchange of near-real-time information including voice, data, video, and imagery.  This secure environment will be rapidly deployable, mobile, interoperable, and seamless between AOC and aircraft, either en route or in theater.  This project provides secure information transmission capabilities for a persistent, global, survivable communications backbone network accessible for warfighters operating in all domains. It provides self-healing, self-configuration, anti-jam communication networking capabilities, and provides enterprise networking capabilities for agile, policy-based network management.  In addition, this project develops and demonstrates flight ready systems consisting of high capacity radio frequency (RF) and optical components and architectures for next generation communications.  The Air Force also requires the ability to deliver sovereign options in cyberspace through the development and integration of cyber attack, cyber defense, and cyber support technologies for a strategic capability of cyber dominance.  This project develops the ability to deliver cyber attack capabilities (access, stealth and persistence, cyber intelligence, and weapons delivery), cyber defense capabilities (attack detection, attack attribution, and response automation), and cyber support capability (situational awareness and war gaming.)</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Air Force must be able to process and exploit data and information from a variety of sources and domains to create a common operating picture of the battlespace to allow commanders to maintain information dominance.  This project develops, integrates, and demonstrates advanced technologies to achieve comprehensive net-centric operations and Predictive Battlespace Awareness using information from all sources.  Technology development includes:  tasking information collectors, such as intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) platforms, national intelligence sources, etc; correlating and geo-registering the collected data; exploiting the data to extract information of military significance; fusing information from multiple sources to create a digital-and-dimensional representation of the battlespace; assessing the situation; predicting adversary COA; and archiving the results for ready use by decision-makers.  This is a dynamic, complex process that involves technologies for information exploitation, fusion, processing, storage, and retrieval, as well as technologies for machine reasoning, pattern recognition, and timeline analysis.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Air Force requires technologies that will provide the decision maker and staff with seamless access to tailored information within a mobile, dynamic, and scalable, globally distributed AOC, as well as among other producers, consumers, and managers of information relevant to other particular communities of interest (COI).  This project demonstrates the enterprise management capabilities needed for the rapid distribution of actionable information, as well as the needed advances in high performance computing to ensure this complex capability.  This project develops an agile information environment that focuses on quality of service, transformation and brokering, a federated information environment focusing the relationship among the members of the environment, a secure cross-domain information sharing capability that focuses on the security layer and inter-COI information exchange in different security domains, and a collaboration environment focusing on the information workflow layer of the enterprise.  This project will also develop:  1) a computational science and engineering capability demonstrating new models of computation; 2) novel approaches for high performance, interactive, net-centric, distributed, and embedded computing systems; and 3) the technological tools enabling affordable, large-scale, complex, software intensive systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>
