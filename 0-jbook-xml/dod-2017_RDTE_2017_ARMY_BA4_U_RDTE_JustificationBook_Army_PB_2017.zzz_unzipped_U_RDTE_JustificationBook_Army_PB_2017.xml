This will be accomplished by supporting ongoing efforts that provide the most realistic operating environment available to perform technology gap and cost reduction analysis of space, missile defense, and high altitude systems.  Realistic operating environments will be available to determine the ability of the specific technologies to fill capability gaps in terms of utility to the warfighter.  Support of technology demonstrations, Analysis and Demonstration Tools/Test Beds for evolving space superiority and operationally responsive space concepts will address emerging needs and continue to be expanded to ensure that advanced technology development can adequately enhance space, missile defense and high altitude systems. The Future War Center (FWC) will continue to provide program management for maintenance, sustainment, and development for Extended Air Defense Simulation (EADSIM) delivering the required high fidelity synthetic operating environment to provide the capability to perform system and cost benefit analysis, operational planning, and exercise/ experimentation support.  The FWC will continue to provide program management for maintenance, sustainment, and development for Reconfigurable Tactical Operations Simulator (RTOS) delivering operator in the loop capability for air and missile defense simulation in distributed exercises and experiments.</r2:Text>

In order to bring those capabilities into the force development of new force design updates (FDUs) for FDU cycles 16-1, 16-2, 17-1 will be required.  Additionally during the TAA cycle new Rules of Allocation (ROA) will be developed to ensure missile defense units are properly accounted for in the future.

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The program element funds space systems integration efforts performed by the US Army Space and Missile Defense Command/ Army Forces Strategic Command (USASMDC/ARSTRAT) and the Program Executive Office for Intelligence, Electronic Warfare (PEO IEW&amp;S).

Project EB7 - PEO IEW&amp;S: Details of this program are reported in accordance with Title 10, United States Code, Section 119 (a)(1).

Project EB 7 - USASMDC/ARSTRAT:  Headquarters, Department of the Army General Order Number 37, dated 16 October 2006, designated USASMDC/ARSTRAT as the Army proponent for space and the Army Service Component Command of U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM).  As such, USASMDC/ARSTRAT is responsible to develop warfighting concepts, conduct warfighting experiments to validate those concepts, identify capabilities needed to implement the validated concepts, and develop Doctrine, Organization, Training, Material, Leadership &amp; Education, Personnel and Facilities (DOTMLPF) solutions to realize those space related capabilities.  Army Regulation (AR) 10-87 Army Commands, Army Service Component Commands, and the Direct Reporting Units, dated 4 September 2007 and AR 5-22 The Army Force Modernization Proponent System dated 19 August 2009 designates USASMDC/ARSTRAT as the Army Force Modernization proponent for Space and High Altitude Capabilities.

Project 990 funds USASMDC/ARSTRAT to integrate warfighting concepts and technologies, validate concepts, and identify capabilities needed to implement the validated concepts, and develop DOTMLPF solutions to realize those space and high altitude related capabilities. Provide engineering support to the Joint Friendly Force Tracking (J-FFT) Mission Management Center (MMC) through an associated test-bed for both operational and developmental injection and integration of real-time J-FFT information into the Common Operating Picture (COP) for Combatant Commanders (COCOMs), Joint Task Forces (JTFs), and Coalition Partners.  The MMC injects real-time J-FFT information into the COP for COCOMs, JTFs and Coalition partners.  USSTRATCOM, in accordance with CJCSI 3910.01 (reference V.4.) is designated one of three coordinating agencies for J-FFT within DoD.  CJCSI 3910.01 directs eight Force Modernization tasks to USSTRATCOM.  USSTRATCOM SI 534-5 (reference V.6.) and annually published USSTRATCOM operations orders have designated USASMDC/ARSTRAT as the lead USSTRATCOM component command for Friendly Force Tracking (FFT).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project 990 funds United States Army Space and Missile Command/Army Strategic Command (USASMDC/ARSTRAT) efforts to develop, analyze and mature warfighting concepts, and conduct warfighting experiments for space and high altitude capabilities.  The program also funds development and integration of new data sources and data services into the Joint Friendly Force Tracking Mission Management Center.  The Mission Management Center (MMC) injects real-time Joint Friendly Force Tracking (J-FFT) information into the Common Operating Picture for Combatant Commands (COCOMs), Joint Task Forces (JTFs) and Coalition partners.  USASMDC/ARSTRAT is the proponent for space / high altitude capabilities and is responsible for determining and integrating Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership and Education, Personnel and Facilities (DOTMLPF-P) for the Army. 

USSTRATCOM, in accordance with CJCSI 3910.01 (reference V.4.) is designated one of three coordinating agencies for J-FFT within DOD.  CJCSI 3910.01 directs eight Force Modernization tasks to USSTRATCOM.  USSTRATCOM SI 534-5 (reference V.6.) and annually published USSTRATCOM operations orders have designated USASMDC/ARSTRAT as the lead USSTRATCOM component command for J-FFT.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>Project EK7, Area Denial Capability Development is a new start in FY 2016.

Project 606, Cntrmn/Barrier Adv Dev is a new start in FY 2017.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) provides for the Concept Exploration and Refinement of a Deep-Range employed Networked Obstacle.  This PE develops alternatives to the aging inventory of the Family of Scatterable Mines systems.

Project 606 enables component development of a new detection capability for explosive hazards, improvised explosive devices (IED), and components in support of route clearance operations.  These capabilities will enhance the effectiveness of the Route Clearance Platoon within the Engineer Company, the Brigade Combat Team as well as other related Army missions.

Project EK7 Area Denial Capability Development will evaluate integrated technologies and prototype systems in a realistic operating environment to expedite technology transition for a Deep-Range employed Networked Obstacle that denies the enemy terrain and freedom of action while allowing friendly forces to maneuver freely within the same battlespace.  Area Denial Capability Development provides Man-in-the-Loop (MITL) controlled scalable effects against mounted and dismounted enemy forces that disrupt, turn, fix or block their ability to maneuver.  Area Denial Capability Development enables the Combatant Commander to establish early Situational Awareness of an area without exposing friendly forces to enemy engagement, and to actively detect, identify, discriminate, and engage the enemy in order to shape the battlespace at deep operational ranges.  Area Denial Capability Development will utilize an open system, modular architecture to facilitate future development, maintenance, repair, and product improvements.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides for the Development of a Deep-Range employed Networked Obstacle.  This project develops alternatives to the aging inventory of the Family of Scatterable Mines systems.

Area Denial Capability Development will evaluate integrated technologies and prototype systems in a realistic operating environment to expedite technology transition for a Deep-Range employed Networked Obstacle that denies the enemy terrain and freedom of action while allowing friendly forces to maneuver freely within the same battlespace.  Area Denial Capability Development provides Man-in-the-Loop (MITL) controlled scalable effects against mounted and dismounted enemy forces that disrupt, turn, fix or block their ability to maneuver.  Area Denial Capability Development enables the Combatant Commander to establish early Situational Awareness of an area without exposing friendly forces to enemy engagement, and to actively detect, identify, discriminate, and engage the enemy in order to shape the battlespace at deep operational ranges.  Area Denial Capability Development will utilize an open system, modular architecture to facilitate future development, maintenance, repair, and product improvements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>An Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) was initiated in September 2015 and the study will assess the technical feasibility, operational feasibility, technical risk, and affordability of various potential materiel solutions.  The AoA will be informed by previously executed studies and input from Government, Industry and Academia.  In parallel to the AoA, up to 5 Concept Prototype contracts/agreements will be provided to industry to develop representative prototypes (hardware and/or models) that will be used to assess the technology risks and costs associated with multiple system level concepts.  The results of the AoA and evaluation of representative prototypes will support a Milestone A Decision.  The Army will award two Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) contracts/agreements to develop competing prototypes of the selected materiel solution.  Technologies that support the selected system level concepts will be matured during TMRR, and a Capability Development Document (CDD) will be developed.  At the end of TMRR, and after a successful Milestone B Decision, the Army will competitively award an Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract to complete development of the system, complete system integration, develop manufacturing processes, and conduct testing before entering the Production and Deployment phase.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>SOM: US Forces must be able to effectively neutralize and degrade energy weapon systems and electro-optical systems/smart weapons that operate in the full range of the electromagnetic spectrum to improve platform survivability and soldier protection levels of maneuver forces on the battlefield.  Improvements are sought across the entire multi-spectral range from visual through infrared (IR) and millimeter wavelengths (MMW) radar for incorporation into self-protection using sustained generated obscuration technology.  SOM will be man portable and modular to facilitate quick mounting on manned/unmanned platforms and dismounted operations.

NBCRV: This program upgrades the Stryker Nuclear Biological Chemical Radiological Vehicle Sensor Suite (NBCRVSS)for increased sensitivity, chemical detection at increased maneuver speeds, and increased reliability.  The NBCRVSS consists of a chemical point detector for solid, liquid, and vapor Chemical Warfare Agents, a biological point detection system, a Chemical Vapor Sampling System, a Training Aids, Devices, and Simulation System, and the Sensor Processing Group.  The NBCRVSS provides the Stryker NBCRV the ability to detect, identify, collect, report, and mark NBC hazards.  NBCRVSS funding is expected to move to a separate Program Element during the FY16 President's Budget cycle.  It will be reflected under PE 655038, Project Code EQ7.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Screening Obscuration Module (SOM): US Forces must be able to effectively neutralize and degrade enemy weapon systems and electro-optical systems/smart weapons that operate in the full range of the electromagnetic spectrum to improve platform survivability and soldier protection levels of maneuver forces on the battlefield. SOM provides visual through near-infrared screening of the electromagnetic spectrum. SOM will be man-portable and modular to facilitate quick mounting on manned/unmanned platforms and dismounted operations. The SOM replaces out-dated 1930s technology Combat smoke pots that are safety hazards containing potential carcinogenic constituents and are fire hazards.  Combat smoke pots lack a turn on/off ability, are unsafe to mount on combat vehicles and produce a smoke cloud that is too small, and too short in duration to meet current requirements, SOM addresses these issues. 

NBCRV:  This program upgrades the Nuclear Biological Chemical Reconnaissance Vehicle Sensor Suite (NBCRVSS).  The NBCRVSS is the Mission Equipment Package for the Stryker Nuclear Biological Chemical Reconnaissance Vehicle (NBCRV) and consists of chemical point detectors, a standoff chemical vapor detector, a biological point detector, a Chemical Vapor Sampling System, and a Sensor Processing group.  The NBCRVSS provides the Stryker NBCRV the ability to detect, identify, collect, report, and mark Nuclear Biological Chemical (NBC) Hazards. Starting in FY16, a Chemical Surface Detector will be developed to replace the Dual Wheel Sampling System to increase maneuverability of the Stryker NBCRV and increase reliability. Starting in FY17, a Chemical Mass Spectrometer will be developed to replace the Chemical Biological Mass Spectrometer Block II to increase reliability, sensitivity, and the number of chemicals detected. Also in FY17 an update to the Joint Service Lightweight Standoff Chemical Agent Detector (JSLSCAD) will be developed to increase range and probability of detection by reducing its field of view.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Acquisition Strategy:

SOM: The Screening Obscuration Module (SOM) acquisition strategy is a single-step Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) phase leading to a Milestone B/C production decision.  The path forward for the TMRR phase will include the release of a formal request for proposal (RFP) to develop and test a SOM system capable of obscuring the Visual through Near IR wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum.  The SOM RFP will utilize a Full and Open Competitive cost plus best value contract approach to execute the TMRR phase and a fixed price contract option for production. This acquisition strategy includes system development and demonstration, full system integration, design for producibility and a demonstration of interoperability, safety, utility and reliability. 

NBCRV: The Nuclear Biological Chemical Reconnaissance Vehicle Sensor Suite (NBCRVSS) Upgrade is a single-step in the evolutionary acquisition strategy for the Stryker Nuclear Biological Chemical Reconnaissance Vehicle.  The contract approach of the Chemical Surface Detector (CSD) will be a Full and Open cost plus fixed fee competitive prototyping contract.  The contract approach of the Chemical Mass Spectrometer (CMS) will be a Full and Open cost plus fixed fee competitive prototyping contract.  The contract approach for the update of the Joint Service Lightweight Standoff Chemical Agent Detector (JSLSCAD) will be a Sole Source cost plus fixed fee Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity with firm fixed price production task orders.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Title changed from Tank and Medium Caliber Ammunition to Weapons and Munitions Advanced Development.

The Weapons and Munitions Advanced Development Program Element (PE) encompasses a comprehensive program to develop, rapidly transition to production, and field advanced weapons and munitions.  These programs will ensure continued battlefield overmatch and lethality of U.S. maneuver forces against the full range of modern battlefield threats.  To achieve this, Weapons and Munitions Engineering Development Program will identify and develop promising technologies through competitive development and streamlined acquisition procedures.

Project 652: The M829E4 cartridge is an Abrams delivered Line of Sight (LOS) munition that will provide capability for the current force Armored Brigade Combat Team's (ABCT) commander to conduct decisive operations and destroy current and future enemy Main Battle Tanks (MBTs) equipped with Explosive Reactive Armor (ERA) and Active Protective System (APS) at ranges from 0-2km (T) and 0-4km (O).  The M829E4 equips ABCT commanders with a unique capability which will increase the ABCT's lethality and ability to seize the initiative during unified land operations.  After an Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase I competitive shoot off in FY 2011, Alliant Techsystems (ATK) was awarded the option to continue with Phase II until its conclusion in FY 2015.  FY 2012 supported the continuation of Phase II of the M829E4 cartridge.  FY 2013 funding supported design finalization, design verification, fabrication and initial testing of Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&amp;E) hardware.  The full performance of the M829E4 is obtained with an Abrams equipped with an Ammunition Data Link breech modification.  FY 2014 supported hardware and performance testing, mandated Live Fire Test &amp; Evaluation (LFT&amp;E) and completion of Milestone C.  FY 2015 supported qualifying a second source for the composite sabot material.  The current single source supplier for this material had significantly increased the cost for this material, more than doubled in cost, and expressed intentions of possibly getting out of this business.  Qualification of this second source has occurred and has resulted in competitive pricing thus driving down the unit price cost.  The aforementioned selection has mitigated the risk of the current supplier exiting as a supplier of this material. 

Project 656: The Advanced Multi Purpose (AMP) program is a direct fire line of sight 120mm large caliber munition under development for the Abrams Main Battle Tank.  It has three modes of operation including point detonate, point detonate delay and airburst.  AMP is the material solution for breaching double reinforced concrete walls and defeating Anti Tank Guided Missile (ATGM) teams from 50m to 2000m (T) and 50m to 4500m (O), a validated gap that cannot currently be met with existing stockpiled ammunition.  In addition to added capability, AMP will also consolidate the capabilities of four existing stockpiled 120mm munitions, thereby addressing the users' battlecarry dilemma by allowing them to load a single munition that is capable of defeating multiple targets including ATGM teams, reinforced walls, personnel, light armor, bunkers, and obstacles.  The full performance of the AMP is obtained with an Abrams equipped Ammunition Data Link breech modification, the same required by the 120mm M829E4 cartridge that achieved Milestone C in FY 2014.  FY 2016 supports multiple contracts with competing prototypes in Phase 1 of 2 for Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD).

Project 694: The 40mm Low Velocity (LV) Increased Range Anti-Personnel (IRAP) tactical cartridge allows the warfighter to effectively engage multiple targets, at increased ranges using the 40mm M203 and M320 Grenade Launchers. The IRAP cartridge provides the grenadier with a higher probability of achieving a first shot kill against enemy personnel, coupled with the ability to defeat personnel targets in defilade positions at increased ranges with greater accuracy and lethality. When deployed against point and area targets, the cartridge inflicts incapacitating effects against personnel or achieve a mobility kill against unarmored vehicles at increased ranges beyond those offered by the current M433 High Explosive Dual Purpose (HEDP) cartridge. IRAP is a new capability identified as a Warfighter requirement in the Capability Development Document, 40mm, Low Velocity Family of Ammunition Annex A1, Increased Range Anti-Personnel Cartridge. The cartridge provides lethal effects against targets with improved accuracy and greater standoff ranges increasing Soldier Survivability. FY 2017 supports Milestone B approval, Request for Proposal (RFP) preparation, Source Selection Planning, Government Technical Development and Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) Testing. Engineering, Manufacturing Development will commence in FY 2017.

Project EB8: The One Way Luminescence (OWL) program is a critical technology development in response to the 7.62mm, 5.56mm, and .50 Caliber Family of Ammunition Capabilities Development Documents (CDD).  Current small caliber ammunition tracer rounds are a pyrotechnic tracer mix allowing enemy forces to see the trace round and track its trajectory back to the shooter.  The OWL program objective develops and fields a full day/night tracer round, replace the current pyrotechnic cartridges with trace cartridges that are only visible to the shooter and soldiers in close proximity, increasing soldier survivability.  7.62mm is the immediate focus followed by 5.56mm and .50 caliber OWL cartridges.  FY 2017 funding supports maturation and downselect of the 7.62mm OWL technology, procurement of bullet components, "tracer" material and testing evaluation in order to attain a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 6.  FY 2017 funding further supports EMD contract development necessary for a FY 2018 Milestone B.

Project EB9: This project is essential to support the advanced development activities and technology demonstrations of the Aviation Airborne Expendable Countermeasure (AAECM) components and prototype munition decoys necessary to address emerging threat deficiencies in Army aircraft protection and the safety of its aircrews against advanced Man-Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS) and shoulder launched Surface-to-Air Missiles (SAM) systems. These efforts will evaluate integrated technologies and countermeasure prototype systems in realistic operating test environments to help expedite technology transition from the laboratory to operational use to demonstrate component and subsystem maturity prior to integration into major and complex Army aircraft platforms. These expendable countermeasures systems are an essential part of survivability equipment for Army aircraft. Army RDT&amp;E efforts are coordinated with the PEO Aviation and its platform PMs with PM Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) to address emerging JUONS from theatre.

Project EC2:  The Advanced Armor-Piercing (ADVAP) program is a critical technology development in response to the 7.62mm and 5.56mm Family of Ammunition Capabilities Development Documents (CDD).  The nomenclature for the 7.62mm ADVAP is now XM1158 and the companion trace is XM1159.  The overall objective of the ADVAP program is to develop and Full Materiel Release (FMR) a 7.62mm XM1158 cartridge linked 4:1 with a trace cartridge (XM1159) followed by a 5.56mm cartridge variant that will provide overmatch capability to defeat advanced light armored threats within typical machine gun ranges. The 7.62mm XM1158 and XM1159 cartridge will be optimized for use in the M240 Machine Gun.

Project EC3: The Ammunition Logistics Prototyping project supports the future force by improving the distribution, management, reliability and survivability of ammunition through the advanced development, integration, and demonstration of logistics system enablers.  These enablers will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of ammunition operations, to include retrograde, while reducing the logistics footprint on the battlefield.  Technology areas addressed include handling, distribution, and management (strategic and tactical), prognostics, diagnostics, and asset visibility, explosives safety, and adaptive and environmentally friendly packaging and palletization.  The efficient deployment and sustainment of reliable ammunition is vital to success on the battlefield.  This project enhances the operational effectiveness of the ammunition logistics system to ensure the distribution of reliable ammunition to the warfighter.

Project EL7:  The Reduced Range Small Caliber Training Ammunition (RRTA) program is a critical technology development in response to the 7.62mm and .50 Caliber Capabilities Development Documents (CDD).  The overall objective of the RRTA program is to develop and field 7.62mm RRTA cartridges that will provide a ballistic match to M80A1 and M62A1 cartridges to standard training ranges, while reducing the maximum range of the ammunition. This will allow soldiers to train with 7.62mm weapons on restricted ranges. The RRTA cartridge will be designed to be compatible with all Army 7.62mm weapons, but specifically optimized to work in the M240 Machine Gun. After the 7.62mm cartridge is matured.  FY 2017 dollars support Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction in preparation for a TRL 6 demonstration and preparation for Milestone B.

Project EL8:  The Lightweight Small Caliber Ammunition (LSCA) program is a critical technology development in response to the 7.62mm and .50 Caliber Capabilities Development Documents (CDD).  The goal of the LSCA Program is to reduce the Soldier load through reduction in ammunition weight.  The LSCA Program will develop and field 7.62mm LSCA cartridges that will provide the same capabilities as the M80A1 and M62A1 cartridges.  The LSCA cartridge will be designed to be compatible with all Army 7.62mm weapon systems, but specifically optimized to work in the M240 Machine Gun.  After the 7.62mm cartridge is matured a .50 Caliber variant will be developed. FY 2017 funding will support 7.62mm TRL 6 evaluation of the 7.62mm Phase II Defense Ordinance Technology Consortium (DOTC) efforts, solicitation release, preliminary design review, and milestone B preparation for the LSCA Program.
 
Project EU1: The Enhanced Lethality Cannon Munitions program will identify, develop, prototype, and demonstrate new enhanced lethality technologies, components, and subsystems maturity for Cannon munitions to enable fact-based analysis of enhanced lethality alternatives, quantify their effectiveness in mitigating evolving and derived capability gaps, reduce integration risk, and support transition into existing/new Cannon munitions. This program will evaluate and analyze the effectiveness, efficiency, producibility, affordability, safety, and compatibility of these prototype potential materiel solutions in high fidelity simulations and representative realistic performance-related developmental tests.

Project EU2: The Improved Multi-Option Fuze will identify, develop, prototype, and demonstrate new improved multi-option fuze technologies, components, and subsystems based on Next Generation Proximity Sensor (NGPS) capabilities with built-in exportability attributes previously matured via OSD-sponsored Science and Technology efforts under the Joint Fuze Technology Program and Defense Exportability Features (DEF) Congressional Pilot Program. This program will evaluate and analyze the effectiveness, efficiency, producibility, affordability, safety, and compatibility of these prototype potential materiel solutions in representative realistic performance-related developmental tests.

Project FA5: The objective of this advanced component development and prototyping effort is to identify, evaluate, mature, test, and demonstrate various assured precision prototype technologies in weapons and munitions systems to prove component and subsystem maturity in a system-of-systems environment and to reduce subsequent Program of Record (PoR) integration risk.  Assured Precision Weapons and Munitions are an integral part of US military strategy and continue to enable combat overmatch and dominance across the Land Component battlespace.  Unhindered access to trusted Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) information under conditions where existing space based PNT (i.e. P(Y)-Code Global Positioning System (GPS)) may be limited or denied has created the need to develop, prototype, and evaluate new/emerging Assured PNT capabilities (including M-Code GPS and Pseudolites) into both PGMs and Weapons operating in a complex system-of-systems environment.  This imperative is reinforced by Public Law 111-383 Section 913 which mandates the use of Air Force-developed M-Code GPS capabilities in all systems fielded FY 2018 and beyond unless a waiver is obtained from the Secretary of Defense.  As such, both precision weapon and munition PoRs must coordinate with the development and technology delivery activities of the Air Force’s Military GPS User Equipment (MGUE) program as well as the Army’s Assured PNT program to protect and insure critical precision-based Joint warfighting capabilities as well as maximizing effectiveness and efficiency of US taxpayer investments across multiple Lethality portfolios.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The 0604802A ED7, 120mm Advanced Multipurpose (AMP) Cartridge, program is not a new start.  Funds in the 0604802A ED7, 120mm Advanced Multipurpose (AMP) Cartridge, program in FY 2017 are a realignment of funds from program 0603639A 656, 120mm Cartridge (Advanced Multipurpose-AMP), for more efficient, effective program management.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Advanced Multi Purpose (AMP) program is a direct fire line of sight 120mm large caliber munition under development for the Abrams Main Battle Tank.  It has three modes of operation including point detonate, point detonate delay and airburst.  AMP is the material solution for breaching double reinforced concrete walls and defeating Anti Tank Guided Missile (ATGM) teams from 50m to 2000m (T) and 50m to 4500m (O), a validated gap that cannot currently be met with existing stockpiled ammunition.  In addition to added capability, AMP will also consolidate the capabilities of four existing stockpiled 120mm munitions, thereby addressing the users' battlecarry dilemma by allowing them to load a single munition that is capable of defeating multiple targets including ATGM teams, reinforced walls, personnel, light armor, bunkers, and obstacles.  The full performance of the AMP is obtained with an Abrams equipped Ammunition Data Link breech modification, the same required by the 120mm M829E4 cartridge that achieved Milestone C in FY 2014.  FY 2016 supports multiple contracts with competing prototypes in Phase 1 of 2 for Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>In FY 2017, the program will transition to 0604802A EW1, 40mm Increased Range Anti-Personnel Ammunition (IRAP).  Funds in the 0604802A EW1 40mm IRAP program in FY 2017 are a realignment of funds from program 0603639A 694, Medium Caliber Ammunition, for more efficient, effective program management.  In FY 2017, PE 0603639A 694, Medium Caliber Ammunition, 40mm Increased Range Anti-Personnel (IRAP), is a new start.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The 40mm Low Velocity (LV) Increased Range Anti-Personnel (IRAP) tactical cartridge allows the warfighter to effectively engage multiple targets, at increased ranges using the 40mm M203 and M320 Grenade Launchers.  The IRAP cartridge provides the grenadier with a higher probability of achieving a first shot kill against enemy personnel, coupled with the ability to defeat personnel targets in defilade positions at increased ranges with greater accuracy and lethality.  When deployed against point and area targets, the cartridge inflicts incapacitating effects against personnel or achieve a mobility kill against unarmored vehicles at increased ranges beyond those offered by the current M433 High Explosive Dual Purpose (HEDP) cartridge.  IRAP is a new capability identified as a Warfighter requirement in the Capability Development Document, 40mm, Low Velocity Family of Ammunition Annex A1, Increased Range Anti-Personnel Cartridge.  The cartridge provides lethal effects against targets with improved accuracy and greater standoff ranges increasing Soldier Survivability.  FY 2017 supports Milestone B approval, Request for Proposal (RFP) preparation, Source Selection Planning, Government Technical Development and Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) Testing.  Engineering, Manufacturing Development will commence in FY 2017.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>One Way Luminescence (OWL) develops a new tracer technology and applies it to multiple calibers. The initial focus was on 7.62mm ammunition in FY 2015 followed by 5.56mm in FY 2018 and .50 Caliber ammunition in FY 2019.  As the technology matures it will be transitioned to Project 0654802A EP4 starting in FY 2018 for 7.62mm, and FY 2020 for 5.56mm and .50 Caliber.  The OWL cartridge will be compatible with all Army Small Caliber weapon systems, but optimized for Machine Guns and will provide improved lethality/Target effects over the current tracer munition.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The One Way Luminescence (OWL) program is a critical technology development in response to the 7.62mm, 5.56mm, and .50 Caliber Family of Ammunition Capabilities Development Documents (CDD).  Current small caliber ammunition tracer rounds are a pyrotechnic tracer mix allowing enemy forces to see the trace round and track its trajectory back to the shooter.  The OWL program objective develops and fields a full day/night tracer round, replace the current pyrotechnic cartridges with trace cartridges that are only visible to the shooter and soldiers in close proximity, increasing soldier survivability.  7.62mm is the immediate focus followed by 5.56mm and .50 caliber OWL cartridges.  FY 2017 funding supports maturation and downselect of the 7.62mm OWL technology, procurement of bullet components, "tracer" material and testing evaluation in order to attain a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 6.  FY 2017 funding further supports EMD contract development necessary for a FY 2018 Milestone B.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>The 0604802A EP4, OWL for Small Caliber Ammunition program will not be a new start.  FY 2018 funds are realigned from program 0603639A EB8, OWL for Small Caliber Ammunition, for more efficient and effective program management.  The 0604802A EP4 OWL funding line continues the development work of 7.62mm, 5.56mm, and .50 Caliber OWL cartridges into Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD).</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The OWL concept will be developed through Government and Industry prototyping efforts.  An annual Technology Readiness Assessment (TRA) was conducted in FY 2015 and will be conducted in FY 2016 and FY 2017 to measure the progress of the designs.  In FY 2017, there will be a downselect between the industry and Government concepts in order to proceed with Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD).  The Government will demonstrate TRL 6 for 7.62mm in FY 2017 to prepare for Milestone B.  The 5.56mm and .50 Caliber cartridges will follow the 7.62mm schedule with Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) starting at the end of FY 2020.  These new tracer cartridges will replace legacy tracers in each of the various small caliber configurations.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

These efforts will evaluate integrated technologies and countermeasure prototype systems in realistic operating test environments to help expedite technology transition from the laboratory to operational use to demonstrate component and subsystem maturity prior to integration into major and complex Army aircraft platforms. These expendable countermeasures systems are an essential part of survivability equipment for Army aircraft. Army RDT&amp;E efforts are coordinated with the PEO Aviation and its platform PMs with PM Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) to address emerging JUONS from theatre.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>In FY 2017 the 7.62mm ADVAP program will transition to 0604802A EP5, Advanced Armor-Piercing (ADVAP) for Small Cal Ammunition.  The 0604802A EP5, Advanced Armor-Piercing (ADVAP) for Small Cal Ammunition, program is not a new start.  Funds in the 0604802A EP5 ADVAP program in FY 2017 are a realignment of funds from program 0603639A EC2, Advanced Armor-Piercing (ADVAP) for Small Cal Ammunition, for more efficient and effective program management.  The 0604802A EP5 ADVAP funding line continues the development work of both 7.62mm and 5.56mm ADVAP cartridges into Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD).</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Advanced Armor-Piercing (ADVAP) program is a critical technology development in response to the 7.62mm and 5.56mm Family of Ammunition Capabilities Development Documents (CDD).  The nomenclature for the 7.62mm ADVAP is now XM1158 and the companion trace is XM1159.  The overall objective of the ADVAP program is to develop and Full Materiel Release (FMR) a 7.62mm XM1158 cartridge linked 4:1 with a trace cartridge (XM1159) followed by a 5.56mm cartridge variant that will provide overmatch capability to defeat advanced light armored threats within typical machine gun ranges. The 7.62mm XM1158 and XM1159 cartridge will be optimized for use in the M240 Machine Gun.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports the future force by improving the distribution, management, reliability and survivability of ammunition through the advanced development, integration, and demonstration of logistics system enablers.  These enablers will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of ammunition operations, to include retrograde, while reducing the logistics footprint on the battlefield.  Technology areas addressed include handling, distribution, and management (strategic and tactical), prognostics, diagnostics, and asset visibility, explosives safety, and adaptive and environmentally friendly packaging and palletization.  The efficient deployment and sustainment of reliable ammunition is vital to success on the battlefield.  This project enhances the operational effectiveness of the ammunition logistics system to ensure the distribution of reliable ammunition to the warfighter.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>This is a new start program in FY 2017. The 0603639A EL7, Reduced Range Small Caliber Training Ammunition (RRTA).  The RRTA technology applies to multiple calibers.  As the technology matures it will be transitioned to Project 0604802A EP3 starting in FY 2018 for 7.62mm, and FY 2020 for .50 caliber ammunition.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Reduced Range Small Caliber Training Ammunition (RRTA) program is a critical technology development in response to the 7.62mm and .50 Caliber Capabilities Development Documents (CDD).  The overall objective of the RRTA program is to develop and field 7.62mm RRTA cartridges that will provide a ballistic match to M80A1 and M62A1 cartridges to standard training ranges, while reducing the maximum range of the ammunition. This will allow soldiers to train with 7.62mm weapons on restricted ranges. The RRTA cartridge will be designed to be compatible with all Army 7.62mm weapons, but specifically optimized to work in the M240 Machine Gun. After the 7.62mm cartridge is matured.  FY 2017 dollars support Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction in preparation for a TRL 6 demonstration and preparation for Milestone B.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>Lightweight Small Caliber Ammunition will develop and qualify lightweight cartridge case for 7.62mm ammunition to replace current brass cartridge case.  The initial focus will be on 7.62mm ammunition followed by .50 caliber variant in FY 2018.  In FY 2017 the 7.62mm program will transition to 0604802A EP6, Lightweight Cartridge Case for Small Caliber Ammunition. The 0604802A EP6, Lightweight Cartridge Case for Small Caliber Ammunition, program is not a new start.  Funds in the 0604802A EP6, Lightweight Cartridge Case for Small Caliber Ammunition, program in FY 2017 are a realignment of funds from program 0603639A EL8, Lightweight Cartridge Case for Small Caliber Ammunition, for more efficient and effective program management.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Lightweight Small Caliber Ammunition (LSCA) program is a critical technology development in response to the 7.62mm and .50 Caliber Capabilities Development Documents (CDD).  The goal of the LSCA Program is to reduce the Soldier load through reduction in ammunition weight.  The LSCA Program will develop and field 7.62mm LSCA cartridges that will provide the same capabilities as the M80A1 and M62A1 cartridges.  The LSCA cartridge will be designed to be compatible with all Army 7.62mm weapon systems, but specifically optimized to work in the M240 Machine Gun.  After the 7.62mm cartridge is matured a .50 Caliber variant will be developed. FY 2017 funding will support 7.62mm TRL 6 evaluation of the 7.62mm Phase II Defense Ordinance Technology Consortium (DOTC) efforts, solicitation release, preliminary design review, and milestone B preparation for the LSCA Program.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>Project EU1, Enhanced Lethality Cannon Munitions is a new start program in FY 2017.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program will identify, develop, prototype, and demonstrate new enhanced lethality technologies, components, and subsystems maturity for cannon munitions to enable fact-based analysis of enhanced lethality alternatives, quantify their effectiveness in mitigating evolving and derived capability gaps, reduce integration risk, and support transition into existing/new cannon munitions. This program will evaluate and analyze the effectiveness, efficiency, producibility, affordability, safety, and compatibility of these prototype potential materiel solutions in high fidelity simulations and representative realistic performance-related developmental tests. Up to four potential enhanced lethality cannon munition materiel solution alternatives from Government and Industry will be prototyped and evaluated. The best of these potential materiel alternatives will be further refined, tested, and demonstrated prior to the transition of mature enhanced lethality technologies into existing/new cannon munition Programs of Record (PoRs).  This program addresses derived requirements for increased organic Brigade Combat Team (BCT) indirect fire stowed kills, potential lethality shortfalls of smaller payload extended range cannon munitions fired from existing fielded US weapon systems, and increased lethality demands being placed on unitary cannon artillery rounds due to the pending policy-driven loss of cluster munitions.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program will identify, develop, prototype, and demonstrate new improved multi-option fuze technologies, components, and subsystems based on Next Generation Proximity Sensor (NGPS) capabilities with built-in exportability attributes previously matured via OSD-sponsored techbase efforts under the Joint Fuze Technology Program and Defense Exportability Features (DEF) Congressional Pilot Program.  This program will evaluate and analyze the effectiveness, efficiency, producibility, affordability, safety, and compatibility of these prototype potential materiel solutions in representative realistic performance-related developmental tests.  Up to four potential improved multi-option fuze solution alternatives from Government and/or Industry will be prototyped and evaluated leveraging NGPS with built-in DEF technology.  This program will enable fact-based analysis of new height of burst/proximity fuzing alternatives that are resistant to enemy countermeasures and reverse engineering threats, quantify their effectiveness, reduce integration risk, and support transition into existing/new artillery/mortar fuzes and munitions.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>As an advanced component development and competitive prototyping program, this effort will identify, develop, prototype, evaluate, analyze, and demonstrate up to four potential improved Multi-Option Fuze solutions from Government and Industry.  This effort will quantify their respective maturity and effectiveness in providing conventional Cannon and Mortar munitions a height of burst/proximity fuzing capability that is resistant to enemy countermeasures and reverse engineering threats.   Appropriate mature potential solutions will be selected for subsequent transition as an inherent part of new improved Multi-Option Fuze programs of record.  Subsequent respective Engineering and Manufacturing Development efforts will be Type Classified Standard with supporting detailed government-owned Technical Data Packages (TDPs) to enable “build to print” by Industry.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The objective of this advanced component development and prototyping effort is to identify, evaluate, mature, test, and demonstrate various assured precision prototype technologies in weapons and munitions systems to prove component and subsystem maturity in a system-of-systems environment and to reduce subsequent Program of Record (PoR) integration risk.  Assured Precision Weapons and Munitions are an integral part of US military strategy and continue to enable combat overmatch and dominance across the Land Component battlespace.  Unhindered access to trusted Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) information under conditions where existing space based PNT (i.e. P(Y)-Code Global Positioning System (GPS)) may be limited or denied has created the need to develop, prototype, and evaluate new/emerging Assured PNT capabilities (including M-Code GPS and Pseudolites) into both PGMs and Weapons operating in a complex system-of-systems environment.  This imperative is reinforced by Public Law 111-383 Section 913 which mandates the use of Air Force-developed M-Code GPS capabilities in all systems fielded FY 2018 and beyond unless a waiver is obtained from the Secretary of Defense.  As such, both precision weapon and munition PoRs must coordinate with the development and technology delivery activities of the Air Force’s Military GPS User Equipment (MGUE) program and the Army’s Assured PNT program to protect and insure critical precision-based Joint warfighting capabilities as well as maximizing effectiveness and efficiency of US taxpayer investments across multiple Lethality portfolios.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Project conducts demonstration and validation of improved subsistence and subsistence support items used to enhance soldier effectiveness and quality of life in all four Services, as part of an integrated Department of Defense (DoD) Food Research, Development, Test, Evaluation and Engineering Program. The Program is reviewed and validated twice annually by the DoD Combat Feeding Research and Engineering Board (CFREB) as part of the Joint Service Food Program.  This project develops critical enablers that support the Joint Future Force Capabilities and the Joint expeditionary mindset by maintaining readiness through fielding and integrating new equipment. This equipment enhances the field soldier's well-being and provides the soldier with usable equipment, in addition to reducing sustainment requirements, related Combat Support/Combat Service Support (CS/CSS) demands on lift, combat zone footprint, and costs for logistical support.

This PE/Project supports Field Feeding Programs for all the services.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This R-Form reflects two (2) separate organizations; The Rapid Equipping Force(REF) and the Asymmetric Warfare Group (AWG).  

All funding figures reflect only REF.  AWG request is not reflected in funding figures.

The Rapid Equipping Force (REF) supports Combatant Command (COCOM)/Army Service Component Command (ASCC) based on emerging rapid equipment requirements.   The REF is an enduring organization (Base funded) per Headquarters, Department of the Army, memo, SUBJECT:  Implementation Plan for Stabilization of the Rapid Equipping Force (REF), signed by the Under Secretary of the Army:  Joseph W. Westphal, dated 30 January 2014. 

The REF harnesses current and emerging technologies to provide rapid solutions to U.S. Army Forces employed globally.  The REF combines and integrates functions that cross several Army staff elements and ASCCs to accelerate materiel solutions and technology insertion to U.S. Army Forces employed globally.  The REF is the Army's quick reaction capability with the ability to develop, prototype, acquire, integrate and sustain Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS), Government Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) and Non-Developmental Item (NDI) solutions to meet urgent combat requirements for forces employed globally.  It develops and inserts selected future force technologies, capabilities, and surrogate materiel solutions into deployed, deploying, select prepared to deploy, and transformational forces for operational evaluation, assessment, and evolutionary development.  The REF assesses the provided capabilities to improve future solutions, to inform future Army capability requirements and to potentially transition the capability to an Army acquisition program.  

The REF bridges the gap between the traditional acquisition process and immediate equipping needs.  The REF pursues tangible solutions that can be equipped rapidly with a goal of 180 days.  The REF focuses on finding immediate and effective game-changing capabilities to increase Soldier effectiveness, protection, and lethality in any operational environment.  The REF process provides the mechanism to respond rapidly to an adaptive enemy who changes in days and months, not years.  The REF coordinates in theater work with the ASCC of the COCOMs to understand their urgent needs, for which the REF acquisition capability may identify, procure, deliver, and sustain solutions to the deployed units.  This fiscal flexibility is significant in that it permits the REF to allocate funds against emerging threats and requirements in the year of fiscal execution.  

The REF works directly with Operational Commanders at all levels, but focuses on Brigade level and below to find solutions to identified capability gaps.  These solutions may result in procurement of new or existing military/commercial materiel equipment, or accelerated development of a future force materiel solution for insertion into the current force now.  

The Army Acquisition Executive designated Program Executive Office (PEO) Soldier as the Milestone Decision (MDA) to institutionalize the acquisition authorities in support of the REF and to provide proper acquisition oversight while enhancing visibility of these efforts.  The MDA will ensure flexibility and speed focused on the needs of Soldiers serviced by the dedicated REF Program Management Office (PMO).   This establishes a formal acquisition - reporting chain that leverages - existing reporting venues, to ensure appropriate ASA (ALT) visibility, oversight, and direction.  

The REF capabilities cross all Warfighter Function Areas:
1 – Mission Command
2 – Movement and Maneuver
3 – Intelligence 
4 – Fires
5 – Sustainment
6 – Protection 

The REF FY17 RDT&amp;E request $3.259 million (Base) is for system integration, testing and evaluation to support project requirements. 
  
The RDT&amp;E funding also provides the REF the flexibility to invest in near-term, innovative solutions.  RDT&amp;E funds are necessary in the vast majority of all REF projects.  Most importantly, REF requires RDT&amp;E funds to conduct safety certification (testing) for REF provided non-standard equipment before it is equipped to the unit.  This critical requirement exists to ensure that the equipment is safe for Soldiers to use and that any risks are known and documented.  The REF also requires RDT&amp;E funds to integrate several different COTS/GOTS/NDI technologies into one capability that solves the tougher and more complex problems.  RDT&amp;E funds are used to further develop high (>6) Technology Readiness Level (TRL) systems or advanced technologies in conjunction with industry and Other Governmental Agencies (OGAs).  Frequently, these technologies only need small amounts of funding in order to help them achieve a maturity level that is suitable to solve deployed U.S. Army Forces problems.  The REF requires RDT&amp;E funds in order to modify existing technologies that were developed for one purpose, but now may be suitable to solve another problem.   REF will fund deliberate projects in support of technology solution scouting to meet anticipated needs.  These efforts measure and identify current technologies and provide capability assessments to TRADOC and other organizations with the intent of informing future requirements.  Example efforts that may require RDTE include the following projects:  Nano Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) Assessment; Carbine Optics; Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Combat System, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C5ISR); Small Unit Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance (ISR); Electronic Warfare; Counter Unmanned Aerial System (UAS); Operational Energy; Mission Command; and Force Protection.


Mission Description AWG:  The Asymmetric Warfare Group (AWG) provides critical operational advisory support globally and rapid solution development to Army and Joint Force Commanders to enhance Soldier survivability and combat effectiveness, continuously assesses the Operating Environment (OE), to defeat current and emerging threats.  As such, AWG is uniquely positioned to quickly provide feedback and observations of asymmetric threats back to TRADOC Centers and Schools allowing for the timely adaptation of training, Programs of Instruction and informing capability requirements of future forces.  

With its theater access, AWG continues to serve in its advisory capacity to assist regionally aligned forces (RAF), support ASCC security cooperation missions, as well as inform Army innovation programs. In times of crisis, the AWG will continue to be a critical combat enabler to Army and Joint contingency force deployments responding to a diverse range of theater threats and requirements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>The demand for REF 10-liner requirements has levels based on the increased tempo of transitioning brigades in Operation Freedom Sentinel (OFS) with nine (9) month deployments; the expansion of brigades’ operational environments (OEs) that required smaller units to operate in more isolated areas; and a new force structure and role in OFS.  At the end of FY15, the REF had 604 total requirement’s - 513 were OCO requirements.</r2:Text>

                                        <r2:Text>The REF mission expands to perform Direct Support (DS) to globally deployed Soldiers, ASCCs of the Combatant Commands, regionally aligned Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs) and includes support to Operation Freedom Sentinel (OFS) in Afghanistan, Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR) in Iraq, and other operations in the CENTCOM and AFRICOM areas of responsibility.  During the same period, the REF expects to see an increase in requirements submitted by Army Special Operations Forces (SOF) in other areas of the world, as well as, from brigades employed in more global roles, such as the regionally aligned BCTs, and their logistical support elements.  The REF also expects to play a much more deliberate role in providing support to the Army's Global Response Force as they prepare for a wider range of response missions.  

For FY16 the REF projected 664 requirements (101 Base, 563 OCO).   The projection was based on the requirements demand signal and modified using the following planning assumptions:

1) Based on expanding Army operations worldwide we anticipate significant requirements from deployed Army forces in non-OCO regions.
2) There is no change in the OMB OCO criteria and guidance,
3) The number of troops deployed to Afghanistan/OFS (~10K) and the types of missions they are performing remains constant through June 2016 then maybe reduced by 50% for the remainder of the year,
4) The number of troops deployed to Iraq/OIR (~4K) and the types of missions they are performing remains unchanged, 
5) And, there is no significant change in the level of operational support to Counter-ISL operations outside of Iraq.

A change to any of these assumptions could have significant impact on the number and type of requirements received, and upon the type of funding (OCO or Base) required.  For example, any change in OCO guidance could significantly change the ratio of OCO to Base funding required.  Likewise, if troops deployed to OIR are given the mission to accompany Iraqi Security Forces during the anticipated counter-offensive REF could expect a significant increase in Warfighting function requirements for mission command, intelligence, movement and maneuver, and force protection.  In OFS, a decision to retain current manning levels may similarly effect the number of requirements REF receives in FY16.</r2:Text>

                                        <r2:Text>TThe REF partners with ASCCs forces and Army SOF community to perform DS to globally deployed Soldiers and regionally aligned BCTs.  The REF anticipates increased uncertainty regarding the future of OIR and other operations in the CENTCOM AOR requiring additional flexibility to develop technological solutions supporting the reduced numbers of Soldiers operating globally in order to fill force protection gaps in the face of a smaller and more lethal terrorism threat.  The REF expects to increase our engagement with the ASCCs in order to address capability gaps generated by geographical and environmental constraints and improve our understanding of evolving threats and operating conditions within the respective ASCC areas of operations.   The REF also expects to play a much more deliberate role in providing support to the Global Response Force as they prepare for a wider range of response missions.  We anticipate increased coordination with various Army technology demonstrations and Joint Capabilities Technology Demonstrations in order to leverage developed residual technologies to rapidly address identified critical capability gaps and gain immediate feedback through limited user evaluations.   In accordance with REF’s participation in the Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD) led quick reaction capability effort, the Army determined the REF would provide the Army’s warm base capability with ~100 requirements in FY17 and beyond.

For FY17 the REF projects ~100 requirements in the following REF Warfighter function areas.

1 – Mission Command (344K)
2 – Movement and Maneuver (782K)
3 – Intelligence  (254K)
4 – Fires  (34K)
5 – Sustainment (333K)
6 – Protection  (512K)

The REF anticipates ATEC testing and evaluation cost of $1.000 million. The REF requires RDT&amp;E funds to test technologies in order to ensure suitability and safety before equipping the Soldier – any modified COTS/GOTS/NDI items has to be tested.


AWG is uniquely postured to support unified land operations to mitigate future risk to Army forces resulting from non-traditional and hybrid threats.  AWG supports solution development and equipping efforts with operational advising/global first hand observation, but does not conduct materiel acquisition without an appropriate acquisition partner; investment funding is required to legally execute the breadth of AWG’s solution development mission. The use of investment fund is kept to a minimum to accomplish proof of concept and threat replication IOT influence the Army’s capacity to adapt to the evolving threat while informing subsequent TRADOC DOTMLPF-P integration.  AWG will focus efforts to investigate, evaluate, and quantify various Commercial-Off-The-Shelf /Government-Off-The-Shelf platforms and systems for purposes of research and development, testing, capability and limitation experimenting, and procurement for solutions to emerging capability gaps.  These efforts will focus on near term, leveraging existing technology, and addressing identified capability gaps for emerging research shortfalls, PIPs, leap ahead technologies, and fixes to existing shortfalls (reliability, sustainability, and durability).  

The AWG RDTE Base request for FY17 is $250K.  The AWG request is not reflected in funding figures on this R-Form.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The REF harnesses current and emerging technologies to provide rapid solutions to the urgently required capabilities of U.S. Army Forces employed globally.   The REF focus is on rapidly placing capabilities into Soldiers' hands.  This mission is accomplished in one of two ways: rapidly adapting COTS/GOTS/NDI equipment to meet operational needs and developing emerging deployable capability via interaction with research and development organizations and academia.  All capabilities are safety tested prior to insertion into operational environments.  Training and sustainment are provided for every capability until it is transitioned to an approved acquisition program or terminated through an approved Army process.  Operational assessments are conducted to provide feedback in support of Army requirements generation and future capability development.  REF capabilities routinely serve as a bridge to specific ONS, JUONS, and JEONS gaps to meet urgent operational requirements.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides for the advanced component development and prototyping of Army food and combat feeding equipment designed to reduce the logistics burden and Operation and Support (O&amp;S) costs of subsistence support to service personnel. Project supports development of rapidly deployable field food service equipment in coordination with ration development efforts. Project conducts demonstration and validation of improved subsistence support items used to enhance soldier effectiveness and quality of life in the Army and the other military Services, as coordinated with the Department of Defense (DoD) Food Research, Development, Test, Evaluation and Engineering Program. This project develops critical enablers that support the Joint Future Force Capabilities and the Joint expeditionary mindset by maintaining readiness through fielding and integrating new equipment. This equipment enhances the field soldier's well-being and provides the soldier with usable equipment, in addition to reducing sustainment requirements, related Combat Support/Combat Service Support (CS/CSS) demands on lift, combat zone footprint, and costs for logistical support.

This PE/Project supports Field Feeding programs for the Army.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Tactical Exploitation of National Capabilities (TENCAP) program serves as the Army's centralized lead to perform National Intelligence cross-agency engineering to evaluate, enhance, prototype, and transition Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) technologies/capabilities developed by Science and Technology (S&amp;T) and other activities across the National Intelligence Community (IC) into Army systems and architectures.  TENCAP (1) ensures continued access to current National and Theater sensors and supporting tactical architectures; and (2) exploits new developments that focus on improving the analysis and tasking, collection, processing, exploitation, dissemination and feedback (TCPEDF) of intelligence data.  This includes efforts to: (1) shorten targeting timelines down to Platoon level; (2) enhance target identification; (3) provide better target location (accuracy); (4) provide continued coverage of a target; and (5) develop in-theater analytic tools to enable data exploitation in near-real-time support to contingency operations.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Army Tactical Exploitation of National Capabilities (TENCAP) mission is a Congressionally mandated and chartered enduring requirement to leverage National intelligence capabilities useful to the tactical Army.  The Army TENCAP acquisition strategy is driven by an annual TENCAP General Officer Steering Group (TGOSG), co-chaired by the Army G2; Army G8; and the Military Deputy to the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology [ASA(ALT)]; and includes representatives from the Army G3; Army G6; Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC); and the Program Executive Office for Intelligence, Electronic Warfare and Sensors (PEO IEW&amp;S).  The TGOSG reviews, validates, prioritizes, and guides Army TENCAP efforts, according to Army and Defense strategy. Based on this TGOSG guidance, Army TENCAP invests BA 6.4 RDTE in Intelligence Community (IC) developments during the more cost-effective advanced development phase to ensure Army requirements are met with minimal redundancy.  Army TENCAP then uses BA 6.5 RDTE to manage the transition of these advanced development efforts through system development and integration into Army Programs of Record (POR).  This strategy ensures these leveraged investments remain viable through multiple budget cycles, significantly increasing successful transition to recipient Army POR.  With acquisition discipline and oversight provided by PEO IEW&amp;S, Army TENCAP executes the TGOSG approved efforts through use of multiple contracts and agreements with the military, National agencies, Labs, Industry Partners and Academia for the full duration required to complete development and transition these National capabilities into enduring Army programs.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element focuses on efforts to evaluate and integrate technologies and representative prototype systems that facilitate the development of Soldier-borne sensor devices transitioning from the laboratory to operational use. Efforts focus on proving out commonality across as broad a spectrum of users as possible to provide enhanced Soldier products, giving them superiority on the battlefield.

Project VT7 (Soldier Maneuver Sensors-Advanced Development): These efforts focus on providing enhanced products to give Soldiers superiority on the battlefield by providing the capability to detect enemy snipers using precise target information to mitigate operational risk before sniper fire occurs. This project integrates higher resolution thermal focal plane arrays, integrated ballistic solutions to auto-adjust reticles for range, wireless technology with weapon sights, improved range, performance, and capability, while decreasing system size and weight.  These integration efforts enhance Soldier situational awareness, lethality, survivability, mobility, and comfort in combat and training environments. Additionally, this project supports efforts to evaluate and integrate technologies and representative prototype systems for the development of Soldier-borne sensor devices, transitioning from the Science and Technology (S&amp;T) arena to operational use. This project includes cost associated with efforts for integration and interface of products on Soldiers head, body and weapons.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>These efforts focus on providing enhanced products to give Soldiers superiority on the battlefield by providing the capability to detect enemy snipers using precise target information to mitigate operational risk before sniper fire occurs. This project integrates higher resolution thermal focal plane arrays, integrated ballistic solutions to auto-adjust reticles for range, wireless technology with weapon sights, improved range, performance, and capability, while decreasing system size and weight.  These integration efforts enhance Soldier situational awareness, lethality, survivability, mobility, and comfort in combat and training environments. Additionally, this project supports efforts to evaluate and integrate technologies and representative prototype systems for the development of Soldier-borne sensor devices, transitioning from the Science and Technology (S&amp;T) arena to operational use. This project includes cost associated with efforts for integration and interface of products on Soldiers head, body and weapons.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Title>Family of Weapon Sights (FWS)</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>FWS is a family of weapon sights that enable combat forces to acquire and engage targets with small arms and to conduct surveillance and Enhanced Target Engagement under day/night obscurants, no-light, and adverse weather conditions. The family utilizes advancements in thermal and low light level sensors to produce Individual (I), Crew-Served (CS), and Sniper (S) weapon sights operable in-line with a day optic or in stand-alone mode. This project integrates a smaller pixel focal plane array in multiple large format sizes to improve sensitivity, clarity, and range, while simultaneously reducing the size, weight and power consumption of both the Crew-Served and Sniper variants.  The FWS-I variant is a weapon mounted long-wave infrared sensor that enables Soldiers to fire quickly and accurately from any carry position and with significantly reduced exposure to enemy fire by providing a wireless zeroed weapon aim point in the Soldier's goggle. Leveraging the success of the Individual variant development, the FWS-CS variant operates as the primary sight; it includes a wireless Helmet Mount Display (HMD) and provides the Soldier, with input from a laser rangefinder device, a more accurate aim point that adjusts automatically for range, ammunition characteristics, and vertical angle. The FWS-S variant mounts in-line with the Sniper’s direct view optic providing a thermal imagery capability to the host weapon at the weapon’s maximum effective range, plus 20% overmatch.  FWS-S provides Snipers a large format display with increased pixel density that enables accurate long range engagements while maintaining day sight, extending the lethality and providing exceptional observation.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>There is a broad application potential for environmental quality technology (EQT) to be applied to multiple Army weapon systems and installations.  However technology must be demonstrated and validated (total ownership cost and performance data identified) before potential users will consider exploiting it.  This program element includes projects focused on validating the general military utility or cost reduction potential of technology when applied to different types of infrastructure, military equipment or techniques.  It may include validations and proof-of-principle demonstrations in field exercises to evaluate upgrades or provide new operational capabilities.  The validation of technologies will be in as realistic an operating environment as possible to assess performance or cost reduction potential.  EQT demonstration/validation is systemic; i.e., applies to a class of systems (e.g., vehicles or aircraft) or to a Department of Army-wide, multiple site/installation problem (e.g., unexploded ordnance detection and discrimination).  This program will address, and eventually resource, programs in each of the Army environmental quality technology pillars (military materials in the environment, sustainable ranges and lands, compliance, and pollution prevention).  All work must be endorsed by potential users and supported by a state-of-the-art assessment (i.e., "technology is heading for user to implement").</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The National Defense Center for Environmental Excellence (NDCEE) was established by Congress in 1990 with a directive to "serve as a national leadership organization to address high priority environmental problems for the Department of Defense (DoD), other government organizations, and the industrial community."  The NDCEE Program is a national resource for developing and disseminating advanced environmental technologies.  The NDCEE is used to demonstrate environmentally acceptable technology to industry; validate new technology prior to transferring that technology; and assist in the training of potential users as part of that technology transfer process.  The NDCEE is a DoD resource for environmental quality management and technology validation.  This program is managed by the Army on behalf of the Office of the Assistant Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Environment.  In May 2008, the program name was redesignated from the National Defense for Environmental Excellence to the National Defense Center for Energy and Environment to ensure that the Center's mission recognizes and addresses the strategic interdependence of energy and environmental technology requirements within an overall sustainability framework in support of our installations, weapons systems and war fighters.  This name change also directly supports the DoD's proactive implementation of Executive Order 13423, "Strengthening Federal Environmental, Energy and Transportation Management."

Our broadly encompassing and growing mobile, personal and stationary advanced energy technology requirements include infrastructure, alternative and synthetic fuels, surety, renewables, storage, distribution, advanced power, micro-grids, transportation, systems integration and others.  Further, to train as we fight, validated energy and environmental technologies need to be available and implemented at our installations.  The NDCEE will continue to demonstrate, validate, and transfer these technologies supporting our integrated environment, safety, occupational health and energy objectives with full consideration of the triple bottom line of mission, environment and community.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The NDCEE is a national asset focused on DoD applications that include technology transfer to appropriate DoD organizations.  The NDCEE fosters an outreach program to describe its products and capabilities that include publication of results and participation in professional meetings, symposia, conferences, and appropriate coordination with industry.  The management strategy for the NDCEE centers on a DoD Executive Advisory Board (EAB) chaired by the DoD NDCEE Executive Agent on behalf of the Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Installations and Environment and composed of senior DoD leadership to oversee NDCEE operations.  The EAB is supported by the NDCEE Technical Working Group (TWG) that includes senior level staff members from each of the offices represented on the EAB.  The NDCEE TWG coordinates all NDCEE activities, votes on proposed joint NDCEE projects, and reports back to the EAB Principals.  Working at the tactical levels, three Focus Groups (evironment, safety/occupational health, and energy) were established to develop joint projects.  The Army's Environmental Quality Technology Program participating in the the Focus Groups also assists in the formulation of suggested environmental technology projects to be demonstrated within the NDCEE Program.  The contracting strategy of the NDCEE is based on using an NDCEE Contracting Officer's Representative to validate all the contractual portions of the NDCEE and by technical monitors (TM) to oversee the technical aspects of each contracted task.  A prime contractor operates NDCEE test facility to validate environmentally compatible technologies on a representative "shop floor".  The NDCEE accounts for and conducts work for: (1) direct funded Army tasks; (2) reimbursable tasks from within DoD and from other Government agencies; and (3) when applicable Congressionally directed and funded tasks.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports Advanced Component Development and Prototypes of environmental quality technologies developed within the Army Environmental Quality Technology program.  The project increases operational sustainment and warfighter training capabilities by reducing soldier and worker health risks and environmental quality impacts that would otherwise result in restoration needs and compliance enforcement actions against installations while simultaneously increasing performance and standardization across the Army.  The project expedites technology transition from the laboratory to operational use by demonstrating new materials and processes to fulfill the performance requirements outlined in Material Specifications, Depot Maintenance Work Requirements, Technical Manuals, Drawings and other technical data.  Materials and processes demonstrated under this project are inherently more sustainable than the baseline with respect to environmental, safety and occupational health concerns, thereby reducing life cycle costs incurred by acquisition, industrial base and installation end users.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program implements the provisions of Title 10 U.S. Code, Section 2350a, Cooperative Research and Development (R&amp;D) Projects: Allied Countries.  The objective is to improve, through the application of emerging technologies, the conventional defense capabilities of the United States and our cooperative partners, including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), U.S. major non-NATO allies and Friendly Foreign countries. Through technology sharing and joint equipment development these projects help reduce U.S. acquisition costs and leverage important technologies for the Army Transformation and the development of the Future Combat system. Cooperative efforts also improve multinational force compatibility with potential coalition partners through the development and use of similar equipment and improved interfaces. The program focuses specifically on international cooperative technology demonstration, validation, and interoperability of Army weapon and command, control, communications and information (C3I) systems, including the NATO Defense Against Terrorism initiatives. Projects are implemented through international agreements with foreign partners that define scope, cost and work sharing arrangements, management, contracting, security, data protection and third party transfers.  Funds are used to pay for only the U.S. work share that occurs in the United States at U.S. Government and U.S. contractor facilities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>In Fiscal Year (FY) 2015, funding for Advanced Maintenance Concepts was realigned to Program Element (PE) 0605830A Project EE5 to reflect development efforts in Budget Activity 05, System Development and Demonstration. 

In FY 2017, Future Vertical Lift, Project B47, will receive funds in PE 0603801A.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>PE 0603801A Project B32, Advanced Maintenance Concepts provides advanced development aviation support of programs that include advanced maintenance concepts and equipment. This program provides for development of rapid battle repair procedures, tools development to speed the return of aircraft to a full mission status, and development of new equipment for aerial recovery of damaged aircraft. Included in this project are: diagnostics/prognostic monitoring systems, Aviation Ground Power Unit (AGPU) redesign and incorporation of AGPU modularity capabilities, Aviation Light Utility Mobile Maintenance Cart (ALUMMC), Aviation Unit Maintenance Shop Set (AVUM SS), Unit Maintenance Aerial Recovery Kit (UMARK) and development support for tools needed to provide maintenance support to modernized/future force aircraft.  There is no funding for this project in FY 2015 and beyond.

PE 0603801A Project B47, Future Vertical Lift (FVL) is an initiative, not yet an acquisition program, to develop a family of vertical lift aircraft for the United States Armed Forces. FVL was established in 2009 by the Secretary of Defense to focus all Department of Defense (DoD) vertical lift capabilities and technology development, as well as retaining long-term engineering capabilities. In October 2011, the Deputy Secretary of Defense issued the FVL Strategic Plan to outline a joint approach for the next generation vertical lift aircraft for all military services. The Strategic Plan provided a foundation for replacing the current fleet with advanced capability by shaping the development of vertical lift aircraft for the next 25 to 40 years.  The development and fielding of FVL will significantly improve vertical lift capabilities providing critical aviation support to the Joint warfighting community.  Increases in range, speed, payload, survivability, reliability, and reduced logistical footprint can only be achieved through the FVL approach of developing a new aircraft design.  FVL will integrate advancements in technologies and design configurations balanced with appropriate trades to ensure affordability. 

FY 2017 funding provides for Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) Modeling, Simulation, and Analysis and provides for Systems Engineering and Program Management (SEPM).  FY 2018 continues to fund AoA efforts and provides funding for SEPM.  FY 2019 supports Milestone A, Request for Proposal (RFP) development, RFP release, and SEPM.  FY 2020 funds Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB), and continues to provide funding for SEPM.  FY 2021 provides for air vehicle contract award and provides funding for SEPM.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>FY17 dollars in the amount of $4.221M continue to support project advanced component development, and prototype of equipment and sub-systems supporting the Army Watercraft mission to provide critical capabilities in support of Unified Land Operations (ULO), by extending the Commander's available maneuver space into and throughout the littorals, inland waterways and near coastal regions. Army watercraft equipment supports the conduct of riverine, Logistics Over The Shore (LOTS), Joint Logistics Over The Shore (JLOTS), inter and intratheater transport, movement and maneuver, mission command and sustainment, as identified in DODD 5100.01 (Functions of the Department of Defense and its Major Components). Army Watercraft exploit the inland waterways and littoral regions as waterborne maneuver and supply routes, conducting operations through littoral entry points (developed, undeveloped, and austere access points) and in non-permissive, and/or denied access scenarios. The Army uses a spectrum of Army Watercraft Systems, from heavy sustainment ocean going landing craft capable of intratheater and ship to shore transport and undeveloped beach or harbor access, to ocean-going and harbor utility tug boats and barge derricks for transport and denied port/salvage operations, and modular causeway systems to support LOTS/JLOTS. The funding supports initiatives to enhance the seaworthiness, safety, survivability, supportability, energy efficiency, environmental, regulatory compliance and reliability of existing systems.  Funded efforts will advance critical gaps in these areas for the current fleet, while at the same time researching, developing and testing emergent technologies in a manner to support future acquisitions and future fleet planning. The funding supports our ability to be compliant with the National Defense Authorization Act of 1996 Section 312 and 502(6) of the Clean Water Act and compliance with Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) emission standards.  

FY17 funding will primarily support the maturation of At Sea Transfer - Modular Warping Tug (MWT) Repower study and an (MWT) Electrical Standardization study.  Additional requirements to support Energy and Efficiency Compliance, Uniform National Discharge Standards (UNDS) across the fleet and Force Protection for LSV.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Tactical Electric Power (TEP) program was established by the Department of Defense to develop modernized, standard families of mobile electric power sources and power distribution systems for all Services throughout the Department of Defense.  Project Manager Expeditionary Energy &amp; Sustainment Systems (PM E2S2) derives concept and technology developments that will improve the performance, mobility, readiness and survivability of the next generation of tactical power sources in support of all Services.  It supports initiatives that are essential to the development and fielding of modernized TEP sources from Watts to Megawatts level that comply with environmental statues and provide noise and signature-suppressed, energy-efficient, lightweight, deployable and reliable equipment.  FY16 &amp; FY17 funding will support test and evaluation of technologies for Small Tactical Electric Power (STEP), Mobile Electric Hybrid Power Sources (MEHPS), and Management and Distribution Control (MDC). Also funding will support a holistic Modeling and Simulation approach to the evaluation of Operational Energy (OE)-related impacts, systems, and improvements; with the vision of reducing Army energy dependency and demand, increasing systems and contingency bases energy efficiency, seeking alternative energy sources and supporting a culture of energy responsibility while sustaining or enhancing operational capabilities.  This includes support of the Joint Operational Energy Initiative (JOEI).  Out years will support investigation of general advancements in engine, power equipment, energy storage, renewable/alternative energy, and power distribution equipment that are applicable to current equipment and emerging requirements.  In addition, an extensive analysis of commercial generator technology is planned to support requirements definition for the next family of tactical sets.  Programs include costs for developing concept hardware and executing system evaluations at the Network Integration Evaluation (NIE) events at Ft. Bliss.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project develops and demonstrates the potential of prototype equipment and technologies to satisfy petroleum storage, distribution, and quality surveillance system requirements.  The Technology Development programs support the development and enhancement of rapidly deployable Petroleum and Water equipment.  The mission includes developing fuel quality analysis systems; achieving greater capabilities in the removal of Nuclear, Biological, Chemical (NBC) and other contaminants from water sources; reducing the logistics footprint; developing water reutilization systems to reduce the requirement for transport of water into the theater; and material systems to decrease the logistics footprint and employment time for the transfer of liquid logistics in joint operations area.  This vital equipment enables the Army to achieve its mission by providing the Army with the means to be highly mobile and self-sustaining in very hostile joint operations areas.  Future Force operations demand that combat systems be rapidly deployable to the theater, rapidly emplaced upon arrival, and rapidly relocated to support a fast moving non-linear battlefield.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports development of critical soldier support and sustainment systems including shelter systems (rigid and soft wall), base camp subsystems, field service systems, mortuary affairs equipment, heaters, camouflage systems to counter emerging enemy threat technologies, and other combat service support equipment. These systems will fill identified theater distribution and services capability gaps, improve unit sustainability, improve resource and energy efficiency and increase combat effectiveness. This project supports Advanced Component Development and Prototyping of critical tactical support systems that support mobile Joint Service command and control, medical, and maintenance platforms. This project develops critical enablers that support the Quartermaster (QM) Force Transformation Strategy and The Army's Modular Capabilities by maintaining readiness through fielding and integrating new equipment. This project also ensures Army Expeditionary Forces are capable of rapid deployment and reduces sustainment requirements, related Combat Support/Combat Service Support (CS/CSS) demands in lift, combat zone footprint, and costs for logistical support.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>Zero-Footprint Base Camp reduces the operational energy and logistics footprint of the expeditionary base camp system, with the goal being a significant reduction in fuel, water, and power requirements to sustain operations in the field in addition to reducing site preparation, maintenance, and spare parts requirements. Operating a base camp such as Force Provider requires a significant amount of logistics support and also produces an enormous amount of by products, both of which cost money, human effort (that means a risk in the form of soldiers on the road), and represents a potential vulnerability.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element (PE) funds development of medical materiel within the early system integration portion of the System Development and Demonstration phase of the acquisition life cycle using 6.4 funding. Program efforts support transition of promising Science and Technology candidate medical technologies (drugs, vaccines, medical devices, diagnostics, and mechanisms for detection and control of disease carrying insects) to larger scale testing in humans for safety and effectiveness. Programs are aligned to meet future force requirements identified within concept documents and organizational structures. This Program Element also provides funding for Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulated human clinical trials to gain additional information about safety and effectiveness on the path to licensure for use in humans.  The Projects supported by this PE are: 

(PROJ 808) funds development of candidate medical countermeasures for infectious diseases of military relevance. Efforts include vaccines, drugs, diagnostic kits/devices, and insect control measures. These funds support human clinical efficacy trials of the drug/vaccine in a larger group that are designed to assess performance and to continue safety assessments in a larger group of volunteers. Products from this project will transition to PE 0604807A, Project 849.

(PROJ 811) funds the development of military relevant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) medical countermeasures. It provides funding for planning and conducting of human clinical trials in a group of healthy volunteers to assess the drug/vaccine for safety, tolerability, how the drug/vaccine is distributed, metabolized, and excreted from the body, and investigate the appropriate dose for therapeutic use. Products from this project will transition to PE 0604807A, Project 812.

(PROJ 836) funds the demonstration and validation of medical products for enhanced combat casualty care and follow-on care, including rehabilitation. This project also funds the human clinical trials that test the safety and effectiveness of biologics, devices and demonstration. Clinical trials are conducted in accordance with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations. Products from this project will transition to PE 0604807A, Project 832. 

(PROJ VS7) funds program upgrades, retrofits, trains, and sustains the fleet of Medical Evacuation legacy helicopters that continue to play a major role in Iraq and Afghanistan. The approved force design increased the number of air frames in the force from 12 to 15 aircraft for 37 MEDEVAC companies. All products from this project will transition to PE 0604807A Project VS8.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project funds development of candidate medical countermeasures for infectious diseases of military relevance.  These efforts are in: vaccines, drugs, diagnostic kits/devices, and to determine if insects are infected with pathogenic organisms capable of infecting service members/preventive medicine measures. These funds support human clinical effectiveness (capacity to produce a desired size of an effect under ideal or optimal conditions) trials of the drug/vaccine in larger groups that are designed to assess how well the drug/vaccine works, and to continue safety assessments in a larger group of volunteers. Funding supports both technical evaluations and human clinical testing to assure the safety and effectiveness of medical diagnostic kits and devices. This work, which is performed in military laboratories or civilian pharmaceutical firms, is directed toward the prevention of disease, early diagnosis, and accelerated recovery time once diagnosed; to enhance battlefield readiness. All clinical trials are conducted in accordance with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations, a mandatory obligation for all military products placed into the hands of medical providers or service members. Product development priorities are determined based upon four major factors: (1) the extent and threat of the disease within the Combatant Commands theater of operations, (2) the clinical severity of the disease, (3) the technical maturity of the proposed solution, and (4) the affordability of the solution (development and production).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project funds development of militarily relevant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) medical countermeasures.  It provides funding for the planning and conducting of human clinical trials in a group of healthy volunteers to assess the drug/vaccine for safety, tolerability, how the drug/vaccine is distributed, metabolized, and excreted from the body, and to investigate the appropriate dose for therapeutic use.  Development efforts are focused on militarily unique needs effecting manning, mobilization, and deployment.

In addition, novel findings in the properties of some circulating antibodies prompted planning for an open label extension to start in FY15. Completed FY15 collection of invasive samples for safety and effectiveness clinical trials RV306 and RV328; those samples have a requirement for immediate processing and analysis. Concluded FY15 RV306 and 328 with costs associated with the five clinical trial sites associated with those protocols.</r2:Text>

Results of RV305 resulted in a rollover study (RV305 amendment) which provides an additional boost dose to selected vaccine recipients. Continue candidate vaccine trials RV306 (evaluation of different one-year boosts) and RV328 (study of AIDSVAX B/E alone) to produce further immunogenicity data that complement the RV305 data. Continue the RV403 in Mozambique, Uganda, and Thailand. Compare the studies of immune responses induced by the RV144 regimen using AIDSVAX B/E mixed with L(MPLA) [monophosphoryl lipid A) with liposomes.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project funds the demonstration and validation of medical products for enhanced combat casualty care and follow-on care, including rehabilitation.  This project funds human clinical trials to test the safety and effectiveness of biologics (products derived from living organisms) and devices necessary to meet medical requirements.  When available, commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) medical products are also tested and evaluated for transition to engineering and manufacturing development.  Consideration is also given to reducing the medical logistics footprint through smaller weight, volume, and equipment independence from supporting materials.  All clinical trials are conducted in accordance with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Original models of Army Black Hawk MEDEVAC helicopters continue to play a major role in maintaining high US troop survival rates in Iraq and Afghanistan by evacuating wounded troops in less than one-hour.  In 2009 a VCSA-approved force design update increased the number of air frames in the force from 12 to 15 aircraft for 37 MEDEVAC companies to better meet operational needs.  In 2010, the AMEDD accepted life-cycle management of the MEDEVAC MEP from PEO Aviation.  In order to achieve required operational capability and enhance commonality across the MEDEVAC fleet, the MEDEVAC MEP program upgrades, retrofits, trains, and sustains the 256 MEDEVAC legacy helicopters to achieve the medical capability provided by the HH-60M, which is factory built for the MEDEVAC mission.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) for Advanced Component Development and Prototypes manages the Soldier as a system in order to increase combat effectiveness, test and deliver tangible products that save Soldier's lives, and improve Soldier's quality of life.  It evaluates, develops, and tests emerging technologies and critical Soldier support systems to reduce technology risk.

Project ET8 funding (Personnel Airdrop System) supports efforts to improve Static Line (SL) and Military Free Fall (MFF) personnel parachutes and associated equipment to include canopy improvements based on integration of new technology with the goal of enhancing the insertion capability of the airborne soldier and increasing the performance, safety and durability of personnel airdrop equipment.

Project S51 funding (Aircrew Integrated Systems) supports component development and prototyping of critical Soldier support systems and other combat service support equipment that will improve unit sustainability and combat effectiveness.   

Project S53 funding (Clothing and Equipment) supports development of state-of-the-art technology to improve tactical and non-tactical clothing and individual equipment to enhance the lethality, survivability, and mobility of the individual Soldier. 

Project S54 funding (Small Arms Improvement) provides funds to develop, demonstrate and evaluate emerging technology for integration of systems, subcomponents and prototypes designed to enhance lethality, target acquisition, fire control, training effectiveness and reliability for current and future small arms weapon systems and ammunition.

Project VS4 funding (Soldier Protective Equipment) supports efforts to evaluate integrated technologies and representative or prototype systems that help expedite Individual Soldier Ballistic Protection technology transition from the laboratory to operational use.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports the Advanced Component Development and Prototyping of select Air Soldier System (Air SS) technologies. The Air SS provides improved safety, survivability, and human performance that amplifies the Warfighter's effectiveness and facilitates full-spectrum dominance of Army aircraft. The Air SS addresses capability gaps identified during combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan including the effects of weight and bulk, limited situational awareness, and lack of functionally integrated aircrew member life support equipment. The Air SS follows an evolutionary acquisition approach that integrates mature technologies to build to the full capability. Air SS reduces overall weight and bulk of aircrew equipment, increases situational awareness, and enhances aircrew mobility. This funding provides advanced development for the Air SS in technology areas supporting improved laser eye protection, integrated power, wireless personal area networks, lightweight protective clothing, and tactile situational awareness cueing. Includes integration and interface of products on Soldiers.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This funding supports efforts to evaluate and integrate technologies and representative or prototype systems that help expedite Soldier uniform and clothing technology transition from the laboratory to operational use.  Efforts focus on proving out commonality across as broad a spectrum of users as possible to provide a modular, integrated uniform/clothing system from skin out and head-to-toe.  It funds efforts to investigate new technologies and domestically available fabrics with Flame Resistance, moisture wicking, insect protection and camouflage technologies, including evaluation and integration of fabrics appropriate for uniforms and equipment used in jungle/tropical and Arctic environments. It funds efforts to improve personnel parachutes, to include analysis of canopy cloth fabrics and pack volume techniques.  New technologies are investigated to monitor health and improve Soldier survivability, reduce weight, and improve affordability, mobility and comfort in combat and training/administrative environments.  Includes integration and interface on the Soldier system.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This PE provides funding for analytical support of Analysis of Alternatives (AoA). Based on Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 5000.02, AoAs are required to be completed for a new start program prior to its first Milestone (MS) Decision. AoAs are a statutory requirement for ACAT I and ACAT II programs and regulatory for ACAT III programs.  The AoAs support the preparation of the Capability Development Document (CDD), Key Performance Parameters (KPP) and Thresholds within the CDDs and tradeoff analysis.  The Army must complete an AoA prior to the MS A Decision in order to successfully achieve a MS A decision for new start programs.  This PE provides central funding for new start programs prior to a materiel development decision which do not yet have a Program Manager assigned for materiel development.  The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy and Plan.  Work in this PE is performed by analytical agencies such as U.S. Army TRADOC Analysis Center and U.S. Army Materiel Systems Analysis Activity. The Army is projecting to start work on several AoAs beginning in FY 2017, and will assess and fund the highest Army priorities during the year of execution.

The FY 2017 funding request was reduced by $3.374 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Lower Tier Missile Defense (LTAMD) Capability program will integrate a competitively selected Gallium Nitride (GaN) array antenna onto the baseline PATRIOT RS, replacing the Passive Electronic Scanned Array (PESA) technology. The Active Electronic Scanned Array (AESA) antenna configuration change, using GaN-based technology, will enable increased radar operating ranges thereby maximizing the inherent PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhanced (MSE) capabilities to engage threats.

Lower Tier Missile Defense (LTAMD) Capability tasks include all the programmatic and engineering activities needed for the LTAMD-C Materiel Development Decision, Analysis of Alternatives, and Business Case Analyses/Trades. Once the material solution has been determined, the development effort for LTAMD Capability will be accomplished. These activities will continue through the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction(TMRR) and Engineering and Manufacturing Development(EMD) phase to enable the prototyping, development, and testing of the LTAMD Capability.

FY2017 base dollars in the amount of $35.132 million initiates Lower Tier Missile Defense Capability to include programmatic and engineering activities needed for the Material Development, Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) and Business Case Analyses/Trades.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Lower Tier Missile Defense (LTAMD) Capability program will integrate a competitively selected Gallium Nitride (GaN) array antenna onto the baseline PATRIOT RS, replacing the Passive Electronic Scanned Array (PESA) technology. The Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) antenna configuration change, using GaN-based technology, will enable increased radar operating ranges thereby maximizing the inherent PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhanced (MSE) capabilities to engage threats.

Lower Tier Missile Defense (LTAMD) Capability tasks include all the programmatic and engineering activities needed for the LTAMD-C Materiel Development Decision, Analysis of Alternatives, and Business Case Analyses/Trades. Once the material solution has been determined, the development effort for LTAMD Capability will be accomplished.  These activities will continue through the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction and Engineering and Manufacturing Development phase to enable the prototyping, development, and testing of the LTAMD Capability.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) funds prototyping and demonstration of selected technology enabled capabilities to support advanced ground, aviation systems, command, control, communications &amp; reconnaissance systems and equipment, precision weapons, and Soldier equipment. Funding facilitates maturation and demonstration of advanced technologies and systems in relevant environments and tactical/operational scenarios, taking technologies to a goal of Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 7 and reducing risk for acquisition programs of record.  Efforts include competitive prototyping earlier in development to facilitate transition of new capabilities into acquisition programs. In Project DS3, efforts are directed by an Army Senior Executive Steering Group to ensure that demonstrations have high potential for filling capability gaps and transition. Project EX3 funds prototyping and demonstration of ground vehicles to assess future concepts and designs against selected capability trades and future technologies for current and future combat vehicles across the combat vehicle portfolio. This PE provides the Army an improved mechanism for fulfilling the goals of the Weapon Systems Acquisition Reform Act (WSARA) of 2009 by enabling greater competition in the latter stages of technology maturation and establishes a closer alignment between Science and Technology (S&amp;T) programs and acquisition programs.

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.
     
Work in this PE is performed by the Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM), Engineering Research Development Center (ERDC), and Space and Missile Defense Command (SMDC).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Assured Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) will provide Army forces with unhindered access to trusted PNT information under conditions where space based PNT (Global Positioning System (GPS)) may be limited or denied. Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memo (JROCM) 049-10, dated April 5th 2010, approved the Positioning, Navigation and Timing Assurance Initial Capabilities Document and designated the Army as the Lead Component for Assured PNT. The Material Development Decision (MDD) was approved on July 30th 2013.  The Assured PNT draft Capabilities Development Document was validated by the Army Requirements Oversight Council (AROC) on July 28th 2014. 

PNT is a critical enabler of many Army systems. The current capability, GPS, is a fixed frequency system vulnerable to current and emerging threats and field conditions, which means Warfighter assured access and integrity to PNT is not guaranteed.  This situation degrades mission performance to an unacceptable level. Therefore, current Army systems cannot operate at the required PNT Assurance Levels with GPS alone.

Assured PNT is a family of solutions which includes four subprograms: (EH9) The Pseudolites subprogram provides PNT Assurance in GPS denied environments by providing terrestrial radio navigation (GPS-like) service in electronically or physically challenged environments using a higher power signal. (EJ2) The Mounted PNT subprogram is the integration of multiple sensors and provides PNT platform distribution. The Mounted PNT subprogram incorporates a System of Systems architecture that acquires, protects and distributes secure PNT on stationary and vehicular platforms. (EH8) The Dismounted PNT subprogram is the integration of multiple sensors for platform distribution of PNT on the Soldier. The Dismounted PNT subprogram incorporates a System of Systems architecture that acquires, protects and distributes secure PNT on the soldier. (EJ3) The Anti-Jam Antenna subprogram provides GPS signal protection and PNT Assurance in challenged environments through anti-jam technologies. Anti-jam enables tactical capabilities through assured signal acquisition in challenged environments. 

0604120/ED5 funding line continues as the Assured PNT parent funding line. However, four (4) separate project lines were created for the Assured PNT subprograms; EH8 – Dismounted PNT subprogram; EH9 – Pseudolite subprogram; EJ2 – Mounted PNT subprogram; EJ3 - Anti-Jam Antenna subprogram.

FY 2017 Base funds in the total amount of $83.279 million are provided to continue the development of the A-PNT program. The ED5 funding line accounts for $11.116 million for PNT System of Systems Architecture (SOSA) Testing and enhancements of Army PNT capabilities against emerging threats. The EH8 funding line accounts for $3.200 million for risk reduction activities and program documentation in preparation for Milestone B of the Dismounted PNT subprogram. The EH9 funding line accounts for $57.411 million for the continuation of the TMRR competitive prototyping effort and program documentation in preparation for Milestone B for the Pseudolite subprogram. The EJ2 funding line accounts for $11.552 million for Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) and program documentation in preparation for Milestone B of the Mounted PNT subprogram.

                        <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>ED5 - Assured PNT FY 2015 Base funds in the amount of $11.447 million are associated with EH9 - Pseudolites Subprogram. FY 2015 funds were provided the Assured PNT Program to initiate the development of Pseudolites. FY 2016 funds of $9.700 million support Military GPS User Equipment (MGUE) Precision Guided Munitions. FY 2017 funds of $11.116 million support Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) System of Systems Architecture (SOSA) Testing and enhancements of Army PNT capabilities against emerging threats.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>FY15: The Planned Acquisition Strategy for the Pseudolite subprogram includes: 1) Technology maturation of the Transmitter segment through the use of two competitive prototyping, cost-plus fixed fee (CPFF) contracts. 2) Command and Control (C2) segment will leverage the development by other DoD agencies to the greatest extent possible, specifically, the Electronic Warfare Planning and Management Tool (EWPMT); this will be a Government Off the Shelf (GOTS) product. 3) Receiver segment will make the use of multiple contracts through existing vehicles for Pseudolite Receiver SW Prototype Development.

FY16: The acquisition strategy includes the acceleration of Military GPS User Equipment (MGUE) Increment 2 for Precision Guided Munitions (AM2P).  This will provide a technology maturity assessment of MGUE Increment 1 technology and increase supply chain competition for subsequent use by Joint Precision Guided Munitions (PGM) to avoid potential significant performance and operation risks. The Joint Common GPS Specification and Interface Control Document will be validated through live fire Technology Readiness Level 6 (TRL6) demonstration. The M-Code GPS enables essential PGM-based lethality capabilities in potential "M-Code Only" GPS combat scenarios and maintains combat overmatch enabled by Joint GPS-based PGMs.

FY17: The planned acquisition strategy for PNT System of Systems Architecture (SOSA) Testing and Resiliency and Software Assurance Modification (RSAM) implementation is to award sole source contracts to the original equipment manufacturers, utilize existing engineering support contracts, and leverage the Communications Electronics Research Development Engineering Center (CERDEC) to develop and evaluate solutions that will mitigate emerging threats.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Assured Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) Acquisition Strategy is focused on the acquisition of a family of solutions required to achieve the Assured PNT capability.  The materiel solutions are partitioned into subprograms (Pseudolites, Mounted PNT, Dismounted PNT, and Anti-jam Antenna) to allow for the optimization of solutions for various Army formations.  EH8 is specifically for the acquisition of Dismounted PNT.

The Dismounted PNT acquisition strategy will begin at Milestone B in FY18.  After a successful MS B approval the proposed strategy is to award a single Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract through full and open competition with priced options for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) and for the procurement of all technical data relevant to the performance of this contract or life cycle of this program.

FY15-FY17:
The planned Dismounted subprogram acquisition strategy uses Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Science and Technology (S&amp;T) funding and Budget Activity (BA) 4 funding for the technology maturation and risk reduction phase (SBIR Phase I and II).   Phase I will reduce associated risks, overall development costs, and develop the technology to Technical Readiness Level (TRL) 6 prior to Milestone B and enables incremental development prototyping in support of transition to planned program of record.  Phase II will provide funding for key features and functionality desired by PM PNT to significantly advance the design for a clear transition to Engineering Manufacturing Development.  

FY18 and beyond:
During Engineering and Manufacturing Development, the chosen vendor will develop the Dismounted PNT system.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>0604120/ED5 funding line continues as the Assured PNT parent funding line. However, four (4) separate project lines were created for the Assured PNT subprograms: EH8 – Dismounted PNT subprogram; EH9 – Pseudolite subprogram; EJ2 – Mounted PNT subprogram; EJ3 - Anti-Jam Antenna subprogram.

EH9 - Pseudolites subprogram funds prior to FY16 are associated with ED5 – Assured PNT. FY 2016-2019 funds are to continue the development of Pseudolites.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Highly accurate Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) data is a key enabler and a cross cutting capability for Army forces to execute their mission. Army Forces require unhindered access to trusted PNT information under conditions where space based PNT may be limited or denied to maintain its Global Positioning System military advantage on the battlefield. The current capability, Global Positioning System (GPS), is a fixed frequency system which is vulnerable to current and emerging threats and field condition.

Pseudolites (satellite – like transmitters)assure GPS access and integrity by providing PNT via terrestrial and airborne based radio navigation GPS transmitters in electronically or physically challenged environments using a higher power signal. Area protection is provided through the deployment of Pseudolite transmitters supporting a Brigade Combat Team area of operations. The Pseudolites subprogram enables continued operations of PNT-enabled systems such as Blue Force Tracker, Communications Networks and Precision Guided Munitions. The PNT Pseudolite subprogram will consist of three segments: 
1.  Pseudolite Transmitter segment provides terrestrial and airborne radio navigation (GPS-like) service in electronically or physically challenged environments using a high power signal.
2.  Command and Control (C2) segment to control the Pseudolites transmitters on the battlefield.
3.  Receiver segment, which will develop software upgrades to current and future military GPS receivers to receive and process the Pseudolite signals.  

FY 2017 Base funds in the amount of $57.411 million are provided for the continuation of the Pseudolite subprogram. These efforts include the laboratory and field testing of Pseudolite prototypes; platform integration development; integration of M-Code in accordance with Public Law 111-383 Sec 913; participation in various Navigation Warfare (NAVWAR) test events; and documentation preparation to support the Development RFP Release Decision.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Assured Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) Acquisition Strategy is focused on the acquisition of a family of solutions required to achieve the Assured PNT capability. The materiel solutions are partitioned into subprograms (Pseudolites, Mounted PNT, Dismounted PNT, and Anti-jam Antenna) to allow for the optimization of solutions for various Army formations. EH9 is specifically for the acquisition of Pseudolites.

The acquisition strategy was approved by the Milestone Decision Authority and Milestone A was successfully completed in May 2015.  The Pseudolite subprogram is currently in the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction Phase of the acquisition life-cycle.

The TMRR Acquisition Strategy for the Pseudolite subprogram includes: 1) Technology maturation of the Transmitter segment through the use of two competitive prototyping, cost-plus fixed fee (CPFF) contracts. 2) Command and Control (C2) segment will leverage the development by other DoD agencies to the greatest extent possible, specifically, the Electronic Warfare Planning and Management Tool (EWPMT); 3) Receiver segment will make the use of multiple contracts through existing vehicles for Pseudolite Receiver SW Prototype Development. 

Pseudolite Milestone B is planned for FY 2018. After a successful MS B approval, the proposed strategy is to award a single Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract with priced options for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) and for the procurement of all technical data relevant to the performance of this contract or life cycle of this program.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>0604120/ED5 funding line continues as the Assured PNT parent funding line. However, four (4) separate project lines were created for the Assured PNT subprograms: EH8 – Dismounted PNT subprogram; EH9 – Pseudolite subprogram; EJ2 – Mounted PNT subprogram; EJ3 - Anti-Jam Antenna subprogram.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Mounted Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) subprogram:
Highly accurate Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) data is a key enabler and a cross cutting capability for Army forces to execute their mission. Army Forces require unhindered access to trusted PNT information under conditions where space based PNT may be limited or denied to maintain its Global Positioning System military advantage on the battlefield. The current capability, Global Positioning System (GPS), is a fixed frequency system which is vulnerable to current and emerging threats and field condition.

The Mounted A-PNT System is a scalable form-factor that distributes PNT data to multiple devices (client systems) via the PNT System of Systems Architecture (SOSA) in a mounted environment by using GPS signals coupled with non-GPS augmentation while minimizing the redundant costs for Anti-Jam Antennas in GPS degraded or denied environments.  The Mounted A-PNT System is the integration of multiple sensors for platform distribution of PNT, which allows the Soldier to operate in a GPS denied environment.  The Mounted A-PNT System implements a SOSA that acquires, protects and distributes secure PNT on stationary and/or mobile platforms.  The mounted materiel solution paces the threats and is a migration path to future technologies, including M-Code.  

FY 2017 Base funds in the amount of $11.552 million is for the initiation of the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) phase to support the Mounted PNT subprogram.  These efforts include the development, testing and integration activities to demonstrate sufficient technical maturity to support the entrance into the EMD phase.  It will also include the integration of M-Code in accordance with Public Law 111-383 Sec 913 and documentation preparation to support the Milestone A Decision.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Assured Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) Acquisition Strategy is focused on the acquisition of a family of solutions required to achieve the Assured PNT capability. The materiel solutions are partitioned into subprograms (Pseudolites, Mounted PNT, Dismounted PNT, and Anti-jam Antenna) to allow for the optimization of solutions for various Army formations. EJ2 is specifically for the acquisition of Mounted PNT.

Based upon a successful Milestone A Decision, the program funding will be used to continue the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction phase utilizing two contractors developing prototype-construct alternatives; demonstrate and assess the functionality of integrated Anti-Jam Antenna Systems. 

Milestone B is planned for FY 2018. After a successful MS B approval the proposed strategy is to award a single Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract through full and open competition with priced options for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) and for the procurement of all technical data relevant to the performance of this contract or life cycle of this program.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>Funding for FY17 and out for Block 1 activities has been realigned from BA4, PE 0604319/DU3 to BA5, PE 0605052/EY7.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program supports the overall Air and Missile Defense (AMD) architecture and provides a robust intercept capability against Cruise Missiles (CM), Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) and Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar (RAM) threats for deployed forces.  The Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment 2 - Intercept (IFPC Inc 2-I) is a ground-based weapon system that will be designed to acquire, track, engage, and defeat UAS, CM, and RAM. The System will provide 360-degree protection and will simultaneously engage threats arriving from different azimuths. A block acquisition approach will be used to provide this capability. The Block 1 system will consist of an existing interceptor and sensor and development of fire control software and a Multi-Mission Launcher (MML) to support the UAS and CM mission. The IFPC Inc 2-I System will be compatible with the Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) Command and Control (C2) architecture. The IFPC Inc 2-I System will be transportable by Army common mobile platforms. Development of a second  Interceptor for Block 1 begins in FY18. 

The FY 2017 funding request was reduced by $5.000 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Materiel Development Decision (MDD) was completed in fourth quarter Fiscal Year (FY) 2011, allowing for the initiation of an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) to determine materiel solution approach; establishment of requirement baseline; initiation of development of required Milestone documents and execution of the Milestone decision to continue with Research, Development, Test, &amp; Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) efforts associated with conducting an Engineering Demonstration.  

The Government will fund the Aviation and Missile Research Development and Engineering Center (AMRDEC) for the development and demonstration of the Multi-Mission Launcher (MML) during the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) phase of the program.  An independent Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) was completed, and the recommendation was made to continue organic development through the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Persistent Training Environment (PTE) will provide the Department of Defense (DoD) cyber forces with a capability that uses a combination of loosely affiliated or independent virtual environments with varied capabilities that are not scalable or extensible.  The current environment constrains training capabilities and capacity, but lack a joint or standard approach consistent with a broader vision of PTE.  PTE system approaches are aligned to the outputs of the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (OUSD AT&amp;L) and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) J6 led, “Cyber Range Evaluation of Alternatives (EOA) Findings and Issue Paper Deliberations,” dated 17 November 2015.  The US Army acknowledges it is the lead candidate service to perform as the Executive Agent (EA) for Cyber Training Ranges and DoD Acquisition Lead for the PTE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Persistent Training Environment (PTE) will provide the Department of Defense (DoD) cyber force with a capability that uses a combination of loosely affiliated or independent virtual environments with varied capabilities that are not scalable or extensible.  The current environment constrains training capabilities and capacity, but lack a joint or standard approach consistent with a broader vision of PTE.  PTE system approaches are aligned to the outputs of the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (OUSD AT&amp;L) and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) J6 led, “Cyber Range Evaluation of Alternatives (EOA) Findings and Issue Paper Deliberations,” dated 17 November 2015.  The US Army acknowledges it is the lead candidate service to perform as the Executive Agent (EA) for Cyber Training Ranges and DoD Acquisition Lead for the PTE.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>
