            <proc:Description>Warfighter Information Network - Tactical (WIN-T) connects all users to each other from theater down to the maneuver battalion, to joint and multinational elements, and the Defense Information System Network (DISN). WIN-T employs a combination of terrestrial, airborne, and satellite-based transport options, to provide robust, redundant connectivity. Network modernization is the Army's top priority, and WIN-T is its cornerstone program. It enables mission command on the move, keeping highly mobile and dispersed forces connected to one another and to the Army's global information network. With essential voice, video and data services, commanders can make decisions faster than ever before and from anywhere on the battlefield. WIN-T's infrastructure provides commanders and other users the ability to communicate via voice, data, and video simultaneously at all levels of security.  

WIN-T Increment 1: Networking At-the-Halt
A state-of-the-art, Beyond Line of Sight, at-the-halt communications network that ensures operational relevancy and interoperability with future increments. It provides the current Warfighter with communications backbone that enables them to exchange information (voice, data, and video) at high speeds with high reliability throughout the tactical Division, Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs), and Battalion level elements.  Two sub-increments are noted as follows: (Increment 1a): Extended Networking at-the-Halt - with Ka military satellite communications capability; and (Increment 1b): Enhanced Networking at-the-Halt, the Increment 1a capability adding the Net Centric Waveform (NCW) and Global Information Grid (GIG) Compliant Colorless Core Capability to enhance interoperability with subsequent WIN-T Increments.  WIN-T Inc 1 AAO is 216; reached in FY12.


WIN-T Increment 2: Initial Networking On-the-Move
Warfighter Information Network (WIN-T) Increment 2 (Inc 2) provides the Army with On-The-Move (OTM) networking capability.  The Inc 2 network retains capabilities delivered by WIN-T Inc 1 and by leveraging proven government and commercial technologies, adds greater network throughput and automated Network Management to optimize planning (to include spectrum use), initialization, monitoring and troubleshooting. WIN-T Inc 2 employs Satellite Communications (SATCOM) OTM to extend the network in maneuver Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs) to Company level for the first time.  Using equipment mounted on combat platforms, WIN-T Inc 2 delivers a mobile capability that reduces reliance on fixed infrastructure and allows key leaders to move on the battlefield while retaining Situational Awareness and Mission Command capabilities. Using the Highband Networking Radio, with the Highband Networking Waveform and high performance antennas, the WIN-T Inc 2 Line-of-Sight network offers an adaptive 30 Megabit per second (Mbps) aggregate throughput to key leaders in their Command Post or in their vehicle. The WIN-T Inc 2 network is self-forming, which means that it automatically creates transmission paths based on terrain and environmental conditions; and self-healing, meaning that the paths will automatically re-route traffic to complete network transactions and calls even if one or more nodes break down or loses connectivity.  This offers greater network reliability and better end-to-end connectivity than traditional point-to-point networks.  WIN-T Inc 2 introduces the network management capability needed to keep the mobile and dispersed forces networked together through automated planning, initialization, monitoring, and troubleshooting.  Finally, WIN-T Inc 2 adopts "Colorless Core" technology that encrypts both classified and unclassified user information in the network and minimizes the number of users on the "core" of the network.  The Colorless Core allows commanders to utilize the tactical network without fear of the enemy intercepting information. Colorless Core is a technical insertion in the WIN-T Inc 1b network which enhances information sharing between WIN-T Inc 1b and WIN-T Inc 2.

The WIN-T Inc 2 capabilities are identified for fielding to Armored, Infantry, and Stryker BCTs and Division Headquarters.  The Point of Presence and the Tactical Communications Node have both satellite and Line-of-Sight communication capability.  The Soldier Network Extension (SNE) provides satellite communication only.  The Point of Presence and the Tactical Communications Node are deployed at Division, Brigade and Battalion echelons. The SNE serves as the S3 vehicle at Battalion level and is also deployed down to Company level.  
 
WIN-T Inc 3 mature technologies will be inserted into WIN-T Inc 2 units.

Area Common User System Modernization (ACUS MOD): Supports the Bridge to Future Networks (BFN) systems architecture as the Army's intermediate networking solution.  Supports the Army's Transformation/Modularity initiatives by developing, procuring, and fielding product improvements into the Army's Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (SBCTs) and 24 Expeditionary Signal Battalions (ESBs).  Also provides support to those systems that were fielded under the Area Common User System Modernization Plan (ACUS MP).  Overall, ACUS Mod supports the Army's mission by providing Ethernet local area network communications between Tactical Operational Centers (TOC); TOC &amp; Tactical Internet network management capabilities; integrated voice, video and data services; Line of Sight (LOS) and Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) transmission capability.

The ACUS Mod systems consists of: the High Capacity Line of Sight (HCLOS/AN/TRC-190) radio which provides a 16Mbps line of site transmission capability required to transport the increased volume of data on the digital battlefield; the Battlefield Video-Teleconferencing Center (BVTC) provides Video Teleconference (VTC) and data collaboration to assist the commander in coordinating and interacting with different echelons and adjacent units; the AN/TRC-170 tropospheric scatter radio which provides Beyond Line Of Sight (BLOS) communications with ranges in excess of 100 miles and bandwidth of up to 16 Mbps; and the Single Shelter Switch (SSS) which provides commanders with a "First In" capability and building block for network expansion.  The SSS is enhanced to provide Joint and Coalition interoperability using Commercial-Off-The-Shelf and Government-Off-The-Shelf (COTS/GOTS) architecture for technology upgrade ease.  The aforementioned systems are an integral part of the WIN-T Inc 1 system architecture.  The Tactical NetOps Management System (TNMS) is a scalable modular NetOps capability that operates on multiple client or server platforms.  It is fielded to units not provided with WIN-T Inc 1 NetOps capabilities.  The TNMS will facilitate decision-making necessary to quickly identify network problems, shift resources, change configurations and coordinate the management of the critical network infrastructure supporting Mission Command (MC)/Command and Control (C2) functions.  

These systems will be fielded to WIN-T Increment 1 units according to the Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) schedule. 
WIN-T ACUS Mod AAO: 24 ESBs.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2016 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $783.116 million supports WIN-T Increments 1, 2 and ACUS MOD requirements below: 

WIN-T Inc 1: FY 2016 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $200.437 million supports:
(a) The fielding of 31 Modification Work Order (MWO) Kits (which includes Colorless Core and Net Centric Waveform (NCW) Modems) to support Increment 1b Army units (Expeditionary Signal Battalions (ESBs), BCTs and Divisions). 
(b) NetOps Convergence of disparate tactical NetOps tools to a common baseline and alignment with other WIN-T Increments.
(c) Technical refresh and modernization are critical to ensure the Army's tactical network maintains its security posture and compliance with new Information Assurance policies. WIN-T Inc 1 is executing a 5-year tech refresh cycle to counter obsolescence and inability to sustain COTS IT components.  A 5-year tech refresh cycle equates to 20% of the fleet annually (32-40 units of various sizes will undergo tech refresh annually).  Modernizing through virtualization reduces life cycle costs by reducing Size, Weight, and Power through collapsing and converging capabilities that previously resided on individual hardware components into virtual servers, and leveraging common COTS solutions across various programs.

All of the WIN-T Inc 1 FY16 efforts enable Army units to communicate more efficiently with WIN-T Inc 2 units and enhances WIN-T Inc 1 information assurance and information security.

WIN-T Inc 2: FY 2016 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $504.463 million procures 248 communications nodes (39 TCNs, 167 SNEs, 42 PoPs) and 1,240 other Configuration Items for fielding to 3 Infantry BCTs, 3 Divisions, and 6 units that have a third battalion added to their organization as part of the Army force structure changes.  FY 2016 funds will also continue to field and support previously procured assets.

WIN-T Inc 2 unit of measure quantity shown on P-21 is based on Communications Nodes, which consist of Tactical Communications Node (TCN), Points of Presence (PoP) and Soldier Network Extension (SNE).

An Acquisition Decision Memorandum on May 30, 2014 directed the restructure of WIN-T Inc 3. As a result of this restructure, and once approved in an updated Capability Production Document (CPD), the Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) for WIN-T Inc 2 will be 3,583 nodes. At present, the AAO for WIN-T Inc 2 is 2,937 nodes, based on quantities in the WIN-T Inc 2 CPD approved by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council on 25 Nov 08, and revised on 20 May 13.
 
WIN-T Inc 2 will be fielded based on the Army Force Generation cycle. 
   
ACUS MODS: FY 2016 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $78.216 million will procure and field 283 Battlefield Video-Teleconferencing Center(BVTC) III systems to replace BVTC II which has reached end of life. The funds will also procure and field Tactical NetOps Management Systems (TNMS) to 89 units.  The funds will also support fielding, logistics, tech refresh, unit validation tests, and program management support for the Single Shelter Switch (SSS), and HCLOS.

"In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities."</proc:Justification>

                    <proc:OverallHistoryPlanningRemarks>Per ADM issued 27 Sept 13, OSD approved procurement of Lot 4 articles (excluding SNEs), and restricted Lot 5 procurement to Training Bases only. Procurement of Lot 4 SNEs and Lot 5 Hardware is deferred until FRP authorization in May 2015.

1. From FY09-FY13 - 19 BCTs and 6 DIV HQ were procured, along with 5 Fixed Regional Hubs and 1 Training Base; 5 BCTs and 2 DIV HQ along with 5 Regional Hub Nodes and 1 Training Base were fielded.*  
2. In FY14 - 1 Training Base was procured; 7 BCTs and 2 DIV HQ were fielded. Procurement of 1 BCT and 1 DIV HQ were deferred pending FRP DR authorization. 
3. In FY15 - 1 DIV HQ will be procured and 2 BCTs and 1 DIV HQ will be fielded, along with 1 Training Base. 
4. In FY16 - 3 BCTs and 3 DIV HQs will be procured and will include procurement of additional nodes to support force structure changes that impact 6 previously-procured BCTs.  4 TAAs will be fielded. 
5. In FY15-17, upon FRP decision, CIs restricted by ADM (Lots 4/5) will conclude procurement and allow fielding of an additional 4 BCTs.

            <proc:Description>The Signal Modernization Program will provide upgrades to increase the capacity and capabilities of the Army units equipped with WIN-T Inc 1, IAW the capabilities described in the Transmission Systems Capability Production Document (CPD).  These upgrades will enhance units' ability to support operations spanning the spectrum from combat operations to Homeland Defense and Disaster Relief by adding cellular phone capabilities, radio cross-banding, commercial internet access, new terrestrial and tropospheric scatter radio systems, and Top Secret Intel nodes to replace the aging TROJAN Spirit terminals.  The initial effort will be to upgrade the Expeditionary Signal Battalions (ESB), which provide WIN-T Inc 1 communications support to large headquarters and Combat Support/CombatService Support units that do not have organic WIN-T.  In the future, funding will support converging tactical sustainment and medical communications systems into WIN-T.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2016 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $49.898 million supports procurement of ninety (90) Commercial Coalition Equipment (CCE) Mission Enclave/Celluar (4G)/Wireless and fifty (50) Top Secret-Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS-SCI) enclaves to support Transport Convergence.  Also procures sixteen (16) Tropo lite and Terrestrial Line of Sight (TRILOS) to support legacy terrestrial communications in Expeditionary Signal Battalions (ESB). 

Procurement funding is increasing in FY16 and beyond due to increased fielding quantities of new capabilities as source selection and acceptance testing are completed.

The Transmission Systems Capability Production Document (CPD) was Joint Requirements Oversight Council(JROC) approved 18 Dec 2014.

            <proc:Description>The Joint Incident Site Communications Capability (JISCC) provides interoperability communications support to the National Guard (NG) response forces and local first-responders in Defense Support of Civil Authorities (DSCA) missions/domestic emergencies. JISCC includes a modular system, support equipment, and team of trained JISCC operators and maintainers. JISCC provides critical capabilities to numerous NG missions to include large-scale pre-planned events, responses to man-made/natural disasters, and other civil support/humanitarian efforts. JISCC is a multi-platform communications bridge between first responders and other state, local, and federal agencies. Deployed in each state at the Joint Forces Headquarters (JFHQs),the JISCC is able to provide rapid incident response communications.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2016 Base Procurement dollars in the amount of $4.062 million support the procurement of nine (9) JISCC Delta Packages. A JISCC Delta Package includes Radio Bridging Voice Cross-Banding, Commercial Mission Network Enclave, Wireless and Cellular capabilities to support first responders and civil support missions.

The Transmission Systems Capability Production Document (CPD) was Joint Requirements Oversight Council(JROC) approved 18 Dec 2014.


"In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities."

"The FY2016 funding request was reduced by $1.020 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances."</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>JOINT COMMUNICATIONS SUPPORT ELEMENT (JCSE): JCSE, assigned under Joint Enabling Capabilities Command, US Transportation Command, is the only joint Department of Defense (DoD) unit specifically formed to provide C4 systems support for Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) contingency operations worldwide. The Joint Communications Support Element (JCSE) mission is to provide, on short notice, those critical communications required to support Joint Task Force support (JTF) and Joint Special Operations Task Force (JSOTF) headquarters. These assets support the warfighter's ability to deploy rapidly and immediately provide the positive command and control required. This support includes contingency and crisis communications for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Combatant Commands, Services, Defense agencies, non-Defense agencies, and foreign governments. The modernization program goals include meeting emerging real-world operational requirements with improved capabilities, smaller footprint, reduced operations and maintenance costs, and seamless integration with the global information grid. Per Defense Planning Guidance (DPG), the Army is mandated to fund 1/3rd fair share of JCSE's validated equipment modernization plan.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>JCSE: FY2016 base funding in the amount of $5.008M procures communications equipment based on Strategic Planning Guidance; which includes major upgrades to large and small aperture mobile satellite systems, Everything over Internet Protocol (EoIP), Airborne/En-Route, and terrestrial and single-channel equipment and program management and organic support. Currently employed commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) equipment is approaching the end of its life cycle and requires replacement, along with technology refreshment; to meet the modernization program goals which include meeting emerging real-world operational requirements with improved capabilities, smaller footprint, reduced operations and maintenance costs, and seamless integration with the global information grid. This equipment is a critical part of Command and Control communications packages that provide direct operational support to joint forces and HQ elements deployed to austere locations around the globe. Per the Planning Guidance, the ARMY is mandated to fund one-third of the fair share of JCSE's validated equipment modernization plan. JCSE's Modernization Program is built/restructured based on Combatant Command (CCMD) and Service Components' requirements and emerging technologies. Service's influence JCSE's spending plan through recommendations in concert with MDAP schedules, ensuring that Service dollars meet Joint Service requirements.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>The Defense Enterprise Wideband Satellite Communications (SATCOM) Systems (DEWSS) provides Super High Frequency (SHF) wideband and Anti-Jam (AJ) satellite communications supporting critical national strategic and tactical Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (C3I) requirements. Portions of DEWSS must support the Army Warfighter as well as unique and vital Department of Defense (DoD) and non-DoD users, as approved by the Joint Staff and/or Secretary of Defense (SECDEF). The DEWSS/Wideband Global Satelellite (WGS) will be used in conjunction with the Terrestrial Transmissions of the Defense Information System Network (DISN) and other communications systems to provide end-to-end communications and the long-haul connectivity.

The AN/TSC-93E Tactical Satellite Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) provides satellite communications (SATCOM) capability in the SHF (Super High Frequency) range.  93E operates over both commercial and military SHF satellites for Army Expeditionary Signal Battalions (ESBs).  93E, along with the WIN-T program's AN/TSC-156 Phoenix Terminal, is the Army's primary means of extending DISN services (NIPR, SIPR, JWICS, DSN, DRSN, and Secure VTC) to deployed Army forces. 93E SLEP has replaced existing "D" models with "E" models.  E model upgrades the 93 from 20 Mbps to 50 Mbps, and extends the service life of the 93 until 2025.  93E configuration is as follows: up-armored, consisting of antenna pallet housing the AS-3036D antenna mounted on an M1152 D1 vehicle towing a M1102 trailer.  The M1102 transports two MEP-803A generators, a SN-571 SYNC box, and a 20 gallon fuel cell.  The cell will increase fuel capacity over 200%. A second M1152A1 will tow a fifth wheel commercial trailer transporting the AN/TSC-93E 250 shelter.  The 93E configuration will also work in a non-up armored mode using the M1097 and the M1113.

The Senior National Leadership Communications (SNLC) program and the required modernization effort exists through a bilateral agreement for a 10-year user equipment modernization.  This essential Priority 0 effort supports unique internal requirements that provide critical communications to support continuing peaceful relations between the United States President and Russia/Ukraine/Belarus/Kazakhstan leaders. The program includes the Direct Communications Link (DCL), Continuous Communications Link (CCL) and the Government-to-Government Communications Link (GGCL). Communications are for diplomatic peacekeeping, arms control and treaty verification purposes.

The Modernization of Enterprise Terminals (MET) program is a complete modernization of fixed X-Band enterprise satellite communications terminals.  The MET family of terminal equipment will increase the capacity of existing satellite communications facilities by adding military Ka-Band capability, enabling the Army to maximize its use of the Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) constellation.  The MET's modular design and incorporation of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) systems will improve the sustainability of Army enterprise satellite communications systems, reduce life cycle costs, and extend the life of the enterprise terminal family beyond 2025.

The Digital Communications Satellite Subsystem (DCSS) is an array of baseband equipment that is integral to the Defense Enterprise Wideband SATCOM System (DEWSS). DCSS is the interconnection between the Global Information Grid (GIG) and the DEWSS satellite earth terminal equipment, providing users with access to the Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) system, the Defense Satellite Communications System, and other military and commercially available satellite constellations. Provides deployed Warfighters with global connectivity to military command and control systems, reachback to the sustaining base, and access to enterprise information resources and the Defense Information Systems Network. Interfaces with the national strategic communications infrastructure to support Presidential and senior DoD leadership communications.

The Enterprise Wideband Satellite Payload Control System provides for the management of Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS) and Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) earth terminal and satellite resources, which are required for rapid and efficient reaction to operational needs in support of the Warfighter. State-of-the-art strategic satellite payload network control and planning systems for use with DSCS, WGS, and commercial satellite systems are procured and installed at Wideband Satellite Operation Centers (WSOC) worldwide. Payload control functions control and configure the satellites.  Network control functions manage communications between operators and processors, generate and drive display formats, and maintain and provide rapid access to the network databases. The Army's effort to digitize forces has created a tremendous increase in demand for bandwidth. Subsystems ensure efficient use of satellite power and spectrum, overcoming existing and projected bandwidth constraints, and allow U.S. forces to achieve information superiority on the battlefield. Provide reliable satellite communications networks to support unique user mission requirements vital to national security under stressed and unstressed conditions.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>Transportable Tactical Command Communications (T2C2) extends the Warfighter Information Network Tactical (WIN-T) network to small company and team sized early entry units. The T2C2 system is based on combat proven capabilities and provides robust voice and data communication capabilities. The T2C2 systems will also integrate users into the higher capacity WIN-T network and extend that network to the tactical edge; T2C2 also enables warfighters in select small Command Posts (CP) (typically Company level) and select Army teams to send and receive time sensitive Situational Awareness (SA), Intelligence, and Mission Command (MC) information while At-the-Halt (ATH) in support of all Joint determined and defined operational phases.  These phases span from the initial Shaping Phase, designed to dissuade or deter adversaries and assure mission friends, Deterrence, Initiative Seizure and Domination culminating with post maneuver Stabilization and Enabling of Civil Authorities enabling legitimate civil governance in safe and secure environment.

The approved AAO for Transportable Tactical Command Communications (T2C2) is 490 Lites, 372 Heavys.

T2C2 Capability Production Document (CPD) was validated in Nov 2013.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY16 base procurement dollars, in the amount of $44.998 million, supports the procurement of Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) quantities for T2C2 Light (34) and T2C2 Heavy (24) systems. FY16 OCO procurement dollars, in the amount of $5.724 million, supports T2C2 Bridging Capabilities. Commercial manpackable satellite terminals will be procured to support emerging operational needs of forces deploying to the Theater of Operations in the Persian Gulf or Operation INHERENT RESOLVE (OIR).

            <proc:Description>Super High Frequency (SHF) terminal, also referred to as the Phoenix, satisfies tactical, highly mobile, command and control, intelligence, fire support, air defense and logistics wideband communications requirements in support of Army and multi-service users.  Phoenix provides the Army operational flexibility by operating over four bands (C, X, Ka, and Ku) on military and commercial satellites resulting in less dependency on costly and high demand commercial satellites.  Fielding is to Active, Reserve and National Guard Expeditionary Signal Battalions (ESBs). The Army decided to retire legacy AN/TSC-85 terminals by 2015 and replace them with SHF (Phoenix) terminals and upgrade all Phoenix terminals from 20 to 50 Megabits per second (Mbps) aggregate capacity to meet growing capacity demands.  This program is designated as a DoD Space Program.

The Approved Acquisition Objective (AAO) for the SHF Terminal is 112.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>The NAVSTAR Global Positioning System (GPS) is a passive, space-based, radio positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) system providing precise time, three dimensional position, navigation and velocity information to Warfighters. Accurate positioning, navigation and timing are critical enablers to all Army Warfighting capabilities. Timing is a key enabler to tactical communications networks.The NAVSTAR GPS program is designated as a DoD Space Program and the United States Air Force (USAF) is the executive service. The USAF GPS Directorate develops enabling technologies and products for GPS User Equipment (PE 35164F), with direct Army management and participation. The Army implements these technologies into Army architectures and user equipment.  The Army NAVSTAR GPS program provides for management, procurement, fielding and support of Army GPS User Equipment. GPS User Equipment consists of a family of Selective-Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM) based PNT Capability solutions which span aviation users, ground users, host vehicles, and sensors. Current GPS User Equipment is comprised of a dual-use dismounted handheld or system-installed Defense Advanced GPS Receiver (DAGR), DAGR Distributed Device (D3) for distributed PNT on platforms, and Ground-Based GPS Receiver Application Module (GB-GRAM) for embedded PNT.

Public Law 111-383 Section 913 (January 2011) Authorizes FY 2017 and beyond appropriations to only procure GPS equipment capable of receiving the military code, commonly known as M code, if M code capable equipment is available.

Current Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) for the DAGR/D3 is 462,288 units.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2016 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $14.027 million support D3 integration and fielding.  This will include hardware and software modification of the current D3 that will host the M code card.  FY 2016 procurement dollars include software support to resolve compatibility issues resulting from upgrading to the M code technology, fielding D3 to Armored Knight, integration of the D3 to client and host systems, test and evaluation to include Bid Sample and First Article Testing, and contractor support.

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>Secure Mobile Anti-Jam Reliable Tactical Terminal (SMART-T) is a multi-channel satellite terminal that provides beyond line of sight support for the current and future tactical communications network.  The SMART-T provides a robust, protected satellite capability to permit uninterrupted communications, as our advancing forces move beyond the line-of-sight of terrestrial systems.  The prime mover is a High Mobility Multi-Purpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) configured with all the electronics and the self-erected antenna.  The SMART-T transmits at the Extremely High Frequency (EHF) band and receives in the Super High Frequency (SHF) band.  The SMART-T provides the only low probability of interception and low probability of detection (LPI/LPD) capability to avoid being targeted for destruction, jamming or eavesdropping.  The SMART-T provides fully interoperable communications with the Milstar terminals of other services (Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps and other DoD agencies and activities).  The SMART-Ts are being upgraded to use the Advanced EHF (AEHF) satellite constellation, which provides a four-fold increase in communication capacity over the current Milstar system but retains full backward compatibility with the Milstar satellites.  SMART-T is designated as a DoD Space Program.

The Approved Acquisition Objective (AAO) is 324 terminals plus 8 terminals procured for the DoD Special Users.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2016 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $13.453 million supports logistics, obsolescence management, training, and fielding support for previously procured SMART-T AEHF upgrade kits and AEHF SMART-T terminals.

            <proc:Description>Global Broadcast Service (GBS) provides high speed broadcast of large volume data and multimedia products.  These include Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) and commercial video and products from imagery, intelligence, weather and biometric data sources.  GBS gives deployed forces access to national level repositories of intelligence products and other critical mission planning information.  The Air Force (USAF) is designated as the executive service for this Acquisition Category (ACAT) IC program. The Army GBS program is designated ACAT III. The Army supports the Joint Program Office (JPO) for the development and procurement of the Transportable Ground Receive Suites (TGRS) and the Theater Injection Point (TIP). The TGRS consists of a Receive Broadcast Manager (RBM) and a one meter satellite antenna which can receive video, imagery, and large data files at rates up to 29.5 megabits per second (Mbps). The TGRS is fielded to Battalion, Brigade Combat Teams, Division, Corps and Theater level units in active, National Guard, and reserve components. The TIP consists of a Transportable Satellite Broadcast Manager (TSBM) coupled with a Phoenix Super High Frequency (SHF) terminal. The TIP provides an in-theater injection capability for the GBS architecture that permits distribution of vital Joint Task Force Commander in-theater information to the TGRS.  The Army TSBMs will be upgrading a down-sized Joint Internet Protocol Modem (JIPM) Network Control Center (Mini Hub) to maintain compatibility with other fixed injection sites, the Broadcast Management functions of the Defense Enterprise Computing Centers (DECC) and the TGRS. This is a Joint Program and is designated as a Department of Defense Space System. 
The Approved Acquisition Objective (AAO) for GBS TGRS is 2080.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2016 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $6.265 million will support logistics, training, and fielding for previously procured systems to upgrade legacy TGRS to comply with Office of the Secretary of Defense mandated information assurance improvements to the GBS broadcast. GBS will field and train WINDOWS 7 upgrades.   

DoD has stopped efforts to provide TRANSEC with the current JIPM solution and is pursuing a commercial modem to support the TRANSEC requirement for GBS in the future.  The objective TRANSEC modem solution has not yet been identified.  In the interim, the Army will field JIPMs on hand, to be used without TRANSEC, to provide increased capability for previously procured GBS suites and spares until the objective TRANSEC modem has been identified and tested by DISA.

            <proc:Description>Mod of In-Svc Equipment (TACSAT) funds the upgrades to Army tactical satellite communications equipment.  This Mod of In-Svc funding procures and fields Tactical Computer Digital Mission Planner (T-CDMP) AN/PYQ-19. T-CDMP replaces the Communications Planning System (CPS)(AN/PSQ-17). The T-CDMP is an integrated tool on which Military Strategic and Tactical Relay (MILSTAR) and Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) satellite communication network planning will be performed. The T-CDMP supports real-time mission planning and network management to efficiently use limited satellite resources.  The T-CDMP generates Terminal Image Data essential for the operation of Secure Mobile Anti-Jam Reliable Tactical Terminal (SMART-T) and Single Channel Anti-Jam Manportable Program (SCAMP) terminals. Mod of In-Svc funds the 20th Support Command - Command, Control, Communications and Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) requirements; the Unified Command Suite (UCS) to the National Guard; and provides Enroute Mission Command (EMC) capability for the 82nd Airborne Global Response Force (GRF). 

The T-CDMP Approved Acquisition Objective is 318.</proc:Description>

                    <proc:Description>MOD OF IN SVC: This program provides a tactical satellite communications capability to meet critical Ground Mobile Forces (GMF) Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence(C4I), needs not satisfied by conventional terrestrial communications systems.  The GMF are those components of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Special Operations Forces and Joint Communications Support Elements engaged in land, tactical air combat, and amphibious operations ranging from single-service crisis missions to mutually supportive joint-service combat scenarios. Mod of In Svc Equipment (TACSAT) funds the upgrades to Army Tactical Satellite Communications Equipment. In addition, provides support for the 20th Support Command - Command, Control, Communications and Computers Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance (C4ISR) gear; the Unified Command Suite (UCS) to the National Guard; and provides EMC capability for the 82nd airborne Global Response Force (GRF).

T-CDMP: FY 2016 funds training and fielding of the Tactical Computer, Digital, Mission Planner (T-CDMP)/(AN/PYQ-19), to meet modularity requirements for Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) protected communication mission planning. T-CDMP supports communications mission planning and management of satellite resources on MILSTAR and AEHF for Army Secure Mobile Anti-Jam Reliable Tactical Terminal (SMART-T) and Single Channel Anti-Jam Man-Portable (SCAMP) terminals. These terminals provide world wide anti-jam, low probability of intercept and detection, secure voice and data capability for Brigade, Division, Corps, and special users. The Air Force is the Executive Agent for developing the Tactical Mission Planning Sub-System (T-MPSS)(AN/PYQ-14), the major subassembly of the T-CDMP (AN/PYQ-19). Each service is responsible for procuring the T-CDMP and fielding the system to their communications planners. The T-CDMP is essential to the operation of the SCAMP and SMART-T.  This program will procure the designated hardware, field, provide training and technical data for SCAMP and SMART-T communications planners.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>Enroute Mission Command Capability (EMC) supports the Global Response Force (GRF) requirement to conduct Airborne forcible entry operations with the ability to conduct mission command, to include mission planning and rehearsal, while enroute on board US Air Force Air Mobility Command (AMC) aircraft. EMC modernizes enroute communications to enable broadband reach-back data capability utilizing military or commercial networks with adequate bandwidth support required by Mission Command and Intelligence applications.

The enduring requirement for EMC is documented in the Transmission Systems Capabilities Production Document (CPD), which was Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) approved 18 Dec 2014.  The Army Procurement Objective (APO) for the EMC is 8 nodes.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2016 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $7.116 million will support fielding and training of Fixed Installed Satellite Antennas (FISA), Command and Staff Palletized Airborne Nodes (CASPAN), Key-leader Enroute Nodes (KEN) and Dependent Airborne Nodes (DAN) procured in FY15. It will also support Environmental testing; Army Interoperability Certification (AIC) and Joint Integration Test Command (JITC) certification.

Operational Needs Statement (ONS) 09-9319 was revalidated by the HQDA G-3 on 5 Nov 2014 to support fielding of the objective capability, which will support a full brigade lift of the Alpha echelon for a forced entry operation. (ONS) 09-9319 was oally validated by HQDA G3 in 5 Mar 2013.  $21.275 million was provided in September 2013 via an Above Threshold Reprogramming (ATR) on SSN BB8417 Modification of In-Service Equipment (TACSAT) in support of that ONS to provide an initial capability.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>Global Command and Control System-Army (GCCS-A):  This project is the Army component of the Global Command and Control System (GCCS) Family of Systems (FoS). GCCS-A provides automated command and control tools, including Force readiness, planning and movement, and situational awareness, for Army Strategic and Operational Theater commanders to enhance warfighter capabilities throughout the spectrum of conflict during Joint and combined operations in support of National Security. GCCS-A dramatically improves the Army's ability to analyze courses of action, develop and manage Army forces and execute war plans. GCCS-A links the GCCS-Joint Common Operating Picture with the Army Mission Command systems. In accordance with Army Command Post Computing Environment and Joint Command and Control objectives, GCCS-A will be re-architected away from a scalable process architecture based server - thick client architecture to a virtualized server - web client architecture hosted on Battle Command Common Services. In addition, Product Manager, GCCS-A is the Executive Agent with responsibility to procure and field GCCS-J hardware and Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) software to selected GCCS-J sites.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>GCCS-A FY 2016 Base funding will support fielding of GCCS-A 4.3 and procurement of GCCS-J refresh hardware in the amount of $10.137 million.

            <proc:Description>B90000 is a summary of the JTRS HMS program: B90210 (JTRS HMS - Handheld) and B90215 (JTRS HMS - Manpack); funding for the RDTE phase of the JTRS HMS program resides in Program Element 0604280A.

Handheld, Manpack, and Small Form Fit (HMS) is a materiel solution meeting the requirements for a Software Communications Architecture (SCA) compliant hardware system hosting SCA-compliant Government purpose rights software waveforms (applications). HMS is an Acquisition Category (ACAT) ID Program that encompasses specific requirements to support the US Army, US Air Force, US Navy, US Marine Corps and the Special Operations Command (SOCOM) communication needs.

HMS provides voice and data communications to the tactical edge/most disadvantaged Warfighter with an on the move, at the halt, and stationary Line of Sight (LOS)/ Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) capability for both dismounted personnel and platforms. HMS radios are software re-programmable, networkable multi-mode system (of systems) capable of simultaneous voice, data and video communications. The embedded Small Form Factor (SFF) versions of HMS may be used for Unmanned Vehicles and other platform applications.

HMS is structured as a single program of record. The program has completed the Engineering Manufacturing and Development Phase and received Milestone C approval on 17 June 2011 with Low Rate Initial Production configured radios.

HMS is currently executing an April 2014 approved acquisition strategy to procure modified non-developmental items (NDI) through full and open competition open to all potential industry partners. The first phase is to procure an NDI AN/PRC-154A Rifleman Radio (RR) for use in a classified environment. The RR ports the Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW)-Army managed waveform. The second phase is procuring an NDI AN/PRC-155 Manpack (MP) for use in a classified environment. Waveforms to be ported to HMS MP include: SRW, Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS)-Army managed waveform, Satellite Communications (SATCOM)-Army managed waveform, and Mobile-User Objective System (MUOS)-Navy managed waveform. 

The Army will award Multiple Firm Fixed-Price (FFP) IDIQ Contracts through a multiple step selection process:
a. Award FFP Contracts and initial delivery orders to all qualified vendors based on technical acceptability and demonstrations (4QFY15 for RR and 1QFY16 for MP).
b. Award second delivery orders based on qualification test results (2QFY16 for RR and 3QFY16 for MP)
c. Award FRP delivery orders based on operational assessments and best value trade off construct (2QFY17 for RR and 4QFY17 for MP).

Following full and open competition, qualified NDI RR and MP Radios will require operationally-relevant testing to inform a Full Rate Production decision and to support fielding to Capability Set units.

The current Rifleman Radio (Army) AAO is 193,279 (of which 37,632 are for SRW Applique).  SRW Appliqué is a single-channel, vehicle-mounted radio running SRW that can be retrofit into the same space as SINCGARS. The Army intends to integrate the SRW Appliqué radios with multiple vehicle platforms for fielding flexibility.
 
The current Manpack and SFF-B (Army) AAO is 66,572.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY16 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $64.640M supports the procurement of:
-300 operational test assets for the Rifleman Radio, support equipment, and fielding. ($34.910M) (100 radios per vendor)
-240 operational test assets for the Manpack Radio, NRE, and vehicle integration. ($29.730M) (60 radios per vendor)

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY08 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), these items are necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>The Mid-tier Networking Vehicular Radio (MNVR) enables the extension of data services within the tactical network through seamless integration of the upper and lower tiers; providing software-defined, multi-channel networking radios for a wide variety of Army tactical vehicles to meet the Army's requirement for the Mid-tier Wideband Networking (MWN) capability.  
 
On 20 September 2013, the Defense Acquisition Executive (DAE) signed the Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) approving the program Materiel Development Decision (MDD).  The ADM designated MNVR as an ACAT 1D Special Interest Program under the continued oversight of the DAE.  It approved the Army to award an Industry contract, which was awarded on 24 September 2013 as a single award for an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), firm fixed price contract.

The Approved Acquisition Objective (AAO) for the MNVR is 10,293.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2016 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $27.762 million funds the procurement of 226 radios for fielding in FY17.  FY 2016 funding also provides for preliminary CS 17 &amp; 18 fielding activities including Tier I &amp; II Support Operations Cell (SOC)/Single Interface to the Field (SIF) support; minor hardware modifications; Source Selection for the next industry-developed version of the MNVR to be fielded starting in CS19; and Project Management Administration (PMA) costs to support the execution of the modified Non-Developmental Item (NDI) strategy for a mid-tier networking vehicular capability.  

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>The Multifunctional Information Distribution System Low Volume Terminal (MIDS LVT) is a communications device that provides situational awareness information exchange between aircraft, airborne command and control, Ground Air Defense and shipboard platforms in the Tactical Data Link-16 Network. The Army variant consists of three Line Replaceable Units (Main Terminal, Power Supply Assembly and Cooling Unit) installed on a mounting base, which physically and functionally replaces the Joint Tactical Information Distribution System (JTIDS) Class 2M terminal. 

The Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) for MIDS is 709 and the Army Procurement Objective is 572.  The Army procured 566 terminals through FY14 and no more hardware procurements are planned. Army future procurement are for Block Upgrade 2 (BU2) upgrade kits only.

Procurement dollars support the acquisition and fielding of MIDS-LVT terminals for the Air Defense Airspace Management (ADAM) Cells, PATRIOT, Terminal High Altitude Air Defense (THAAD), Forward Area Air Defense Command and Control (FAADC2), Joint Land Attack Cruise Missile Defense Elevated Netted Sensor (JLENS), Joint Tactical Ground Station (JTAGS), Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) and Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System (IBCS), in support of the Army Transformation Plan.

Army MIDS is part of the Joint Navy-led MIDS program.  The Army leverages Navy contracts to support Army MIDS efforts and to upgrade the BU2 crypto-modernization initiative. The BU2 retrofit improves the capabilities and security of the MIDS LVT by incorporating the crypto-modernization and mandated frequency remapping to ensure compliance with National Security Agency and Federal Aviation Administration mandates. The BU2 kit replaces approximately five shop replaceable units within the radio.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY2016 Base dollars in the amount of $9.422 million will support Block Upgrade 2 retrofit, engineering services, software support, and program management.  The Block Upgrade 2 unit cost is pending contract award and negotiation.  With a planning retrofit unit cost of $65K, 86 BU2 retrofit kits may be procured in FY16.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>The AMC Critical Items Program oversees the process by which Class II and VII end items that are out of production and, consequently, now under AMC management, are re-procured to fill shortages.  The program supports major end-item (weapon system) inventory management through item managers.  The program requirements represent actual and projected equipment deficiencies and do not include obsolete items or items replaced by modernized successors managed by G8.

The Army Materiel Command (AMC) identifies Table of Organizational Equipment (TOE) items with identifiable line item numbers (LINs) that have valid unit requirements and support Army force generation requirements. These LINs are in the sustainment phase of their life cycle and are no longer being acquired by the Army.  In some cases there is a production base because of commercial, Foreign Military Sales (FMS) or other service demands.  The Army prioritizes these items and determines that the systems requested herein are key to supporting current operations.

LIN H01907: The AN/ASM-146 Repair Shelter is an air transportable, mobile field maintenance facility that provides repair capability at the BCT level for all Commmunications-Electronics (C-E) systems and equipment and is critical to maintaining C-E readiness in the battlefield.

LIN P40750: Power Supply PP-6224, LIN P40750 is a power supply that furnishes 0-25 amperes over a voltage range of 24 to 32 Vdc from nominal 115/230 VAC at 50, 60 or 400 Hz single phase.  The power supply can also operate from a 24 Vdc storage battery in the battery standby mode.  It is the Army standard tactical 24V DC power source for C-E equipment in Tactical Operations Centers (TOCs) as well as equipment dismounted from vehicles.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2016 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $26.020 Million supports the following efforts.

Electronic Shop Shelter H01907: FY 2016 Base procurement funding in the amount of $8.391 million will support the program management through acquisition of 50 ea each AN/ASM-146 LIN H01907 systems to include program management and organic support. Funding supports a balanced investment strategy for the Army's approved force structure and Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) requirements.  This critical system has substantial shortages, which have resulted in 20% of BCTs deploying without full authorizations. Shortages of these systems will degrade the readiness of Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Sensors Systems, thereby placing warfighter lives in jeopardy. ERC-A systems are primary weapon systems which are essential in accomplishing the operation mission.

Power Supply P40750: FY 2016 Base procurement funding in the amount of $17.629 million is required for the acquisition of 4,962 each Power Supply, PP-6224 LIN P40750. Funding supports both acquisition and program management to include engineering support for new production contract effort. A substantial shortage of this item is degrading readiness of systems requiring 24V DC power. Due to Modified Table of Equipment (MTOE) shortages of 58%, this equipment is ranked as #2 on DA's Readiness list. The inability to provide sufficient quantities of this item will degrade DOD readiness by hindering battlefield communications. 

Economy of scale procurement and evolving critical requirements could affect quantity planned.

IAW Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L.110-181), these items are necessary for use by the active components and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>The Spider is a hand emplaced, remotely controlled, anti-personnel munition system that was designed to replace the capability of the persistent anti-personnel landmines banned from use after December 2010 per US Landmine policy. Spider, as a Man-in-the-Loop system, offers numerous capabilities for asymmetric warfare focusing on small unit force protection.  The system is made up of 4 subsystems: Man-in-the-Loop (the human operator), Remote Control Station (the system command and control station), Repeater (a communication link to the munitions that provides extended range), and Munition Control Units (delivers anti-personnel effects).  The Spider is designed to mitigate the indiscriminate initiation of the lethal mechanism.  A Soldier makes a conscious decision to engage a target with the lethal mechanism. Spider's sensor capabilities and controlled munitions provide needed force protection and battlefield shaping.  Spider allows measured and graduated responses including sense only, non lethal, and lethal modes.  Spider also supports net-centric operations by feeding situational awareness information (location and status) into the Battle Command System.  The Spider system with its many desirable features makes it a versatile weapon system that has significant utility across the full spectrum of military operations and will support current and future operations.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.  Type Classification Standard and Full Material Release were achieved in July and September 2013 respectively.  The Spider AAO is 736 systems.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>XM7 Spider is a hand emplaced, remotely controlled, Man-In-The-Loop (MITL) anti-personnel munition system that is currently being fielded.  Spider Increment 1A utilizes an evolutionary acquisition approach which builds upon the baseline Spider Increment 1 system.  Spider Increment 1A will 1) replace the Spider Increment 1 Remote Control Unit (RCU) with a new Networked Munitions Control Station that includes mapping capability, seamless interoperability to the Mission Command System (MCS) or Joint Battle Command Platform (JBC-P) and new technologies, 2) control current Spider AP munitions and 3) demonstrate the initiation of legacy GOTS AV (lethal) and AP (lethal and non-lethal) effects.  All other XM7 Spider Increment 1 components (i.e. Control Station Transceiver (CST), Munition Control Units (MCUs)) will remain as is to ensure backwards compatibility.  The Spider system with its many desirable features makes it a versatile weapon system that has significant utility across the full spectrum of military operations and will support current and future operations.  The Spider Increment 1A Army Procurement Objective is 321 systems and the overall Spider program has an Approved Acquisition Objective (AAO) of 736 systems.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2016 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $9.199 million supports the procurement of 89 Spider Increment 1A systems.  

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L.110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>The Tactical Communications and Protective System (TCAPS) provides Soldiers with advanced, active hearing protection that simultaneously protects Soldiers' hearing while enabling situational awareness and mission command. TCAPS protects Soldiers against harmful impulse and steady-state noises characteristic of combat environments while enabling Soldiers to communicate with each other using voice communications or over a tactical radio. TCAPS also enhances survivability and situational awareness by allowing Soldiers to selectively amplify faint sounds that would not be otherwise audible. 

By reducing noise-induced hearing damage, TCAPS contributes to the reduction of post-service disability compensation and limits lost in-service time related to hearing injury. TCAPS will employ commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) solution(s) that are inserted into production on a periodic basis following user evaluations.

The Approved Acquisition Objective (AAO) for the TCAPS is 106,184.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2016 base procurement dollars in the amount of $25.597 million procures commercial off the shelf Tactical Communications and Protective Systems. 

The General Accounting Office (GAO) Report 11-114 states that the Veterans Administration purchased 382,000 hearing assistive devices at an estimated expenditure of $154 million in FY2008 and provided annual disability payments in excess of $1.1 billion in FY2009. Hearing injuries will be avoided only if Soldiers wear hearing protection. Historically Soldiers have had to choose between hearing protection and auditory situational awareness. TCAPS prevents hearing injury while enabling command, control and situational awareness.

            <proc:Description>The Unified Command Suite (UCS) is a fully integrated mobile communications platform that is self-sufficient and highly interoperable by integrating commercial off the shelf (COTS) and government off the shelf (GOTS) military communications hardware.  UCS provides communications interoperability with Federal, State, Local and Military Emergency Response elements at incident scenes.  UCS provides reachback capability which allows Incident Commanders the ability to assess an incident scene, advise responders, and facilitate access to Department of Defense information.  UCS provides critical Key Performance Parameter directed reachback communications for Analytical Laboratory Systems (ALS) and other Civil Support Team (CST) systems.

The Approved Acquisition Objective (AAO) for the UCS is 64.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2016 Base funding in the amount of $21.854 million will modernize, upgrade, and procure components for the Unified Command Suites for Civil Support Teams.  Funding supports the UCS platform shelter and integration for 32 UCS systems, Video Teleconference (VTC) upgrade for 32 UCS systems, Satellite Communication (SATCOM) terminal upgrades for 32 UCS systems, and cryptological device modernization of 32 UCS systems.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>The COTS Family of radios provides state-of-the-art communications for tactical use.  Through numerous non-developmental and commercial offerings, the COTS family is able to provide various capabilities currently required by the Soldier.  

These capabilities include:

-Transmit and receive voice and data via line-of-sight (LOS), non-LOS or satellite communications (SATCOM) operations
-Supports legacy/current force waveforms and emerging networking waveforms
-Software upgradeable
-Encryption to protect Sensitive Unclassified and Classified voice and data
-Supports Large/Medium/Small Forward Operating Bases
-Vehicular, Manpack, Hand Held, and Base Station configurations

Funding also supports COTS procurement of cosite mitigation, Electronic Warfare filters and multi-band antennas.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>This program has no FY 2016 procurement request, as program transitions to sustainment.

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-118), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>The Medical Communications for Combat Casualty Care (MC4) system provides multipliers to the medical force structure through the acquisition of information technology solutions for the deployable medical forces.  The MC4 system fulfills the requirements highlighted in United States Code: Title 10, Subtitle A, Part II, Chapter 55, Section 1074f, mandating the proper documentation of deployed service members' medical treatment to include pre- and post-deployment screening and its associated medical surveillance, enabling each soldier to have a comprehensive, life-long medical record of all illnesses and injuries.  The MC4 system also interfaces Force Health Protection and medical surveillance information with Army Mission Command information technology systems.  The collection and analysis of medical data provided by the MC4 system provides and enhances medical situational awareness for mission commanders.  The MC4 program is currently in full fielding of integrated Information Management/Information Technology (IM/IT) equipment.  The Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) is 46,589 end components of the MC4 system.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2016 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $24.388 million supports production engineering, fielding and new equipment training for new systems.  In addition, overall program office management efforts are funded in this appropriation.  Base funding in FY16 is required to continue fielding remaining gaps of MC4 capability to the Army medical force structure and to upgrade obsolete equipment to comply with direction of the US Army Common Operating Environment.  FY16 funding will procure 2,089 end components of the MC4 system for upgraded and new equipment fielding and provide NET (new equipment training) as needed for 3 Active units (1 military police, 1 sustainment brigade, 1 medical detachment); 128 National Guard units (3 Infantry Division headquarters, 2 sustainment brigades, 1 chemical unit, 11 infantry regiment/battalion, 23 medical units, 11 military police, 11 field artillery, 7 brigade combat team headquarters, 18 engineering units, 4 cavalry units, 18 support battalion, 2 maneuver battalion, 14 aviation units, 1 armored, 1 fires brigade, 1 battlefield surveillance brigade); and 57 Army Reserve units (4 sustainment commands, 1 aviation battalion, 25 medical units, 5 military police units, 3 combat support hospitals, 9 civil affairs units, 3 chemical units and 8 engineering units). The system is fielded and trained to units as they prepare for deployment or other priority missions.  In addition, all units with MC4 equipment authorizations are being evaluated for authorized shortages and provided equipment towards reaching the AAO.  The medical encounters captured by the MC4 system will provide the Soldiers' electronic health record as well as data to databases and systems that enable commanders to: identify population health trends and outbreaks; reallocate human and materiel resources based on needs; determine if locations are the source of illnesses or injuries; and make better tactical and medical decisions that impact the mission and Soldiers' health.

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY08 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA)(P.L. 110-181) this item is necessary for use by the active components and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing the military support to civil authorities.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>This program is vital in conventional operations and irregular warfare. Beginning in FY16, the portfolio for Civil Affairs (CA) and Military Information Support Operations (MISO) will consist of 11 systems. These systems are critical to the Warfighter's capabilities in all overseas contingency operations, theater security cooperation, and stability, transition and reconstruction operations. These systems are deployed in support of the combatant commanders engaging with foreign audiences, joint interagency and multi-national operations before, during, and after military operations. The program enables CA/MISO units to keep pace with the increasing Modified Table of Organization and Equipment (MOTEs), rapid deployment rotational cycles, and the requirements of the Warfighter in various theaters of operations. The Army Acquisition Objectives for these 11 systems are 8 Fly Away Broadcast System-v2 (FABS-v2), 192 Media Production Center-Light (MPC-L), 8 Media Production Center-Medium (MPC-M), 33 MISO Print-Light (MISOP-L), 2 MISO Print-Medium (MISOP-M), 651 Next Generation Loud Speakers-Dismounted (NGLS-D), 641 Next Generation Loud Speaker-Mounted (NGLS-M), 709 Production Distribution System-Light (PDS-L), 56 Radio Integration System Lite (RIS-L), 890 SOF Deployment Node-Light (SDN-L), and 59 Tactical Local Area Network (TACLAN).</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2016 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $3.695 million supports the procurement of 13 Production Distribution System-Light (PDS-L).

            <proc:Description>The Biometrics Enabling Capability (BEC) product office has full life-cycle management responsibility of the upgraded authoritative biometrics enterprise repository system, known as DoD Automated Biometrics Identification System (DoD ABIS).  DoD ABIS is an information technology investment that supports identity superiority by providing the critical capability for Warfighters to identify known or suspected terrorists and third country nationals in the course of military operations.   DoD ABIS is the authoritative biometrics enterprise system that provides matching, sharing and storing of biometrics data.  The capability can receive multi-model biometrics submissions to include iris, face, palm and finger prints from biometrics collection devices, which will support the Warfigher in making, retain, capture or release decisions.  The system has a direct impact on the availability of critical intelligence information that is of vital interest to DoD and other government agencies, including Department of Justice (DoJ), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and Department of State (DoS).</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>This program has no FY 2016 Base or Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) procurement requirement, as the system is transitioning to sustainment.

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>The Cryptographic Systems (CS) Program procures and fields Communications Security (COMSEC) solutions to secure the National Network Enterprise.  New and emerging architectures, cease key dates, and DoD/Army policy are driving the need to replace current inventory of stove pipe systems with technologically advanced (network centric/Global Information Grid (GIG) compliant) devices that incorporate Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Joint Requirements Oversight Council directed cryptographic standardization, advanced key management and network centric performance capabilities.  This program enables DoD to equip the force with critical cryptographic solutions and services during peacetime, wartime, and contingency operations. The program consists of three product families: In-Line Network Encryptors (INE), Link/Trunk Encryptors Family (LEF), and Secure Voice. (PD Net E)

The Army-wide Cryptographic Network Standardization (ACNS) effort is to bring cryptographic equipment into compliance with the Army's upgraded data network and Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6), as mandated by the National Security Agency (NSA) and Chief Information Officer (CIO)/G6.  ACNS provides the Army fully modernized equipment and provides Units assistance with system identification, training, integration, network optimization, and property book update.  ACNS is an essential project as many of the legacy devices currently in the field will no longer be compliant starting in FY 2015 due to NSA driven cease key dates, resulting in an inability to communicate at classified levels. (PD Net E)

The Defensive Cyberspace Operations (DCO) program provides initial capabilities to Cyber Protection Teams. Teams enable passive and active cyberspace defensive operations to preserve friendly cyberspace capabilities, and protect data, networks, net-centric capabilities, and other designated systems.  DCO consists of four critical capabilities: 

DCO-Infrastructure (DCO-I): the hardware and software baseline for remote cyber maneuver based on Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Plan X 
Cyber Protection Team (CPT) support: tools that reside inside DCO-I 
Web Vulnerability Scanning: the software baseline to secure key cyber terrain and protect DoD websites 
Big Data Analytics: analytics that leverage Defense Information System Agency (DISA) Acropolis analytics  

DCO responds to unauthorized activity or alerts/threat information against the Army enterprise, and leverages intelligence, counterintelligence, law enforcement, and other military capabilities.  It includes outmaneuvering adversaries taking or about to take offensive actions against defended networks, or otherwise responding to internal and external cyberspace threats.  Internal defense measures include mission assurance actions to dynamically reestablish, re-secure, reroute, reconstitute, or isolate degraded or compromised local networks to ensure sufficient cyberspace access for commanders.  The Army's DCO activities are a construct of active cyberspace defenses which provide synchronized, real-time capabilities to discover, detect, analyze, and mitigate threats and vulnerabilities to DoD networks and systems.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>The Cryptographic Systems (CS) Program procures and fields Communications Security (COMSEC) solutions to secure the National Network Enterprise.  New and emerging architectures, cease key dates, and DoD/Army policy are driving the need to replace currently fielded legacy systems with technologically advanced (network centric/Global Information Grid (GIG) compliant) devices that incorporate Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Joint Requirements Oversight Council directed cryptographic standardization, advanced key management and network centric performance capabilities.  This program enables DoD to equip the force with critical cryptographic solutions and services during peacetime, wartime, and contingency operations.  The program consists of four product families: In-Line Network Encryptors (INE), In-Line Media Encryptors (IME), Link/Trunk Encryption Family (LEF), and Secure Voice (SV). 

Army Key Management Infrastructure (AKMI) is a Non Program of Record (POR) under PD Network Enablers (PD Net E).  The AKMI is the Army's implementation of the National Security Agency's (NSA) Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) ACAT IAM program.  KMI automates the functions of Communications Security (COMSEC) electronic key management, control, planning, and distribution.  KMI supports the Army's ability to communicate and distribute data on the Army's tactical and strategic networks by limiting adversarial access to, and reducing the vulnerability of, Army Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence (C4I) systems. KMI provides an integrated, operational environment that brings essential key management functions in-band.  AKMI supports Department of Defense (DoD) Global Information Grid (GIG) Net Centric and Crypto Modernization Initiatives and supports emerging requirements transitioned from the Army Key Management System (AKMS).  AKMI provides an Over the Network Keying (OTNK) solution to support emerging cryptographically modernized systems.  AKMI will continue to support non-modernized legacy equipment until it can be upgraded to operate seamlessly within the AKMI architecture.

The Army Key Management System (AKMS) is the Army's implementation of the National Security Agency's (NSA) Electronic Key Management System (EKMS) program automating the functions of Communications Security (COMSEC) electronic key management, control, planning, and distribution. AKMS supports the Army's ability to communicate and distribute data on the Army's tactical and strategic networks by limiting adversarial access to, and reducing the vulnerability of, Army Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence (C4I) systems. The AKMS System of Systems (SoS) systems components are the Local COMSEC Management Software (LCMS), Automated Communications Engineering Software (ACES) and Simple Key Loader (SKL). AKMS is an ACAT III Program of Record (POR) under PD Network Enablers (PD Net E). It is the Army's implementation of the NSA's EKMS. The AKMS allows the Army to manage, control, plan, and distribute electronic key for the 1.5 million Cryptographic Units (ECUs) necessary to communicate and distribute data on the Army's tactical and strategic networks.

The Approved Acquisition Objective (AAO) for the AKMS is 174,522 (Fill Devices); AKMI is 855 Management Client Nodes (MGC); Crypto Systems is 153,203 (Encryption Devices).</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>In FY 2016, PD COMSEC funding of $72.257 Million supports three sub-programs.  

FY 2016 base procurement dollars, in the amount of $16.206 Million, will be primarily utilized to procure modern In-Line Network Encryption (INE) and In-Line Media Encryption (IME) devices.  A portion of these funds will support the continuing Army-wide Cryptographic Network Standardization (ACNS) effort.

FY2016 base procurement dollars in the amount of $45.678 supports the procurement, fielding, depot support and New Equipment Training (NET) for KMI MGCs, NGLD fill devices, J-TNT and ACES laptops.  It also provides associated government and contractor engineering support, Post Deployment Software support, system technical and software support of the AKMI SoS components.  Funding enables modifications in the AKMI SoS to support the transition of AKMS components to KMI standards compliance and to support legacy and emerging ECUs ability to communicate within the KMI architecture.

FY 2016 base procurement dollars in the amount of $10.373M supports continuing Post Deployment Software Support (PDSS) efforts for legacy AKMS components, operational support for deployed and sustaining forces, technical engineering &amp; support, associated government and contractor engineering support, and the development and updating of Web based training for AKMS components to augment in-class delta and sustainment training. The PDSS effort is an OPA requirement because of the new capabilities that are required to be implemented into key management products based on the evolution of the network and end cryptographic units.  The changes in capability do not allow the operational support to be transitioned to sustainment.  The PDSS contract for all key management products has been optimized and requirements continuously assessed to ensure that it is  fiscally sound.  The AKMS SoS supports the transition to AKMI, the Army's implementation of NSA's KMI ACAT IAM program in accordance with the EKMS Tier 2 Sunset date of December 2017.  Continued support for the AKMS SoS is critical until KMI is fully operational and fielded. The current SKL fleet will require support through at least 2025.  Modernization of fill devices and emerging radio planning and configuration requirements are supported through the Army's KMI funding line (B96004).  

It is the PdD's intent to incrementally migrate the AKMS funding line to the AKMI funding line beginning in FY2017, provided that the sunset date of December 2017 is met. Recent developments at the NSA Program Management Office (PMO) may cause additional schedule slippages to the complete standup of the KMI infrastructure. This presents a potential risk which may require the AKMS funding line to be maintained at steady state beyond 2017, if the planned sunset date is not met.

            <proc:Description>This program funds Army-wide non-tactical installation Land Mobile Radio (LMR) systems and radios, and two years of Interim Contractor Support (ICS) for LMR system maintenance.  LMR systems are commercial solutions that provide mobile and portable communications for garrison public safety, force protection, homeland security, and facilities maintenance operations. The primary users of LMR are emergency response personnel, including installation military police, fire departments, and medical personnel. These personnel use LMR to synchronize emergency response efforts and for critical communications support during dispatch, mobilization, deployment, and operations.  Without adequate communications capabilities that readily enable coordination, maximize the use of scarce radio spectrum, and provide secure voice transmissions, emergency responders and base support personnel would be significantly constrained in their ability to perform key functions.  LMR provides Army interoperability with state and local fire protection and law enforcement agencies critical to ensuring effective incident response via mutual aid agreements.  The LMR Program modernization of installation radio systems enables compliance with the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) mandated migration from wideband LMR systems.  LMR systems are key components of the Army Enterprise used to provide a seamless communications network in support of base level communications and infrastructure.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2016 Base funding in the amount of $16.082 million procures and modernizes garrison LMR systems for two installations in the continental US (CONUS), and US Army Garrison Japan, and provides two years of Contractor Support (CS) for LMR system engineering.  Existing systems do not meet DoD and Army standards, are obsolete, are no longer supported by the manufacturer, and/or are non-compliant with the NTIA spectrum efficiency mandate.  Power projection and power support Army installations across the continental US (CONUS) and the Pacific Area of Operations rely on base support LMR systems as a primary means to support force protection, public safety, installation management, and homeland security missions.

In accordance with Sections 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>In accordance with Section 1815 of FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.

This budget line does not procure weapons systems or produce end items.  All Information Technology (IT) procurements consist of COTS/GOTS solutions; all quantities and unit cost vary by project, system configuration, and site.

This program provides engineering, quality assurance, and Information Systems infrastructure (common user voice, data, video networks) in support of Military Construction Army (MCA) and Sustainment, Restoration, and Modernization (SRM) projects. It supplies non-tactical telecommunications equipment and engineering services for Army base operations. When required due to MCA or SRM projects, this program provides upgrades to regional or Theater Information Systems infrastructure, as well as physical plant infrastructure that directly support those Information Systems assets.  This program delivers standardized operational processes and procedures, providing the Army with consistent integration, synchronization, and delivery of voice, data, imagery, applications, and network capabilities down to the individuals in both the operating force and generating force Army-wide.  In conjunction with MCA or SRM projects, this program also provides funding for organization-specific command and control Information Systems requirements necessary to equip a new or modernized facility to a mission-ready state ahead of the physical relocation of the occupant organization.

PROPONENT/MISSION IT-MCA/PHYSICAL RELOCATION: 
This program funds organization-specific command and control Information Systems requirements necessary to relocate and equip an organization in conjunction with MCA or SRM projects. These may include specific IT requirements to facilitate connectivity from building infrastructure to end user equipment, items for classrooms, computers, video teleconferencing (VTC) systems, projectors, display/knowledge walls, telephone equipment, et cetera.  This SSN consolidates individual organizational requirements to provide a deliberate planned programmatic approach to procure mission essential Information Systems equipment.

INFORMATION SYSTEMS (MCA SUPPORT):
This program provides for the worldwide Information Systems infrastructure (common user voice, data, video networks) for the MCA Program. It supplies non-tactical telecommunications equipment and services in support of Army base operations, LandWarNet 2020 and Beyond, Unified Capabilities, common user, and physical plant infrastructure to support Information Systems assets.  It provides standardized operational processes and procedures, enabling the Army consistent integration, synchronization, and delivery of voice, data, imagery, applications, and network capabilities down to the individuals in both the operating force and generating force Army-wide.

INFORMATION SYSTEMS (CONUS/WESTERN HEM):
This program provides for the worldwide Information Systems infrastructure (common user voice, data, video networks) for the SRM Program. It supplies non-tactical telecommunications equipment and services in support of Army base operations, LandWarNet 2020 and Beyond, Unified Capabilities, common user, and physical plant infrastructure to support Information Systems assets.  It provides standardized operational processes and procedures, enabling the Army consistent integration, synchronization, and delivery of voice, data, imagery, applications, and network capabilities down to the individuals in both the operating force and generating force Army-wide.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2016 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $86.037 million supports:

PROPONENT/MISSION IT-MCA/PHYSICAL RELOCATION: 
FY 2016 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $50.694 million supports the procurement of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) information systems and infrastructure which support mission essential command and control Information Technology requirements in newly built MCA or renovated SRM facilities. These funds ensure the Army employs a planned systematic approach to procure mission essential Information Systems equipment in support of vital command and control missions. This includes, but is not limited to, above secret mission essential network transport infrastructure, and end-user instruments (including telephones, soft phones, video teleconferencing equipment or computing devices), associated licensing, and secure data switches, gateways and encryption devices for classified connectivity.  In addition to the overall network, this provides funding for  mission essential Information Systems for classrooms, computers for mission requirements above secret, video teleconferencing (VTC) systems, projectors, display/knowledge walls, secure telephone equipment, and physical plant infrastructure to support those Information Systems assets. This program procures the network infrastructure engineering, acquisition, installation, security, and quality assurance to support the planning, design, and implementation of mission essential Information Systems. This program supports requirements necessary for the physical relocation of units in conjunction with MCA and SRM projects with command and control missions. Funding is required to ensure that these projects have all necessary Information Systems infrastructure and equipment for soldier readiness of the facilities.  This program consolidates individual organizational requirements to provide a deliberate planned programmatic approach to procure mission essential Information Systems equipment.

INFORMATION SYSTEMS (MCA SUPPORT):
FY 2016 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $31.028 million supports the procurement of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) Information Systems which support Unified Capability voice/data switches, common user network transport infrastructure, end-user instruments (including telephones, soft phones, video teleconferencing equipment or computing devices), associated licensing, training range connectivity which may include long runs of fiber optics cable, and secure data switches, gateways and encryption devices for classified network connectivity. This funding also procures the network infrastructure engineering, acquisition, installation, security, and quality assurance to support the planning, design, and implementation of Information Systems requirements associated with MCA projects. Funding is required to ensure that these projects have all necessary Information Systems infrastructure and equipment for soldier readiness of the facilities.

INFORMATION SYSTEMS (CONUS/WESTERN HEM):
FY 2016 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $4.315 million supports the procurement of commercial-off-the-shelf information (COTS) systems which support Unified Capability voice/data switches, common user network transport infrastructure, end-user instruments (including telephones, soft phones, video teleconferencing equipment or computing devices), associated licensing, training range connectivity which may include long runs of fiber optics cable, and secure data switches, gateways and encryption devices for classified network connectivity. This funding also procures the network infrastructure engineering, acquisition, installation, security, and quality assurance to support the planning, design, and implementation of Information Systems requirements associated with SRM projects.

            <proc:Description>The Defense Message System (DMS) program is DoD's official system of record for Organizational Command and Control Messaging, as established under ASD C3I memorandum dated 12 April 2001.  DMS consists of a web-based enterprise level messaging system employing the Automated Message Handling System (AMHS) software, which provides a single, secure, global inter-service messaging capability extending from the sustaining base to the Warfighter.  DMS' tactical implementation supports the Warfighter in the joint task force environment and across the continuum of Army operations.    

DMS is:  1. Meeting Army Campaign Plan Objectives through deploying and sustaining a global messaging system for Joint and Coalition forces.  2. Designed to meet the Net-centric requirements of no repudiation (digital signature), data security (digital encryption), assured and timely delivery, message traceability and storage.  3. Providing Authentication and Confidentiality through High Grade Class IV Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) encryption. This guarantees the identity of senders and recipients with the assigned organizational PKI certificates, and messages are encrypted between drafting organization and receiving organization.  The Body of the message is unreadable to all except intended recipients with authorized access.  4.  Supporting administrative and intelligence traffic from the sustaining base to the battlefield.  5.A critical tool which aids in the Central Command Area of Operation (CENTCOM) direction of both US and Allied forces within Multi-National Forces-Iraq (MNF-I).  6.  The only messaging system that allows the regional Combatant Commands (COCOMs) to officially communicate with their Allied partners, and other Services and Agencies, at the operational level.

These are all Joint Army Knowledge Management (AKM) Goal 3 initiatives.

All funds support the Active component.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>The Emergency Management Modernization Program (EM2P) is a single integrated acquisition program for the design, procurement, fielding, new equipment training, and life-cycle management of emergency management capabilities in support of Army installations, Soldiers and their Families, civilians, and contractors.  EM2P provides capabilities that increase situational awareness, decrease responder time, and allow for quicker warning and notification of personnel during the management of an active incident.  The EM2P system consists of Mass Warning and Notification (MWN) technologies, Enhanced 911 (E911) solutions, and Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) capability.  CAD serves as the central hub for dispatching law enforcement, fire, and medical services on an installation and is integrated with Automated Installation Entry (AIE), Mass Warning and Notification (MWN), and law enforcement (LE) authoritative data sources as well as with local civilian CAD and civilian LE authoritative data sources.  The EM2P provides capabilities that will save lives by enabling Commanders to quickly and effectively respond to any installation emergency events, to include insider threats, terrorist activity and natural disasters.

The EM2P ADM authorizes EM2P to field 56 CONUS and 13 OCONUS Mass Warning and Notification (MWN) systems and 22 Enhanced (E911) systems.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2016 Base procurement funding in the amount of $8.550 million will complete the total package fielding of 56 CONUS and 13 OCONUS Mass Warning and Notification (MWN) technologies and 18 Enhanced 911 (E911) solutions at Army installations.

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.

This budget line does not procure weapons systems or produce end items.  All IT procurements consist of COTS solutions; all quantities and unit costs vary by system configuration and site.

The Installation Information Infrastructure Modernization Program (I3MP) modernizes and refreshes the classified and unclassified Telecommunications/Information longhaul and shorthaul transport Infrastructure supporting Army posts/camps/stations across the globe.  Installation-level network infrastructure is comprised of the wiring, electronics and security equipment required to provide voice, video, and data communications to traditional business users and Warfighters.  Specific systems include classified and unclassified Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), Joint Regional Security Stacks, and Internet Protocol Video.  I3MP is at the very foundation of the Army's Enterprise information technology modernization strategy to evolve to an Everything over Internet Protocol (EoIP) network environment that meets the Department of Defense mandate to implement Unified Capabilities (UC) and the Joint Information Environment (JIE).  I3MP engineers, designs, and fields standardized, converged, UC-ready, secure Installation Campus Area Network (ICAN) infrastructure using Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) solutions.  In Korea, the program resources all the Information Technology engineering required to ensure Army and Joint Forces can operate efficiently once they relocate south to Camp Humphries.  This infrastructure provides tactical and strategic end-users with connectivity from the desktop to the DOD Information Network (DODIN).  The network I3MP modernizes ensures soldiers maintain their warfighting systems and their proficiency on the systems by using the installation network as a "Docking Station" while they are at home station instead of relying on costly satellite usage time.  I3MP further enables valuable training as it provides the critical high speed and high bandwidth connectivity required for facilities and organizations to conduct Live, Virtual, and Constructive exercises and operations.  The program supports the Army/DoD objectives of network convergence to UC and is aligned with the Joint Information Environment (JIE) initiative by providing the transport infrastructure.

The World Wide Technical Control Improvement Program (WWTCIP) is a continuing program to initiate, improve, expand and automate the Army's Technical Control Facilities (TCF). The program provides power (alternating current and direct current (AC/DC), uninterruptible power supply (UPS) and backup generator), timing and synchronization equipment, line conditioning equipment, real time alarm monitoring and control, tri-service tactical interface, and appropriate test equipment with associated hardware.  The upgrades provide the end user with greater bandwidth for real time response, high quality voice, data, video, and minimizes outages.  The program is essential to support Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS) Theater Combatant Commander's communications as well as the Continental United States (CONUS) power projection bases and Defense Satellite Communications Systems.  The emerging requirements of new base consolidation in both the Pacific and European Theaters will require robust TCF capability.  Provides initial configuration management and implements Information Assurance (IA) controls for TCFs. 

The Terrestrial Transmission (TT) program is a component of the Army's seamless Enterprise Network that provides long-haul communications compatibility across operational systems supporting the Department of Defense approved program to modernize and integrate digital operations within the Pacific and European Theaters. The goal architecture will be able to accommodate the rapidly changing deployment and realignment of forces within the Pacific and European Theaters. The objective is an integrated, survivable network that provides voice, data messaging, video and transmission services to the Warfighter. It will also continue the upgrade of power, and timing and alarm systems for the European Transmission Systems. The Army Special Access Program Enterprise Portal (ASEP) is the Army's only Top Secret compartmented wide area network providing a secure communications capability (email, video, teleconferencing, document storage/sharing, voice over internet protocol and instant messaging) for the transmission of highly classified Special Access Required (SAR) information between the Army Operations Center (AOC), the Army staff, Army Commands, Army Service Component Commands, Army Special Access Programs (SAPs) and Army Sensitive Activities (SAs).</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>I3MP:
FY 2016 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $69.223 million supports CONUS/OCONUS engineering plans and upgrades/modernizes the telecommunications/information infrastructure on Army installations in CONUS and OCONUS to provide standardized secure Information Campus Area Network (ICAN) for tactical and strategic use from desktop to DoD Information Network (DoD IN) through implementation of Unified Capabilities (UC).  This means converging separate voice, video, and data networks and electronics which exist on Army installations onto a single data (internet protocol) network.  Dollars also support Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) and the purchase of Area Distribution Node/End User Building (ADN/EUB) switches to meet the Army's Unified Capability (UC) Modernization requirement. 

FY 2016 Overseas Contingency Operation (OCO) procurement dollars in the amount of $29.500 million supports Operation Freedom Sentinel (OFS).  $14.000 million provides OFS support for theater infrastructure modifications to communications equipment at Camps Buehring and Arifjan with outside cable plants (OSP) and DISN terrestrial circuits for installation of the diverse Commercial Point of Presence (PoP).  $15.500 million provides OFS support for other enduring locations with theater infrastructure modifications with OSP and network communications facility infrastructure modifications. Support includes replacement of connexes housing network support equipment, servers, and associated equipment with grounded, environmentally controllable modular facilities or within existing permanent facilities; it also brings existing data centers into compliance with Joint Information Environment facility standards for installation processing nodes and special purpose processing nodes.


WWTCIP:
FY 2016 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $2.975 million procures the technical engineering service support that facilitates design reviews for the full technical upgrades of TCFs.

Terrestrial Transmission:
FY 2016 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $1.298 million provides for minimal technology refresh (Routers, Switches, Servers, Monitors, etc.) of 10 sites to maintain operational effectiveness, information assurance requirements and to replace obsolete system components of the Army's Special Access Program Enterprise Portal (ASEP).</proc:Justification>

                    <proc:OverallHistoryPlanningRemarks>REMARKS: I3MP is a complex program that orchestrates the implementation of multiple disciplines (connectivity (voice, data, Outside Cable Plant (OSP) network)), capacity, storage and information assurance) across multiple locations each with their own developmental cycle, frequently resulting in the overlapping development and implementation of customized communications solutions (to meet unique and diverse mission conditions) at each Army installation. Unit costs and accompanying number of implementations (installations) will, therefore, vary from year to year, due to the complexity of the requirement, size of the installation, state of the information technology being replaced/modernized, the type of technology required, unique configuration and level of effort required to satisfy all requirements.

            <proc:Description>The Joint Program Office (JPO) supports all Services and Special Operations Command (SOCOM). The Integrated Broadcast Service (IBS) is the worldwide Department of Defense (DoD) standard network for transmitting time-sensitive tactical and strategic intelligence and targeting data to all echelons of Joint Service operational users. The JPO's role is to consolidate and replace existing IBS terminal functionality and capability, and to expedite execution of the IBS Technical Transition Plan (TTP). The Joint Tactical Terminal (JTT) family of systems currently consists of the JTT-Senior and JTT-IBS. The TTP is a comprehensive refresh effort of the entire IBS network focused on rearchitecting the broadcast from its current multi-broadcast, multi-data format structure, to a single broadcast (Common Interactive Broadcast - CIB) and single data format (Common Message Format - CMF). The JTT family of systems is a critical component of the TTP as these systems are the only IBS receiver/transceiver devices in the DoD being modernized to support both the new consolidated broadcast architecture and the National Security Agency's (NSA) crypto modernization mandate. The JTT upgrades must execute the over-the-air broadcast portion of the TTP and IBS data flow via the existing over-the-air IBS broadcast networks. The JTT is the official IBS producer system, ensuring continued IBS interoperability to a variety of tactical receivers across DoD and the Services throughout the TTP implementation period and beyond. This program funds the completion of test and evaluation of JTT commercial of the shelf hardware and software modules, and performance enhancements to the family of JTT equipment. This is necessary to ensure crypto modernization compliance and to facilitate migration to a rearchitected CIB and CMF-based IBS broadcast structure. Funds also support the coordination of JTT configuration management, training, equipping and supporting the Warfighter with improved Joint Readiness and Interoperability.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY2016 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $0.881 million funds support of configuration management, sustainment, training, and fielding of JTT-IBS. The approved Army Acquisition Objective is 994.

Funding supports the Active Component only.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>Prophet Enhanced (PE) is the current system under the Prophet Ground acquisition program.  The PE is the tactical commander's sole organic ground-based Signals Intelligence (SIGINT)/Electronic Warfare system for the Brigade Combat Team (BCT), Stryker Brigade Combat Team (SBCT), and Battlefield Surveillance Brigade (BfSB).  Its primary mission is to provide 24-hour Situation Development and Information Superiority to the supported maneuver brigade to enable the most effective engagement of enemy forces. PE provides a modular, scalable, open architecture-based system solution optimized for ease of use in a variety of configurations (Stationary-Fixed, Mobile and Manpack).  It also incorporates the ability for rapid integration of Technical Insertions and Pre-Planned Product Improvements to ensure operational relevance.  PM Prophet will modernize legacy systems to provide for fleet modernization to meet the requirements of the Prophet program and match the capabilities of the Prophet Enhanced sensors and platforms currently being fielded to the Army.

Army Acquisition Objective (AAO):225</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY2016 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $63.650 million supports the modernization of 14 legacy Prophet systems to modern SIGINT capabilities, plus associated support for New Equipment Training, fieldings and spares for these systems. Prophet continues to modernize legacy systems. After individual modernized systems are assessed during retrofit (and possible re-use of parts) at the contractor's facility, additional cost savings may be realized, and additional quantities purchased.

            <proc:Description>Distributed Common Ground System - Army (DCGS-A) is the Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) System of Systems (SoS) for Joint, Interagency, Allied, Coalition, and National data analysis, sharing and collaboration.  The core functions of DCGS-A are:  the vertical and horizontal synchronization of ISR Processing, Exploitation and Dissemination (PED) efforts; operations in a networked environment at multiple security levels; the control of select Army and joint sensor systems; the fusion of all acquired data and information, and distribution of relevant red (threat), gray (non-aligned), and environmental (weather and terrain) information; and providing the Warfighters' early warning and targeting capability.  DCGS-A provides a single integrated ISR ground processing system composed of common components that are interoperable with sensors, other information sources, all Warfighting Functions, and the Defense Information &amp; Intelligence Enterprise (DI2E).  DCGS-A is fielded in Fixed and Mobile configurations emphasizing the use of reach and split based operations by improving accessibility of data in order to reduce forward deployed footprint. As enhanced capabilities are developed and tested, a continuing series of software releases will be integrated into Army common/commodity hardware and fielded to units in accordance with (IAW) the Army Force Modernization Strategy and the Dynamic Army Resourcing Priority List (DARPL).

The Army Acquisition Executive designated Program Executive Office Intelligence Electronic Warfare and Sensors (PEO IEW&amp;S) as the Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE) lead.  As such, DCGS-A is defining the architecture to fit within the Common Operating Environment (COE) as described by the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology) (ASA(ALT)) COE Implementation Plan.  This is in accordance with the G-3/5/7 priority to align all Army networks, procurements, and enhancements under one COE and one vision leveraging intelligence community investments.

DCGS-A hardware and software is based on a combination of Government Off The Shelf (GOTS), Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS), and Non-Developmental Items (NDI) that are integrated into scalable configurations, tailored to Warfighting functions. These product line components include the software baseline, server suite [Intelligence Fusion Server (IFS)] and individual analyst multi-function workstations, such as Portable and Fixed-Multi-Function Workstations (P-MFWS) and Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) Workstation. These components are also used to upgrade existing fielded Intel Programs of Record to enable the establishment of the Army COE while simultaneously assuring system compatibility and interoperability within the DCGS enterprise.

DCGS-A is a designated Major Automation Information System (MAIS), and is deployed on multiple hardware platforms and security levels across the Army.  DCGS-A achieved a successful Milestone C in 2Q12, and following the operational assessment and Full Deployment Decision (FDD) in 1Q13, DCGS-A Increment 1 Release 1 capabilities are being deployed across the Force IAW the DARPL. Increment 1, Release 2 and Increment 2 capabilities will be fielded incrementally through software releases integrated onto the fielded product line hardware configurations.   

Within the Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs), DCGS-A provides basic mobile ISR capability as well as software applications that can be embedded on future Command, Control, Communications &amp; Intelligence (C3I) and other systems. At the Corps, Division and Echelons Above Corps (EAC), DCGS-software will be hosted on fixed, mobile and portable configurations. DCGS-A consolidates and modernizes the PED capabilities formerly found in the following programs, allowing for their continuing disposition out of the force structure: All Source Analysis System (ASAS) Family of Systems (FoS), Tactical Exploitation System (TES) FoS, Integrated Meteorological System (IMETS) FoS, Digital Topographic Support System (DTSS) FoS, Counterintelligence and Interrogation Operations (CI&amp;I Ops) workstation, Guardrail Common Sensor Intelligence Processing Facility/Guardrail Ground Baseline, Common Ground Station, Prophet Control, and Enhanced Trackwolf processing capabilities. DCGS-A will continue to develop software packages to be embedded into mission command and other select systems providing future enhanced ISR/analytic capabilities.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY2016 Base funding in the amount of $260.268 million will modernize and procure components for the DCGS-A fixed Sites, mobile variants and Program of Record (POR) systems transitioned to the DCGS-A capability.  DCGS-A hardware and software will be integrated into select ISR Current Force POR systems, generating a cost savings, to network enable and provide enhanced ISR PED capabilities IAW the Army's Equipping Strategy. Funding supports the DARPL by equipping and training next deployers with the current DCGS-A software release. Funding also procures new COTS software licenses to enhance performance of fielded systems, as well as supports integration of Intelligence Community investments. DCGS-A supports the Army's Geospatial Transformation by providing an integrated visualization capability for intelligence, terrain, and weather effects in a net centric environment.

FY2016 OCO funding in the amount of $54.140 million is required to reset and recapitalize 1 Operational Intelligence Ground Station (OGS), 13 Geospacial Intelligence (GEOINT) Workstations (GWS), and 5 Tactical Intelligence Ground Stations (TGS).    

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>The Joint Tactical Ground Station (JTAGS) system provides the Army's only in-theater capability for directly downloading raw data from the Defense Support Program satellites, processing this data into ballistic missile early warnings, alerting, cueing, and disseminating that information reliably to theater combatant commanders. JTAGS, fielded since 1997, currently has five ground stations, and is deployed in three theaters (PACOM, EUCOM, and CENTCOM). Obsolescence issues coupled with the desire to take advantage of the Air Force's investment in newer satellites (Space Based Infrared System, SBIR) and their improved warning accuracy and timeliness, led to the Army's approval/initiation of the JTAGS Pre-Planned Product Improvement (P3I) program.   JTAGS Approved Acquisition Objective (AAO) is five systems.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY16 base procurement dollars in the amount of $3.906 million procures re-configured and upgraded hardware/software ground stations developed via the JTAGS P3I Block 2 Phase 1 development/modification program.

            <proc:Description>TROJAN, as an Army Intelligence system, has been providing direct support and an operational readiness capability to soldiers since 1983. TROJAN exists to provide value added to the tactical commander with remote access to signal environments, in order to maintain a high state of operational readiness and enhance the training and sustainment of highly perishable intelligence skills. Additionally, the TROJAN architecture provides the infrastructure enabling split-based and force protection operations in direct support of the warfighter.

TROJAN NexGEN, formerly TROJAN Classic XXI (TCXXI) advances the tactical commanders' readiness in the areas of training (technical and operational signals intelligence (SIGINT)), operational intelligence production and dissemination, and operational support to split-based intelligence operations supporting force protection operations. TROJAN NexGEN's principle use is to provide remote access to target environments, enabling split-based operations from a sanctuary by being the gateway interface to environments of immediate relevance to every supported commander's priority intelligence requirements. In addition, NexGEN will continue its role as an operational readiness system, while also supporting commanders' intelligence requirements across the spectrum of conflict. 

TROJAN NexGEN is an intelligence and electronic warfare (IEW) system that supports the increased readiness of key mobilization personnel in preparation for actions in the mission areas of The Army Plan (TAP). NexGEN is capable of maintaining operational readiness status of unit personnel supporting the full spectrum of military operations as outlined in the Army Strategic Planning Guidance and Army Planning Guidance sections of the TAP.

TROJAN NexGEN provides operational readiness capability to an Army commander employing a rapid global response capability to any level of military conflict throughout the seven mission areas. By employing reach technology relay capabilities between the forward deployed sensors and the sanctuary-based Remote Operational Facilities (ROFs), NexGEN can meet the operational deployment timelines through the use of readiness training venues to meet the requirements of units from Brigade Combat Teams through Corps and Echelon Above Corps (EAC). This operational concept provides the unique capability to remotely control the sensors and direction finding capabilities of the Deployable Collection Assets (DCAs) and process and analyze the collected information for timely reporting of time-sensitive information to the forward deployed Army, Joint Service and Multi-National warfighters.
 
TROJAN SPIRIT provides Army units with dedicated, secure, high capacity, Sensitive Compartmented Information high intelligence data processing and communications. It provides a rapidly deployable, multi-level security, processor-to-processor, high capacity communications capability, and supports tactical to strategic reach-back, essential to split-based operations.

All funding goes to the Active Component.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY2016 Base funding in the amount $13.929 million funds collection and processing system upgrades required to maintain the TROJAN NexGEN system strategic architecture commonality. These enhancements were commonly known as TROJAN Classic XXI and are now referred to as TROJAN Ground SIGINT NexGEN. Funding is used for the procurement of material (hardware/software) in support of planned TROJAN NexGEN upgrades and fielding activities to include fixed and mobile collection platforms, multi-band signal search and acquisition survey systems, fielding, modernization of existing sites, and upgrades to Network Control Centers to support NSA-approved architecture for network infrastructures.  

Funds also procure pre-planned product improvements to all of the fielded and to be fielded TROJAN SPIRIT LITE (V)1/(V)2/(V)3 systems to include bulk transport (bulk encrypted) network upgrades, increased bandwidth upgrades to Mbps throughput, X and Ka Band upgrades, replacement of end-of-life or out dated hardware, and TROJAN Network Control Center (TNCC)/TROJAN Network Operations Center (TNOC) upgrades.  

FY2016 OCO funding in the amount of $6.542 million funds the upgrades and support of TROJAN SPIRIT systems required for current and emerging operational missions.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>Special Purpose Systems (BZ9751):  Technical Insertions (TI) will be made to the ground-based Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) system with additional capabilities required by theater units to effectively engage enemy forces and prove Force Protection information to friendly forces.  Procure government and commercial off-the-shelf (GOTS/COTS) Next Generation SIGINT capabilities that are theater specific and enable the Prophet system to address specific threats and Signals of Interest (SOI).  Prophet Enhanced (PE) is the tactical commander's sole organic ground-based SIGINT/Electronic Warfare system for the Brigade Combat Team (BCT), Stryker Brigade Combat Team (SBCT), and Battlefield Surveillance Brigade (BSB).  Its primary mission is to provide 24-hour situation development and information superiority to the supported maneuver brigade to enable the most effective engagement of enemy forces.  PE provides a modular, scalable, open architecture-based system solution optimized for ease of use in a variety of configurations (Stationary-Fixed, Mobile and Manpack).  It also incorporates the ability for rapid integration of TI and pre-planned product improvements to ensure operational relevance.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2016 Base procurement funding in the amount of $3.978 million is for TI, integration, and product upgrades (hardware and/or sofware) to increase system performance, to include but not limited to: enhanced Manpack capability (integration/test and accreditation of updates), tuner upgrade, processor upgrade, antenna upgrade, operating system upgrade, and receiver software upgrade for Prophet systems to ensure the product remains relevant.

All funding is for the Active component.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>The Counterintelligence (CI) and Human Intelligence (HUMINT) Automated Reporting and Collection System (CHARCS) is the Army's CI and HUMINT tactical collection and reporting system. CHARCS provides automation support for information collection, reporting, investigations, source &amp; interrogation operations and document exploitation. The CHARCS automation architecture extends from the individual HUMINT team soldier or CI agent to the Corps. CHARCS reports digital data such as maps, overlays, images, video, biometrics, scanned documents and audio files. These media are transmitted through secure networks and interfaces with the Distributed Common Ground Systems-Army (DCGS-A) for detailed analysis and creation of finished intelligence products. Collection and reporting teams at Military Intelligence (MI) battalions and their operational managers are equipped with one of two CHARCS systems. The first is the AN/PYQ-8 Individual Tactical Reporting Tool (ITRT) which provides collection and processing devices for individual HUMINT team member or CI agents. The second is the AN/PYQ-3 CI/HUMINT Automated Tool Set (CHATS) which provides the team leader (who normally directs 3-5 team members)and Operational Management Team (OMT) tools to process and manage team-collected information and a robust set of devices such as printers, scanners, and cameras to assist the collection mission. The CHATS is also used by Operational Management Team (OMT) (who normally directs 3-5 collection and reporting teams). Each CHATS has an associated Mission Support Peripheral Sets and Kits (MS-PSK) or Collection Peripheral Sets and Kits (C-PSK).

The C-PSK provides specialized collection component capabilities to support CI/HUMINT collection missions. C-PSK capabilities are commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) technologies and include video and camera equipment, global positioning system (GPS), voice recording device and infrared strobe lights. The MS-PSK provides specialized collection component capabilities to support CI/HUMINT collection missions. MS-PSK capabilities are COTS technologies and include night vision photography &amp; video, captured materiel tracking, digital media forensics software, Document Exploitation (DOCEX) software.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>Close Access Target Reconnaissance (CATR) is a kit of electronic devices that collect, send back, and acquire data to provide near real time feedback in order to validate, follow, locate, or track a target (i.e., tagging, tracking, and locating (TTL)).  CATR will use electronic audio and or video recorders to obtain information which is used to validate movement and identify targets.  In addition, CATR allows for threat monitoring that can be integrated into existing operational tools, help to paint a clearer picture of the battlefield, pinpoint possible target locations, and identify and exploit enemy movements and patterns.

This program is a new start in FY 2016.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2016 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $8.010 million supports the fielding of 24 CATR sets to four (4) Brigade Combat teams (BCTs).  Funds will re-kit CATR sets/systems into the Program of Record (POR) configuration, using equipment from the CATR Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) program.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>The Machine Foreign Language Translation System (MFLTS) program develops, fields, and sustains a basic automated foreign speech and text translation capability into Army acquisition systems, to augment and compliment limited human linguistic resources. These integrated automated translation capabilities will be applicable across three different system configurations; a hand-held/wearable portable device, a laptop or mobile device, and in a networked/web-enabled system. The software modules will translate English into a prioritized listing of languages in a prioritized collection of domains (i.g. medical, intelligence, base security). MFLTS will be interoperable with Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) or Government Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) automation equipment to include the Distributed Common Ground System-Army (DCGS-A), Ground Soldier Ensemble, Counterintelligence Human Intelligence Automated Reporting and Collection System (CHARCS).

This program is a new start in FY 2016.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2016 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $8.125 million supports production of the MFLTS Initial Capability software and software licenses.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>The AN/TPQ-50 (formerly known as AN/TPQ-48(V)3) Lightweight Counter Mortar Radar (LCMR) is a digitally connected, day/night mortar, cannon, and rocket locating system. It is used to detect, locate, track, and report enemy indirect firing systems and provides the ability to observe friendly fire. The AN/TPQ-50 is capable of being deployed in two configurations, standalone or vehicle mounted. It can be set up and operational in 20 minutes and disassembled in 10 minutes. The AN/TPQ-50 is deployed as part of a System of Systems for the Counter-Rocket, Artillery, Mortar (C-RAM) construct or Rocket, Artillery, Mortar (RAM) Warn. It provides data to the Forward Area Air Defense Command and Control (FAAD C2) node for the sense and warn force protection capability at fixed and semi-fixed sites. It provides 360 degrees of azimuth coverage from ranges of 500 meters to 10 kilometer. The AN/TPQ-50 is a program of record with a demonstrated combat record with systems currently fielded to multiple Continental United States (CONUS) and Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) locations and currently scheduled for deployment to Operation Freedom's Sentinel in FY15.

            <proc:Description>Persistent Surveillance Systems - Tethered (PSS-T) is a program comprised of Persistent Threat Detection System (PTDS) and Persistent Ground Surveillance System (PGSS). PSS-T has been assigned to Army Program Executive Office for Intelligence, Electronic Warfare and Sensors (PEO IEW&amp;S). PTDS and PGSS are critical Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) programs consisting of tethered aerostats equipped with high resolution Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR) camera systems and wide-area assessment sensors. Video collected by PSS-T is distributed to the Forward Operating Base and division commander information center as well as to quick reaction forces via personal digital assistant (PDA) displays, providing tactical commanders enhanced battlefield situational awareness.

PTDS - The baseline configuration includes the US Army Research Lab's Unattended Transient Acoustic Measurement and Signature INTelligence (MASINT) System (UTAMS) which operationally cues the PTDS MX-20 EO/IR sensor to slew onto a target. The UTAMS is an acoustic sensor design consisting of sensor stations linked via radio to a base station. Each sensor station includes microphone arrays, signal processor, and display. The baseline PTDS also includes the Joint Synchronization Information Transmitter (JSIT) Mini-Tactical Common Data Link transmitter that transmits MX-20 video stream to ground forces equipped with One System Remote Video Terminal. Expendable-Unattended Ground Sensor (E-UGS) enhances the PTDS ability to detect enemy vehicle and footstep traffic and provides improved situational awareness and facilitate tactical response. PTDS continues to meet other urgent theater needs through system upgrades: adding High Antennas for Radio Communications (HARC) radio, the PRC-117G wide band radio, Tactical Targeting Network Technology (TTNT), Highband Networking Radio (HNR) as part of the aerial layer network extension architecture; transmitting weather data directly to Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA) via weather relay kits; added dual sensor capability; additional ground moving target indicator STARLite and wide area motion imagery Kestrel sensors, Persistent Surveillance Systems (PSS) Slew to Cue and Survivability enhancements.

The PGSS has been a highly successful example of quickly delivering urgently needed capabilities to the Warfighter at remote forward operating bases (FOBs). PGSS continues to meet other urgent theater needs through system upgrades: adding HARC radio, the PRC-117G wide band radio, Quint Networking Technology (QNT), and micro-Enhanced Position Location Reporting System (EPLRS) as part of the aerial layer network extension architecture; transmitting weather data directly to AFWA via PGSS Weather Web, added dual sensor capability; additional Vista, Kestrel, and wireless identification sensing platforms (WISP) sensors, PSS Slew to Cue, Precision Fires, and Survivability enhancements. Additionally, Expendable-Unattended Ground Sensor (E-UGS) enhances the PGSS ability to detect enemy vehicle and footstep traffic and provides improved situational awareness and facilitate tactical response.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>The Sentinel system is used with the Forward Area Air Defense Command and Control [FAAD C2] element and is a supporting program to the Integrated Air and Missile Defense architecture via the Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System [IBCS] to provide critical air surveillance of the forward areas.

Sentinel [AN/MPQ-64A1] consists of a radar-based sensor with its prime mover/power, Identification Friend or Foe [IFF], and Forward Area Air Defense [FAAD] Command, Control and Intelligence [C2I] interfaces.  The radar is deployed in both an air defense role and a sense and warn role for Counter-Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar [C-RAM] missions.  The sensor is an advanced three-dimensional battlefield X-Band air defense phased-array radar with an instrumented range of 75 km.  Sentinel is capable of operating day or night, in adverse weather conditions, in the battlefield environments of dust, smoke, aerosols and enemy countermeasures.  It provides 360-degree azimuth coverage for acquisition tracking.  Sentinel contributes to the digital battlefield by automatically detecting, classifying, identifying and reporting targets [cruise missiles, unmanned aerial systems, rotary wing and fixed wing aircraft].  Improved Sentinel acquires targets sufficiently forward of the battle area to allow weapons reaction time and allow engagement at optimum ranges.  Sentinel's integrated IFF reduces the potential for fratricide of US and Coalition aircraft.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2016 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $43.285 million dollars procures 59 Common Platform Upgrade modification kits for the fleet. These quantities do not reflect the actual number of radars modified.

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.</proc:Justification>

                    <proc:Description>Improved Sentinel Modifications include waveform upgrades for the Receiver/Exciter and Target Classification and upgrades/replacement of the current Sentinel transmitter with Power Amplifier Modules [PAM]. The Exciter upgrades will provide low level Radio Frequency [RF] signals sufficient to support the acquisition and tracking of cruise missile targets and the generation of target classification waveforms. Receiver upgrades accomplish receipt and signal conditioning of low level RF signals prior to Analog/Digital [A/D] conversion sufficient to support the acquisition and tracking of cruise missile targets and target classification. Variable rotation rate provides capability to slow the antenna rotation, increasing time on target to acquire and track small cruise missile targets and to provide flexible antenna positioning capability for target classification waveforms. Target classification efforts include software implementation of target classification capability to support beyond visual range engagements. 

The TPX-57 Mode 5 Identification Friend or Foe [IFF] modification kit replaces the current TPX-56 IFF. It also consists of a new router, enhanced Radar Control Terminal (eRCT), Signal Data Processor (SDP) box, and multiple circuit card assemblies. These modifications convert existing A1 radars to the A3 configuration.  Mode 5 provides improvements over Mode 4 in crypto sensitivity, range performance, probability of identification, expanded reply data including position reports, elimination of garbled returns from closely spaced aircraft, friend from foe identification capability, lethal interrogation capability, reduced interference with Civil Air Traffic Control systems, and selective interrogation capability.  Incorporation of Mode 5 into the Sentinel system is critical to retaining the cooperative target identification capability and Sentinel effectiveness on the current/future battlefield, allowing Sentinel to remain operationally effective in Air Defense operations and Homeland Defense missions.  The addition of the eRCT, SDP cards and corresponding SDP box funds the mitigation of obsolescence issues; reliability, availability, and maintainability issues; and operational and hardware issues identified with fielded Sentinel radars.  The eRCT enables remote operations and includes a tactical data recorder needed for Sentinel to support Counter-Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar [C-RAM] requirements.  The addition of an ethernet router is required to meet Information Assurance requirements for the eRCT and to add Command and Control connectivity to the Sentinel system.

The Common Platform Upgrade will upgrade the current Sentinel prime mover to a common Army platform to meet Brigade Combat Team [BCT] force protection, as well as meet Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System [IBCS] requirements.  Transition to a common Army platform is in compliance with Acquisition Decision Memorandum dated August 2011.  The current Sentinel platform does not meet the force protection requirements as defined by the BCT maneuver mission and IBCS operational requirements. 

The Cross Domain Solution [CDS] Network Interface will enhance Information Assurance and add a National Security Agency [NSA] certified CDS to the fleet, enabling the Sentinel radar to operate on Unclassified and Coalition networks.

The Electronic Attack/Electronic Protect [EA/EP] addresses the electronic countermeasures [ECM] gap. This effort converts Sentinel from analog to digital in order to address more extensive EA/EP signatures from evolving threats.

The Signal Data Processor [SDP] Upgrade is a redesign of the SDP backplane to provide higher data throughput to remove current limitations and an upgraded set of SDP cards to remove obsolescence.  The North Finding Module [NFM] Upgrade will enhance the system's emplacement accuracy, resulting in improved fire control support and replacement of the obsolete NFM.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>Night Vision Devices (KA3500) is a summary budget line including the following programs: 
   (1) K36400 - The AN/PSQ-20 Enhanced Night Vision Goggle (ENVG) is a lightweight, helmet mounted device that expands a Soldier's Situational Awareness (SA) and lethality by fusing image intensification and long wave infrared into a single, integrated image. Adversaries currently have access to image intensified night vision goggle technology, but not a fused system. The ENVG enables superior combat overmatch capability. The ENVG provides dismounted Brigade Combat Team Warfighters the capability to observe and maneuver in all weather conditions, through obscurants, during limited visibility, and under all lighting conditions including total darkness while enabling rapid detection and engagement with rifle-mounted aiming lasers. The AN/PVS-14 Monocular Night Vision Device (MNVD) is a head or helmet mounted image intensification device that provides Soldiers with the ability to perform night operations. The AN/PSQ-20 and AN/PVS-14 support the tactical level of war; enabling the individual Soldier to see, understand, and act first; permitting superior tactical mobility and decisive engagement during limited visibility conditions.   
   (2) K35000 - The Multi-Function Aiming Light (MFAL) is a family of multifunctional infrared and visible laser devices used by Soldiers for accurate weapon aiming or to point out targets and other items of interest. In FY 2018 and beyond, funding in this program procures Pre-shot Threat Detection(PTD) systems.  The PTD is designed to detect and locate optical scopes used by snipers or optronic sight systems on the battlefield or urban zones.      
   (3) B53800 - This program provides funding to procure Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) Laser Target Locators (LTL). There are two generations of LTLs. Generation I systems are the Laser Target Locator Systems (LTLS). Generation II systems are the Laser Target Locator Modules (LTLM) and are currently being procured and fielded. The LTLM is a lightweight, handheld, laser target locator with day and thermal sight capability as well as an internal Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver. LTLM provides the dismounted observer or Scout a fully digital, handheld system to accurately determine target location and the ability of call for fire during all weather and lighting conditions. LTLM improves speed, accuracy, and safety of use over Generation I systems.  
   (4) K41500 - The Clip-on Sniper Night Sight (SNS), AN/PVS-30 for the M110 Semi-Automatic Sniper System (SASS) and XM2010 Enhanced Sniper Rifle (ESR) utilizes passive third generation image intensification technology for night operations. The Clip-on SNS supports the tactical level of war enabling the individual Sniper to see, understand, and act first. The Clip-on SNS provides the Sniper with the capability to acquire and engage targets at extended ranges and eliminate threat Snipers, materiel, and thin skinned armored vehicle targets under low light and night conditions, thus increasing the Sniper's survivability and lethality. Funding beginning in FY 2019 supports the procurement of the Family of Weapon Sights-Sniper (FWS-S) variant, which utilize advances in thermal and image intensification technology to provide a sniper weapon sight operable in line with a day optic sight or in a stand-alone mode.  The FWS-S includes fused multi-band imagery and rapid target acquisition with ballistic equations providing the Sniper with improved capabilities during day and night operations.  
   (5)  K50400 - The TS-3895A provides performance testing for AN/AVS-6, AN/PVS-5 series and AN/PVS-7 series night goggles on a go/no go basis. It is intended for use at intermediate maintenance levels combined with an attachment kit commodes of a collimation attachment and a diopter scope, it can also be used for adjustment of NVGs during disassembly and repair.  It allows the individual Warfighter to perform a wide variety of tasks at night; these tasks include flight operations on various platforms, walking, operating vehicles, surveillance, map reading, maintenance, first aid operation, and engaging enemy targets with direct rifle fire.
   (6)  K31300 - The Driver's Vision Enhancer (DVE) is an uncooled thermal imaging system developed for use on combat and tactical wheeled vehicles.  The DVE allows for tactical movement of combat vehicles in support of their operational missions in all environmental conditions (day/night and all weather).  DVE facilitates mobility providing enhanced driving capability during limited visibility conditions (darkness, smoke, dust, and fog).</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2016 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $124.216 million supports the purchase of 6,002 Enhanced Night Vision Goggles, 524 Laser Target Location Modules, and associated fielding costs.

The FY 2016 funding request was reduced by $29.345 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.</proc:Justification>

                    <proc:OverallHistoryPlanningRemarks>Each delivery order made under these contracts is competed among the 2 manufacturers on the basis of best cost, available schedule, and performance. Therefore, a determination of the quantity per manufacturer to be awarded to each is made after reviewing this information at the time of each delivery order. (Unit Costs are weighted averages).

A new contract will be awarded in FY16 to continue procurement of a smaller, lighter, and lower-cost LTLM. However, the initial start-up costs (qualification, etc) will result in an increase in unit cost for the first year.</proc:OverallHistoryPlanningRemarks>

                    <proc:OverallHistoryPlanningRemarks>The May 2014 ENVG III contracts, awarded to BAE Systems and DRS, RSTA, Inc, were protested.  A subsequent reconvened Source Selection upheld the original awards in December 2014.  A protest was again levied by Raytheon and a stop work order was issued, on both contracts, until resolution. On 13 January 2015, the stay was lifted on the DRS contract.

Unit cost is an average hardware based on quantity of systems procured.  FY 2014 procurement includes 1420 next generation ENVG III qualification systems that will allow wireless imagery connectivity to the Family of Weapons Sight Individual (FWS-I) variant. This capability will provide Rapid Target Acquisition (RTA).

The ENVG III hardware unit cost in FY 2014 and FY 2015 is benefited by the combined quantity buy of 9,720 systems on the FY 2015 delivery order.</proc:OverallHistoryPlanningRemarks>

            <proc:Description>The Long Range Advanced Scout Surveillance System (LRAS3) is a long range reconnaissance and surveillance system which operates in both a stationary vehicle mounted configuration and in an autonomous dismounted configuration. The LRAS3 is a multi-function, line-of-sight target acquisition common sensor suite which provides real-time target detection, recognition, and identification capability 24 hours a day in all weather conditions. LRAS3 also automatically determines Far Target Location (FTL) coordinates for any target ranged to by the operator. LRAS3 enables information superiority by interfacing with Force XXI Battle Command, Brigade-and-Below (FBCB2) to provide target acquisition and FTL information. LRAS3 utilizes the Horizontal Technology Integration (HTI) Second Generation Forward Looking Infrared (SGF) thermal sensor, enabling 24 hour a day operation in adverse weather and penetration of battlefield obscurants. LRAS3 significantly increases the survivability of forces through its standoff capability, allowing them to continue their mission as the eyes of the maneuver commander on the battlefield. The LRAS3 is a key enabling technology and has been a critical combat overmatch capability for the Army units in combat in Afghanistan. The LRAS3 continues to support requirements from Operation Enduring Freedom; for example, the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) All Terrain Vehicle (M-ATV) and developing a networked-enabled (netted sensors) technology insertion capability. The current LRAS3 Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) is 2,894 systems.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>The AN/PSQ-23 Small Tactical Optical Rifle Mounted (STORM) Micro-Laser Range Finder (MLRF) is a weapon-mounted multi-function laser system. It provides an eye safe laser range finder, digital compass, Infrared (IR) and visible aiming lights, and an IR illuminator for far target location with continuous range, accuracy, weight and power performance enhanced capabilities. When connected to a Precision Lightweight Global Receiver/Defense Advanced GPS Receiver (PLGR/DAGR), the AN/PSQ-23 provides range and direction information to develop accurate and timely far target locations. The STORM addresses the lack of depth perception for night applications through use of its IR illuminator and rangefinder. The STORM system provides a stand-alone capability for small unit leaders and Snipers.  In FY15, a production Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) reduced size, weight, power consumption, and cost; designated as STORM AN/PSQ-23C.

The current Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) for this program is 24,163.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2016 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $23.216 million procures 2,526 AN/PSQ-23C systems for fielding to small unit leaders and Snipers.

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>The Green Laser Interdiction System (GLIS) is a rifle-mounted (M4/Modular Weapon System (MWS) carbine or M16A4) laser system that allows the Soldier to interdict non-combatants through non-lethal effects up to 300 meters. It is also designed to divert, disrupt, or delay potential enemies before they can engage friendly forces. GLIS fosters an effective non-lethal means to alert civilians they are approaching military operations with visible effects. GLIS is interchangeable between host weapon platforms.

The Army Acquisition Objective for the GLIS program is 24,846.

            <proc:Description>The Rocket, Artillery, Mortar (RAM) Warn program evolved from the Counter-Rocket, Artillery, Mortar (C-RAM) program and is a horizontal technology insertion, using current C-RAM warning capability to provide early, localized warning of indirect fire (IDF) threats to all Maneuver Brigade Combat Teams (BCT).  It employs the Air Defense Airspace Management (ADAM) Cell already resident in the BCT Headquarters as the command and control (C2) element; uses the existing radars in the Target Acquisition Platoon of the Fires Battalion as the Sense element; and adds enhanced C2, warning devices, controllers, and dedicated communications devices between the existing radars, ADAM Cell, and warning devices.  Integration of this equipment provides a Warn capability to the BCTs for detection of threat IDF rounds and transmission of the detection data to the C2 element for correlation and determination of a predicted point of impact (POI).  Based on the POI, the C2 then determines which warning nodes should send "Incoming" warning alarms and transmits this information to the appropriate warning nodes.  In addition to the representative RAM Warn capability fielded to each BCT, Army Pre-positioned Stocks (APS) equipment sets are being procured to supplement the fielded capability based on mission needs.  Timely warning will enable those BCT personnel in the hazard area of an inbound IDF threat to seek cover or a prone position prior to impact, thus reducing casualties.  The Capability Production Document (CPD) was approved in August 2010, and an update was approved in May 2012, to reflect the name change to RAM Warn.  An initial operational test (IOT) was conducted during November 2012 as part of Network Integration Evaluation (NIE) 13.1, and the RAM Warn Milestone C Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) decision occurred on 19 December 2012.  In April 2014, RAM Warn was approved for entry into the Full Rate Production (FRP) acquisition phase based on successful completion of LRIP exit criteria, including Full Materiel Release.

Near-term directed enhancements to the C-RAM system-of-systems (SoS) capability include use of Army tactical communications rather than commercial systems and integration of Warn functionality into the command and control (C2) workstation to reduce complexity and footprint.

The Counter-Rocket, Artillery, Mortar (C-RAM) Intercept program provides a counter-RAM capability to the Indirect Fire Protection Capability (IFPC)/Avenger battalions, 5-5 and 2-44 Air Defense Artillery(ADA), to defend against and defeat the enduring indirect fire threat.  This capability is provided by fielding existing Land-based Phalanx Weapon System (LPWS) guns previously deployed as a part of the C-RAM quick reaction capability; the guns undergo reset prior to fielding.  C-RAM Intercept transitioned to an acquisition program with the approval of the C-RAM Intercept Capability Production Document (CPD) on 22 Aug 2013 and the Army Acquisition Executive's approval of an Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) on 23 Aug 2013, authorizing the program's entry into the acquisition management system as a post-Milestone C, Acquisition Category (ACAT) III program under the management of the Program Executive Officer, Missiles and Space.  Initial issue of LPWS assets to the IFPC/Avenger battalions is ongoing, with Materiel Release projected for 1QFY16.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2016 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $60.679 million provide for the procurement and fielding of the RAM Warn capability to 21 BCTs and 9 Army Pre-positioned Stocks (APS) equipment sets, C-RAM Intercept fielding to 5-5 and 2-44 ADA, and sustainment support for C-RAM Intercept at 5-5 ADA.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>Family of Weapons Sights (FWS) consist of Individual (I), Crew-Served (CS), Sniper (S) variants, and the Thermal Weapon Sight (TWS).  The AAO for the TWS was completed with the FY12 procurement.  The FWS variant family will increase lethality and improve situational awareness by extending the range a Warfighter can recognize potential targets.  The FWS-I (Milestone C is FY16) reduces target engagement time in both day and night conditions through Rapid Target Acquisition (RTA).  The FWS-CS (Milestone C is FY18) will enable a crew served weapon gunner to more accurately engage targets in less time by utilizing a Head Mounted Display and disturbed reticle that adjusts the aim point.  The FWS-S (Milestone C is FY18) will provide greater detection, recognition and aiding in identification at greater ranges during periods of darkness and limited visibility.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>The Improved Position and Azimuth Determining System (IPADS) provided common inertial survey control for all U.S. Army and Marine Corps Field Artillery, Mortar, Artillery Meteorological and Radar systems.  The IPADS, enhanced with the Global Positioning System (GPS) (IPADS-G), will address deficiencies of the fire support community by providing the ability to maintain the current accuracy of the IPADS without stopping for zero velocity updates, therefore increasing artillery timeliness, availability of fires, lethality, survivability, and force protection on extended convoys or artillery missions.  The IPADS-G may be aided by an internal GPS receiver; however, it must also be capable of operating in an inertial fashion independently of GPS aiding.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY2016 Base Appropriation in the amount of $3.366 million supports the completion of the IPADS-G model conversion ($1.152 million) and the acquisition of a Control and Display Unit replacement ($2.214 million) to address obsolescence. The Army previously contracted for the engineering change proposal to provide the GPS upgrade to the 278 IPADS in the inventory, making them the IPADS-G model. The requested funding supports the continued fielding of the IPADS-G, including essential fielding costs including engineering support, publications, software updates, and new equipment training.

            <proc:Description>The Profiler program provides meteorological (MET) wind speed, wind direction, temperature, barometric pressure, and humidity information required for use in the Advance Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS). All of these are required for precise targeting and terminal guidance. The Profiler program uses a numerical mesoscale weather model to build a four-dimensional MET model (height, width, depth, and time) that includes terrain effects. By providing more accurate MET messages, the Profiler program will enable the artillery to have a greater probability of a first round hit with indirect fire systems. This capability increases the lethality of field artillery systems such as the Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS), Paladin, self-propelled or towed howitzers, and mortars. 

The Profiler program began with Profiler Block I which used a ground tactical meteorological (TACMET) sensor and MET data from the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA) broadcast over communications satellites with the weather model to provide highly accurate MET data. Profiler Block III replaces the Profiler Block I and provides a networked laptop configuration that enhances system efficiencies and reduces the system's operational and logistics footprint with the elimination of support vehicles, trailers, and external sensors. The Profiler Block III configuration consists of one computer with a common operating system co-located within the tactical Command Post (CP) with a direct interface to the CP local area network (LAN). The Profiler Virtual Module system is a product improvement to Profiler Block III that can function in a manual or automatic mode allowing for an operator to manually create MET messages or for MET to be automatically generated in response to requests from any connected AFATDS computer. A significant Operations and Support cost avoidance is realized through this improved configuration. The Profiler Virtual Module will address emerging requirements and system long-term software sustainment challenges. The Profiler Virtual Module concept includes the following updates: update of the weather model; update of software architecture removing legacy Profiler Block I code and creating a modular framework; development in conjunction with the AFATDS program, including AFATDS version II, to provide increased interoperability and usability; and to enable operation of the Profiler system in a virtual machine for use in the Common Operating Environment (COE) versions 2,3,4 and 5. This concept is a flexible approach that supports use of existing Profiler Block III hardware, increased accuracy during technical refresh of hardware with higher performance computers, and virtualization on the Command Post Computing Environment (CP CE) server.

The Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) for Profiler Block I is 108.  

The Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) for Profiler Block III is 136.

The Profiler Virtual Module product improvement is aligned to the current Army Force Structure and requires the refresh of Profiler Virtual Modules.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2016 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $4.057 million supports the fielding of Profiler Virtual Module Tech refresh systems.

The FY 2016 funding request was reduced by $0.184 million to account for the availability of prior year balances.

The Firefinder Radars use a combination of radar techniques and computer controlled signal processing to detect and locate enemy Rockets, Artillery and Mortar (RAM) with sufficient accuracy, and transmit the target data to appropriate counter fire elements in near real time.  The AN/TPQ-36 is phased-array radar which automatically locates mortar and short range rocket launchers.  The system is configured on three (3) High Mobility Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWVs) making it highly mobile and transportable.  The AN/TPQ-37 is a phased-array radar with a longer target acquisition range allowing it to locate RAM.  The system is configured on a M1048A1 6-ton trailer which is towed by a 5-ton prime mover. The system has a spare 5-ton cargo truck and the Operations Central (OC) is mounted on a M1113 HMMWV truck.  
Operationally-required software enhancements and technology insertions for parts obsolescence are necessary to maintain both radars' ability to locate current and emerging threats such as rockets normally used for direct fire. Both systems will receive a ruggedized laptop computer refresh in order to stay up to date and ensure interoperability.  The new ruggedized laptop computer will be interchangeable between the AN/TPQ-36 and AN/TPQ-37.

Army Acquisition Objective (AAO):  
AN/TPQ-36 - 116 (1 per Brigade Combat Team (BCT); Armored, Stryker &amp; Light)    
AN/TPQ-37 - 70  (1 per Armored and Stryker BCT; 2 per Active Component (AC) Field Artillery Brigade; 1 per AC Division Artillery; 1 per National Guard (NG) Fires Brigade)</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>The Joint Battle Command - Platform (JBC-P) program is the cornerstone of joint forces Command and Control (C2) Situational Awareness (SA) and communications. JBC-P provides secure Blue Force Tracking capability in Platforms and Command Posts, providing soldiers and commanders a map-based Common Operating Picture of the battlefield, and as a result, reducing fratricide.

The JBC-P program fields hardware (vehicle platform computer systems, satellite transceivers, encryption devices, and ancillary equipment), software capabilities, and will leverage the Army's previous equipment investments by installing the new JBC-P software on new hardware as well as existing Force XXI Battle Command Brigade and Below (FBCB2) computer systems.

JBC-P serves a primary role as the basis of the Mounted Computing Environment (MCE), one of six (6) environments within the Common Operating Environment (COE) framework. The COE is an approved set of computing technologies and standards that enable secure and interoperable applications to be rapidly developed and executed across a variety of computing environments. Future development of the MCE will leverage JBC-P hardware and software to consolidate and integrate multiple warfighting systems in the Platform (Mounted) environment. This integrated MCE, with its open standards, enhanced interoperability, and simplified end-user interface, will speed delivery of the new Mission Command applications to the warfighter while improving the effectiveness and value of current systems.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>The Joint Effects Targeting Systems (JETS) Target Locator/Designator System (TLDS) provides the dismounted observer and the joint terminal attack controller an integrated, lightweight, modular capability to detect, identify, accurately locate in three dimensions, mark, and designate targets and provide accurate target location coordinates to a forward entry device. The JETS TLDS is an Army program with joint interest (Air Force and Marine Corps). 

JETS will support the Army Fires Center of Excellence two sensor strategy to reduce the number of Fires optical targeting systems to two configurations. JETS will satsify the requirement for the dismounted precision targeting sensor for the individual observer.

This program is a new start in FY 2016.

The draft Approved Acquisition Objective for this program is 3,287.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2016 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $47.212 million procures 71 JETS and initial production tooling and test equipment (non-recurring).

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>MOD OF IN-SERVICE EQUIPMENT (LLDR) funds the retrofit of the Lightweight Laser Designator Rangefinder (LLDR, AN/PED-1 and AN/PED-1A) to incorporate target location improvements. The upgraded LLDR system is type classified as an AN/PED-1B(2H). The LLDR is a modular system designed for crew-served, man-portable day/night all-weather use for determining the precise location of threat targets, and for designating threat targets for engagement by Global Position System (GPS) guided and laser guided precision munitions for a variety of Army and Joint weapons systems. The Target Location Module uses a thermal night vision sensor, day camera, laser rangefinder, and digital compass, GPS, and system controller with digital data and video outputs. The Laser Designator Module provides the capability to guide laser-guided munitions and the capability to mark targets for targeting hand-off to aircraft. This effort also replaces earlier Laser Designator Modules with new diode-pumped Laser Designator Modules, reducing weight and power requirements, resulting in lower sustainment costs. The target location improvement retrofit adds a precision azimuth measurement sensor to supplement the digital compass and brings LLDR systems to a common configuration. Target location improvements enable precision target location and engagement with current and future precision munitions by dismounted fire support teams.

The LLDR with target location improvements will support the Army Fires Center of Excellence two-sensor strategy to reduce the number of Fires optical targeting systems to two configurations.  LLDR will continue to fill its role as a crew-served, dismounted precision targeting system and will in the future integrate with Fire Support vehicle mission equipment packages to also serve as the mounted Fires targeting system.

Funding in this program supports upgrade of LLDR for increased target location accuracy to facilitate employment of currently fielded GPS guided Precision Munitions by dismounted fire support teams.

The Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) for this program is 2,700. Only 200 of the AAO were built in the 2H configuration, the remaining 2,500 require retrofit.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2016 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $22.314 million supports the retrofit of 59 existing LLDR systems with target location improvement.</proc:Justification>

                    <proc:Description>MOD OF IN-SERVICE EQUIPMENT (LLDR) funds the retrofit of the Lightweight Laser Designator Rangefinder (LLDR, AN/PED-1 and AN/PED-1A) to incorporate target location improvements. The LLDR is a modular system designed for crew-served, man-portable day/night all-weather use for determining the precise location of threat targets, and for designating threat targets for engagement by Global Position System (GPS) precision and laser guided munitions for a variety of Army and Joint weapons systems. The Target Location Module uses a thermal night vision sensor, day camera, laser rangefinder, and digital compass, GPS, and system controller with digital data and video outputs. The Laser Designator Module provides the capability to guide laser-guided munitions and the capability to mark targets for targeting hand-off to aircraft. This effort also replaces earlier Laser Designator Modules with new diode-pumped Laser Designator Modules, reducing weight and power requirements, resulting in lower sustainment costs. The target location improvement retrofit adds a precision azimuth measurement sensor to supplement the digital compass and brings LLDR systems to a common configuration. Target location improvements enable precision target location and engagement with current and future precision munitions by dismounted fire support teams.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>The M32A1 and M32A2 Lightweight Handheld Mortar Ballistic Computer (LHMBC) calculates ballistic solutions that give the mortar user data to aim mortar weapon, set the charge, and serve as the Fire Direction Center for all mortar platforms.  The M32A1 LHMBC communicates digitally on the Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS).  The M32A2 communicates digitally on the newly fielded Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW) Fire Support Network.  Both the M32A1 and M32A2 LHMBC versions provide firing computations for all calibers of mortars as well as digital messaging capability.  The M32A2 LHMBC will utilize Nett Warrior (NW) Mobile/Handheld (M/HH) platform and will be compatible with Common Operating Environment (COE) 2.0 compliance.  The M32A2 LHMBC will comply with ASA(ALT) COE directive for M/HH platform.  The M32A1 Lightweight Handheld Mortar Ballistic Computer (LHMBC) will utilize the Ruggedized Tactical Handheld Device (RTHD) platform and will be compatible with COE 1.0 compliance.

This program is a new start in FY 2016.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2016 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $12.131M supports LHMBC software integration of COE 2.0 onto NW platform and procurement of 653ea M32A2 LHMBC NW computers.  The M32A2 LHMBC NW with the latest software are urgently needed to replace the obsolete M32 Ruggedized Personal Digital Assistance (RPDA) computers in the field.  LHMBC eliminates the need of paper firing table, improves the accuracy of mortar ballistic calculation, and increases survivability of mortar crews by digitally connecting to Fire Support network to receive fire missions and Fire Support Coordination Measures to conduct fratricide check.

FY 2016 OCO procurement dollars in the amount of $2.601M supports replacement of 110ea M32 LHMBC RPDA with M32A1 LHMBC RTHD due to combat losses and washouts from combat operations (Unserviceable Condition Code F (unrepairable), G (incomplete), and H (condemned) systems in Theater Provided Equipment (TPE) stock.  The M32A1 RTHD computer will served as an interim computer to fulfill; US Army and US Army National Guard Infantry Brigade Combat Team shortages during Army reorganization until the M32A2 LHMBC NW integration is complete.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>The Mortar Fire Control System (MFCS) accurately determines weapon position and orientation, navigates, calculates ballistics, and communicates digitally on the Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS) and the newly fielded Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW) fire support net. The MFCS consists of the M95/M96 version that is used on mounted 120mm mortars in Armor and Stryker Brigade Combat Teams, and the M150/M151 version that is used on the M120A1 120mm Towed Mortar that is fielded throughout all Infantry Brigade Combat Teams (IBCT). The M95 is used on the M1064A2/M1064A3 Mortar Carriers with the M121 Battalion Mortar System and the M1129A1 Stryker 120mm Mortar Carrier with the 120mm Recoiling Mortar System. The M96 is used on M577 Mortar Fire Direction Center (FDC) vehicle. The M150 is used on the M120A1 120mm Towed Mortar that is mounted on the M1101 Trailer. The M151 is used on the M1097 HWMMV that serves as the IBCT Mortar FDC. Both the M95 and M150 consist of five main components: 1) The Commander's Interface (CI) (M95) or Fire Control Computer (FCC)(M150) links the MFCS components together, communicates, and calculates the ballistic solutions. 2) The Tactical Advanced Land Inertial Navigator (TALIN) is the pointing device and position system that provides the weapon's position, pointing azimuth and elevation. 3) The Gunner's Display (GD) shows the gunner where to point the tube, shows weapon's azimuth and elevation, and the ballistic firing solution. 4) The Driver's Display (DD) (M95 only) provides a "steer-to" display to aid in navigation and emplacement of the vehicle, and 5) The Power Distribution Assembly/Enhanced Power Distribution Assembly filters vehicle power and acts as a circuit breaker isolating MFCS line replaceable units from power fluctuations and surges. The M96 and M151 each consist primarily of the CI (M96) or FCC (M151), installed in the FDC vehicle.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2016 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $10.075 million supports the procurement of (92) SRW Hardware Upgrade kit and (144) M95 Stryker FCCs. Systems are urgently required for fielding to eight US Army and Army National guard Infantry Brigade Combat Teams in accordance with HQDA Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) fielding schedules. These systems improve the accuracy of the M120 towed mortar system from 138 meters Circular Error Probable (CEP) to 75 meters CEP, allowing for first round fire for effect. The systems also increase survivability of mortar crews by eliminating soldier dismount, and adds digital connectivity to the Fire Support network and connectivity to SINCGARS and Force XXI Battle Command Brigade and Below (FBCB2) situational awareness blue data.

            <proc:Description>The AN/TPQ-53 (formerly known as the Enhanced AN/TPQ-36) Counterfire Target Acquisition Radar System Capability Production Document (CPD) was approved on 29 September 2010. The AN/TPQ-53 System is a highly mobile radar set that automatically detects, classifies, tracks, and locates the point of origin of projectiles fired from rocket, artillery and mortar (RAM) systems with sufficient accuracy for first round fire for effect. It mitigates close combat radar coverage gaps and will replace the current AN/TPQ-36 and AN/TPQ-37 Firefinder Radars, modernizing brigade combat teams (BCTs) and fires brigades. The AN/TPQ-53 System interoperates with battle command systems (BCSs) to provide the maneuver commander increased counterfire radar flexibility. The AN/TPQ-53 system is capable of being deployed as part of the Indirect Fire Protection Capability (IFPC) system of systems (SoS) to provide a sense and warn capability for fixed and semi-fixed sites. The AN/TPQ-53 System provides a system with increased range and accuracy throughout a 90 degree search sector (stare mode) as well as 360 degree coverage (rotating) for locating mortar, artillery and rocket firing positions.  
Army Acquisition Objective (AAO): 174</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>The Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 procurement dollars in the amount of $217.379 million supports the procurement of fifteen (15) AN/TPQ-53 radars.

The FY 2016 funding request was reduced by $69.097 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>Fire Support Command and Control (FSC2) systems automate the planning and execution of fire support operations so that a suitable weapon or group of weapons adequately covers targets. Fire support is the effects of lethal and non-lethal weapons (fires) that directly support land, maritime, amphibious and special operation forces to engage enemy forces, combat formations, and facilities in pursuit of tactical and operational objectives. FSC2 family consists of Gun Display Unit -Replacement (GDU-R), Ruggedized Handheld Computer (RHC), Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS), Light Weight Technical Fire Direction System (LWTFDS), and Pocket-sized Forward Entry Device (PFED).

The Gun Display Unit-Replacement (GDU-R) system allows non-digitized howitzer firing sections to receive and display firing data and firing commands transmitted by the Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) at the platoon Fire Direction Center, and transmit the status of the gun to the AFATDS as the fire mission progresses. The GDU-R is fully fielded and will be retired when the last M119A2 towed howitzer is digitized.

The Ruggedized Handheld Computer (RHC) is hardware used to host the Forward Observer System (FOS) software, combined are known as the Lightweight Forward Entry Device (LFED). The LFED is a handheld device used by mounted forward observers and fire support teams to transmit and receive fire support messages over standard military radios. They provide a digitized connection between the fire support teams and the Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS), and provide a vital sensor-to-shooter link. LFED/RHC enables mounted forward observers and fire support officers to plan, control and execute fire support operations at maneuver platoon, company, battalion, and brigade levels. The Approved Acquisition Objective for RHC is 2,587.

AFATDS provides joint automated fire support command, control and communications and functions as the land component's automated Fire Support Command and Control (FSC2) system.  AFATDS is used in the Fires Warfighting Function to plan, execute, and deliver lethal and non-lethal fires within the overall Mission Command and Control (MC2) enterprise. The system interoperates and integrates with: over 80 different battlefield systems from Army, Marine Corps, Navy, and Air Force; and Coalition Forces fire support command and control systems.  AFATDS fuses the essential situational awareness data, intelligence information and targeting data, in near real time, in order to effectively manage target selection and target engagement in accordance with the Maneuver Commanders guidance and priorities and to safely execute against friendly situational picture.  AFATDS pairs targets to weapons to provide optimum use of fire support assets and timely execution of fire missions.  AFATDS automates the planning, coordinating, and controlling of all fire support assets (field artillery, mortars, close air support, naval gunfire, attack helicopters, offensive electronic warfare, fire support meteorological systems, forward observers, and fire support radars).

The Light Weight Technical Direction System (LWTFDS) currently consists of one product, Centaur. Centaur is a handheld system which provides technical fire control for the cannon Fire Direction Centers (FDCs). Centaur replaced the 1980's era Back-up Computer System (BUCS) which is no longer in service. Centaur serves as a backup technical fire direction capability in case the primary capability, Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) is unavailable and serves as a secondary calculation check for AFATDS. In addition, Centaur provides early entry forces with the capability to compute automated cannon ballistic firing solutions before AFATDS arrives. Centaur hosts the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Armament Ballistic Kernel (NABK) computational software algorithm which is ported onto a Rugged Personal Digital Assistant (RPDA).

The Pocket-sized Forward Entry Device (PFED) (Inc 1) is a handheld hardware device that enables rapid precision Sensor-to-Shooter and Surveillance capabilities. PFED is fully interoperable with Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) and current fire support systems. The Approved Acquisition Objective for PFED Inc 1 is 2,761.  PFED Increment 2 is a software application that operates on the Nett Warrior (NW) End User Device (EUD). It will provide the dismounted Forward Observer (FO) and Fire Support Teams (FISTs) the capability to accurately and rapidly locate ground targets and enable the Nett Warrior ensemble to digitally process a Call For Fire.  PFED Inc 2 aligns with the Army's Fires and Effects Concept of Operation and contributes to Networked Fires as part of the combined arms teams in Army, Special Operations Forces (SOF), and Joint operations. PFED Inc 2 supports the Mobile Handheld Computing Environment requirement that all handheld applications reside on the Nett Warrior EUD.  PFED Inc 1 will remain fielded and sustained until units receive PFED Inc 2-capable Nett Warrior End User Devices (EUDs). PFED Inc 2 software will be deployed by Nett Warrior IAW the NW fielding schedule.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2016 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $1.190 million supports Pocket-sized Forward Entry Device (PFED) Inc 1 and Inc 2 logistics/engineering support, PFED Inc 2 ancillary items purchase, program management, PFED Inc 1 fielding and New Equipment Training (NET).

FY 2016 OCO dollars in the amount of $.048 million supports retrograde operations in Afghanistan that have yielded an austere environment where rapid in-theatre systems replacement is infeasible. The large retrograde effort depleted the availability of theatre-provided equipment. In addition, available systems are outdated or have been affected by dust, and power fluctuations that have shortened equipment lifecyclcs. Further, near term circumstances in the operational environment demand quick action to source equipment to cover emerging mission sets without degrading existing capability.

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P. L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>The Battle Command Sustainment Support System (BCS3) is the logistics Command and Control solution for U.S. land forces. BCS3 provides commanders the capability to execute end-to-end distribution and deployment management and brings better situational awareness, resulting in better decision-making capability to warfighters. It enables warfighters and commanders to target, access, scale and tailor critical logistics information in near-real time. BCS3 provides more effective means to gather and integrate asset and in-transit information to manage distribution and deployment missions. BCS3 combines distribution management to include commodity and convoy tracking, and deployment management into a logistics Common Operating Picture (COP) for one mission-focused visual display.  BCS3 has been adopted and integrated into Joint and strategic logistics C2 processes.  BCS3 is the only near-term end-to-end logistics COP solution for the Joint commander. BCS3 will maintain its core capabilities and continue to advance in development while integrating into the Joint command and control architecture. This continued development will enable decision superiority via advanced collaborative information sharing achieved through interoperability. BCS3 has immediate, high pay-off benefit to warfighters. BCS3 is a force multiplier, a precision tool for logistics planning and execution that provides warfighters with the necessary tools to succeed.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>The Forward Area Air Defense Command and Control (FAAD C2) system collects, digitally processes, and disseminates real-time target cuing and tracking information; the common tactical 3-dimensional air picture; command, control, and intelligence information to all Air and Missile Defense (AMD) weapon systems (Avenger and Man-Portable Air Defense System (MANPADS), joint and combined arms systems.  The FAAD C2 system provides alerting data to air defense gunners, airspace battle management, and up-linking of mission operations, thereby enhancing force protection against air and missile attack.  Situational awareness and targeting data is provided on threat aircraft, cruise missiles, and unmanned aerial systems (UAS).  The FAAD C2 system provides this mission capability by integrating dynamic FAAD C2 engagement operations software with the Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS), Joint Tactical Terminal (JTT), Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS), Enhanced Position Location Reporting System (EPLRS), Global Positioning System (GPS), Airborne Warning and Control Systems (AWACS), Sentinel Radar, and the Mission Command (MC) architecture.  In addition, FAAD C2 provides interoperability with Joint C2 systems and horizontal integration with PATRIOT, and Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) by fusing sensor data to create a scalable and filterable Single Integrated Air Picture (SIAP) and common tactical picture.  The system software is a key component of the Air Defense and Airspace Management (ADAM) Cell that is being fielded to Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs), Multi-Functional Support Brigades and Division Headquarters as part of the Army's modularity concept.  System software is able to provide target data and engagement commands/status to AMD (Air and Missile Defense) Battalions.  FAAD C2 is also a principal air defense system within the Homeland Defense Program.

            <proc:Description>The Air and Missile Defense Planning and Control System (AMDPCS) is an Army Objective Force System that provides integration of Air and Missile Defense (AMD) operations at all echelons.  AMDPCS systems are deployed with Air Defense Artillery (ADA) brigades (Bdes), Army Air Missile Defense Commands (AAMDCs), and Air Defense and Airspace Management (ADAM) Cells at the Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs), Multi-Functional Support Brigades, Corps and Divisions.  AMDPCS systems also provide air defense capabilities to Homeland Defense systems. The fielding of ADAM Cells is essential in fulfilling the Army's Campaign Plan requirement.  ADAM Cells provide the Commander at BCTs, Bdes and Divisions with air defense situational awareness and airspace management capabilities.  They also provide the interoperability link with Joint, multinational and coalition forces.  AMDPCS components are vital in the transformation of ADA units.  AMDPCS provides these organizations with shelters, automated data processing equipment, tactical communications, standard vehicles and tactical power, and the two major software systems used in air defense force operations/engagement operations: The Air and Missile Defense Workstation (AMDWS) and the Air Defense System Integrator (ADSI).  The AMDWS is a staff planning and battlespace situational awareness tool that provides commanders at all echelons with a common tactical and operational air picture.  The AMDWS is being fielded to all AMDPCS units, including the ADA Bdes, the AAMDCs and the ADAM Cells, as well as to the Maneuver Air and Missile Defense Battalions and Batteries.  AMDWS provides the Mission Command (MC) capabilities imbedded within the Warfighter Mission area.  AMDWS is the Net-centric interface to MC for all components of the AMD force.  AMDPCS also provides the ADA Brigades, AAMDCs and ADAM Cells with the ADSI, which is a communications data link processor and an additional display system. AMDWS and ADSIs are vital components of the ADAM Cells that are deployed in Afghanistan.  AMDWS is a critical component in the integration and fielding of the Counter-Rocket, Artillery and Mortar (C-RAM) capability to Operating Bases in Afghanistan.

Approved Acquisition Objective (AAO) for AMDPCS shelter systems is 225.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2016 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $28.176 million procures 5 ADAM Cells for AMD Combat Aviation Commands, AMD Theater Aviation Brigades, and Maneuver Enhancement Brigades which will provide a 3-dimensional air picture for situational awareness, the capability to coordinate airspace command and control, and warning of rocket artillery and mortar attacks.  FY 2016 also procures 1 AMDPCS for one Terminal High Altitude Air Defense (THAAD) Battery.

            <proc:Description>The Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense (AIAMD) Program is a direct response to the U.S. Army AMD Concept and Operational and Organizational (O&amp;O) Plan for the Future Force, the Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense System of Systems (SoS) Capabilities Development Document (CDD) and the new Air and Missile Defense Task Force Concept of Operations (CONOPS).   The AIAMD Program is uniquely structured to enable the development of an overarching system of systems (SoS) capability with all participating Air Defense Artillery (ADA) components functioning interdependently to provide total operational capabilities not achievable by the individual element systems. The AIAMD program achieves this objective by establishing the AIAMD architecture and developing (1) the IAMD Battle Command Systems (IBCS) Engagement Operations Center (EOC) that provides the common Mission Command capability, (2) the Integrated Fire Control Network (IFCN) capability for fire control connectivity and distributed operations, and (3) the common Plug and Fight (P&amp;F) Kits that network enable multiple sensor components, weapon components, and the IBCS EOC.

The AIAMD Program will provide advanced capabilities to the Army and the soldier by allowing transformation to a network-centric system-of-systems capability (also referred to as "Plug and Fight") that integrates Army Air and Missile Defense (AMD) sensors and weapons with the IBCS EOC.  The AIAMD SoS architecture will enable extended range and non-line-of-sight engagements, to include joint kill chain engagements across the full spectrum of aerial threats, providing fire control quality data to the most appropriate weapon to complete the mission successfully.  Further, it will mitigate the coverage gaps and the single points of failure that have plagued AMD defense design in the past.  The AIAMD program will provide the user with the ability to train on a single C2 system that will result in overall training savings. The AIAMD program will also provide the Army with the ability to procure components that will build to established interfaces allowing them to "connect" to the IFC network alleviating the cost of procuring total system capabilities in the future. 

The FY18 Initial Operational Capability is delivered through the fielding of the IBCS EOC-based AIAMD architecture including the IBCS EOC, Sentinel and Patriot components connected via an IFCN, working in an integrated manner. Additional capabilities include the incorporation of IBCS functionality into Air Defense Airspace Management (ADAM) Cells, ADA Brigade Headquarters and Army Air and Missile Defense Command (AAMDC) Headquarters. Future additional capabilities include incorporation of Terminal High Altitude Air Defense (THAAD) batteries and composite Indirect Fire Protection Capability (IFPC)/Avenger battalions into the AIAMD architecture.

AIAMD is a designated Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP).

This program is a new start in FY 2016.

FY16 funding goes to the Active Component. Army National Guard funding starts in FY2020.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2016 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $12.920 million funds the initial hard tooling and labor associated with the IBCS production line set up to support low-rate initial production. Funding includes the cost of fabrication, assembly and installation of tools, inspection equipment and test equipment to support the manufacture of IBCS components. Funding includes the cost for the modification and rework of the required developmental tools for production purposes as well as duplicate sets of tools.

FY 2016 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $7.997 million is required for Long Lead-time Items (LLI) IBCS components required to protect the production schedule and to maintain critical manufacturing skills for both the prime and sub-contractors. The Long Lead items consist of Tactical Mounted Trailers with a long lead time of 14 months and S-280 shelters with a long lead time of 15 months.

"In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities."</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>Life Cycle Software Engineering (LCSE) support, by the Software Engineering Center (SEC), provides the essential equipment needed to maintain Communications-Electronics Life Cycle Management Command (C-E LCMC) managed fielded Battlefield Automated Systems (BAS) in a state of operational readiness.  Approximately 100 BASs in Post Production Software Support (PPSS) directly depend on LCSE support to maintain a posture of mission critical readiness.  LCSE system support and services are essential to maintain BASs in the state of operational readiness.  Policy for Post Production Software Support (PPSS) requires that system managers provide initial host capabilities for new systems and that the Life Cycle Software Engineering Centers (LCSEC) provide upgrades and replacement of obsolete equipment.  Significant portions of host and network equipment are no longer economically repairable and/or are reaching obsolescence.  There is a requirement to respond to emergency requests from the field for Software Engineering support, in order to maintain operational readiness of deployed BASs.  With host computers and peripherals having a life span of approximately five years and SEC performing its mission over a continuous period of time beyond five years, equipment must be replaced and/or upgraded regularly to deal with obsolescence and take advantage of the continual improvements in technology that are indigenous to high-technology based weapon systems and their software support environments.  SEC must purchase these items to meet systems mission requirements.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2016 Base Procurement dollars in the amount of $5.850 million procures the following Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) lab equipments:

1) Computer Equipment: (1) E-J Band RF channel with 5-port Direction-of-Arrival (DoA) capability, (1) K-L Band RF channel (mmW) with 5-port Direction-of-Arrival (DoA) capability,  RF Simulator Spare Parts Package (a. AC-to-DC Power Supplies, b. Various circuit card assemblies (CCAs); i.e. FiberOptic Interface, Digital Pulse Generation Modules, Digital-to-RF Interface, etc., c. Various RF discrete components; i.e. Frequency Locked Oscillators(FLO) C thru L bands, RF Amplifiers (C thru L bands), RF Attenuators (C thru L bands) and  a 5-port Direction-of-Arrival (DoA) Modules (C thru L bands), Quad-Phase Modulators (C thru L bands), RF Pulse Modulation Switch (C thru L bands), etc).

Requirement Description: The RF simulator will be supporting the increase of Radio Frequency (RF) simulation requirements due to the complexity of threats to Force Protection systems such as Counter Radio-Controlled Improvised Explosive Device (RCIED) Electronic Warfare (CREW)  Duke, Radar Warning receivers APR-39A(V)1, APR-39B(V)2, and APR-48 Radio Frequency Interferometer(RFIS) and future systems.  Failure to provide effective support for threat simulation using the most effective simulator covering all threat Radio Frequency (RF) bands can cause unreliable mission software for CREW and all Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) systems supported by SEC.  In addition, the current RF simulators being used are well beyond their expected Operational Life Cycle, and are likely to become inoperable within the next 6-18 months

2) Computer Equipment: NetApp F2240A-4-24X2TB-CL-10G-R5 (FAS2240-4,CL,HA,24x2TB,10GbE,Dual CTL), (2) Dell Blade computer (8 blades - 6 1/10gb switches ), (2) Dell EqualLogic storage for blade computer (24 TB), (45) Surrogate computers - HP Compaq 6300 Microtower  (Core i5, 250GB HDD, 4GB RAM, 1 DVD RW), 18 ServSwitch Octet Basic User Station(KV1711A-R2), 20 ServSwitch Octet KVM Switch, 4 Users x 16 Servers (KV1703A0, 50 Updated monitors for Surrogate computers - 22" and 144  ServSwitch Octet Server Access Module (SAMs) for USB

Requirement Description: The majority of existing Force XXI Battle Command, Brigade and Below (FBCB2) software integration and test hardware is 8-10 years old and is no longer supported by the vendor. In the case of the Blue Force Tracking Network Operations Center (BGN), the test bed hardware is not a representative of the deployed equipment and thus limits SEC's ability to truly replicate, troubleshoot, and assess performance and operational behavior on the fielded target hardware. The BFT/NOC hardware is 2 generations of hardware behind the deployed configuration. In addition, test bed network equipment, such as switching equipment, requires replacement due to obsolescence and lack of vendor support.  Failure to fund the hardware upgrade and allow the test bed become partially and/or completely inoperable due to equipment obsolescence and vendor support, this will render SEC incapable of performing the FBCB2 PPSS mission.

Requirement Description: The Ft. Sill server farm for the Fires programs under sustainment are reaching their end of life. These machines serve up compilers and provide a data repository for all source code, and documentation at Ft. Sill. Today we have roughly 20 machines that are about 3-5 years old. This purchase would replace them with 5 more powerful machines utilizing VMWare to virtualize the environment reducing the needed for as many machines. The new machines will increase the server reliability and assist in consolidation. Loss of one machine will begin to impact the Compilation schedules for all Fires program under sustainment at Ft. Sill. Loss of more will increase that effect. These machines are roughly 3-5 years old on average and are approaching end of life, which will soon render them unserviceable.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>The Network Management Initialization and Services (NMIS) program supports the Army's objectives of an integrated Network Operations capability.  There are two components to the program:  

Network Management System (NMS) funds the NetOps Trail Boss systems engineering support to converge NetOps capabilities across ASA(ALT) in order to enable improved network security and delivery of network operations services to the Generating Forces and Operating Forces of the Army.  Integrated NetOps capabilities support distributed operational NetOps responsibilities across the tactical and strategic components of the LANDWARNET, simplify the network management environment for the tactical commander and the G6/S6 staff, and eliminate both functional and material redundancies in order to achieve efficiencies in fielding.  

Data Products provide the necessary initialization data required for Battle Command Systems, like Joint Battle Command-Platform (JBC-P) and the Army Battle Command Systems (ABCS), to interoperate over the tactical network. Data Products are essential for Blue Force Tracker (BFT) Situational Awareness data, for tactical digital messaging (e.g., Improvised Explosive Device (IED) awareness, Medical Evacuation (MEDEVAC), Call for Fire, etc.) and automated Command and Control (C2) to function.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2016 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $5.014 million supports Network Management System duties as an integration/interoperability/convergence manager for the Army's NetOps portfolio. Duties include assessments of Cyber and NetOps capability gaps, developing NetOps capability roadmaps across key Army stakeholders, developing interoperability specifications, and maintaining the Army NetOps Capability Configuration Management.

FY 2016 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $7.724 million supports procurement of Data Product Networking Initializations; databases that support the Army Forces Generation (ARFORGEN) model for deployment, training and reset; the fielding and support of the Initialization Tool Suite (Warfighter Initialization Tool- Platform(WIT-P), Warfighter Initialization Tool- Server(WIT-S), and Warfighter Initialization Tool- Manager(WIT-M)) and utilization of the Automated Initialization Manager(AIM). Static data products are also being evolved to include initialization being managed at the unit level.

The FY 2016 funding request was reduced by $0.141 million to account for the availability of prior year balances.

            <proc:Description>Maneuver Control System (MCS) is also named Tactical Mission Command (TMC). TMC is a suite of products and services that provide commanders and their staff executive decision making capability in a collaborative environment. The suite of products currently in development consist of Command Web (CW), Tactical Applications (TacApps), and an Army Voice Communication System (WAVE).  TMC satisfies requirements and capabilities identified in the MCS 6.4 Capability Production Document and the Battle Command Sustainment Support System (BCS3) Capability Production Document.  The overarching capability includes a user-defined Common Operating Picture (COP) with integrated Command and Control (C2) and Situational Awareness (SA), map-centric collaboration, Army Mission Command Systems (and others) enabling system interoperability, data management, and enterprise services.  TMC contributes to Mission Command Convergence/Common Operating Environment (COE) development for commanders and staff to effectively conduct collaborative mission planning and execution across a range of operations and spectrum of conflict.   Legacy products supported by this Budget Item include Command Post of the Future (CPOF), Battle Command Common Services (BCCS), Logistics Widgets, and Common Tactical Vision (CTV).

TMC procures the hardware infrastructure that powers the Command Post Computing Environment (CP CE) software.  Hardware infrastructure includes clients for applications that have not fully transitioned to the CP CE environment like Command Post of the Future (CPOF) and Battle Command Sustainment Support System (BCS3).  Additionally, TMC procures the hardware for the Battle Command Common Services (BCCS) stacks which provide a hosting environment for all virtualized applications and back end services, such as the Distributed Data Service (DDS) critical for interoperability amongst all systems within the CP CE.  CP CE will use the foundational architectures from TMC's product line to provide a common look and feel for the Warfighter from Army Service Combatant Command (ASCC) to Battalion.

TMC is a designated Major Automation Information System (MAIS) program.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>Global Combat Support System-Army (GCSS-A) consists of two funding subcomponents; Standard Army Management Information Systems (STAMIS) Tactical Computers (STACOMP)and Army Enterprise System Integration Program (AESIP).  

GCSS-Army will modernize tactical logistics by implementing a web based and commercial best business practices system to streamline supply and maintenance, property accountability, and logistics management and integration procedures in all tactical units of the Army. GCSS-Army will provide a comprehensive solution for meeting the day-to-day needs of tactical level logistics, logistics finance operations and statutory auditability requirements. GCSS-Army will enable Commanders to obtain an integrated, interoperable view of the sustainment situation in the battle-space in sufficient time to support decisions that will affect the outcome of combat operations, combat power and planning for future operations.  

The Army Enterprise Systems Integration Program (AESIP), mission is to integrate Army business processes by providing a single source for enterprise hub services, centralized master data management, and business intelligence and analytics.  AESIP will support the Army's federated approach and enable the integration of end-to-end logistical and financial processes. The AESIP solution establishes a framework for a fully integrated ERP centric environment that will ultimately provide Commanders Total Asset Visibility from Factory to Battlefield thereby ensuring delivery of the right equipment to the right unit at the right time, while reducing backlogs of material on the battlefield.

GCSS-A is a designated Major Automation Information System (MAIS) program.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2016 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $162.654 million supports GCSS-Army and AESIP. These funds procure software licenses, fielding, and training support of the systems to the Army. The AESIP funding procures software required for the implementation of an enterprise business intelligence solution, SAP High-Performance Analytic Appliance (HANA), Database Management System and hardware refresh for the end of life equipment supporting mobile training of software deployment.

            <proc:Description>The IPPS-A provides the Army with an integrated, multi-component, military personnel and pay system which streamlines Army Human Resources (HR), enhances the efficiency and accuracy of Army personnel and pay procedures, and supports Soldiers and their families.  The IPPS-A will subsume approximately 50 Army legacy systems across the Army, Army Reserve, and National Guard, into an integrated system.  The IPPS-A is a web-based tool, available 24 hours a day, accessible to HR professionals, combatant commanders, personnel and pay managers, and other authorized users throughout the Army.  IPPS-A addresses major deficiencies in the delivery of military personnel and pay services and also provides internal controls and audit procedures that prevent erroneous payments and loss of funds.

IPPS-A Increment II will deliver full integrated personnel and pay services for all Army Components, building on the trusted database delivered by the IPPS-A Increment I program. Increment II will be able to link the personnel and pay functions for all Army personnel, eliminating duplicate data entry, reducing complex system maintenance, and minimizing pay discrepancies. IPPS-A Increment II will account for status changes between Active, Reserve, and National Guard components to ensure accurate service time minimizing impact on individual pay, credit for service, and other benefits as well as enable disciplined human resource management.

IPPS-A Increment I and Increment II are both designated Major Automation Information System (MAIS) programs.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2016 procurement dollars in the amount of $4.446 million support IPPS-A Increment II initial system software and hardware procurement to build out the Data Center infrastructure.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>The Instrument Set, Reconnaissance and Surveying (commonly known as ENFIRE) is a tactical engineering tool set designed to modernize the collection and dissemination of engineer related information while minimizing exposure to enemy observation. ENFIRE incorporates the ability to automatically populate field data on digital forms used for road, bridge, hasty minefield, and Improvised Explosive Device (IED) reconnaissance/reporting with relevant information from peripheral devices included in the ENFIRE set.  ENFIRE sets are used at the company, platoon, and squad levels as a means to facilitate rapid collection and dissemination of information to commanders in the field.  Information may be disseminated via the Battle Command Common Services  to other ENFIRE sets and to other Mission Command (MC) systems.  ENFIRE also has broad area application as a common computing platform for the engineer platoon; with plans to incorporate the Engineer Rapid Airfield Construction Capability Type 1 software solution.

The long distance laser range finder allows soldiers to quickly and accurately determine a target's bearing and distance from the users' location at a significant standoff range.  Used in conjunction with the Defense Advanced Global Positioning System Receiver and ArcMap software, ENFIRE users are able to create overlays of bridges, roads, hasty minefields, and IEDs on digital maps as they collect information related to these targets.  Using the video camcorder and digital scanner, ENFIRE users can also collect picture and scanned image files that can be associated with bridge, road, hasty minefield and IED information for reporting purposes. Reports can be generated in hard or soft copy for quick dissemination enabling the "Every Soldier as a Sensor" concept.

ENFIRE also offers agile and adaptive tools to help construction and facilities engineers effectively plan and efficiently undertake projects. ENFIRE's construction site-planning software supports structure design, cut and fills requirements, material needs, and personnel and time requirement calculations. ENFIRE's project management tools can create Gantt charts to track project progress and milestones. ENFIRE provides a bar code scanning capability which makes inventory management faster and more accurate.

            <proc:Description>Mod of In-Svc Equipment Instrument Set, Reconnaissance and Surveying (commonly known as ENFIRE) supports tech refresh of fielded systems. Tech Refresh of ENFIRE is on a five year cycle and is the replacement of the laptop and selected perpherials.

ENFIRE is a tactical engineering tool set designed to modernize the collection and dissemination of engineer related information while minimizing exposure to enemy observation. ENFIRE incorporates the ability to automatically populate field data on digital forms used for road, bridge, hasty minefield, and Improvised Explosive Device (IED) reconnaissance/reporting with relevant information from peripheral devices included in the ENFIRE set.   ENFIRE sets are used at the company, platoon, and squad levels as a means to facilitate rapid collection and dissemination of information to commanders in the field.   Information may be disseminated via the Battle Command Common Services (BCCS) to other ENFIRE sets and to other Mission Command (MC) systems.   ENFIRE also has broad area application as a common computing platform for the engineer platoon; with plans to incorporate the Engineer Rapid Airfield Construction Capability (ERACC) Type 1 software solution.

The long distance laser range finder allows soldiers to quickly and accurately determine a target's bearing and distance from the users' location at a significant standoff range.   Used in conjunction with the Defense Advanced GPS Receiver (DAGR) and ArcMap software, ENFIRE users are able to create overlays of bridges, roads, hasty minefields, and IEDs on digital maps as they collect information related to these targets.   Using the video camcorder and digital scanner, ENFIRE users can also collect picture and scanned image files that can be associated with bridge, road, hasty minefield and IED information for reporting purposes. Reports can be generated in hard or soft copy for quick dissemination enabling the "Every Soldier as a Sensor" concept.

ENFIRE also offers agile and adaptive tools to help construction and facilities engineers effectively plan and efficiently undertake projects. ENFIRE's construction site-planning software supports structure design, cut and fills requirements, material needs, and personnel and time requirement calculations. ENFIRE's project management tools can create Gantt charts to track project progress and milestones. ENFIRE provides a bar code scanning capability which makes inventory management faster and more accurate.

ENFIRE Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) = 2748 (Department of the Army AAO increase based on a revised Army Force structure of 450,000) ENFIRE Hardware and Software are 100% Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) and Government Off the Shelf (GOTS) procurements.

This program is a new start in FY 2016.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>Army Training Modernization (ATM) includes three related efforts to acquire Digital Training Facilities (DTF).  DTFs allow rapid delivery of high quality instruction to Army personnel.  Infrastructure acquired is based on industry standards and complies with the Joint Technical Architecture (JTA) and Defense Information Infrastructure Common Operating Environment (DII COE), where applicable.  This assures compatibility with other military services and that commercial, state, and other resources can be leveraged to achieve cost effective solutions to support all Army components.  

Specific initiatives include Distributive Training Technology Project (DTTP), Other Training Modernization, and the Distributed Learning System (DLS).  DTTP and DLS will provide approximately 549 modern distance learning (DL) enabled DTFs and associated  supporting infrastructure to augment training at existing resident Army schools. Moreover, DLS has fielded 31 Deployed Digital Training Campus (DDTC) to allow training while units are deployed.  This allows Army to both increase the number of Army personnel receiving required training and the amount of training that can be provided to each individual. ATM provides a cost effective solution for training Army personnel. Supported training enhancements will help reduce the current backlog of Military Operational Specialty (MOS) training.  Army can significantly increase levels of MOS qualification, hence readiness, with standardized Army courseware delivered through Distributed Learning (DL) technology.  Implementation of these technology enablers reduce resident training requirements and Soldiers spend less time in the training base and more time in units, thereby increasing readiness.  ATM delivers standardized training to Active Component (AC) and Reserve Component (RC) Soldiers and Department of the Army Civilians (DAC).  The DTTP/DLS provide infrastructure for Soldiers to train at or near their assigned station in lieu of resident training at Army schools.

Other Training Modernization supports the National Technical Nuclear Forensics need for a recurring equipment requirement associated with a radiation sensor capability, including the need to upgrade evolving commercial off the shelf detection assets and supporting equipment.  This equipment is required at the institution in order to meet an evolving training requirement associated with the National Technical Nuclear Forensics-Ground Sampling Mission (NTNF-GSM).  The NTNF-GSM is a supporting mission to the strategic national task 9.1.7 (Support Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Forensics and Attribution).  The NTNF-GSM requires the Army to support an interagency incident investigation; in support of the FBI or lead federal agency (LFA), by performing ground sampling of radiological and nuclear material as directed.  Additionally, this supports the Army Career Tracker (ACT).  ACT is a leader development tool which provides Army personnel the ability to manage their professional development and to monitor progress toward training, education, and career goals.  ACT supports the following Strategic Alignments:  The Army Leader Development Strategy; Army Learning Model; The Army Transition Program; The Army Sponsorship Program; Annex O, Army Campaign Plan: Civilian Workforce Transformation; and HQDA EXORD 054-12 ISO Army Transition mandates that leaders utilize roles in ACT to promote life-long learning and development opportunies throughout the Soldier's lifecycle of service (hire to retire).</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY16 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $9.597 million funds the DLS Enterprise Technology Refreshment (Tech Refresh) program in support of all increments (DTF, EMC, ALMS, and DDTC).  Tech Refresh extends the service life by staying ahead of the obsolescence curve with cost-effective planned technology upgrades, refreshers, and insertions, based on market research and system performance requirements (current and projected).  With the advance of information technology, it is critical that Tech Refresh be maintained to assure continued supportability of the DLS Enterprise and to avoid disruption of Army Training.

FY 2016 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $2.454 million supports system integration and technical refresh for 18 of the Program's 334 DL Classrooms.  Many of the DL Classrooms have workstations, audio/video equipment, and printers that are well past their end of life and need technical refresh to comply with heightened Cybersecurity standards and new network infrastructure to ensure their continued availability and capability to meet current and emerging training and readiness requirements for the ARNG's State and Federal missions.

FY 2016 Base procurement dollars in the amount of 0.038 million supports specialized radiation detection equipment, required by personnel operating complex systems in a safe manner.  Without this equipment, training cannot be accomplished. Annex IV to National Security Planning Directive (NSPD)-17/Homeland Security Planning Directive (HSPD)-4, National Strategy to Combat Weapons of Mass Destruction-National Technical Nuclear Forensics (U-title), dated 14 September 2002, directed the Department of Defense and Other US Government Departments to support NTNF-GSM. Department of Defense Directive (DoD) S-2060.04 DoD Support to the National Technical Nuclear Forensics Program (U-title), 1 April 2009, further tasks Department of the Army to support NTNF-GSM. The US Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) as the US Army proponent for training, doctrine, and force development further delegated those matters concerning NTNF-GSM to the Maneuver Support Center of Excellence (MSCoE) and the US Army Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear School (USACBRNS) National Technical Nuclear Forensics-Ground Sampling Mission.  This is a military-unique capability that can be provided by the Department of Defense to support civil authorities in an incident of national significance. 

All funding goes to the active component.</proc:Justification>

The Army Component instance of DCPDS migrated to the Defense Information Systems Agency Defense Enterprise Computing Center in Denver, Colorado, in 2014, but the requirement for lifecycle replacement of workstations and printers to access the DCPDS data from Army Civilian Personnel Advisory Centers (CPACs) and Civilian Human Resources Agency (CHRA) regions will remain with the Army.  Other enduring Army-unique requirements include life cycle replacement of scanners for input of Civilian Official Personnel File documents into Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Electronic Official Personnel Folder (eOPF) system and automation of the Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) process used to manage the flow of data obtained from DCPDS to Army-unique Civilian HR (CHR) applications such as the Civilian Personnel Online (CPOL) portal and the Fully Automated System for Classification (FASCLASS).  

ARMY ACCESSIONING-INTEGRATED AUTOMATION ARCHITECTURE (AA-IAA):  The AA-IAA encompasses the entire automation support for the Army recruiting, accessioning, and Reserve Officers' Training Corps commissioning missions, which satisfy Army manning and force strength requirements supporting the Warfighter.  The AA-IAA serves as an enabler for Total Army recruiting [Active, Reserve, and Army National Guard (ARNG)], in the public, educational, and commercial sectors, where the accessioning force and future force reside while exchanging data with Army and Department of Defense (DoD) automated personnel systems.  The AA-IAA provides essential automation capabilities to field recruiters, special mission recruiters, and guidance counselors for the Regular Army, Reserves, and ARNG.  It reduces administrative tasks while providing essential data on applicants and newly enlisted Soldiers to leadership.  The AA-IAA facilitates responses to changes from Office of the Secretary of Defense and Department of the Army concerning accessioning business processes.  Operationally it captures applicant information and supports electronic projection of that data and supporting documents.  It also provides Continuity of Operations and disaster recovery for Primary Mission Essential Function applications and databases.  It maintains historical production data, produces management reports, supports the presentation of Army opportunities, and is the sole information source for delivering leads to recruiters.  The AA-IAA also provides the overarching support structure for cyber recruiting and applicant self-processing.

KEYSTONE:  KEYSTONE is an interactive, on-line automated personnel system which supports all components (Active, Reserve, and National Guard) of the Army.  It provides critical support to accession, training, re-enlistment and assignment processes in peace and war.  It supports over 20,000 users worldwide, tracks over 300,000 training seats and maintains military occupational specialty (MOS) skill qualifications, enlistment programs, and assignment/enlistment guarantees.  It maintains historical production data, produces management reports, supports the presentation of Army opportunities, is a source for delivering leads to recruiters, and is the sole information source of reclassification for career counselors.  KEYSTONE also provides Continuity of Operations and disaster recovery for Primary Mission Essential Function applications and databases.  KEYSTONE systems have a direct and visible impact on the Total Army's Personnel End Strength.  This program is linked to RDTE Program Element 0605013A, Project Number T05, Project Title Army Business System Modernization Initiatives.

            <proc:Description>The General Fund Enterprise Business System (GFEBS) is a Major Automated Information System (MAIS)(ACAT-1AC) project that replaces 30+ year-old financial systems including the Standard Finance Systems (STANFINS), Standard Operations and Maintenance, and Army R&amp;D System (SOMARDS). GFEBS is the Dept of the Army's core financial and asset management system for administering its general fund, improving performance, standardizing processes and ensuring future needs are met. GFEBS is a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) System certified by the Chief Financial Officers Council (CFOC).GFEBS is fielded to more than 37,000 trained users at over 227 installations worldwide and is the Army's solution to the current capability gap in accounting and financial management. GFEBS provides improved functionality in general fund core financial functions including: general ledger management; financial reporting; real property, plant, and equipment accountability; reimbursables, revenue, and accounts receivable; cost management; funds control and budgetary accounting; accounts payable; and audit trails and system controls and meets legislative mandates to develop an auditable financial system. The primary objectives for the GFEBS financial management system are to improve performance, standardize business processes, ensure capability exists to meet future needs, and provide Army's decision makers with relevant, reliable, and timely information.

GFEBS-Sensitive Activities (SA) provides a classified version of the GFEBS program developed to process data in a secure environment to protect and manage classified data. GFEBS-SA will integrate seamlessly with GFEBS and provide a secure, web-based, financial asset and accounting management system to Army classified, intelligence, and special access programs.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2016 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $13.540 million supports software and hardware infrastructure upgrades, to bring GFEBS reporting and analytics in line with processing performance thresholds established in the GFEBS Capabilities Production Document(CPD); migration of GFEBS Production, Development, Test, Staging, and Continuity of Operations(COOP) data center environments to the Defense Information Systems Agency(DISA)*; implementation of configuration changes to meet Common Operating Environment(COE) and Core Data Center Technical configuartion standards.

FY 2016 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $5.455 million supports GFEBS-SA system fielding; training, data cleansing, and initial on-site support.

            <proc:Description>The Department of Defense (DoD) High Performance Computing (HPC) Modernization Program, managed by the Army, supports the needs of all services for technological superiority and military dominance on the battlefield by providing advanced computational services to U.S. weapons system scientists and engineers.  By exploiting continuous advances in high performance computing technology, the defense research, development, test and evaluation (RDT&amp;E) community is able to resolve critical scientific and engineering problems quickly and with more precision.  The results of these efforts feed directly into the acquisition process by improving weapons system designs through an increased fundamental understanding of materials, aerodynamics, chemistry, fuels, acoustics, signal image recognition, electromagnetics, and other areas of basic and applied research as well as enabling advanced test and evaluation environments that allow synthetic scene generation, automatic control systems and virtual test environments.  As such, HPC has been identified as a key enabling technology essential to achieving the objectives of the DoD's science and technology (S&amp;T) and test and evaluation (T&amp;E) programs.  The program deploys supercomputers to provide world-class HPC capability to a nation-wide user community.

The HPC Modernization program provides focused modernization efforts crafted to ensure DoD's science and technology and test and evaluation communities are supported with current generation supercomputing capabilities.  The HPC modernization program resulted from congressional language that recognized supercomputing as a national strategic asset and directed the DoD to focus on supercomputing modernization at laboratories and test centers to keep its forces and military systems on the leading technological edge.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2016 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $60.000 million support two large supercomputers for two Army locations, USACE/ERDC DSRC Vicksburg, MS and Army Research Lab (ARL DSRC) Aberdeen, MD. 

FY 2016 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $2.319M will support DoD HPC Project Investments for Army, Navy, and Air Force initiatives requiring unique specifications or computing classification above SECRET.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>The Reserve Component Automation System (RCAS) is an automated information system that provides the capability to administer, manage, and mobilize the Army's Reserve Component (RC) forces more effectively. Specifically, RCAS supports the mobilization planning and unit administration functions of the Army National Guard and Army Reserve by integrating commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware and office automation software, Government off-the-shelf (GOTS) software, and developed functional software applications into a common operating environment, personal computer based architecture.  Since completion of the infrastructure and functional capabilities, system acquisition has been focused on the effective and efficient sustainment of the fielded system and software applications.

RCAS ensures RC soldiers maintain their warfighting systems and proficiencies on the systems by using the system as a "Docking Station" while they are at home station instead of relying on costly satellite usage time.  The program supports the Army and DoD objectives of network convergence to Unified Capabilities and is aligned with the Joint Information Environment initiative by providing the transport infrastructure.

RCAS is the Army's system of choice and record for all RC Commands mobilizing their citizen soldiers for disaster response, homeland security tasking, and overseas deployment.  Established in response to a Government Accountability Office report on the Army Reserve Component's inability to provide timely and accurate mobilization data, the system now dramatically improves the Army's and the states' ability to organize, train, and equip their citizen soldiers, mobilize forces in half the historical time required, and provides resource visibility to state and federal agencies of all forces at home and abroad.  RCAS has been successfully utilized in response to 9/11, Homeland Security missions, National Training exercises, Disaster Relief, and Operation Iraqi Freedom, New Dawn and Enduring Freedom.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2016 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $17.894 million will support refreshment of approximately 11 percent of the RCAS hardware infrastructure, placing the information technology infrastructure refresh on a 9 year cycle. The program will support hardware and software refresh to Army National Guard and U.S. Army Reserve commands and units based on priorities established by the respective Components. The program will satisfy agency information technology mandates with respect to information assurance, net worthiness, server consolidation, and a common operating environment.

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>MULTIMEDIA/VISUAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS PROGRAM (M/VISP):  The M/VISP allows centralization and streamlining delivery of Multimedia/Visual Information (M/VI) products and services to reduce overall operating expenses while expanding M/VI services.  This program provides equipment and systems for recording, producing, reproducing, processing, broadcasting, editing, distributing, exhibiting, and storing M/VI products and services to support official requirements (i.e. official photos for promotions, graphic charts, large format prints, audiovisual presentation support, television production, and documentation services essential to recording the history of the Army).  Requirements include command and control, training, education, logistics, medical, personnel, special operations, engineering, public affairs, and intelligence to convey accurate information to the Soldier, decision-maker, and supporting organizations.  The M/VISP established the Visual Information Ordering Site (VIOS) program as the enterprise solution for common user IT M/VI services.  The VIOS program provides the capability for M/VI managers to monitor, assign, and perform quality control on M/VI services and products which support national strategic communications objectives, commander decision making, and training for all regions, missions and functions of the Army, OSD, JCS and HQDA.  The VIOS is the authoritative database to manage the installation M/VI program and is used to generate M/VI work orders and collect M/VI IT metrics in support of the Army's IT Metric Program and the Installation Status Report (ISR).</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>This budget line supports the procurement and upgrade of the Automated Integrated Survey Instrument (AISI), Digital Levels and Global Positioning System - Survey (GPS-S).  This equipment supports the survey mission of both the Topographic and Construction Engineer.  Capabilities provided by this equipment enable engineers to establish the geodetic control necessary to support Artillery (e.g., placement of weapons platforms), Aviation (e.g., aircraft registration, safety surveys) and Topographic support. GPS-S integrates Selective Availability, Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM) and Precise Positioning System GPS software upgrades into a Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) GPS for military survey applications. Additionally, this equipment supports Construction Engineering surveys (e.g., roads, buildings, logistics sites, staging areas, airfield construction).  Software functionality, included as part of this procurement, allows the user to accomplish the design work necessary for site design and construction (e.g., materiel calculations, labor, resources).

GPS-Survey Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) = 364
GPS-S Hardware and Software are Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) and Government Off the Shelf (GOTS) procurements.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>This program provides funding to the Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) to establish, modernize, expand or replace test facilities used in production testing of Communications and Electronic equipment.  It sustains Army production test capabilities through upgrade and replacement of instrumentation and equipment that is technologically and/or economically obsolete. Modernization of test instrumentation and equipment provides increased automation and efficiencies, improved data quality and quantity and cost avoidances to Army Program Managers.  Programmed funding will be used to upgrade or replace production test instrumentation and equipment at the Electronic Proving Ground (EPG), Fort Huachuca, AZ.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2016 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $0.425 million supports the ongoing modernization of EPG's Global Positioning System (GPS) testing lab to the new military signal standards.  It will purchase two differential GPS receivers for ground truth, upgrade GPS transmitter system and upgrade GPS data collection software to collect and analyze new coded data blocks.  The majority of the instrumentation being upgraded or replaced is obsolete and has met or exceeded its economic life.  This instrumentation is required to ensure complete and accurate test data is collected and safety and environmental hazards are minimized.  Benefits of this project include increased test efficiencies and decreased costs and risks to Army Program Managers.

            <proc:Description>Brigade Combat Team (BCT) Emerging Technologies provides funding for the procurement of Network Integration Evaluation (NIE) evaluated and Army approved commodities (hardware and software) and installation of these network enhancements onto Brigade Combat Team (BCT) vehicle platforms.  These funds provide for the procurement and installation of hardware/software products/components, which are not a part of a current Program of Record (POR) and have been evaluated and approved through the Army's Agile NIE process for inclusion into the Army's Capability Sets (CS) Synchronized Fielding plan.  Hardware/software products/component include the tested and approved system, vehicle mounting  hardware (A-Kits), and ancillary equipment such as power amplifiers/splitters, GPS units, loudspeakers, routers, and battery isolators, filters, cables, connectors, AC inverters, utility outlets, environmental control units (ECU), fans, thermal &amp; power switches, diplexers, and antennas.

This program is a new start in FY 2016.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2016 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $7.438 million procures Network hardware/software products/components and associated vehicle mounting equipment (A-Kits) to meet Army emerging requirements for the Synchronized Integrated Fielding process in support of CS 16 and 17 fieldings depending on the length of the final Non-Reoccurring Engineering (NRE) and production timeline.  These Network Improvements are designed to close Army gaps in support of the Army's Force 2025 Network Goals.

These hardware/software products will be acquired either through existing Army contracts and/or production options that are established as part of the NIE DP3 approval process.  A-Kits and installation services will be acquired through established contracts with the vehicle manufacturers or integrators.

The exact procurement requirements are defined upone completion of each NIE, when all hardware/software products have gone through the evaluation and approval process.  CS 16 and 17 request is based upon the results of planning for and executing CS 13 and 14; ASA(ALT) fielded four (4) IBCTs in CS 13 and will field six (6) IBCTs, two (2) SBCTs and one (1) Division HQ in CS 14.
