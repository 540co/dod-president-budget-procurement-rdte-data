                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>DCMA is positioned as a unique, independent enterprise that provides DoD with capabilities not found in the Component Services, or anywhere else within Government.  In accordance with the President’s Management Agenda (PMA), DoD’s Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) “Six Areas of Focus”, and the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), DCMA is seeking to adapt, reshape and rebalance to prepare for the strategic challenges and opportunities we face in the years ahead.  As the independent eyes and ears of the DoD, national and international partners, DCMA is continually delivering actionable acquisition insight.  Adherence to Better Buying Power (BBP) 2.0 initiatives, such as controlling costs throughout the product lifecycle, incentivizing productivity, and improving tradecraft in acquisition of services, are ensuring affordability and increasing productivity.  Application of improved supply chain management directives and superior price-costing strategies will eliminate requirements imposed on industry where costs outweigh benefits.  The intent is to work with industry to collect data that will enable the Department to identify requirements that can be reduced or eliminated to reduce cost without adversely affecting performance.  Better understanding of the commercial sector will allow the Agency to properly exploit its benefits while protecting government interests.  Furthermore, we are invigorating our efforts to adjust to the changing environment through achieving and sustaining audit readiness, creating an agile and flexible learning organization/culture to support future customer programs, initiating and strengthening acquisition processes and optimizing mission execution to support the acquisition enterprise through agile business practices. 
 
DCMA’s mission is to provide Contract Administration Services (CAS) to the Department of Defense (DoD) Acquisition Enterprise and its partners to ensure delivery of quality products and services to the warfighter; on time and on cost. DCMA has two primary objectives, 1) providing CAS to the military services and other authorized customers worldwide and 2) providing contingency contract support in theater.  The Agency has worldwide acquisition impact through three Field Directorates (Operations, International, and Special Programs). The Agency's Field Directorates are regionally based. The Agency's civilian and military personnel manages over 20,063 contractors and approximately 348,000 active contracts.  

DCMA is executing a strategy to modernize and consolidate all web-based applications in concert with a new Enterprise Architecture framework that adheres strictly to the Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA). Investing in newer modern technologies that utilize business process driven frameworks will greatly improve not only the quality of the DCMA contract information but allow DCMA to realize internal process efficiencies. The web-based capabilities support DCMA's unique mission and provide cross functional capabilities that support the full range of acquisition and contract management. These capabilities help DCMA acquisition workforce access real time data; thus, enabling them to make sound contract management and business decisions. The objective behind web-based capabilities is to provide mission-effective and efficient solutions to unique sets of problems that slow down or hinder performance based contract management for DCMA and other DoD support components. 

FY 2014 Actual:  In FY 2014 ($13.812)  DCMA reengineered some of DCMA’s Contract Administration and Line of Service business processes and the toolsets that provide these capabilities. We streamlinedd business processes and consolidated toolsets that enable those capabilities to reduce operations and sustainment costs for the Department and where applicable for DCMA.  

FY 2015-2016 Plan:  In FY 2015 ($12.530) and FY 2016 ($12.542) DCMA is planning to capitalize on Information Technology (IT) investment innovations that leverage technology to achieve an agile enterprise architecture that equips the Agency with enhanced IT solutions for mission support operations and gives Agency decision-makers better data to compare options, provide ready analytic solutions, allocate resources, and improve processes.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>DCMA is positioned as a unique, independent enterprise that provides DoD with capabilities not found in the Component Services, or anywhere else within Government.  In accordance with the President’s Management Agenda (PMA), DoD’s Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) “Six Areas of Focus”, and the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), DCMA is seeking to adapt, reshape and rebalance to prepare for the strategic challenges and opportunities we face in the years ahead.  As the independent eyes and ears of the DoD, national and international partners, DCMA is continually delivering actionable acquisition insight.  Adherence to Better Buying Power (BBP) 2.0 initiatives, such as controlling costs throughout the product lifecycle, incentivizing productivity, and improving tradecraft in acquisition of services, are ensuring affordability and increasing productivity.  Application of improved supply chain management directives and superior price-costing strategies will eliminate requirements imposed on industry where costs outweigh benefits.  The intent is to work with industry to collect data that will enable the Department to identify requirements that can be reduced or eliminated to reduce cost without adversely affecting performance.  Better understanding of the commercial sector will allow the Agency to properly exploit its benefits while protecting government interests.  Furthermore, we are invigorating our efforts to adjust to the changing environment through achieving and sustaining audit readiness, creating an agile and flexible learning organization/culture to support future customer programs, initiating and strengthening acquisition processes and optimizing mission execution to support the acquisition enterprise through agile business practices. 
 
DCMA’s mission is to provide Contract Administration Services (CAS) to the Department of Defense (DoD) Acquisition Enterprise and its partners to ensure delivery of quality products and services to the warfighter; on time and on cost. DCMA has two primary objectives, 1) providing CAS to the military services and other authorized customers worldwide and 2) providing contingency contract support in theater.  The Agency has worldwide acquisition impact through three Field Directorates (Operations, International, and Special Programs). The Agency's Field Directorates are regionally based. The Agency's civilian and military personnel manages over 20,063 contractors and approximately 348,000 active contracts.  

DCMA is executing a strategy to modernize and consolidate all web-based applications in concert with a new Enterprise Architecture framework that adheres strictly to the Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA). Investing in newer modern technologies that utilize business process driven frameworks will greatly improve not only the quality of the DCMA contract information but allow DCMA to realize internal process efficiencies. The web-based capabilities support DCMA's unique mission and provide cross functional capabilities that support the full range of acquisition and contract management. These capabilities help DCMA acquisition workforce access real time data; thus, enabling them to make sound contract management and business decisions. The objective behind web-based capabilities is to provide mission-effective and efficient solutions to unique sets of problems that slow down or hinder performance based contract management for DCMA and other DoD support components.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                        <r2:Description>We are engaging with our Service Acquisition Executives to collaborate earlier in the acquisition process to ensure requirements are defined with well written entry and exit criteria, testing requirements defined, technical data addressed and risk addressed.  DCMA participation earlier in the acquisition life cycle process provides clearer requirements for execution and sustainment, reduces life cycle costs and supports better buying power.

Software development continues to be one of the main cost drivers for cost overruns.  Our in plant presence allows us to perform oversight and analysis of existing software development to include emerging critical focus areas of agile software and technology processes and leaning forward to address cybersecurity and information assurance concerns.  Our independent in-plant insight into contractor processes provides a unique acquisition insight service to our DoD customers to ensure contractor compliance in program development.  We see DCMA as a key role in mission assurance surveillance and the surveillance of complex software and network systems to support DoD initiatives. This is integral to better buying power.</r2:Description>

                                                                <r2:Text>DCMA developed solutions for using enterprise actionable data in a mobile environment. Also, continued the migration of Integrated Workload Management System (IWMS) and DCMA 360, which provides an integrated suite of DCMA collaborative web-applications.  It will be a major focus in the future as well and the development of an Enterprise Surveillance Plan tool that will analyze technical requirements and contract risk, and determine surveillance requirement.   

Also, DCMA enhanced its modification and Delivery Order System and implemented the Procurement Data Standardization (PDS).  PDS is a system-agnostic data standard that is intended to be adopted and implemented DoD-wide for creation, translation, processing, and sharing of procurement actions. It defines the minimum requirements for contract writing system output to improve visibility and accuracy of contract-related data.  Also, it supports interoperability of DoD acquisition systems; and standardizes and streamlines the procure-to-pay business process.  Further, the PDS will improve visibility of contract-related data, enabling senior DoD leadership to make better informed business decisions.  And finally, this data standard will support future migration to enterprise and federal systems and processes where appropriate. 

DCMA worked in concert with the Defense Procurement Acquisition Policy (DPAP) contract on building a contract file structure within IWMS by improving: Storage Taxonomy and Standardization; Contract Administration Business Processes and efficiency; and filing of electronic contract documents.  DCMA has engaged DPAP and plans on utilizing the Distributed Virtual Electronic File structure as a basis for storing the electronic files.  The IWMS effort will help DPAP and the Department: avoid redundancy, establish master documentation sources; automate document processing, and clarify records retention.

DCMA was engaged in DPAP PDS XML to ANSI X12 Mapping. DPAP requested assistance from DCMA to test and validate a data translation capability that converts data exchanged between Contract Writing Systems (CWSs) and Mechanization Of Contract Administration Services (MOCAS) into the PDS format, further promoting the integration of contract data and interoperability of related CAS systems across the DoD enterprise. This capability will significantly reduce the number of data translation mappings DCMA currently sustains on behalf of our MOCAS trading partners, further streamlining Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) transmissions of awards and modifications into MOCAS, reducing the cost of manual processing invoices into MOCAS.

Additionally, DCMA supported SeaPort CWS (EDI) Development and Certification. DCMA provided technical support to the Navy to develop, test and deploy EDI translation maps for SeaPort, one of several Navy CWSs that award and administer contracts for the Department.  Prior to DCMAs involvement, the Seaport system was not capable or certified to transmit awards and modifications via EDI to MOCAS, causing the Navy to pay a much higher manual rate for payment of invoices. Development and certification was completed in early FY 2014, the Navy projects a savings of $800K annually.

Further, DCMA streamlined and improved communication processes and interfaces in the areas of Contract Administration Services improving data exchange across the DoD Acquisition Enterprise.</r2:Text>

Our goal is to streamline business processes and consolidate toolsets that enable those capabilities to reduce operations and sustainment costs for the Department and where applicable for DCMA.  In order to accomplish this goal DCMA will need to invest in the research, purchase, and development of the new capabilities.

In addition DCMA is capitalizing on Information Technology (IT) investment innovations that leverage technology to achieve an agile enterprise architecture that equips the Agency with enhanced IT solutions for mission support operations and gives Agency decision-makers better data to compare options, provide ready analytic solutions, allocate resources, and improve processes.  

Also, in conjunction with DPAP and Performance Assessments and Root Cause Analyses (PARCA) we plan to improve the quality of analytical and predictive information (and reduce direct impact to programs) by standardizing business processes and capabilities.  The Analytic Information Management System (AIMS) effort will: standardize compliance assessment methodologies, tools, processes, and technologies; establish a guideline assessment wizard to ensure these attributes are examined in a repeatable process and return consistent results; implement business intelligence, analytics, and a single data repository to improve insight into operations performance across the Acquisition enterprise; improve detection of Earned Value Management System (EVMS) non-compliance; and establish a consolidated view of all compliance and performance data, from the same source system.</r2:Text>

                                                <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>DCMA is invigorating efforts to adjust to the changing environment through achieving and sustaining audit readiness, creating an agile and flexible learning organization/culture to support future customer programs, initiating and strengthening acquisition processes and optimizing mission execution to support the acquisition enterprise through agile business practices.  

As a part of our strategy and business practices, DCMA directly supports Better Buying Power (BBP) 2.0 initiatives, such as controlling costs throughout the product lifecycle, incentivizing productivity, an improving tradecraft in acquisition of services.  Critical among BBP initiatives are should-cost and affordability.  DCMA’s expertise in these areas has enabled unprecedented savings and cost avoidance.  In an environment of declining resources, this pricing talent will be a valuable asset in ensuring the Government only pays its fair share of company costs.  

Additionally, in pursuing these business practices we are continuing to utilize contractors to perform specialized functions such as software development and testing.  A number of mini-competitions are held with Federal Supply Schedule, Government Wide Acquisition Contracts, and DCMA Basic Purchasing Agreement Vendors.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Established by Executive Order, with policy oversight by the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense/Readiness (Training Readiness and Strategy), this program (1) Identifies, assesses, develops, and provides guidance on standards for instructional software and associated services used by Federal agencies, international partners, and contractors; (2) Conducts research on the ways these organizations can harness the power of learning technologies, such as computer-based and online courseware, training games, virtual worlds, mobile technology, intelligent tutors, and other emerging learning technologies to provide high-quality, easily accessible, adaptable, and cost-effective education and training.  The ADL Initiative efforts reduce costs by reducing the need for face-to-face instruction, by increasing interoperability--which enables discovery, retrieval, and reuse of distributed learning content--and by researching and prototyping methods of distributed learning with superior motivational and learning outcomes.  ADL past work resulted in the development of a Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM), the current de facto internationally accepted standard and specification for distributed learning interoperability.  SCORM is mandated for all Department of Defense (DoD) agencies through DoD Instruction 1322.26.  ADL provides support for users of SCORM, and is also working in collaboration with the Services, other government agencies, industry, and our international partners to develop the next generation training learning architecture (TLA).  The TLA is aimed at modernizing the way we learn by facilitating learning experiences that take advantage of current and emerging technologies based on new specifications and standards built upon web services.  With respect to researching and prototyping new methods of distributed learning, ADL is conducting projects on intelligent tutoring and serious game for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM), as well as projects aimed at supporting life-long learning, in the form of a personal assistant for learning (PAL).  The PAL is an advanced concept research effort to provide a ubiquitous, tailored training and learning capability.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The ADL Initiative efforts reduce costs by reducing the need for face-to-face instruction, by increasing interoperability--which enables discovery, retrieval, and reuse of distributed learning content--and by researching and prototyping methods of distributed learning with superior motivational and learning outcomes.  ADL past work resulted in the development of a Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM), the current de facto internationally accepted standard and specification for distributed learning interoperability.  SCORM is mandated for all Department of Defense (DoD) agencies through DoD Instruction 1322.26.  ADL provides support for users of SCORM, and is also working in collaboration with the Services, other government agencies, industry, and our international partners to develop the next generation training learning architecture (TLA).  The TLA is aimed at modernizing the way we learn by facilitating learning experiences that take advantage of current and emerging technologies based on new specifications and standards built upon web services.  With respect to researching and prototyping new methods of distributed learning, ADL is conducting projects on intelligent tutoring and serious game for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM), as well as projects aimed at supporting life-long learning, in the form of a personal assistant for learning (PAL).  The PAL is an advanced concept research effort to provide a ubiquitous, tailored training and learning capability.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Department of Defense Human Resources Activity (DHRA) is a DoD-wide Field Activity chartered to support the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness (USD (P&amp;R)).  HSPD-12 requires rapid electronic authentication for all Government employees, uniformed individuals and contractors. The Defense Enrollment and Eligibility System will provide Enterprise capability for the cardholder data repository, common Access interface to multiple types of Access control hardware, common Access software, the ability to control Access to multiple facilities through one authoritative data source, and provide the standards and data to/form and power efficient gates. Implement Enterprise Access control data for the DoD while providing standards and reducing redundancy. RDT&amp;E funding will be expended to develop the secure interfaces necessary to work with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and first responders for Enterprise authentication. Many systems support different aspects of electronic authentication across the Department. RDT&amp;E will allow for the pursuit of a potential solution that will interface disparate applications/systems. This will increase Government efficiency by rapidly verifying electronically the identity of an individual and can be used by many applications, reduce identity fraud, protect privacy by limiting information stored, and increase privacy processes to maintain Access controls, thereby facilitating identification of first responders</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

HSPD-12 requires rapid electronic authentication for all Government employees, uniformed individuals and contractors. The Defense Enrollment and Eligibility System will provide Enterprise capability for the cardholder data repository, common Access interface to multiple types of Access control hardware, common Access software, the ability to control Access to multiple facilities through one authoritative data source, and provide the standards and data to/form and power efficient gates. Implement Enterprise Access control data for the DoD while providing standards and reducing redundancy. RDT&amp;E funding will be expended to develop the secure interfaces necessary to work with the FBI and first responders for Enterprise authentication. Many systems support different aspects of electronic authentication across the Department. RDT&amp;E will allow for the pursuit of a potential solution that will interface disparate applications/systems. This will increase Government efficiency by rapidly verifying electronically the identity of an individual and can be used by many applications, reduce identity fraud, protect
privacy by limiting information stored, and increase privacy processes to maintain Access controls, thereby facilitating identification of first responders.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Department of Defense Human Resources Activity (DHRA) is a DoD-wide Field Activity chartered to support the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness (USD (P&amp;R)).  This PE includes application of R&amp;D to expedite prototype development and mission support efforts to sustain and/or modernize operations required for general RDT&amp;E.

Project 1:  DoD Enlistment Processing and Testing. The project administers testing programs, which enable the Armed Services to select highly qualified military recruits. The DoD uses a single test, the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB), to determine eligibility of military applicants and to report recruit quality data to Congress. High quality recruits are obtained from administering the ASVAB annually to approximately 600,000 applicants for Military Service as part of the DoD Enlistment Testing program, and to 1 million students in the DoD Student Testing program. Each Service also uses ASVAB test forms developed in this program as part of their in-service testing programs. New ASVAB test forms and related support materials are implemented approximately every four years. This allows DoD to make measurement improvements as well as decrease the likelihood of test compromise. Ongoing RDT&amp;E efforts include development and evaluation of procedures which (1) reduce or eliminate threats to the validity of the ASVAB test scores generated; (2) improve the efficiency of the test development, calibration, and validation process; and (3) improve selection and classification decisions made by each Service through more effective use of test score information. In addition, periodic assessments are required to provide DoD manpower planners and Congress with information on aptitude trends in the population from which recruits are drawn.

Project 2:  Human Resources Automation Enhancements.  DCPDS is the Department’s enterprise civilian human resources (HR) transactional system supporting 800,000 employees, representing approximately one-third of the federal government’s civilian work force. DCPDS has proven its business case, avoiding costs for the Department of over $200M/year when compared to the multiple DoD Component operational costs prior to establishment of the enterprise system.  The consolidation of all instances of DCPDS at the DDC completed in 2014 has resulted in substantial component savings.  In FY 15/16, additional data center consolidation will include additional HRIT Enterprise systems moving to the DDC.

Network and system operations span worldwide, with 24/7 operations that support 19 Regional Service Centers and over 300 Customer Support Units. DCPDS completed its upgrade to the Hewlett Packard Blade architecture for all database servers in 2014. The current focus of DCPDS is the expansion of these efficiencies through the consolidation of DCPDS operations to a single data center, where DCPDS enterprise operations and all DoD customer regional operations will be located at the Lockheed Martin Denver Data Center.. (Army and Air Force relocated in FY14 and focus has now turned to .) 

Other DCPAS programs supporting the civilian workforce include minimizing involuntary separations, assisting laid-off workers, maintaining workforce balance, and reducing the costs of DoD's workers and unemployment compensation via the Defense Injury and Unemployment Compensation System (DIUCS). DHRA/DCPAS supports the development, issuance and maintenance of uniform DoD-wide civilian personnel policy; provides program guidance and technical interpretation for both appropriated and non-appropriated funded civilian HR programs ; manages DoD's Civilian Assistance and Re-Employment (CARE) program, including the Priority Placement Program (PPP); investigates and mediates discrimination complaints; conducts grievance investigations; and manages the operation of the enterprise civilian HR information system, DCPDS. These programs are supported by an aggressive data automation program, to include a communications capability, computing equipment, and an automation software link to standardize these divergent functions. These funds continue to support these processes.

Project 3: NEO Tracking System.  The Non-Combatant Evacuation Operations (NEO)Tracking System (NTS) / Emergency Tracking Accountability System (ETAS) is a certified and accredited DoD automated system that accounts for, and sustains visibility of noncombatant evacuees during a NEO under the authority of DODD 1000.25, DoD Personnel Identity Protection (PIP) Program. NTS is currently being used in the USAFRICOM, USCENTCOM, USEUCOM, USSOUTHCOM, and USPACOM Area of Responsibility. The ETAS component is the CONUS domestic version of NTS and is for use by USNORTHCOM during disasters in the CONUS whether natural, accidental, or acts of terrorism. The primary purpose of the NTS/ETAS is to provide individual accountability of the evacuee by creating and maintaining a database of evacuees assembled during an evacuation operation and subsequently tracking the evacuees' movement throughout the evacuation process.  Minor growth from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is attributed to research and development supporting the integration of the Enterprise Identity Attribute Service and the Organization Unique Identifiers in this family of systems that provides secure attribute based access control.

Project 4:  Synchronized Pre-deployment and Operational Tracker Enterprise Suite (SPOT-ES).  SPOT-ES is the Department of Defense (DoD) system of record for accountability and visibility of contracts and contractor personnel authorized to operate in a contingency operation.  SPOT-ES provides web based tracking and visibility into contract services, personnel and equipment locations; provides a common operational picture for Combatant Commanders; enhances the analytical tools to accurately plan for the quantity of contracted support required for future contingency operations; and collects accurate data for the Office of Management and Budget-directed quarterly census of all contractors supporting contingency operations.  Minor growth from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is attributed to development and integration of more rugged and transportable Automatic Identification Technologies that facilitates person accountability and property tracking and accountability of the NTS.

Project 5:  ESGR Awards &amp; Activty Tracking (AATR) Tool.  Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve (ESGR) requires a comprehensive web-based application (Awards and Activity Tracking and Reporting) to track ESGR Activities to include briefings and recognition of civilian employers and briefings of National Guard and Reserve that will track against organizational goals vs. costs and the hours donated by Volunteers.  The application will replace several manual processes that use Microsoft Excel spreadsheets across 54 State Committees and through contractor support.  This will also place all critical data in a DoD Data Center.  Development of a web-based application would immensely improve data collection and analysis while allowing field staff and volunteers to better focus on operations and mission accomplishment.  The application would be an addition to ESGR’s current Portal that contains ESGR’s member management, inquiry and case management, and freedom award nomination systems.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Civilian HR automation enhancements planned for FY 2015 and FY 2016 are focused on software development to support the Department’s civilian workforce, including  a DoD-Wide performance management system; enhancement of employee competency assessment capability; modernization of injury and unemployment compensation case management;  and EEO investigations case management.  In addition, changes to DCPDS are required for mandates for the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), HR Line of Business (LoB), electronic Official Personnel Folder, and Retirement Systems Modernization implementation. DoD is one of five designated Shared Service Centers in the federal  government focused on providing standard services across agency lines, gaining potential significant business and cost-saving benefits. DoD is considered a leader in this initiative. 

DCPDS is the Department’s enterprise civilian HR system that has provided the savings originally projected in the achievement of full operational capability in 2002 and which has continued to operate as the DoD system serving over 800,000 employee records. Additional initiatives to sustain the Department’s lead in automated systems include expansion of employee self service functionality, and support for data warehouse improvements, engineering plans for consolidation and migration to a federal data center, an employee-manager portal, and information assurance initiatives to comply with DoD-mandated DMZ requirements. DCPDS enhancements will support the Department’s focus on the further consolidation of civilian HR operations to a single operational site, with linkage to Component operations worldwide.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

NTS is currently being used in the USAFRICOM, USCENTCOM, USEUCOM, USSOUTHCOM, and USPACOM AORs. The ETAS component is the CONUS domestic version of NTS and is for use by USNORTHCOM during disasters in the CONUS whether natural, accidental, or acts of terrorism. The primary purpose of the NTS/ETAS is to provide individual accountability of the evacuee by creating and maintaining a database of evacuees assembled during an evacuation operation and subsequently tracking the evacuees’ movement through the evacuation process.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Advanced IT Services Joint Program Office (AITS-JPO) identifies and integrates new and mature commercial information technology (IT) and advanced operational concepts into net-centric battlespace capabilities to access and exchange critical information; exploit opportunities to enhance current force capabilities; and project future force IT requirements. AITS-JPO supports preparing for future joint force and coalition initiatives through developing and integrating a full range of data services and advanced IT applications to support cooperative activities between the US and its coalition partners. These emergent capabilities are technologies that can be rapidly infused into existing tools.  

The program uses three key mechanisms to streamline the process of fielding emergent requirements: (1) Joint Capability Technology Demonstrations (JCTDs) with the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD)/Combatant Commands (COCOMs)/Services/Agency; (2) Joint Ventures with COCOMs/Program of Record (POR); and (3) Risk Mitigation Pilots with POR/Community of Interest. The JCTD process aligns with the revised Joint Capability Integration and Development System process, developed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, by adapting technology and concept solutions to meet pressing warfighter needs. OSD approves new JCTDs annually and on a rolling start basis.  Defense Information Systems Agency participates in both a technical and transition manager role.  The JCTDs and the Joint Ventures and risk mitigation pilots use a teaming approach thereby sharing costs and reducing the risk to individual organizations.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:SummaryExplanation>The decrease of -$0.070 in FY 2014 is due to a reduction in the number of OSD approved JCTDs. 

The decrease of -$0.030 in FY 2015 is due to a reduction in the number of OSD approved JCTDs. 

The decrease of -$2.530 in FY 2016 is due to a change in DoD policy where the JCTD process will be used to satisfy seven OSD identified technology problem areas.  Due to this policy change, there is a reduction in the number of long-term JCTDs (18-48 months) with the program moving towards rapid delivery of technical capabilities with Emerging Capability Technology Demonstrations (ECTDs).  ECTDs are shorter in duration (12-36 months) and provide faster delivery of capability to mission partners (-$2.000).  The remaining -$0.530 is due to support DISA equities such as a development environment that can be leveraged to minimize the initial capital required to establish infrastructures to performing mobile application development and software experimentation.  With modernization of infrastructures through virtualization, there are IT efficiencies that can be realized to perform tasks simpler, faster, and more repeatable.  In addition, OCTO will look for partnerships with other interested parties to fund projects together thereby reducing the funding required to implement projects.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

These Leading Edge products provide the Department of Defense (DoD) and National Senior Leaders, (e.g., the President of the United States, Secretary of Defense, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Combatant Commanders, as well as inter-agency participants) with critical focus on long-term collaboration, planning and information sharing. The Leading Edge technology pilots support future joint and coalition initiatives by developing and integrating a range of data services and advanced IT applications. These emergent capabilities are technologies that can be rapidly infused into existing tools for use by the US and coalition partners.
  
Program investments in advanced technology benefit strategic and tactical users in the intelligence, warfighting and business domains by providing them with reliable, persistent collaboration, and networking technologies including computing-on-demand to reduce the need to replicate data or services at the point of consumption. Investments also provide support for virtual end-user environments and semantic search capabilities which enhance the decision-making process. These capabilities provide the warfighter with technical superiority and to achieve interoperability and integration, while working in concert with joint, allied and coalition forces to effectively counter terrorism and enhance homeland security defense. 

The program is further divided into major subprogram areas:  Command and Control (C2) and Combat Support (CS), Information Sharing (IS), Network Infrastructure (NI), Network Operations (NetOps), Cyber Threat Discovery and Program Management Support.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Will provide engineering investigation and support for desktop virtualization, thin client environments, mobility service and enterprise service.

The decrease of -$0.476 from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to the change in DoD policy where the JCTD process will now be used to satisfy seven OSD identified technology problem areas.  Because of this shift, there is a reduction in the number of longer-term JCTDs (18-48 months) with the program moving towards rapid delivery of technical capabilities with Emerging Capability Technology Demonstrations (ECTDs).  ECTDs are shorter in duration (12-36 months) and provide faster delivery of capability to mission partners.</r2:Text>

Market research during the acquisition process includes a review of DISA contracts, other DoD contract vehicles, and other Government agency contracts which are advertised for Government-wide usage.  This market research also includes consideration of small businesses including, minority/women owned (8A) businesses, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, mentor/protégé and other specialized contract vehicles and processes.  It evaluates all contractors available from DISA sources for their ability to deliver the products specifically required for the unique program efforts.  The program works collaboratively with vendors to obtain generic cost data for planning and analysis purposes.  Past and current contract prices for similar work and other government-wide agency contracts provide additional sources of information.  Quotes from multiple sources help provide averages for more realistic cost estimates.  DISA makes a concerted effort to award many of its contracts to small businesses.  Additionally, many of the DISA contracts are awarded with multiple option periods. These have the benefit of fixing labor costs over an extended period and minimizing the administrative costs associated with re-issuing short-term contracts. CTO reviews existing contract vehicles and the number of contracts to minimize administrative overhead.  Instead of individual contracts for program management, business line improvement, asset management, and financial management, there is now one small business program services contract that provides services across DISA.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

For JCTDs/ECTDs, the program office develops an Implementation Directive and Management Plan. These guidance documents outline the project objectives, schedule, and funding for the JCTD/ECTDs. Military utility will be assessed by each JCTD/ECTD to develop and document the detailed objectives. The Operational Sponsor (a COCOM) will evaluate the process and measure results. For technology investigation and piloting, DISA CTO uses standard operating procedures for identifying objectives and metrics. Key metrics used include: utility of technology, time to delivery of technologies to the field, percentage of improvement in transition of technologies, and percentage of improvement in collaborative efforts with other Science and Technology organizations. See below for specific metrics:

1.  Metric: JCTDs/ECTDs provide rapid capabilities to the warfighter that address urgent COCOM needs.  Metrics include: time of delivery of technology to the field and     utility of technology.

     Measure/Goal:  Number of approved JCTDs/ECTDs with CTO as the Technical Manager and the number of JCTDs/ECTDs pending approval with CTO as TM.

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Global Combat Support System - Joint (GCSS-J), is a key enabler for achieving Focused Logistics and is essential during peace, contingency, crisis, and war in support of the joint warfighter across the full range of military operations. GCSS-J, the Logistics System of Record, provides a Joint Logistics Common Operational Picture to ensure the right personnel, equipment, supplies, and support are in the right place at the right time and in the right quantities to mobilize, move, and sustain all elements of operating forces within a theater or operational area. 

GCSS-J gathers data from authoritative sources to provide a fused, integrated, near real-time, multidimensional view of combat support and combat service support across joint capability areas. These efforts provide situational awareness of the battlespace and logistics pipeline (e.g., supply, deployment and distribution, engineering, etc.). Using GCSS-J, the joint logistics warfighter no longer needs to log into multiple legacy systems and manually gather data to compile reports. GCSS-J provides real time actionable information in the form of watchboards (e.g., fuels and munitions watchboards) and near real time information in the form of reports and mapping visualizations.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

GCSS-J, the Logistics' System of Record, provides a Joint Logistics Common Operational Picture (JLogCOP), ensuring the right personnel, equipment, supplies, and support are in the right place, at the right time, and in the right quantities across the full spectrum of military operations. 

GCSS-J gathers data from authoritative sources to provide fused, integrated, near real-time multidimensional view of combat support and combat service support across joint capability areas. These efforts provide situational awareness of the battlespace and logistics pipeline (e.g., Supply, Deployment and Distribution, Engineering, etc.). Using GCSS-J, the joint logistics warfighter no longer needs to log into multiple legacy systems and manually gather data to compile reports.  GCSS-J provides real-time in the form of reports and mapping visualizations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The PMO maximizes the use of performance-based contracts and requires contractors to establish and manage specific earned value data to mitigate risk and monitor deviations from cost, schedule, and performance objectives. The PMO evaluates performance by conducting thorough Post-award Contract Reviews, monthly Contract Performance Reviews, and bi-monthly In-Process Reviews.  

The PMO uses a Statement of Objectives (SOO) for development efforts rather than the traditional Statement of Work, as it provides potential offerors flexibility to develop cost-effective solutions and the opportunity to propose innovative alternatives to meet GCSS-J requirements. By stating the requirements in a SOO, the contractor can produce a technical solution methodology to deliver leading edge technology to the warfighter.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                                                <r2:PerformanceMetrics>GCSS-J fields capabilities based on functional priorities of the Combatant Command 129 Requirements Document as approved and prioritized by the functional sponsor, Joint Staff J4. These requirements and goals are translated into releases with specific capabilities, which have established cost, schedule, and performance parameters approved by the DISA's Component Acquisition Executive/Milestone Decision Authority.  

Metrics and requirements are routinely gathered by the GCSS-J PMO. The metrics from the strategic server sites are analyzed by the PMO to ensure that operational mission threads continue to be met and if system enhancement/capabilities are of benefiting the user. Future capabilities include tools that allow GCSS-J to refine and enhance the type of performance metrics that can be gathered and analyzed. These tools become increasingly important as GCSS-J continues to integrate additional data sources and external applications, which allows GCSS-J to continue to transition to a Service Oriented Architecture and directly supports DoD's net-centric vision of exposing and consuming web services. As GCSS-J usage increases and new capabilities are fielded, performance metrics will ensure that the system is meeting user requirements.

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), through the Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC), manages the Department’s Interoperability Test, Evaluation, and Certification process that is structured to provide meaningful and independent test results in order to increase stakeholder confidence.  The objectives, of the Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) activities, are to validate that DISA’s (and the Department’s, where appropriate) deliverables have met operational requirements.  The T&amp;E activities target evaluation strategies in the design, development, operational, integration and/or sustainment aspects of every program requiring support.  DISA’s T&amp;E efforts span a variety of test categories supporting DISA’s delivery of Department-wide enterprise solutions as well as Service, Agency, and mission partner developmental, operational, Information Assurance, and interoperability testing, validation and certification efforts. These efforts are focused on T&amp;E for Information Technology (IT) that includes the Joint Information Environment (JIE), Cyber, Cloud services, and Mobility. 

As the Department of Defense (DoD) Joint Interoperability Certification Authority, JITC annually: 
  •  Issues hundreds of interoperability testing and certification related products.
  •  Manages the scheduling and executes multiple annual distributed Joint Tactical Data Link hardware in the loop interoperability test events.  These events are designed to evaluate, certify and re-certify Service/Agency Tactical Data systems.
  •  Reviews hundreds of Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System documents, interoperability support plans and Legacy Waiver requests on behalf of the DoD Chief Information Officer (CIO) and the Joint Staff. 
  •  Serves as executive agent to DoD Interoperability Steering Group, in support of the DoD CIO, and uses this forum to coordinate policy, adjudicate issues, and to process Interim Certificates to Operate.
  •  Ensures interoperability test and certification standard practices and procedures are in accordance with DoD policy, and reviews and issues over 600 Joint interoperability certifications annually for DoD’s Information Technology and National Security Systems (IT/NSS). 
  •  Manages the scheduling and prioritization of multiple annual distributed Joint Tactical Data Link simulated test events using real components (hardware in the loop interoperability test events) designed to evaluate, certify and re-certify Service/Agency Tactical systems.

JITC provides interoperability test support to Joint, Coalition and Allied operations in theater by providing Interoperability test support within the area of responsibility and supports exercises intended to evaluate Joint, Coalition and Allied operations in, or planning to deploy to theater by: 
  •  Providing on-demand rapid response contingency support to Regional Combatant Commands (COCOMs) as required, and conducting assessments of interoperability exercises.  
  •  Conducting assessments during three of the largest interoperability exercises (the Endeavors).
  •  Broadening its support to the Joint Staff and functional COCOMs with a multitude of interoperability assessment services. 
  •  Maintaining a 24x7 Warfighter Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (C4I) Interoperability Hotline that connects warfighters to subject matter experts to resolve IT interoperability challenges. 
  •  Establishing the framework for the conduct of annual independent evaluations and the status of interoperability through DoD Interoperability Communications Exercises (DICE).
  •  Emulating a distributed Joint Task Force network, providing realism and operational significance during the assessments and evaluations of data integrity, interfacing and responsiveness coupled with efficient configuration tactics, techniques, and procedures. 
  •  Including first responder local and federal communications as part of the task force. 
 
As the only non-Service Operational Test Agency (OTA) within DoD, JITC conducts operational testing of IT/NSS under realistic conditions to determine the operational effectiveness, suitability, interoperability, and security; and independently assesses the operational impact of system issues on mission accomplishment.  JITC is the OTA for DISA-managed programs, and also upon request serves as the OTA for other Agencies such as the Defense Logistics Agency, Department of Homeland Security, and the National Security Agency.

JITC designs Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&amp;E) events to determine if IT/NSS meet user requirements, offering sustaining support services to users to assist Acquisition Program Managers with meeting their overall milestone objectives.  

JITC focuses its efforts towards core T&amp;E improvements, better T&amp;E policy for IT/NSS and designing new test methodologies to better assess Enterprise Service systems, aligning with the Information Technology Service Management model evaluating fulfillment services for suitability.

The T&amp;E project supports the strategy development and investment plans in support of maintaining, improving and operating the DISA Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB).  Specific goals for DISA’s MRTFB each year are to:  
  •  Integrate evolving technologies that are able to leverage efficiencies such as virtualization, enterprise elements such as Infrastructure as a Service and Platform as a Service, and the foundational Cyber assets mandated by the JIE.
  •  Expand test infrastructure and operations to allow for rapid, on-demand provisioning, and federation across the DoD and Cyber integration with enterprise environments. 
  •  Design consistent, repeatable test methodologies that ensure efficient T&amp;E on changing or emerging technologies. 
  •  Provide T&amp;E guidance/oversight to nearly 130 DISA programs, creating synergy and efficiencies across the large DISA IT portfolio, gaining insight in new technologies and commercial best practices.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

JITC issued over 952 interoperability testing and certification related products, and processed 82 ICTO requests for the ISG.  JITC conducted 40 desk top reviews and conducted 60 new Unified Capabilities evaluations, adding 30 new products to the Unified Capabilities Approved Products List.  Additionally, JITC responded to approximately 177 hotline calls from across the DoD, other federal Agencies and DoD supporting commercial sectors. One hundred percent were responded to within the requisite timelines which is two hours for responding to critical, exercise operational, or contingency related interoperability problems, and next business day for routine troubleshooting requests.  Support levels are expected to remain steady in FY14 and FY15.

In FY 2016, JITC will continue to measure percent (%) of OT&amp;E test plans approved by DOT&amp;E prior to start of test and percent (%) of OT&amp;E test reports delivered within 60 days after test event ended with a target value of 95%.  Measurement of customer satisfaction continues for T&amp;E and Hotline Services with a target rating of 5 on a 5-point scale with 5 being the best rating.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Through the Combined Enterprise Regional Information Exchange System (CENTRIXS) and Pegasus, the Multinational Information Sharing (MNIS) Program enables secure sharing of operational and intelligence information and enhances collaboration between United States forces, trusted allies and other multinational partners. This effort also increases overall combat effectiveness by leveraging capabilities and information from all partners and reducing the possibility of fratricide.  These coalition information sharing systems are in direct support of the Department of Defense’s (DoD’s) strategic goals to “Win our Nation’s Wars” and “Deter conflict and promote security”.  The MNIS program supports five Combatant Commands (COCOMs) with connectivity in 89 nations, the North America Treaty Organization, 11 Bilateral agreements and 150 sites with over 80,000 users worldwide.  MNIS also evaluates new technologies and develops tactics, techniques and procedures to facilitate the integration of emerging technologies and capabilities into operational multinational information sharing capability.  The integration of new technology for CENTRIXS and Pegasus is accomplished through research, integration, and testing using the Combined Federated Battle Laboratory Network.  

A planned improvement to the CENTRIXS coalition network, Common Mission Network Transport (CMNT), will provide distinct and permanent transport capabilities; enabling network operation centers to priority command and control information more efficiently.  CMNT supports DoD instruction 8110.1 guidance for integrating CENTRIXS and other operational networks into existing DoD general service communications infrastructure as a separate network servicing all DoD MNIS requirements.  This capability provides a common transport for encrypted traffic.  CMNT will be the established encrypted network to facilitate the movement of virtual private network traffic between segments.

The MNIS emerging capability, Unclassified Information Sharing Services (UISS), extends US information sharing capabilities to mission partners providing enterprise-level solutions that allow COCOMs to share unclassified information with US Government agencies and non-traditional partners such as, host nations, intergovernmental organizations, and nongovernmental organizations. The employment concept for the UISS is to implement enterprise Web-based, “non-mil” platform, available to as broad a community as needed to support mission operations, with worldwide, 24 hour-a-day, seven day-a-week access, to any user with an Internet connection, including web-enabled mobile personal devices.  Using an Internet-based capability and an integrated suite of commercial-off-the-shelf collaboration tools the UISS capability will enable unclassified information exchanges and ad-hoc communications for shared communities of interest and issue-specific groups among and across organizations and individuals.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Multinational Information Sharing (MNIS) Program is a portfolio of four coalition information sharing capabilities designed to enable and improve sharing of operational and intelligence information among US forces and multinational partners.

1) Combined Enterprise Regional Information Exchange System (CENTRIXS), supports intelligence and classified operations at the Secret Releasable level.  There are multiple, cryptographically-isolated CENTRIXS enclaves serving various communities of interest (COI) that support multinational efforts including Overseas Contingency Operations and counter-narcotics operations. CENTRIXS is regionally focused and combatant command (COCOM) centric. The MNIS Program Management Office provides selected centralized services from two Defense Enterprise Computing Centers for five of the 40+ CENTRIXS networks/COIs, and engineering support for standardized solutions.  

2) Pegasus connects the national Command and Control (C2) systems of Combined Communications Electronics Board (CCEB) Nations including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom and the United States, using commercial-off-the-shelf security appliances and cross domain solutions that facilitate situational awareness and operational planning/execution. Pegasus has a strategic focus and is member nation centric. 

3) The Combined Federated Battle Laboratory Network (CFBLNet) provides a controlled coalition Research, Development, Trials and Assessment coalition information sharing “sandbox” for the US, CCEB Nations, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and other mission essential nations. This sandbox is used to evaluate new technologies and to develop tactics, techniques and procedures that facilitate the transition of promising technologies and capabilities into operational multinational information sharing capability enhancements.  CFBLNet's direct customers are the CCEB nations’ military operational and intelligence entities led by their US counterparts at the COCOM and Agency levels.  It is being used for the Coalition Warrior Interoperability Demonstrations, NATO missile defense initiatives, and by the Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance community to test capabilities prior to deployment.

4) The Unclassified Information Sharing Service (UISS) extends US information sharing capabilities to mission partners, enterprise-level solutions that allow COCOMs to share unclassified information with other US Government agencies, host nations, inter-governmental organizations, non-governmental organizations, and other partners.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The National Military Command System (NMCS), operated by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, provides the President, Secretary of Defense, and other national senior leaders the ability to maintain situational and operational awareness and command and control of military forces in all crisis and/or national emergency contingencies. DISA's NMCS engineering program meets the NMCS systems engineer responsibilities, per Department of Defense Directive (DoDD) S-5100.44 and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 3280.01B, to provide the Joint Staff with operationally efficient and cost-effective engineering solutions to ensure that components and facilities satisfy operational requirements including emergency messaging, situational awareness, crisis action, and information management.

The NMCS engineering program is vital in supporting the government's ability to safeguard national security and respond to contingencies globally and/or nuclear war. NMCS engineering focuses on implementing collaborative tools into current and crisis operations areas, integrating adequate back-up storage and recovery of voice, video and data across the continental United States to support key leaders, transitioning nuclear command and control to Internet Protocol based networks, migrating data and voice network to next generation satellites, implementing modern crypto-logical devices, and utilizing wireless networking to support warning systems and situational awareness. In addition, NMCS engineering continues to maintain the NMCS Reference Guide required by DoDD S-5100.44 and to develop engineering and test plans for the installation of hardware and software systems utilized within the NMCS.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:PerformanceMetrics>The NMCS Engineering Branch conducts regularly scheduled In-progress Program Reviews (IPRs) and Configuration Control Board (CCB) meetings to monitor status of engineering projects/tasks. Each current project/task is evaluated in terms of how well the technical work is progressing and how allocated resources are being utilized. Adjustments to resources, schedules, and technical directions are made, as required.  Future projects/tasks are also discussed, thereby ensuring an integrated approach is maintained across all related project/task areas. To further increase the utility of the IPR/CCB structure, the Joint Staff customer participates in the project/task reviews. The result of this approach is a truly integrated effort of NMCS Engineering, contractor, and Joint Staff working together to achieve common program goals. Suitable products are delivered within allocated resources and delivered on schedule 90% of the time.

The NMCS met all FY 2014 performance metrics and is on track to meet its FY 2015 and FY 2016 metrics by delivering suitable products on schedule and within allocated resources 100% of the time.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Information Infrastructure Engineering and Integration effort encompasses two projects: Modeling and Simulation and DoD Information Network (DODIN) (formerly Global Information Grid (GIG)) Systems Engineering and Support. There are two major activities under the Modeling and Simulation project: Modeling and Simulation and DODIN Enterprise Wide Systems Engineering (EWSE).

The DODIN EWSE activity resolves near term (one to three years) high-priority technical issues defined by Department of Defense Chief Information Officer (DoD CIO) and Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), that impact operational capabilities affecting DODIN End-to-End (E2E) interoperability and performance. 

The Modeling and Simulation project provides architecture, systems engineering and E2E analytical functions for DISA and its customers, ensuring integrated capabilities to fulfill warfighter mission requirements. Ongoing beneficiaries of these capabilities include DoD CIO, the DISA Network Services Directorate, the DISA Enterprise Services Directorate, Program Executive Office-Mission Assurance, the Defense Information Systems Network Command Center and Joint Communications Simulation System users in DoD.

The DODIN Systems Engineering and Support project defines and validates that the overall technical strategies for DISA are aligned with key DoD Strategic Planning and Execution documents. These documents include the DoD IT Efficiency strategy, DoD CIO’s Campaign Plan, Joint Information Environment (JIE) Roadmap and Concept of Operations, DoD Instructions and Memorandum, other critical high-level guidance documents and target architectures and transition plans. These strategies establish the foundation for technology investments, technical developments, and the operations and sustainment of critical net-centric products and services provided by DISA. The DISA Chief Technology Officer (CTO) conducts technical system engineering reviews and oversight.  CTO's early identification of technology needs in coordination with DARPA and will be managed through the DISA Technology Information Repository (DTIR).  CTO conducts system engineering oversight, as well as critical technology evaluations and technical maturity assessments.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Modeling and Simulation project provides architecture, systems engineering and end-to-end (E2E) analytical functions for the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) and its customers, ensuring integrated capabilities to fulfill warfighter mission requirements. Modeling and Simulation activities support the Department of Defense (DoD) communications planning and investment strategy, including: application performance assessments, contingency planning, network capacity planning and diagnostics, and systems-level modeling and simulation. Project efforts provide across-theater information awareness for Combatant Commands through application solutions for integrated networks, including DoD’s missions in Afghanistan and the Defense Information Systems Network (DISN) by: (1) supporting the development and implementation of DoD Information Network (DODIN) Enterprise Wide Systems Engineering (EWSE) processes essential to evolving the DODIN in a manner that enables interoperability and E2E performance for critical DODIN programs; (2) developing standardized DISA systems analyses and integration processes to improve systems integration across DISA for all DISA developed communication systems and services; and (3) providing the underlying modeling and simulation and analytical support for E2E DISA and DoD systems engineering and assessment. 

Project efforts provide DoD decision makers with services and a suite of tools capable of identifying key points of impact on DoD command and control information systems and recommending trade-offs within the DODIN configuration with regard to prioritized performance, availability, and security. This effort will reduce the risk in products deployed to the warfighter through improved network performance and traffic analysis, and an efficient means of troubleshooting and subsequent redesign.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Subject matter experts in both large and small businesses are sought for the engineering support. Firm fixed price contracts with one option year are typically used in open competition. Furthermore, technical work with Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) such as MITRE and MIT Lincoln Lab are established and coordinated when the Government can leverage their expertise and R&amp;D in the key technology.  

Modeling and Simulation uses a range of contractors for modeling support to the various projects. Contractors range from small to large business, predominantly using open competition methods and Firm Fixed Price (FFP) tasks and utilizing multi-year (base plus option years) contracts where possible. Support includes network modeling tool and processes development to adapt to ever-evolving OSD/DISA programs and projects, analyses, capacity planning, and network redesign using the models.

                                                <r2:PerformanceMetrics>DISN core bandwidth sufficiency, tied to transport and IP capacity planning and activation of bandwidth in the DISN core, to keep at least 25% spare capacity, to allow for provisioning of unforeseen requirements and rerouting under outages.  Current status stands at 59.85% capacity, thus maintaining spare capacity in excess of 25%.

The EWSE projects will be measured by the number of systems engineering artifacts and/or DODIN Technical Profiles that are published to support interoperability of DoD programs; and the number of engineering/ technical solutions that are adopted by programs/initiatives across DoD, Combatant Commands (COCOMs), and the Services. These solutions will be coordinated with the stakeholders/users to ensure EWSE has the right solution to the right problem.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Chief Technology Officer (CTO) has the responsibility of defining and validating the overall technical strategies for the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) in line with the DoD IT Efficiency strategy and Department of Defense Chief Information Officer (DoD CIO) Campaign Plan. These strategies establish the foundation for technology investments, technical development, Cooperative Research and Development Agreements, and the operations and sustainment of critical net-centric products and services provided by DISA. DISA CTO conducts technical system engineering reviews and oversight. CTO’s early identification of technology needs will be managed through the Technology Management Framework (TMF), a part of the broader Advanced Technology Identification and Insertion Process (ATIIP). TMF uses as its substrate an institutionalized, directorate partnering construct (i.e. DISA CIO, CTO, Strategic Planning and Information (SPI)), based upon an Enterprise Architecture (EA) methodology. 

The CTO supports end to end (E2E) technology evaluations, assessments, process improvements, as well as the analysis and review of potential technology solutions, products, capabilities and services to ensure consistency with DoD Information Network (DODIN) architecture and standards.  Our products provide actionable, decision-oriented information to the Secretary of Defense, Joint Staff, Military Services, Combatant Commands, and other mission partners in satisfying DoD mission objectives.

The CTO maintains the Technology Environment, which provides the infrastructure, tools, processes, and techniques to perform various types of assessments and evaluations. These include informal quick looks, technology demonstrations, proof-of-concept events, and technology piloting events, as well as formally orchestrated operational assessments.  The Technology Environment is capable of supporting a broad range of topics and issues such as EA, wireless and mobile computing, transport technologies, net-centricity compliance, unified capabilities services, Web 2.0, cloud computing, and social networking.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This market research also includes consideration of small businesses including minority/women owned (8A) businesses, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, mentor/protégé and other specialized contract vehicles and processes. Market research evaluates all contractors available from DISA sources for their ability to deliver the products specifically required for the unique program efforts.  The program works collaboratively with vendors to obtain generic cost data for planning and analysis purposes.  Past and current contract prices for similar work and other government-wide agency contracts provide additional sources of information.  Quotes from multiple sources help provide averages for more realistic cost estimates.  DISA makes a concerted effort to award many of its contracts to small businesses.  Additionally, many of the DISA contracts are awarded with multiple option periods. These have the benefit of fixing labor costs over an extended period and minimizing the administrative costs associated with re-issuing short-term contracts.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                                                <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Performance is measured by project milestones and the adoption of these technologies into existing Programs of Record (PORs) or as new program offerings to the DoD and intelligence communities. Metrics that will be used include number and percentage of emerging and mature technologies adopted by DISA and DoD, number and percent of technology research and development initiatives and investments in the DoD, peering organizations and industry partners attributable to technology research. These investments and evolution plans identify, promote, channel and align technology research and investments to reduce time to field emerging technologies to satisfy warfighter requirements. See specific metrics below:

1.  Metric:  Performance is measured by the number of technologies assessed and the adoption or influence of the technologies assessed on DoD, DISA or IC programs, projects or services.  Technologies are identified by many venues to include research and development initiatives, technology watch-lists from various sources (e.g. in-house, peer organizations, industry and/or academic advisors) and commercial product releases that have potential applicability to the warfigher mission area.  These measures will allow CTO to align technology research and development with capabilities gaps and needs resulting in improved operational effectiveness and efficiencies.

      Measure/Goal:  Number of pilot and technology assessments instantiated within the CTO Technical Environment.  Number research initiatives designed, developed and demonstrated and transitioned to programs, projects, or services.

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Information Systems Network (DISN) is the Department of Defenses (DoD's) consolidated worldwide telecommunications capability that provides secure, end-to-end information transport for DoD operations.  It also provides the warfighter and the Combatant Commands (COCOMs) with a robust Command, Control, Communications, Computing, and Intelligence infrastructure to support DoD net-centric missions and business requirements.  The Defense Red Switch Network (DRSN) is a DoD Secure Voice, Command and Control Network that is controlled and directed by the Joint Staff and the Office of the Secretary of Defense.  It provides multi-level secure, rapid, ad hoc, voice calling and conferencing capability to the President, Secretary of Defense, Services, COCOMs, subordinate organizations (military and civilian) and coalition allies.  DRSN also supports the Presidential and National Voice Conferencing (PNVC) (formerly known as National Emergency Action Decision Network (NEADN)) and the Enhanced Pentagon Capability/Survivable Emergency Conferencing Network. These funds support three major efforts:

DISN Systems Engineering Support:  This effort includes engineering for Internet Protocol and optical transport capabilities to ensure the essential operations of a robust and secure DISN; refreshing the systems that instrument and automate the operations, administration, maintenance and provisioning functions and creating a single DISN-wide view for network managers and operators; other activities in support of the DRSN communications capabilities.   

PNVC:  The PVNC (formerly called National Emergency Action Decision Network)) provides selected system engineering for continued development and testing of the PNVC equipment for senior leaders.  The PNVC system provides a military satellite-based, survivable, secure, and near toll-quality voice conferencing capability for the President, Secretary of Defense, Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff, and other senior national/military leaders anywhere in the world as needed.  Funding supports the acquisition activities for the PNVC baseband equipment, including critical and essential engineering required to develop new vocoder and cryptographic and audio-summing equipment.   
 
DoD Mobility: The Mobility Program will lead the development of an Enterprise Solution to support Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) and leverage commercial carrier infrastructure to provide entry points for both classified and unclassified wireless capabilities.  Continued evolution and expansion, within the Department, of the DoD Mobility program will allow for increased mobile services in direct support of the warfighter and the COCOMs.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Initiated new versions of the Multi-stream Summing Device and the Baseband Interface Group to meet airborne environmental requirements

The FY 2015 decrease of -$0.030 results from reduced development efforts on the DISN Information Sharing Services Portal.

The FY 2016 increase of +$18.127 is the result of one-time funding increase to the Presidential and National Voice Conferencing (PNVC) to complete the redesign of PNVC baseband equipment for the presidential aircraft.  The increase is partially offset by completion of the DISN OSS development projects.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

Initial PNVC Engineering Develop Models (EDMs) and DISA funded pre-production units will be tested at various facilities by different organizations.  The Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC) in Ft Huachuca, AZ secures voice test facility that will be used to test the audio baseband equipment with the DRSN Switch, and also test the baseband kits. An Air Force Satellite Communications (SATCOM) testing facility in Colorado Springs, CO will be used for air testing. NSA will conduct testing of the BIG for cryptologic functions and testing will be completed at JITC in Ft Huachuca, AZ for interoperability with the rest of the baseband audio equipment.  Support planning for aircraft integration activities undertaken by the Air Force E-4B and Navy E-6B, by providing assistance to facilitate integration of the audio baseband equipment as it affects the overall PNVC capability.

The decrease of -$19.838 from FY 2014 to FY 2015 is due to a removal of one-time reprogramming action (-$15.000) to initiate the presidential aircraft capability upgrade as well as the planned completion of the key development efforts on the Baseband band Kit (-$4.838), a HEMP protected transit case that will be used by the PNVC Special-user community.</r2:Text>

                                                <r2:PerformanceMetrics>PNVC project metrics track the development status of program acquisition documents, as required by the component executive. These documents include:  Project Execution Plan, Concept of Operations Acquisition Strategy, Capability Production Document, System Engineering Plan and other documents required by the DISA’s Component Acquisition Executive.  Additionally, for management and system engineering support vendors, monthly reports are critical to tracking overall programmatic and engineering progress and the percent of total deliverables received on time.

For product development activities, effective progress is measured based upon the task order milestones in the form of development reviews and weekly progress meetings.  As end items (hardware and software) become available for test, additional measures will be available.  Specifically, the percentage of successfully verified requirements out of the number tested and the number of critical trouble reports outstanding longer than six months, will be tracked.

Internet Protocol (IP) and Optical Transport Technology Refresh:  Provides engineering technical expertise to support and integrate newer, more efficient technologies required to replace end of lifecycle equipment and to achieve more efficient IP and optical technologies.  These new technologies provide protected and assured services for mobility and critical support to the warfighter as well as other DoD and federal customers.

Element Management System (EMS):  Provides operational and network operating systems that instrument and automate the operations, administration, maintenance and provisioning functions creating a single DISN-wide view for network managers and operators.  EMS is a component of the DISN Operational Support Systems (OSS).

Peripheral and Component Design (Secure Voice Switches):  This equipment satisfies unique military requirements for multi-level security (i.e., extensive conferencing/conference management capabilities and features, and gateway functions) that are not available in commercial products.  

DoD Mobility: The Mobility Program will lead the development of an Enterprise Solution to support Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) and leverage commercial carrier infrastructure to provide entry points for both classified and unclassified wireless capabilities.  Continued evolution and expansion, within the Department, of the DoD Mobility program will allow for increased mobile services in direct support of the warfighter and the COCOMs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Minimum Essential Emergency Communications Network (MEECN) provides the Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3) engineer with plans and procedures; systems analysis; operational assessments; systems engineering; and development of concepts of operation and architectures. The NC3 System provides connectivity from the President and the Secretary of Defense through the National Military Command System to nuclear execution forces integral to fighting a “homeland-to-homeland,” as well as theater nuclear war. MEECN includes the Emergency Action Message dissemination systems and those systems used for integrated Tactical Warning/Attack Assessment, presidential decision-making conferencing, force report back, re-targeting, force management, and requests for permission to use nuclear weapons. Efforts assure positive control of nuclear forces and connectivity between the Secretary of Defense, military forces, and an informed decision-making linkage between the President, the Secretary of Defense, and the Combatant Commands. MEECN ensures our national leadership has proper command and control of our forces during times of national emergency, up to and including nuclear war.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports the mission of the Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3) Systems Engineer to the Joint Staff and Executive Leadership. It also provides NC3 expertise to the Department of Defense (DoD) Chief Information Officer (CIO) National Leadership Command Capability (NLCC) Management Office. Systems Analysis supports long range planning and vulnerability assessments to ensure the NC3 System is adequate under all conditions of stress or war and recommends investment strategies to evolve the Nuclear Command and Control System to achieve desired capabilities. Operational Assessments of fielded systems and weapon platforms provides the sole means for verification of NC3 systems’ performance in support of plans and procedures, operation orders, training, equipment, and end-to-end system configuration. Assessments provide strategic and theater level C3 interfaces into the NC3 System. Supporting efforts assure positive control of nuclear forces and connectivity between the Secretary of Defense and strategic and theater forces. Systems Engineering provides the Senior Leadership C3 System with technical and management advice, planning and engineering support, and Test &amp; Evaluation. Leading Edge Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence technology is assessed for all communication platforms supporting executive travelers and senior leaders to include the interoperability of hardware and operational procedures. These technology elements support the President's and other DoD command centers and aircraft (e.g., Air Force One and the National Airborne Operations Center).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

In addition, performance of the Nuclear C3 System is directly measured by the operational assessments funded by this program element.  These periodic assessments evaluate the connectivity used for the five functions of Nuclear command and control: Situation Monitoring, Planning, Decision Making, Force Execution, and Force Management.  Assessment results are used by the Joint Staff to direct changes in system engineering and integration, programmatic execution, and training.  

Specific performance metrics include the following:
Provide engineering products in all task areas that satisfy DoD/CIO and Joint Staff needs within allocated resources 90% of the time.

Conduct assessments of the NC3 system and the SLC3S that provide actionable results and recommendations for the Joint Staff and DoD/CIO to pursue improvements to these capabilities 90% of the time.

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Global Command and Control System-Joint (GCCS-J) funds a Joint Command and Control (JC2) portfolio which includes: GCCS-J, Joint Planning and Execution Services (JPES), and JC2 Architecture.

The GCCS-J Program is the Department of Defense (DoD) Joint C2 system of record.  It incorporates core planning and assessment tools required by Combatant Commanders and their subordinate Joint Task Force Commanders while meeting the readiness support requirements of the Services.  GCCS-J is used by all nine Combatant Commands (COCOMs) at sites around the world, supporting joint and coalition operations. The Services rely heavily on GCCS-J components to reduce their command and control (C2) operational costs. It provides support for commanders and staffs as they conduct joint and multinational operations by providing a fused picture of the battle space within an integrated system that is supporting joint warfighter needs today.  GCCS-J is currently focused on sustainment, synchronization, and modernization to meet emerging operational needs by modifying and enhancing elements or capabilities in order to implement new requirements, enhance functionality, increase efficiency and lower operating and deployment costs while taking advantage of the progress made by current operational systems and technologies.  The GCCS-J program is also executing incremental modernization of C2 capabilities using the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) approved needs.

JPES is a portfolio of capabilities supporting joint policies, processes, procedures, and reporting structures. It is supported by communications and information technology used by the Joint Planning and Execution Community (JPEC).  JPEC uses these capabilities to monitor the following activities: planning, execute mobilization, deployment, employment and sustainment, redeployment, and demobilization.   At full maturity, the JPES capabilities will be integrated with other adaptive planning and execution systems to facilitate the rapid development and sustainment of plans and a seamless, dynamic transition to execution in a net-centric environment. One of the key capabilities residing within the JPES portfolio of sustaining the existing Joint Operational Planning and Execution System (JOPES) while modernization of JOPES is planned and implemented.  The JPES portfolio also includes a core set of infrastructure services consisting of  the JPES Framework (JFW) and a variety of mission applications to include Joint Force Projection (JFP), Joint Capabilities Requirements Manager (JCRM) and eventually the capabilities that will replace JOPES.

JC2 Architecture is a reference architecture that aligns closely to the DoD Information Enterprise Architecture.  The JC2 Architecture describes architectural and operational concepts, technical constructs, and is a repository for valuable reference information relating to C2 standards and information security.  It is the authoritative source of information and technical direction for the JC2 arena.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:SummaryExplanation>The FY 2014 decrease of -$0.474 was due to delayed delivery of Joint C2 Mission Operational Priorities and software architecture modernization initiatives to reduce the overall sustainment cost. 

The FY 2016 decrease of -$0.617 is due to reduced modernization efforts through programmatic, engineering support, and development contract reductions, reduced security upgrades for v4.2.0.9, and reduced Joint Staff J-3/J-6 Operational Priorities to sustainment levels.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Global Command and Control System – Joint (GCCS-J) is DoD’s Joint Command and Control (JC2) system of record and provides the foundation for migration of service-unique C2 systems into a Joint, interoperable environment. The Defense Information System Agency’s (DISAs) portfolio includes funding to support GCCS-J, Joint Planning and Execution Services (JPES), and the development and sustainment of the JC2 Architecture.  GCCS-J incorporates the core planning and assessment tools required by combatant commanders and their subordinate Joint Task Force Commanders while meeting the readiness support requirements of the Services.  Adaptive Planning and Execution Joint Planning Services are being developed to modernize the adaptive planning functions in a net centric environment.  DISA continues to provide support for the operational system to ensure continued access to information integration and decision-support capabilities that enable the exercise of authority and direction over assigned and attached forces, in a net-centric, collaborative information environment.  Additionally, DISA provides critical C2 capabilities to the Commander-in-Chief, Secretary of Defense, National Military Command Center, Combatant Commands (COCOMs), Joint Force Commanders, and Service Component Commanders.  

JPES is a set of capabilities that address components of the DOD’s Adaptive Planning Roadmap (13 December 2005) and Adaptive Planning Roadmap II (5 March 2008).  JPES produces enhancements to the Joint Operations Planning and Execution System (JOPES), focused adaptive planning capabilities, and provides a set of core infrastructure services necessary to provide the warfighter a fully interoperable environment where functionality can be easily added as mission needs dictate.

The JC2 Architecture is a foundational element of JC2 capabilities for the Department.  The JC2 Architecture provides a set of net-centric tenets associated with data, functional service and the C2 infrastructure that describes architectural and operational concepts, technical constructs, and is a repository for valuable reference information relating to C2 standards and information security.  Each year, the DISA architecture team, annually, produces a transitional architecture that documents the current state of C2 capabilities, anticipated changes/enhancements either in progress or planned by the JC2 community.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Spectrum Organization (DSO) provides a full array of electromagnetic spectrum services and capabilities, ranging from short notice on-the-ground operational support at the forward edge, to long range planning in pursuit of national strategic objectives. These services/capabilities are in direct support of Combatant Commanders, the Department of Defense (DoD) Chief Information Officer, Military Services, and Defense Agencies. The DSO is the focal point for electromagnetic spectrum analysis and the development of integrated spectrum plans and strategies to address current and future needs for DoD spectrum access. In addition, DSO serves as DoD's spectrum advocate at national and international forums and conducts extensive outreach to both industry and government. DSO also implements enterprise spectrum management capabilities to enhance spectrum efficiency and agility to improve spectrum-dependent capabilities in support of United States and Coalition operations. This includes acquiring, implementing and sustaining the Global Electromagnetic Spectrum Information System (GEMSIS) which provides an integrated catalog of joint net-centric spectrum management tools and services. Electromagnetic Spectrum Management enables information dominance through effective spectrum operations.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:SummaryExplanation>The FY 2014 increase of +$0.369 provided contract support to enhance the effectiveness of DoD world-wide access to spectrum.       

The FY 2015 decrease of -$0.030 is the result of reduced contract support for the development of enhanced analytical tools.

The FY 2016 decrease of -$1.070 is due to delays in integrating spectrum capabilities within GEMSIS, transitioning emerging technologies to programs of record, and developing enterprise spectrum capabilities.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

The databases are the prime sources of information for DoD use of the Electromagnetic (EM) spectrum. The JSC provides technical measurement and analysis in support of DoD spectrum policy decisions to ensure the development, acquisition, and operational deployment of systems are compatible with other spectrum dependent systems operating within the same EM environment. Additional efforts focus on improving future warfighter EM spectrum utilization through technological innovation, and influencing research and development emerging technology efforts.
 
Improved spectrum support includes the Global Electromagnetic Spectrum Information System (GEMSIS), a net centric capability that will provide commanders with an increased common picture of spectrum situational awareness of friendly and hostile forces while transparently deconflicting competing mission requirements for spectrum use. This capability will enable the transformation from the current preplanned and static assignment strategy into autonomous and adaptive spectrum operations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Program Executive Office Enterprise Services (PEO-ES) provides a portfolio of enterprise level services that enable communities of interest and mission applications to make their data and services visible, accessible, and understandable to other anticipated and unanticipated users. The continually expanding portfolio of enterprise services supports 100 percent of the active duty military and Government civilians; 258 thousand embedded contract personnel; 75 percent of the active Guard and Reserve; and 25 percent of the Guard and Reserve users. This meets the Department’s requirement to support 2.5 million users on the Sensitive but Unclassified (SBU) Internet Protocol (IP) Data network and 300 thousand users on the Secret IP Data network. The portfolio of services continues to expand through the transition of local services to the Department of Defense (DoD) enterprise and providing enhanced functionality that allows DoD personnel to go anywhere within the DoD, login, and be productive, the implementation of an access control infrastructure that enables secure information sharing throughout the DoD, and the integration of pre-planned product improvements to existing enterprise services keeping them relevant to the end-users’ missions.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Program Executive Office Enterprise Services (PEO-ES) continues to expand their portfolio of services that currently includes the core capabilities delivered by the Net-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES) Program, with a resilient and flexible access control infrastructure that enables strong authentication for secure information sharing in the Department of Defense (DoD), and the identification, transitioning, and operationalization of local services into the larger DoD enterprise. Critical warfighter, Business, and Intelligence Mission Area services within the portfolio include an enterprise collaboration capability supporting over 900,000 DoD users, Enterprise Search that exposes data sources throughout the DoD, Service Oriented Architecture Foundation supporting a robust Enterprise Messaging service that provides producers the ability to publish one message that, in turn, can be distributed to hundreds of end-points supporting the subscribers to that information and a critical enterprise authoritative data source service that supports the user’s need to identify and use authoritative data and services. The portfolio also includes the Strategic Knowledge Integration Web (SKIWeb) providing decision and event management support to all levels of a widespread user-base that ranges from the Combatant Commanders to the Joint Staff to Coalition partners on the Secret Internet Protocol (IP) Data network; DoD Visitor that allows personnel to “go anywhere within the DoD, login, and be productive”;the DoD Enterprise Portal Service that provides users with a flexible web-based hosting solution to create and manage mission, community, organization, and user focused sites; and privilege management Authentication Gateway Services (AGS) that is integrated with the Identity and Access Management services supporting brokered Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) authentication for DoD applications without a native PKI authentication capability. The individual suite of capabilities within the portfolio of services provides the user with the flexibility to couple the services in varying ways to support their mission needs. This flexibility provides unprecedented access to web and application content, critical imagery, intelligence and warfighter information, and temporarily stores critical data in a secure environment. The portfolio of enterprise services delivers tangible benefits to the Department by providing capabilities that are applied by US Forces, Coalition forces, and Allied forces to support full spectrum joint and expeditionary campaign operations. These enabling benefits include the ability to:
•	Enhance collaborative decision-making processes
•	Improve information sharing and integrated situational awareness
•	Share and exchange knowledge and services between enterprise units and commands
•	Share and exchange information between previously unreachable and unconnected sources
•	Schedule and coordinate meetings with people across the DoD Components
•	“Go anywhere in the DoD, login, and be productive”
•	Create and manage mission, community, organization, and user-focused sites from global locations
•	Exchange knowledge to enable situational awareness, determine the effects desired, select a course of action, the forces to execute it, and accurately assess the effects of that action
The portfolio contains capabilities that are also key enablers to the Defense Information Systems Agency’s (DISA) mission of providing a global net-centric Enterprise infrastructure in direct support of joint Warfighter, National level leaders, and other mission and Coalition partners across the full spectrum of operations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The portfolio of services is leveraging portions of the acquisition approach approved for the NCES Program. Based on the approved NCES acquisition strategy, the portfolio will adopt proven specifications, best practices, and interface definitions to adopt or buy new network-based services or applications that are delivered, hosted, and managed in accordance with Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and that ensure available, reliable, and survivable services to support the warfighter’s mission.
The portfolio is using a streamlined acquisition approach to ensure that the required acquisitions contain only those requirements that are essential to meet the warfighter mission and that they can be acquired in a cost effective and time constrained manner that meets the defined mission need. This strategy will enable the rapid fielding of low to moderate risk capabilities to meet end-user operational needs through an agile requirements collection and engineering process that supports the acquisition, testing, and fielding of needed requirements in minimum time. The benefits provided by this acquisition approach include:
•	Satisfy time-urgent needs of the warfighter or theater commander
•	Provide early and continual involvement of the user
•	Evaluate the portfolio to determine optimum funding approach to rapidly deploy urgently needed services within the funding profile
•	Effective control processes that lower cost and maintains schedule
•	Provide multiple, rapidly executed increments or releases of capability
•	Early dialogue between the requirements and acquisition communities to expedite technical, programmatic, and financial solutions
•	Enable “insight” not “oversight” to identify and resolve problems early and ensure both the acquisition process and deployed service meets 
                     performance goals
•	Enable agility in selecting modular, open-systems approach
This business strategy will strike a balance between ensuring accountability using acquisition best practices and deploying urgently needed services to the warfighter on a schedule that will support their mission requirements. The goal is to facilitate the DoD enterprise cloud vision where users and Programs of Record easily access enterprise services from maritime, airborne, and land-based locations worldwide through a federation of core data centers. The user community will guide how the portfolio of services must evolve to remain relevant to the Warfighter, Business, and Intelligence Mission Area mission requirements. By partnering with the DoD Components and Mission Areas, the Defense Information Systems Agency will rapidly deliver functionality and capability at the lowest possible cost and risk in the shortest possible timeframe.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

Net-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES) uses continuous monitoring to ensure the delivered and managed portfolio of services meets the mission needs of the stakeholders, are delivered, improved, and sustained in a cost effective manner and continues to add functionality that keeps the capability relevant to the missions supported, and is responsive to evolving mission requirements.

Activity:
•  Requirements Satisfaction

Continue to expand, modernize, and enhance the portfolio of enterprise services to ensure the functionality is kept current with warfighter needs, evolving technologies, and DoD policy. Delivery of modernized services and integration of new technologies are fully tested and delivered in a timely fashion to meet mission needs.

Expected Outcome:

FY2014 (Results): Began the transition activities required to replace the Defense Enterprise Collaboration service with a functional replacement capability; completed the transition of Enterprise Store Front into the portfolio.
FY2015 (Plan): Complete the transition to the replacement Defense Enterprise Collaboration service and support any development and testing required to transition the users from the existing service to the replacement service.
FY2016 (Estimated): Identify mission needs and candidate local services that cross Service and Combatant Command boundaries for their potential to transition into the enterprise infrastructure and the expanding portfolio.

Activity:
•  Portfolio Evolution

Support the transition and integration of new and existing enterprise services and evolving technologies. Provide continuing analysis of industry standards and specifications for enhancements and added functionality to existing operational enterprise services to keep them current with evolving technologies and establish the strategic vision of enterprise services to ensure they evolve to support the user's missions.

Expected Outcome:

FY2014 (Results): Transitioned the Strategic Knowledge Integration Web to an X86 platform, implemented an open source database, and researched a bug in the existing software; transitioned to an open source technology for the replacement Defense Enterprise Collaboration service to expand flexibility to support evolving mission and functionality needs at a lower cost of ownership.
FY2015 (Plan): Identify, research, and develop additional functionality for the replacement Defense Enterprise Collaboration service to ensure it stays relevant to the end-users mission needs.
FY2016 (Estimated): Evaluate Service-centric applications and technologies transitioning into the Joint Information Environment to identify candidates to “Jump start” as potential enterprise services that can support other Services with similar mission needs.

Activity:
•  Enterprise Service Availability
 
Operational testing of modernized services or updated technologies into existing services validate that the validated customer requirement of ≥ .997 availability/reliability is sustained. Operational availability/reliability requirement is met to ensure the modernized service or technologies updates supports the customer perspective of value to mission effectiveness and relevancy to evolving mission needs.

Expected Outcome:

FY2014 (Results): The portfolio of enterprise services met the threshold of .997 availability.
FY2015 (Plan): Operational requirement met by all enterprise services that, in turn, will support the customer perspective that the services support mission effectiveness and is relevant to evolving mission needs.
FY2016 (Estimated): Operational requirement met by all enterprise services that, in turn, will support the customer perspective that the services support mission effectiveness and is relevant to evolving mission needs.

The management areas are designed to ensure that problems can be identified rapidly for resolution, while providing maximum support to the warfighters’ mission. The metrics associated with these management areas provide quantitative data to show that the portfolio of enterprise services are secure, interoperable, and responsive
to current and future warfighter missions in a cost-effective manner. The management areas and metrics will be used to continuously evaluate the value of services to the Warfighter. They will be used to determine the right time to scale and update services to keep them relevant to the warfighter’s mission. Also, when necessary, they provide the necessary artifacts to make decisions to continue, shutdown, or place in caretaker status capabilities that are not performing as expected or where the user demand has slipped or never grew to the level of keeping the service cost effective.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Department of Defense (DoD) Teleport system is a satellite communications (SATCOM) gateway that links the deployed warfighter to the Global Information Grid.  The DoD Teleport program has fielded system capabilities incrementally using a multi-generational approach with Generation 1 and 2 Full Deployment authorized by DoD Chief Information Officer on February 18, 2011. DoD Teleport Generation 3 consists of three phases; Phases 1 and 2 are in Production and Deployment while Phase 3 is in Engineering and Manufacturing Development. Each DoD Teleport investment increases the warfighter’s ability to communicate with a world-wide, net-centric set of information capabilities, which is vital for the DoD to maintain a persistent presence among its adversaries.

Currently, the Teleport system operates as an upgrade of satellite communication capabilities at selected DoD satellite communications gateways. This system provides deployed warfighters with seamless worldwide multi-band SATCOM connectivity to the Defense Information System Network (DISN) Service Delivery Nodes and legacy tactical command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence systems. It also provides centralized integration capabilities, contingency capacity, and common interfaces to access the DISN.

DoD Teleport's goal is to provide secure, seamless, interoperable, and economical upgrades to DoD SATCOM Gateways and meet the growing throughput requirements of the deployed warfighter.

The primary beneficiaries of the DoD Teleport investment are the DoD Combatant Commanders, Military Departments, Defense Agencies, and the warfighter. DoD Teleport Generation 3 is designed to meet the growing demands of the warfighter through the execution of the following phases:

Phase 1: Gateway Advanced Extremely High Frequency [Extended Data Rate] terminals provides tactical users with a 350% bandwidth increase in survivable, antijam communications through all peacetime and combat operations by installing Navy Multiband Terminals (NMT) at select Teleport sites. In addition to enhanced throughput, the NMT maintains compatibility with legacy waveforms and current tactical terminals.

Phase 2: Gateway Wideband Global SATCOM X/Ka-band terminals provides enhanced Wideband Global System (WGS) X/Ka capability to warfighters worldwide by installing terminals from the Modernization of Enterprise Terminal (MET) program at DoD Teleport and other gateway sites. This gateway enhancement allows Teleport to replace end-of-life Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS) terminals while remaining interoperable with tactical WGS X/Ka-band users. The MET enhancement provides a 300% Ka-band capacity increase and an 1100% X-band capacity increase to current enterprise terminal X/Ka capabilities. Additionally, it enables the DoD Teleport system to maintain operational availability consistent with Generation 2 requirements and reduce the overall life-cycle cost of X/Ka capabilities across the DoD.

Phase 3: Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) to Legacy Ultra High Frequency (UHF) systems interoperability will provide interoperability between MUOS users and legacy UHF users by installing MUOS-to-Legacy UHF SATCOM Gateway Component (MLGC) suites of equipment at DoD Teleport sites. MUOS is the next generation DoD UHF SATCOM system that will provide the warfighter with modern worldwide mobile communication services, utilizing the Wideband Code Division Multiple Access waveform for use in the military UHF SATCOM band. MLGC suites will provide critical continuity and interoperability as DoD tactical satellite users transition from legacy waveforms and radios to the Joint Tactical Radio System.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The three TPO procuring agencies, Program Manager Defense Communications and Army Transmission Systems, the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command, and Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) provide direct contracting support. Assistance from other Departments including Army, Navy, and Air Force is acquired via Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request for both organic and contracted support. The TPO maximizes the use of performance-based contracts and requires contractors to establish and manage specific earned value data to mitigate risk and monitor deviations from cost, schedule, and performance objectives. Performance is evaluated thorough post-award contract reviews, performance assessment during quarterly program reviews. The MLGC program will use various contract types to employ the vendor best suited to deliver the program’s capabilities to the warfighter.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                                                <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Teleport Cost and Schedule Performance Metrics: 
Teleport manages and tracks its cost and schedule performance parameters using a tailored Earned Value Management System (EVMS) process, integrating the program plan, the program schedule, Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and financial data.  Progress is monitored/documented monthly showing percentages complete for schedule and cost.  Formal updates with changes to the schedule are documented against the program baseline.

Teleport Program Metrics:
RDT&amp;E funds will be used to maintain an interoperability certification of the fielded DoD Teleport system in light of required/desired system changes.  These changes are certified in standalone test events or as part of DoD Interoperability Communications Exercises (DICE).  Percentage will be computed by dividing the number of changes under test by the number deemed DoD Interoperable.

Performance metrics have been established in four measurement areas: 1) customer results, 2) mission and business results, 3) processes and activities, and 4) technology.  Specific measurement indicators and units of measure vary by measurement area, and metrics in each of the aforementioned areas are measured annually. Teleport will use the same measurement areas for performance metrics in FY 2014, FY 2015 and FY 2016:


Generation 1/2 Metric

The three TPO procuring agencies, Program Manager Defense Communications and Army Transmission Systems, the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command, and Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) provide direct contracting support. Assistance from other Departments including Army, Navy, and Air Force is acquired via Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request for both organic and contracted support. The TPO maximizes the use of performance-based contracts and requires contractors to establish and manage specific earned value data to mitigate risk and monitor deviations from cost, schedule, and performance objectives. Performance is evaluated thorough post-award contract reviews, performance assessment during quarterly program reviews. The MLGC program will use various contract types to employ the vendor best suited to deliver the program’s capabilities to the warfighter.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                                                <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Generation 3 Cost and Schedule Performance Metrics: 
Teleport manages and tracks its cost and schedule performance parameters using a tailored Earned Value Management System (EVMS) process, integrating the program plan, the program schedule, Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and financial data.  Progress is monitored/documented monthly showing percentages complete for schedule and cost.  Formal updates with changes to the schedule are documented against the program baseline.

Generation 3 Program Metrics:
RDT&amp;E funds will be used to perform acquisition testing.

Across appropriations, performance metrics have been established in four measurement areas: 1) customer results, 2) mission and business results, 3) processes and activities, and 4) technology.  Specific measurement indicators and units of measure vary by measurement area, and metrics in each of the aforementioned areas are measured annually. Teleport will use the same measurement areas for performance metrics in FY 2014, FY 2015 and FY 2016.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

Under the DCGS Governance, this effort, referred to as the DCGS Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) Focus Team (FT), is composed of three parts:  the DDTE Focus Group, providing and sustaining a distributed development network; the Strategy Focus Group, looking at current and future net-enabled enterprise T&amp;E methods; and the Execution Focus Group, which leverages the Strategy Focus Group’s methodologies in executing DCGS Enterprise assessment events, such as the annual DCGS demonstration, ENTERPRISE CHALLENGE.  These efforts improve systems engineering and T&amp;E throughout all phases of the DCGS life-cycle, resulting in improved capabilities to share net-centric data and services between the DCGS Programs of Record (PoRs) and the overarching Defense Intelligence Information Enterprise (DI2E).

Operates and maintains the DDTE, providing DCGS PoRs a virtual operationally relevant assessment environment maintaining connectivity between Service facilities, National Agency capabilities, and Coalition partners.  DDTE allows robust integration of modeling and simulation T&amp;E capabilities across Joint DCGS events without introducing vulnerabilities to operational Command and Control networks and has enabled improvements in systems engineering, instrumentation and T&amp;E throughout all phases of the DCGS life cycle. 

DCGS PoRs and Coalition partners use the DDTE network, which supports the net-centric maturity assessment of the DCGS Enterprise under the DCGS Governance, to integrate architecture, standards, and capabilities for implementation of the DCGS Integration Backbone and support the migration to net-centricity, including DCGS Enterprise services for the Military Departments, DCGS-Special Operations Forces and the DCGS Intelligence Community.  National Agency capabilities supporting DCGS include Geospatial Intelligence, Signals Intelligence, Measurement and Signature Intelligence and Human Intelligence, which are integrated and tested in the DDTE domain.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:PerformanceMetrics>The DCGS T&amp;E FT performs a minimum of six DCGS Enterprise assessments per year, and the results are consolidated into the T&amp;E FT Enterprise Assessment Report annually.   The T&amp;E FT also provides input to the DCGS Enterprise Focus Team's State of the Enterprise (SoE) Report, which includes the Enterprise Maturity Model (EMM) and shows measurable DCGS Enterprise net-centric maturity progress over time. 
 
The T&amp;E FT also leverages Joint Interoperability Certification testing to support the evaluation of DCGS Enterprise maturity.  In FY14, of the six DCGS PoR systems, three hold current Joint Staff (JS), Command, Control, Communications, &amp; Computers/Cyber (J6) Interoperability (IOP) Certifications and continue to conduct IOP testing on emerging releases.  One DCGS PoR has completed interoperability testing, and the joint IOP certification is pending.  The remaining two PoRs are not required to be JS J6 certified, but the T&amp;E FT leverages data collected during periodic IOP assessments of these programs during enterprise-level demonstrations and test events.  Due to increased automation for data collection, parsing and analysis, in addition to advances in PoR and Enterprise maturity, the T&amp;E FT increases the cumulative number of net-centric capability evaluations each year.  This trend is expected to continue in FY15 and FY16.  This effort provides the basis for the DCGS Enterprise Assessment, allowing the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) to measure the level of maturity of the DCGS Enterprise supported by the DCGS Governance.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Logistics Agency is responsible for providing the Military Services, other Federal Agencies, along with the combined and allied forces the full spectrum of logistics, acquisition and technical services. DLA sources and provides nearly 100 percent of the consumable items the military forces need to operate – including food, fuel and energy, uniforms, medical supplies, as well as construction and barrier equipment. DLA supplies more than 85 percent of the military’s spare parts, provides logistics information data and products, manages the reutilization of military equipment, and offers document automation and production services. DLA’s Research and Development (R&amp;D) program helps ensure that advanced logistics concepts and business processes are available in order to accomplish the Agency’s mission with the leanest possible infrastructure, using the best commercial and government sources, and applying most effective business processes.  The Logistics R&amp;D program develops and demonstrates high risk, high payoff technology that provides a significantly higher level of support at lower costs, than would be otherwise attainable.  The program has a proven track record of implementation and benefits.  

In December 2013, the DLA Director called for greater flexibility within the R&amp;D program in support of the Agency’s efforts to achieve its’ mission.  As a result, the R&amp;D program is evolving from single supply chain efforts to   Strategic Focus Areas (SFAs) that will support DLA’s efforts to achieve the improvements needed to maintain mission readiness and continue fiscal stewardship while supporting the Department’s transition to peacetime operations.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:SummaryExplanation>The Medical On-line Business Analytics capability will be delayed depriving DLA of the ability to properly plan and monitor orders to critical medical customers.  The Supply Chain management project reductions means additional anti-counterfeiting technology will not be fully developed and implemented, increasing the risk that counterfeit parts will enter the DOD supply system. In addition, emerging additive manufacturing technology will not be available for low volume parts.  The Strategic Distribution and Reutilization reductions mean that DLA support to the COCOM’s deployments will be more costly because they will not be able to access regional suppliers through the IBEX2 system.  Reductions to the Energy readiness program mean cost increases to the Services for fuel because fewer alternative fuel additives will be available.  Finally, the reductions to the Defense Logistics Information project means DLA will not be capable of taking advantage of major advancements in Computer Aided Design/Computer Aided Manufacturing.   

FY2016 – FY2020 Restructuring: In December 2013, the DLA Director called for changes to the R&amp;D program that would allow greater flexibility to support the Agency’s mission.  As a result, the R&amp;D program is evolving from single supply chain efforts to a few overarching Strategic Focus Areas (SFAs) that will support its efforts to achieve the needed improvements in order to maintain mission readiness and fiscal stewardship as the Department continues transition to peacetime operations. The three Strategic Focus Areas are: 

1. Analytic and Decision Support:  R&amp;D efforts undertaken to develop and implement advanced analytical tools, modeling, and simulation of logistics and supply chain processes.  These tools will improve DLA forecasting and procurement strategy decisions and lead to faster and more flexible response to emerging market and customer requirements. 
2. Logistics Processes: R&amp;D efforts undertaken to develop and implement advanced technology in the internal DLA logistics processes. To qualify for R&amp;D funding, the R&amp;D effort must develop and apply technology and processes over and above current baseline IT systems and continuous improvements efforts. 
3. Innovative Products and Services for Customers: R&amp;D efforts undertaken to develop new products and services for DLA customers including helping to achieve the operational energy strategy goals of increasing sources of supply, developing and implementing alternative fuels and emerging,  out of cycle requirements that always occur and new products and services developed by DLA.  

FY2016 – FY2020  Reprogramming to Industrial Preparedness – Manufacturing Technology Program (P.E. 0708011S) 
This change will better align the technical work with the OSD Manufacturing Technology Program initiative for the Model Based Enterprise (MBE).  The MBE will help DOD move to a completely digital environment for design and engineering data needed to conceive, design, build and support weapon systems.  The MBE is important because much of the data currently developed during the design and production weapon system life cycle is lost and has to be recreated.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

The Medical Logistics Network (MLN)  program supports the Medical Directorate’s mission to develop and implement the critical logistics and medical supply chain business practices that ensure the cost-effective and efficient distribution of medical materiel to the full range of Military Health System operations.

The Medical Logistics Network (MLN) program anticipates future medical logistical requirements and develops strategies and tools to meet these requirements.  Operating in the unique DoD-Commercial medical logistics environment, the Medical Logistics Network program develops processes for management of DoD Medical Logistics to ensure effective and safe medical supplies support the warfighter. These business process improvements may have potential extension to other supply chains.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Support Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Strategic Plans Goals 1.)  Warfighter Support) and 2.)  Stewardship Excellence.  The program spans multiple weapon systems and supply chains to improve internal processes, provide new methods, reduce costs and lead times, and ultimately, improve readiness for DLA customers.  

The program is focused in three initiatives:
1.)  Planning Process Improvement:  The program improves elements of current inventory policy models, assesses potential benefits of new technologies and seeks more efficient approaches to deliver customer requirements while reducing inventory and order fulfillment costs.  

2.)  Technical/Quality Process Improvement:  The program improves internal efficiency and customer satisfaction through new tools and methods to proactively address supply issues resulting from current technical/quality processes.  

3.)  Procurement Process Improvement:  The program will demonstrate tailored data collection and business processes for well-defined subsets of suppliers and procurement types to improve supplier responsiveness, cycle time and cost.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Phase 1 of the Exchange Sale of Economic Retention Stock (ESERS) project was successfully complete by selling a sample of NIINs through the GSA.  Financial and Inventory Simulation (FINISIM) upgrades requested by DLA were successfully completed, and efforts to transition FINISIM through the J6 Front Door process were initiated by J34 and likely will continue in FY 2015.  Some enhancements to Peak/Next Gen requested by DLA were completed, and others initiated which will be completed in FY 2015.  An assessment of the Returns process was initiated and scheduled for completion in early FY 2015.  Several Challenges from the Planning community were received, and efforts were begun to structure projects based on them.

Technical/Quality Process Improvements:  Completed an analysis of the potential benefits of changing the definition of Critical Application Items (CAI) to “critical in engineering design or manufacturing requirements” that showed the potential of saving millions of dollars and substantial Administrative Lead Time by avoiding unnecessary Engineering Support Activity reviews.  Completed an analysis of new results-based metrics for the Technical/Quality process, and worked with the Technical/quality team to transition them.  Several Challenges from the Technical/Quality community were received, and efforts were begun to structure projects based on them

Procurement Process Improvements:  The Matching Acquisition Strategies to Industry Capabilities (MASIC) project was successfully completed and transitioned to J7.  WSS successfully completed an assessment of the ship recycling industry and DLA’s potential future role, and reported the results to the DLA Director as input to his decision whether or not to get back into the ship recycling business.</r2:Text>

A Collaborative Planning with Military Service Industrial Maintenance Sites project will be initiated that promises to substantially improve the accuracy of demand forecasts and greatly improve support to warfighters.  New projects will be initiated based on the Challenges in the Planning area that were received in FY 2014.  In addition, collaborative efforts will be continued with the Planning Process team to develop additional new projects targeting FY 2016 awards.

Technical/Quality Process Improvements:  A follow-on project to the CAI effort completed in FY 2014 will be initiated to work with DLA experts to develop a set of recommendation for the joint DLA/Military Service Engineering Support Working Group to match engineering support / risk reduction with item criticality and procurement risk.  New projects will be initiated based on the Challenges in the Technical/Quality area that were received in FY 2014.  In addition, collaborative efforts will be continued with the Technical/Quality Process team to develop additional new projects targeting FY 2016 awards.

Procurement Process Improvements:  A Low Demand Parts project will be initiated to improve support to items seeing low demand by identifying and assessing approaches to group such parts and recommending methods to implement approaches to acquire parts in the groups, with a goal of reducing backorders while increasing participation by small businesses.  A concerted effort will be made to identify additional projects for FY 2015 or FY 2016 starts by working with J7 personnel.</r2:Text>

This change will better align the technical work with the OSD Manufacturing Technology Program initiative for the Model Based Enterprise (MBE).  The MBE will help DOD move to a completely digital environment for design and engineering data needed to conceive, design, build and support weapon systems. 

The Defense Logistics Information Research (DLIR) program objective is to research, identify, and implement potential or existing technologies using high-risk, high-payoff tools, methods, techniques, and products.  The DLIR program partners with commercial industry to perform short-term projects (STPs) in various logistics business areas which align with the Defense Logistics Agency’s (DLA’s) strategic vision. DLIR improves functional and business processes using the latest technologies available, which support the nation’s warfighter. The technical areas of interest are: 1.) Development of Logistics Data Interoperability &amp; Availability. Enhances the functionality and compatibility of data in a complex data environment using supply chain relationships and lifecycle management to allow flexible visibility.  2.)  Next Generation Automated Electronic Commerce and Sourcing.  The Next Generation Automated Electronic Commerce and Sourcing technical area of interest focuses on employing the best of breed processes, practices, and technology to enable and/or streamline electronic commerce from the customer’s point-of-need to point-of-satisfaction.

DLIR is working several short term projects in the first area of interest only. They are positioning DLA to move towards a model-based enterprise (MBE), using and acquiring 3-Dimensional model-based data instead of 2-Dimensional hardcopy for weapon system sustainment and support.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

These tools will improve DLA forecasting and procurement strategy decisions and lead to faster and more flexible response to emerging market and customer requirements. Currently there are three major analytical thrusts: Planning Processes, Medical Supply Chain, and Distribution/Disposition.  Planning processes model and simulate item and customer demand patterns to improve customer support, lower inventories and acquisition costs, and acquisition lead-times for hardware (Class IX items).  Medical Supply Chain Modeling will provide DLA the capability to integrate DLA logistics data and commercial data with satellite and political maps; it will automate for DLA Medical planners the ability to identify entities such as suppliers, customers and vendor distribution centers to enhance spatial awareness of incidents such as catastrophic events and military contingencies.  The Distribution/Disposition thrust will develop, and implement analytical tools, models, and simulations of logistics and supply chain processes related to distribution and disposition.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

It will expand the number of tent and shelter products that have rich technical and performance information available on DOD EMALL. The project is structured to benefit the entire tent manufacturing community by making their product more visible and, more importantly, it will improve the quality of product information available to the warfighter.  Plans include completing data collection and web design for three additional MILSPEC tents, complete modifications, and develop web-based training capability.  

Extension of Supply Chain Simulation project:  This represents additional tasking for an existing project.  The project will simulate the capability of the tent supply chain to surge production under varying conditions and requirements.  We expect this project to produce an effective decision making tool for DLA’s Industrial Capabilities Programs allowing program management to evaluate the effect of placing buffer stocks at various levels within the supply chain.  Anticipate completion by Sept 2011.</r2:Description>

This strategic focus area has 4 thrusts: Technical/Quality Process Improvements, Selected Process Improvements, Medical Processes, and Distribution/Disposition Processes.  

T/Q process improvements to reduce material and internal costs and improve support to warfighters.  Specifically, Cost of Quality processes, increasing use of DOD organic manufacturing capabilities, reduction of ESA reviews caused by Critical Item Reviews.

Selected process improvements cover processes outside the scope of the Technical/Quality (T/Q) Function including identifying improved methods for improving support for Low demand parts, accurate material receipt processes and eCommerce and catalog items as an alternative to stocking items.  

Medical Processes will expand work in critical mechanisms to guarantee product quality of temperature-sensitive medical materiel distributed to our customers, and identify the most efficient and cost-effective means to deliver those medical products in accordance with FDA-labeled and other regulatory requirements.  

Distribution and Disposition logistics processes deal with improving distribution and disposition capabilities, operational effectiveness, and efficiency. While numerous technologies and applications have been developed and exploited, DLA has not kept pace with the commercial industry in regards to modernizing its technology systems infrastructure, processes, or mobilizing information for personnel, customers, and processes.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The Energy Roadmap helps to achieve the operational energy strategy goals of increasing sources of supply, developing and implementing alternative fuels.  The Supply Chain Management Roadmap addresses emerging and out of cycle requirements that always occur and new products and services developed by DLA.   


Included in the budget ($1.250M) is the Print on Demand (POD) project for Mapping Enterprise Business System (MEBS) enhancements.
DLA Headquarters/CC mandated the POD process to establish a web-based tool for DLA Document Services to receive, order and print maps on demand.  

The enhancements improve system capabilities by implementing new and improved program data, user interface, and rules to integrate the POD business process.  These enhancements will greatly improve map services to the warfighter while significantly reducing lead times and lowering overhead costs attributed to printing, storage and shipping.  The POD Project will require an RMD to transfer funds to a new program element prior to the PB16 submission.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Supply Chain Management addresses the emerging technology opportunities that occur out of the budget cycle.  This allows DLA to get a head start undertaking new technological advances without disrupting ongoing programs.  In the past DLA R&amp;D has been able to cut 12 to 24 months off the project starting lead-times.  Saving the lead-time allows the Agency to begin to realize the benefits of implementing new technology sooner than would otherwise be the case and maintain continuity of funding and activity for baseline programs.

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>USTRANSCOM is tasked to provide globally integrated, agile deployment and distribution solutions and related enabling capabilities to support national security, force readiness and sustainability within an increasingly constrained defense budget. Unpredictable and extended global distribution routes, limited visibility of sustainment requirements, force packaging limitations, lift constraints, anti-access/area denial concerns, complex supply chains, as well as non-networked battlefield command and control, planning, and decision support tools impede timely customer logistical support.  To project unimpeded global power and influence, USTRANSCOM must have access to relevant, real-time information and invest in enabling capabilities that contribute to mission success and help ensure the viability of our capabilities and implementation of a relevant transportation strategy.  Effective knowledge sharing, decision support and transparency across the joint logistics enterprise, facilitated by secure enterprise-wide visibility into logistical processes and the ability to effectively collaborate/operate in a contested cyberspace, is required to promote effective, efficient and responsive global management of force projection and sustainment resources.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

This requires investigation into next generation Automated Information Technology (AIT)/Total Asset Visibility (TAV) technologies and/or container security to improve end-to-end distribution visibility and enhance planning/ execution and transform sustainment operations.  Includes the ability to determine immediate, reliable, and accurate shipment status through system access or event management.  Develop an over-arching process and system architecture which will automate and integrate existing and innovative new programs across the supply chain to provide complete In Transit Visibility (ITV) data, to include visibility of non-DOD cargo during humanitarian/disaster relief operations. The ability of USTRANSCOM to supply transportation support for homeland defense and/or disaster relief depends on effective ways to link with other governmental and civilian agencies.  Also need to explore the many barriers across the Joint Deployment and Distribution Enterprise (JDDE), to include non-DOD government entities, coalition partners, non-government organizations, and commercial industry, which can create confusion/conflict or detract from the optimization of the JDDE.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Transportation information exchange across the DOD is inhibited by the disparity of systems, differing data standards, and insufficient interfaces.  Queries and retrieval of status and shipment information cannot be executed due to lack of connectivity between the various components of the supply chain.  The ability to maintain situational awareness of movements at macro/micro (drill down) levels, with associated force and sustainment cargo on board; to track force packages progress, and rapidly determine the impact of any delays or changes to sailing progress and arrival at port of debarkation; and to conduct "what -if" impact assessment of possible changes to delivery asset’s course, speed or departure/arrival information as it relates to force or force package delivery/impact of any change on the closure of force packages in theater is required.  The ability of USTRANSCOM to supply transportation support for homeland defense and/or disaster relief depends on effective ways to link with other governmental and civilian agencies.  Also need to explore the many barriers across the Joint Deployment and Distribution Enterprise (JDDE), to include non-DOD government entities, coalition partners, non-government organizations, and commercial industry, which can create confusion/conflict or detract from the optimization of the JDDE.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Projects in this area address the following: decision support tools, distribution process simulations/analytics, distribution demand forecasting/execution monitoring, training, automated decision-maker support (e.g., queuing, alerting, courses of action), automated status monitoring with information fusion and drilldown capability, and resilient C2 infrastructure capabilities.  Current planning, forecasting and collaboration capabilities do not permit full synchronization of people, processes and assets to execute planned operations.  Automated tools must be able to dynamically analyze/predict demand and provide input to advanced distribution planning systems.  Transportation information exchange across the DOD is inhibited by disparate systems, multiple data standards and insufficient interfaces.  The ability to maintain situational awareness of movements at macro/micro (drill down) levels, with associated force and sustainment cargo on board; to track force packages progress, and rapidly determine the impact of any delays or changes to sailing progress and arrival at port of debarkation; and to conduct "what -if" impact assessment of possible changes to delivery asset’s course, speed or departure/arrival information as it relates to force or force package delivery/impact of any change on the closure of force packages in theater is required.

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Department has found it critical to National Security to maintain an ability to produce legacy microelectronics long after they are available from commercial foundries which move to more advanced technology levels based upon the global market. The Defense Microelectronics Activity (DMEA) uniquely accomplishes this mission for the Department by providing both a trusted and assured supply of microelectronics parts that are no longer available from, or bid by, commercial sources but are essential to combat operations. This is a critical capability in an atmosphere of increasing worldwide supply chain risks with threats to defense microelectronics. The threats include risks, such as, counterfeiting, Trojan horses, unreliability and rapid obsolescence coming from an unpredictable and unsecured supply chain. As fiscal pressures force the Department to maintain its weapon systems longer than originally planned and their extended combat use increases attrition, the need for DMEA’s unique capabilities increases.

Microelectronics is a crucial technology and central for all operations within the Department. Yet, as vital as this technology is to Department operations, the defense market represents less than 0.1% share of the total global semiconductor market. The Department frequently requires legacy microelectronics long after commercial foundries have moved on to advanced technology levels. As such, the semiconductor industry does not respond to the Department’s particular needs of ultra-low volumes, long availability time frames, or its high-level security concerns. In these cases, DMEA procures a license to produce technologies in-house that are no longer commercially manufactured or are unavailable due to no-bids owing to low volume requirements. These licenses enable DMEA to be the Department’s microelectronics supplier of last resort, providing the Department with a long-term, trusted, and assured source.

DMEA provides increasingly rare microelectronics design and fabrication skills to ensure that the Department is provided with systems capable of ensuring technological superiority over potential adversaries. DMEA provides decisive, quick turn solutions for defense, intelligence, special operations, cyber and combat missions as well as microelectronic components that are unobtainable in the commercial market. DMEA’s knowledge of varying military requirements across a broad and diverse range of combatant environments and missions—along with its unique technical perspective—allows it to develop, manage and implement novel microelectronic solutions to enhance mission capability. DMEA then uses these cutting-edge technology capabilities and products in the solutions it develops for its military clientele. After many years of performing analogous efforts, the technical experience, mission knowledge, and practical judgment that are gained from preceding efforts are often incorporated into subsequent technology maturation projects. DMEA’s capabilities make it a key tool in the intelligent and rapid development and application of advanced technologies to identified military needs.

Working alongside industry, DMEA has created a model partnership that provides this capability for the Department. DMEA’s uniquely flexible foundry supports the Department with a wide variety of integrated circuits using various processes that were developed by commercial manufacturers and which are now assured to remain in one location for as long as they are needed. To obtain these processes, DMEA works closely with U.S. semiconductor industry partners to acquire process licenses. These Government-held licenses allow for the transfer to DMEA of industry-developed intellectual property (IP) and the related processes for Department needs. These licenses ensure no commercial conflicts by including industry’s right to bid first on resulting production volumes. DMEA always looks to industry first to see if it can provide the required components. If not, only then does DMEA provide the necessary prototypes and low volume production. A critical element required to make this business model work effectively is protection of the industry partners’ valuable IP and processes. DMEA is Government owned and operated, providing the structure and confidence that an industry partner’s IP is protected from potential competitors. This strategic and cooperative industry partnership approach allows DMEA to use industry-developed IP and processes by acquiring, installing, and applying them toward meeting the immediate and long-term needs of the Department. This unique capability is essential to all major weapon systems, combat operations, and support needs. As such, DMEA serves the Department, other US Agencies, industry and Allied nations.

DMEA assists hundreds of Department programs every year. DMEA has provided its specialized engineering assistance and capabilities to older systems, current systems, and even to programs not yet in the production phase. This includes the F-18 Super Hornet, F-22 Raptor, F-35, RQ-4 Global Hawk, MQ-9 Reaper, AEGIS Advanced Surface Missile System, Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM), Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM), among many other programs. DMEA assists the Combatant Commands (COCOMs) including Special Ops, Cyber, Intelligence, and the Radiation-Hard communities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Technology Development funds provide DMEA with the core resources to execute its primary mission of providing an in-house ability to quickly develop and execute appropriate solutions to keep a weapon system operational, elevate its sophistication level or to meet new threats. These solutions use high mix, low volume, unique microelectronics that are endemic to military requirements but are not commercially available. These funds provide for the development and support necessary to ensure rapid prototyping, insertion, and support of microelectronics technologies into fielded systems, particularly as the technologies advance. DMEA maintains critical microelectronics design and fabrication skills to ensure that the Department is provided with systems capable of ensuring technological superiority over potential adversaries. DMEA provides an in-house capability to support these strategically important microelectronics technologies within the Department with distinctive resources to meet the Department’s requirements across the entire spectrum of technology development, acquisition, and long-term support. This includes producing components to meet the Department’s requirements for ultra-low volume, an extended availability timeframe, and a trusted, assured, and secure supply of microelectronics. These funds provide basic infrastructure upgrades as well as an in-house technical staff of skilled and experienced microelectronics personnel working in state-of-the-practice facilities providing technical and application engineering support for the implementation of advanced microelectronics research technologies from inspection and analysis through design, fabrication, test, assembly, integration and installation. These funds also provide for the recapitalization and modernization of aging microelectronic infrastructure, acquisition and implementation of design and test tools, the development of advanced techniques to inspect and analyze circuits, the adaptation of tools and processes to detect increasingly sophisticated counterfeit microelectronics in the defense supply chain, the development of trusted field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and the extension of the process technologies that are necessary to keep pace with the needs of the Department as weapon system support requirements migrate toward current state-of-the-art technologies. DMEA’s capabilities make it a key resource in the intelligent and rapid application of advanced technologies to add needed performance enhancements in response to the newest asymmetric threats and to modernize aging weapon systems. DMEA designs, develops, and supports vital classified assets for ongoing and time-sensitive specialized intelligence operations and missions of the Department and the Special Operations Commands.

Today’s weapon systems experience extended field operations and/or are required to remain in service beyond planned replacements, driving the need for growth in DMEA’s unique capabilities. This need, along with the continual contraction of commercial resources, makes DMEA the only available resource allowing these systems to remain operational. As such, DMEA and its capability are considered a National Critical Asset.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Department and the National Security Agency (NSA) require uninterruptible access to state-of-the-art design and manufacturing processes to produce custom integrated circuits designed specifically for military purposes. Under DODI 5200.44, Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) in critical/essential systems must be procured from Trusted sources in order to avoid tampered or sabotaged parts. Worldwide competition from foreign, state-subsidized manufacturing facilities continues to greatly reduce the number of U.S. semiconductor fabrication facilities that might be Trusted sources. The prevalence of sophisticated offshore design and manufacturing facilities with economic incentives of state subsidies have resulted in the outsourcing of electronics component and integrated circuit services to these offshore facilities. This trend threatens the integrity and worldwide leadership of the U.S. semiconductor industry by eliminating many domestic suppliers and reducing access to Trusted fabrication sources for advanced technologies. This trend is of acute concern to the defense and intelligence communities. Secure communications and cryptographic applications, among other areas of defense interest, depend heavily upon high performance semiconductors where a generation of improvement can translate into a significant force multiplier and capability advantage. Important defense technology investments and demonstrations carry size, weight, power, and performance goals that can only be met through the use of the most sophisticated semiconductors.

The Trusted Microelectronics program provides the Department and NSA with access to the Trusted state-of-the-art microelectronics design and manufacturing capabilities necessary to meet their confidentiality, integrity, availability, performance and delivery needs. The program also provides the Services with a competitive cadre of accredited Trusted suppliers that can meet the needs of their mission critical/essential systems for Trusted integrated circuit components. The NSA Trusted Access Program Office has successfully contracted with commercial sources to satisfy their state-of-the-art semiconductor requirements. It is imperative for a wide range of technologies in ongoing and future Department/ and NSA systems that access to Trusted suppliers continues. Most importantly, Trusted Microelectronics access is absolutely necessary to meet secure communication and cryptographic needs requiring state-of-the-art semiconductor technologies.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The BEIS utilized the mature, existing infrastructure of Defense Corporate Database/Defense Corporate Warehouse (DCD/DCW), Defense Departmental Reporting System (DDRS), and Defense Cash Accountability System (DCAS) to provide timely, accurate, and reliable business information from across the DoD to support auditable financial statements as well as provide detailed information visibility for management in support of the Warfighter.  The goals of BEIS are to ensure data compliance with Standard Financial Information Structure (SFIS) standards; provide security-defined, enterprise-level access to information for ad hoc management queries; and produce external financial management reports/statements based on standardized data.  BEIS provides solutions to these goals by:
- Establishing the authoritative source for SFIS values and providing for standardization by implementing SFIS and United States Standard General Ledger (USSGL) compliant financial reporting capabilities for Audited Financial Statements and Budgetary Reports.
- Providing an enterprise-wide information environment that will serve as the single source for enterprise-wide financial information.
- Serving as the DoD-wide system for Treasury Reporting.
- Providing decision makers with significantly greater access to financial information through data visibility and business intelligence (e.g., Executive Dashboard).
The BEIS functional baseline encompasses a family of services organized into six distinct lines of business, four of which have achieved Full Operational Capability (FOC).  The remaining two services, Financial Reporting Services and Cash Accountability Reporting Services, will provide DoD enterprise-wide financial visibility and will serve as the centralized financial data source and the single source for enterprise Audited Financial Statements and Budgetary Reports, as well as Treasury Reporting.  The BEIS financial management capabilities will be used by the Military Services, Defense Agencies, and the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller).  These modernization efforts will complete deployment/implementation of BEIS capabilities and will serve the Department Auditability goals and objectives.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

‒In November 2013, BEIS DDRS deployed SFIS Compliant Budgetary Reporting for National Defense University (NDU) Enterprise Business Accountability System (EBAS), Washington Headquarters Services (WHS) EBAS, and Financial Accounting Management Information System (FAMIS) accounting systems.  
‒In September 2014, the DDRS and DCAS system components of BEIS achieved Full Deployment to successfully complete BEIS Increment I.  
-DDRS transitioned back to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) for sustainment in September 2014, while the DCAS system component is slated to transition by end of FY15.
BEIS DCAS Cash Accountability Reporting Services:
‒BEIS DCAS implemented the final deployment of the PowerBuilder to Web (PB2WEB) software to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) in May 2014.</r2:Text>

                                                <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>BEIS leveraged existing infrastructure in DoD’s investment in DCD/DCW, DDRS, and DCAS. BEIS formally implemented a portfolio management approach to program management that helped to ensure a management strategy was in place to better reallocate assets within the portfolio. BEIS has and will continue to deliver needed capabilities more rapidly and efficiently using a Family of Systems (FoS) concept providing a functional baseline organized into six distinct lines of business: General Ledger Services, Business Integration Services, Reference Data Services, Enterprise Level Business Intelligence Services, Cash Accountability and Reporting Services, and Financial Reporting Services. These services are provided by individual IT systems that collectively, make up the BEIS FoS. The BEIS FoS program is composed of four core systems; Defense Departmental Reporting System (DDRS), Defense Cash Accountability System (DCAS) Enterprise Business Intelligence (EBI), and Defense Corporate Database/Defense Corporate Warehouse (DCD/DCW). Capabilities are being developed incrementally with multiple releases per year to meet the Enterprise Transition Plan milestones provided to Congress. BEIS has achieved FOC for the following system components/services: DCD/DCW, to include General Ledger Services, Business Integration Services, Reference Data Services, and Enterprise Business Intelligence (EBI) and transitioned these to DFAS for operations and sustainment.   Based on the list of remaining requirements for BEIS DDRS Financial Reporting Services and BEIS DCAS Cash Accountability and Reporting Services an overall schedule including integrated activities as well as identified products and milestones has been developed. Contracts are competitively awarded to keep costs down. Intra-governmental services are being used where possible for infrastructure support by the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) Technical Services Organization and Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Information Processing Center.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Defense Information System for Security (DISS) is a family of systems solution that specifically addresses the security clearance and suitability determinations requirements of Section 3001 of Public Law 108-458, the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (IRTPA) which requires 90% of all clearances – whether Top Secret, Secret, or Confidential – to be completed within 60 days, as well as supports Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12) compliance across the DOD.  The DISS will electronically collect, review, and share relevant data, government-wide, as mandated by the IRPTA and, guided by relevant Executive Orders, Congress, and GAO recommendations, deliver and maintain an appropriately vetted world-class workforce.  

As a secure, end-to-end IT system, the DISS will be the authoritative source for the management, storage, and timely dissemination of and access to personnel security, HSPD-12, and suitability information and will accelerate the clearance process, reduce security clearance vulnerabilities, decrease back-end processing timelines, and support simultaneous information sharing within various DOD entities as well as among a number of authorized federal agencies.  

The DISS family of systems is comprised of two components: the Case Adjudication Tracking System (CATS) and the Joint Verification System (JVS).  Once fully deployed, the DISS family of systems will replace the Joint Personnel Adjudication System, which contains approximately six million active security clearance records and supports over 80,000 users.  The DISS has also been designated as the repository for adjudicative results for Suitability and HSPD-12 determinations by the 13 July 2011 USD(I) memo “Storage of Adjudicative Results in the Defense Information System for Security.”</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                        <r2:Description>The DISS CATS has been designated as the DoD non-Intelligence Community IT system for case management and adjudications by the 10 April 2009 USD(I) memo “Designation of the DoD Case Management and Adjudication Systems.”  Currently, CATS processes over 500,000 cases annually; electronically producing favorable adjudicative decisions for approximately 24% of Secret level cases.

Further, the 3 May 2012 Deputy Secretary of Defense Memo “DoD Central Adjudication Facilities (CAF) Consolidation” consolidated all DoD CAF into one consolidated DoD CAF responsible for personnel security adjudicative functions as well as favorable Suitability and HSPD-12 adjudications.  The DISS (CATS) is the DOD CAF’s designated IT case management system.

Achieving the above goals will significantly enhance the operational readiness of the national security community and the Federal government.  It will decrease the time required to get an individual through the investigation process.  It will strengthen and reinforce reciprocity throughout the federal community by eliminating redundant or incomplete investigations by standardizing adjudicative decisions and by making available to all agencies adjudicative determinations of the Federal government.</r2:Description>

On May 09, 2013, the DISS CATS received a Full Deployment (FD) Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) which acknowledged that CATS was operationally fielded at the five adjudication facilities and authorized the DISS PMO to enhance and field a consolidated CATS (CATS v4) and its associated portal in order to improve the lifecycle management of the CATS by consolidating the existing CATS applications into a consolidated CATS application that uses a single database.  The July 11, 2014 “DISS Acquisition Strategy Revision Acquisition Decision Memorandum” revised the DISS acquisition strategy to field the remaining JVS capability not contained in the CATS.  The JVS Milestone B is scheduled for 2nd Quarter, Fiscal Year 2015. 

The DISS PMO is responsible for program execution and will employ contract types as directed by the agency contracts policies in order to support the delivery and sustainment of the DISS Capabilities. DISS development contractors employ an agile development methodology to allow for a flexible approach that incorporates user requirements and feedback throughout the development lifecycle while meeting delivery requirements as prescribed by the associated development contract. The Agile development methodology allows for the fielding of incremental capabilities IAW the program’s acquisition approach.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Defense Travel System (DTS) is a fully integrated, electronic, end-to-end financial management system that automates temporary duty travel for the Department of Defense (DoD). DTS meets unique DoD mission, security and financial system requirements within the guidelines of Federal and DoD travel policies and regulations. DTS automates travel authorizations, reservations and arrangements, voucher processing, payment, reconciliation, accountability and archiving. DTS employs Digital Signature and Login/Authentication which requires users to provide a signed response using a valid DoD Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificate to gain access to the DTS application. Travel documents created in DTS are digitally signed with the user’s PKI certificate to provide a means of identifying the signer, verifying the document’s integrity, and enforcing non-repudiation of the signature by the signer.

DTS is a Major Automated Information System (MAIS), Acquisition Category (ACAT) 1AC program. DTS delivers capability by evolutionary acquisition utilizing incremental development; recognizing up front the need for future capability improvements. DTS has a flexible design so that each increment builds upon its core functionality, dependent on available, mature technology providing increasing capabilities to travelers, travel administrators, and process owners. Full Operational Capability (FOC) was declared in March 2010. Future capability improvements will be implemented as P3I beginning FY 2011.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

-Simplify User Interface/Usability Enhancements
-User functionality enhancements based upon user community requirements
-Address system changes if needed in support of DoD Audit Readiness objectives
-Integrate the existing Services' Defense Lodging Systems (DLS) with the DTS to allow display and booking of available, on-base military lodging at all installations, via travel industry standard formatted transactions used by DLS. DTS will also incorporate the Preferred Lodging initiative which will provide the capability to search, display, and book preferred lodging
-Implement changes to Defense Enterprise Accounting and Management System (DEAMS) that will allow Air Force, Air National Guard, and Air Force Reserve personnel to travel on a DTS/DEAMS Line of Accounting (LOA) that includes the Reimbursable Funding Document Number. This process change will maximize automation and minimize manual tasks while achieving Financial Improvement  and Audit Readiness (FIAR) standards</r2:Text>

DRAS 2 will replace the current Defense Retiree and Annuitant Systems (DRAS) and selected manual processes with proven state of the market technology using Clinger-Cohen guidance for selection of the solution.  Rapid fielding techniques will be used to close business process gaps by delivering incremental capability that provides clear financial benefits.  This modernization will allow for the consolidation of disparate DRAS systems and processes, the reduction of system redundancies and inefficiencies, increased customer satisfaction and compliance to Department of Defense (DoD) and federally mandated Information Assurance (IA) requirements.  The DRAS2 modernization is in keeping with the DoD Strategic Management Plan for FY2014-2015 goals and the White House CIO Council 2.0 initiatives.  In FY2015, DRAS 2 has it's own PE 0605090S separate from the PE referenced in this submission.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Enterprise Funds Distribution (EFD) is a multi-service/multi-agency solution established as a key initiative to provide full visibility of funds distributed through echelon I and II for the Military Departments and at all levels for the Defense Agencies to improve and modernize the OUSD(C) funds distribution process.   Funds distribution by its nature is a key enabler of financial visibility within DoD enterprise systems. The concept of a fully visible enterprise funds distribution process serves as a reference where planned and coordinated funds development and execution takes place.  

Within the current DoD environment, progress has been made streamlining a diverse set of stove-piped budget execution and funds distribution processes and systems.  Efforts continue to improve the visibility of funding information, eliminate manual efforts and  undue complexities to the management of budget authority, and to eliminate impediments in the flow of funding documents.  The current environment relies heavily on manual processing and on disconnected standalone systems for the processing of Funding Authorization Documents (FADs) and reprogramming actions.   This environment made the implementation of internal controls difficult, negatively impacted the accuracy and timeliness of information while making the processes of integrating and obtaining management information arduous.  

The envisioned operational environment solves these problems by enabling lifecycle program value management in a web-based application utilizing an authoritative database with single-source data entry and automated workflow.  Capabilities within this integrated environment will enable the automation of all funds distribution and funds control processes within OUSD(C) using authoritative and highly visible data.  Specifically, capabilities include managing apportionments, distributing budget authority to the Military Departments and Defense Agencies, managing rescissions and continuing resolutions, creating and tracking reprogramming actions, and establishing program baselines and budget authority needed to support changes in funding priorities throughout the year.

The operational environment includes organizational elements down to the echelon II level responsible for managing DoD and Component appropriations operating in an unclassified environment.  The web-based application provides pre-planning, apportionment, reprogramming, rescission, continuing resolution, reporting of enterprise-level funds control and distribution of appropriated funding.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The DAI mission is to deliver auditable Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Act compliant business environments for Defense Agencies providing accurate, timely, authoritative financial data supporting the DoD goal of standardizing financial management practices improving financial decision support, and supporting audit readiness.  Currently, Defense Agencies use more than 10 different non-compliant financial management systems supporting diverse operational functions and the warfighter in decision making and financial reporting.  These disparate, non-integrated systems do not meet statutory requirements to produce timely, auditable reports.


The DAI program modernizes the Defense Agencies’ financial management processes by streamlining financial management capabilities, addressing financial reporting material weaknesses, and supporting financial statement auditability for the majority of  agencies and field activities across the DoD.  DAI will support a transformation of budget, finance, and accounting processes across participating defense agencies to help improve the quality of financial information, supporting financial auditability and decision making.   The DAI business solution, once implemented, will provide a near real-time, web-based system from a “.mil” environment of integrated business processes that will enable in excess of 84,000 Defense Agency financial managers, program managers, auditors, and Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) representatives to make sound financial business decisions.


The DAI implementation approach is to deploy a standardized system solution that is consistent with requirements in the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA) and the DoD Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA), while leveraging the out-of-the-box capabilities of the selected Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) product, Oracle e-Business Suite (EBS), version 11i (R11).  DAI implemented an Office of Management and Budget Financial Systems Integration Office (FSIO) qualified COTS financial management business solution with common business processes and data standards.   The Program Management Office (PMO) will not develop any objects that are included in core COTS software or services (i.e. vendor data from Federal authoritative source).  


DAI supports the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) Strategy 5, “Reform the business and support functions of the Defense enterprise”.  DAI is also aligned to the FY 2014/FY 2015 DOD Strategic Management Plan Business Goal 2: “Strengthen DoD financial management to respond to warfighter needs and sustain public confidence through auditable financial statements”. The objective of the Defense Agencies Initiative is to achieve auditable, CFO Act compliant business environments for the Defense Agencies with accurate, timely, authoritative financial data. 


The primary goal is to deploy a standardized system solution to improve overall financial management and comply with BEA, Standard Financial Information Structure (SFIS), and Office of Federal Financial Management (OFFM) requirements. Common business functions within budget execution include  the Department’s BEA End to End (E2E) business processes: Cost Management; Budget to Report; Procure to Pay;  Acquire to Retire (real property lifecycle accounting only); Hire to Retire (Time and Labor reporting only); and Order to Cash.  Future capabilities will support Defense Working Capital Fund accounting, Budget Formulation, Grants Financial Management, and Re-Sale Accounting (for Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA)) as well as a Contract Writing capability.


DAI is currently implemented at 11 Defense Agencies and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Comptroller, (OUSD(C)) (Time and Labor only) and supporting over 9,200 users.  In addition, since Oracle is phasing out maintenance of Oracle EBS, Release 11i, the program is required to migrate to EBS Release 12 (R12). The program office is also responsible for operational sustainment of the system.  Funds are required for additional government and contractor support, licenses, maintenance, and hardware to accomplish the remaining capability developments and organizational deployments, complete the R12 upgrade, initiate the annual Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE 16) assertion packages, and sustain the system.  


The benefits of DAI are:
- Common business processes and data standards;
- Access to real-time financial data transactions;
- Significantly reduced data reconciliation requirements;
- Enhanced analysis and decision support capabilities; Standardized line of accounting with the use of SFIS; and
- Use of United States Standard General Ledger (USSGL) Chart of Accounts to resolve DoD material weaknesses and deficiencies.


The DAI PMO will provide the R12 Upgrade system integration services that include: acquisition management, project management; blueprinting; design, build, and unit test; developing required Reports, Interfaces, Conversions, Extensions, Forms and Workflows (RICEFW) objects; testing (information assurance, integration, functional, performance, conversion, security, user acceptance, operational); end-user training (train the trainer/change management preparing the users for the cross functional skills and awareness needed to perform well with an integrated enterprise resource planning system); system deployment; conversion; information assurance; sustainment; data service; help desk support; as well as studies and analysis support.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

DRAS 2 will replace the current Defense Retiree and Annuitant Systems (DRAS) and selected manual processes with proven state of the market technology using Clinger-Cohen guidance for selection of the solution.  Rapid fielding techniques will be used to close business process gaps by delivering incremental capability that provides clear financial benefits.  This modernization will allow for the consolidation of disparate DRAS systems and processes, the reduction of system redundancies and inefficiencies, increased customer satisfaction and compliance to Department of Defense (DoD) and federally mandated Information Assurance (IA) requirements.  The DRAS2 modernization is in keeping with the DoD Strategic Management Plan for FY2014-2015 goals and the White House CIO Council 2.0 initiatives.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Defense Logistics Agency’s (DLA's) ability to deliver Americans the right logistics solution in every transaction requires more than successful management of the Department's wholesale supplies and suppliers. It requires supply chain excellence. Our military's ability to generate and sustain combat readiness indefinitely, anywhere on the globe requires that DLA-managed materiel flow seamlessly and as needed from the nation's industrial base to where it is ultimately used.

DLA's Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) program seeks to solicit high-risk research and development proposals from the small business community. All selections shall demonstrate and involve a degree of technical risk where the technical feasibility of the proposed work has not been fully established. Phase I proposals should demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed technology and the merit of a Phase II for a prototype or at least a proof-of-concept demonstration. Phase II selections will be strongly influenced on future market possibilities and commercialization potential demonstrated.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs will develop new dual-use technologies for possible future Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) needs.  Dual-use means the technologies will be judged on their potential for future private sector investment both as a vehicle for reducing development time and cost, unit costs of new DLA technologies, and as a route to national economic growth through new commercial products. DLA will conduct the competition as well as award and manage the contracts.

The Defense Logistics Agency`s SBIR/STTR investments are divided into multiple Research Areas identified from within three DLA Elements:

J3 R&amp;D
- Advanced Battery Manufacturing (BATTNET): 
- Advanced Castings and Forgings (PRO-Fast):
- Anti Counterfeiting:

- Second in terms of the congressional definition of “commercialization,” as defined by Office of Secretary of Defense Office of Small Business Programs (OSD/OSBP) Re-Authorization Policy Directive:
-- (Investment) The process of developing products, processes, technologies, or services; and/or 
-- (Sales)  The production and delivery (whether by the originating party or by others) of products, processes, technologies, or services for sale to or use by the Federal Government or commercial markets.

Modern battlefield requirements demand subsistence support that adequately provides for the needs of our military personnel in extremely intense and highly mobile combat situations that can be easily adapted to the civilian sector for humanitarian feeding. In FY 2014, DLA Troop Support Subsistence sold $4 billion in subsistence goods and services to the Department of Defense and other customers. The Rations portion of this business was $702M in FY 2014. The Combat, Humanitarian and Disaster Relief Rations R&amp;D funding request is .002% of sales. The Combat Rations Program is focused on improving the manufacturing technologies related to the production and distribution of the combat rations that are at the forefront of these operations, including Meals Ready to Eat (MREs) as well as Unitized Group Rations (UGR). The objectives are increased readiness, improved quality, optimum sizing for transportation and storage; and better ration variety. CORANET research efforts also help control the cost of the combat rations. The CORANET program engages all elements of the supply chain including the producers, military Services, Army Natick Soldier Research Development and Engineering Center, United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), US Army Veterinary Command, US Army Public Health Command, DLA Logistics R&amp;D, DLA Troop Support Subsistence and academia to research and transition improved technologies for Combat, Humanitarian and Disaster Relief Rations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Department of Defense, through the Defense Logistics Agency, spends upwards of $2 billion per year on military uniforms and individual equipment. The lead-time is up to 15 months for these items. The CDUM program concluded in October 2014 and continuing CDUM projects have been transitioned into the Military Uniform System Technology (MUST) Program.   The Military Uniform System Technology (MUST) Program was initiated in 4th quarter 2014. The strategic objective of the DLA Military Uniform System Technology (MUST) Program is to identify, adapt, and adopt technologies that can significantly reduce the lead-time from development to sustainment from years to months or weeks for the military uniforms and individual equipment.  The Program focuses on quick-reaction and technologies that will transform the military uniform supply chain from a two-dimensional (2D), manual environment into a three-dimensional (3D), digital environment.  The resulting knowledge based system will develop a neutral platform that will seamlessly communicate military uniform requirements to the military uniform industrial base.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Weapon system spare parts managed by DLA that contain castings are responsible for a disproportionate share of DLA’s backorders. Cast parts are ~2% of all hardware National Stock Numbered parts but represent ~4% of all backorders, and when only the oldest backorders are considered up to 10% are castings.  PRO-ACT develops methods and technologies to improve the supply of cast parts. We take a holistic view of the problem and attacks root causes inside DLA, at DLA’s engineering support activity partners in the Services, and at DLA casting suppliers.  This program includes tasks in developing new and improved metalcasting capabilities in the areas of inspection, materials, modeling, and design.  Once developed these capabilities will support the foundry industry, where the technologies will be tested and implemented.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Weapon system spare parts managed by DLA that contain forgings are responsible for a disproportionate share of DLA’s backorders.  Forged parts are ~2% of National Stock Numbered parts but represent ~4% of all backorders, and when only the oldest backorders are considered up to 10% are forgings. This program develops methods and technologies to improve the supply of forged parts.  This program takes a holistic view of the problem and attacks root causes inside DLA, at DLA’s engineering support activity partners in the Services, and at DLA forging suppliers.  The program has three thrusts: Business Enterprise Integration to improve supply support approaches; FORGE-IT to develop and improve technical problems; and R&amp;D which develops new technology for forging suppliers, including new methods for making forge dies (typically the longest lead time and expensive item) and for simulation of metal flow inside the forge die (to eliminate trial and error development of the die).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Develop a capability to emulate most obsolete digital integrated circuits (ICs) in the Federal catalog using a single, flexible manufacturing line.  DoD has estimated $2.9 billion is spent every five years redesigning circuit card assemblies.  Many of these circuit card redesigns are performed to mitigate IC obsolescence.  Commercial ICs have short Product Life Cycles (often only 18 months).  IC Manufacturers subsequently move on to later generations of ICs, leaving little to no sources for their previous IC products.  DoD maintains weapons systems much longer than IC lifecycles, resulting in an obsolescence problem.  In order to avoid costs and potential readiness issues associated with buying/carrying excess inventories acquired before commercial availability ceases, or redesigning the next higher assembly to mitigate the obsolete IC, DLA (as the manager of 88% of the IC Federal Stock Class) must have the capability to manufacture needed IC devices.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The newly transitioned Emulation capability will address several discontinued device families and will increase the potential Emulation production envelope by several hundred NSNs.  MAE completed development of a flexible NMOS/PMOS Digital Microcircuit Emulation capability. MAE continued development of additional implementations including higher density Read-Only and Random-Access Memory, Advanced Emitter-Coupled Logic and Closed-Cell CMOS capabilities. MAE continued 350 and 250 nanometer Emulation fabrication process development, bringing new capabilities to the Customers and Agency.</r2:Text>

Partner Contracts were based upon proposals that demonstrated knowledge, experience, and expertise in the following areas of interest: Automation, Battery Maintenance, Competition &amp; Contracting Requirements, Diminishing Manufacturing &amp; Supply, Lithium Battery Safety, Reducing Acquisition Costs, Shelf Life, Supply Chain Logistics, Surge/Sustainment, and Technology Transition/Insertion. The BATTNET, which includes a Government Steering Group (GSG) of power source technical experts from the military services R&amp;D groups, is informed of general R&amp;D requirements for supply chain improvement. The partners develop among themselves related R&amp;D projects, which are then formally evaluated by the GSG. Selected projects are then chartered within DLA and planned for contract STP awards when funds are available.  Additional projects were awarded to BATTNET partners from FY12 Industrial Base Innovation Fund (IBIF).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Material Availability (MA) Strategic Focus Area (SFA) are R&amp;D efforts undertaken with DLA’s industrial base to reduce material costs, reduce the length and variability of Production Lead-Times and assure the DLA managed products meet requirements, and continuously improve in the quality and reliability. Benefits of this SFA include lower material costs, lower inventory levels and more predictable Customer Wait Times, fewer quality deficiencies and lower customer support costs.  This strategic focus area includes within its scope the former Combat Rations Program, the Battery Program, the Castings and the Forgings programs.  

This SFA is comprised of five roadmaps for Batteries, Combat Rations, Castings, Forgings, and Additive Manufacturing.  

The Battery network objective is to develop the next generation of battery manufacturing technologies for cost and price efficiency, longer shelf life, and lighter batteries with higher energy. The network conducts R&amp;D initiatives to address sustainment gaps and bridge technical solutions into higher MRLs for specific groups of batteries. For FY2013, DLA received 130,600 orders for 2.76 million batteries at $177M net value.

The Combat Rations network is focused on improving the manufacturing technologies related to the production and distribution of the combat rations that are at the forefront of operations, including Meals Ready to Eat (MREs) and Unitized Group Rations (UGR). The objectives are increased readiness, improved quality, optimum sizing for transportation and storage, and better ration variety. CORANET research efforts also help control the cost of the combat rations. The CORANET program engages all elements of the supply chain including the producers, military Services, Army Natick Soldier Research Development and Engineering Center, United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), US Army Veterinary Command, US Army Public Health Command, DLA Logistics R&amp;D, DLA Troop Support Subsistence and academia to research and transition improved technologies for operational rations.    

The Castings consortium objective is to develop methods and technologies to improve the supply of cast parts; looking at root causes of supply issues inside DLA and at casting suppliers.  This program includes tasks to develop new and improved metalcasting capabilities in the areas of inspection, materials, modeling, and design.  Once developed these capabilities will support the foundry industry, where the technologies will be tested and implemented. Weapon system spare parts managed by DLA that contain castings are responsible for a disproportionate share of DLA’s backorders.  Cast parts are ~2% of National Stock Numbered parts but represent ~4% of all backorders, and when only the oldest backorders are considered up to 10% are castings.  

The Forgings consortium objective is to develop methods and technologies to improve the supply of forged parts; looking at root causes of supply issues inside DLA and at forging suppliers. The program has three thrusts: Business Enterprise Integration to improve supply support approaches; FORGE-IT to develop and improve technical problems; and R&amp;D which develops new technology for forging suppliers, including new methods for making forge dies (typically the longest lead time and expensive item) and for simulation of metal flow inside the forge die to eliminate trial and error development of the die. Weapon system spare parts managed by DLA that contain forgings are responsible for a disproportionate share of DLA’s backorders.  Forged parts are ~2% of National Stock Numbered parts but represent ~4% of all backorders, and when only the oldest backorders are considered up to 10% are forgings. 

The Additive Manufacturing (AM) objective is to establish AM as an effective alternative to conventional manufacturing and document the process for AM benefits.  DLA needs to exploit AM technology as a lead-time and inventory reduction enabler.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Proposals are required to include a business case with specific metrics and transition plan for success. The Battery network will also pursue additional battery manufacturing advances from successful DLA SBIR projects selected in FY2014.
FY 17: 2.070	FY 18: 2.107	FY 19: 2.159	FY 20: 2.202

The Combat Rations network plan is to complete STP 4018 and begin implementation.  Complete STP 4017 and establish follow-on Project which will incorporate Inspection Improvement recommendations into a quality process review for effective and efficient implementation of the new Food Safety Act requirements.

The Additive Manufacturing plan is for DLA to partner with the Military Services to use AM to produce parts. DLA and the Services will identify candidate parts, convert technical data to 3D format to facilitate AM, procure the parts, and document the process for AM benefits. The Services will review newly created technical data packages (TDP), test the parts, and qualify AM as an acceptable process to produce the parts.

FY 16 – FY 20: Funding for Additive projects will be reallocated from other MA SFA thrusts and classified into the Additive  Manufacturing Thrust.</r2:Text>

Benefits include eliminating cancelled requisitions returned to customers as “non-procurable.” This strategic focus area includes within its scope the former Material Acquisition Electronics program.  

The Material Acquisition Electronics roadmap has four major thrusts: Advanced Schottky TTL, TTL Compatible CMOS, 512 Kilobit RAM/ROM and Mega Gate ASIC.  These are classes of microcircuits that are expected to become non-procurable in FY 17 and beyond.  Without the technologies planned on the MAE Roadmap, DLA will not be able to support DoD’s requirements for high quality spare parts for critical electronic systems and subsystems. 

The Strategic Materials roadmap is a new thrust for the DLA Mantech program.  It is designed to ensure that critical strategic materials are available from domestic sources and that process innovations are in place to efficiently process or recover strategic materials. Domestic capabilities can enhance national security and potentially reduce Defense Stockpile requirements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

MAE will continue planning for the specific Emulation technology implementations to support specific device family groups in consonance with Customer and Agency requirements. MAE will transition flexible NMOS/PMOS Digital Microcircuit Emulation capability into full-scale production increasing DLA’s ability to re-establish sourcing of non-procurable microcircuit NSNs.  MAE will also complete development and transition higher density Read-Only and Random-Access Memory, Advanced Emitter-Coupled Logic and Closed-Cell CMOS capabilities into full-scale production further increasing DLA’s ability to re-establish sourcing of non-procurable microcircuit NSNs. The newly transitioned Emulation capabilities will address several discontinued device families and will increase the potential Emulation production envelope by several hundred NSNs.  MAE will also initiate several new implementations including development of Advanced Schottky TTL and TTL-Compatible CMOS Emulation Capabilities. It will continue prototyping 350 nanometer Emulation circuitry, bringing Emulation capability that re-establishes sources for additional NSNs.</r2:Text>

Strategic Materials: New Start in 2016. A request for white paper proposals was recently added to DLA’s Emerging R&amp;D Requirements BAA for critical initial manufacturing technology requirements in domestic high strength carbon fibers.  Additional targeted requirements will be determined with DLA Strategic Materials.  Targeted requests for proposals will be conducted to address specific needs and opportunities to ensure that critical strategic materials are available from domestic sources and that process innovations are in place to efficiently produce strategic materials. Manufacturing technologies and capabilities are expected to transition to Title III or specific Weapon System Program funds for industrial base qualification.

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Industry and Customer Collaboration Strategic Focus Area (SFA) projects improve and facilitate the communication of technical and logistics information among industry, DLA’s military customers and DLA. This SFA includes Military Uniform System Technology and the Defense Logistics Information Research (P.E. 0603712S) within its scope.  The movement of the DLIR related work from P.E. 0603712S to the DOD ManTech Program aligns the funding to the critical interface between DLA and industry and away from internal DLA operations.  

This Strategic Focus Area has 5 Roadmaps:  Military Uniform System Technology (MUST), Model Based Enterprise, Technical and Logistical Data Interoperability, Proactive Forecasting and Retail Support, and Supplier Operations Interface.  

The Military Uniform System Technology roadmap will address GAO Report 12-707 recommendations that DOD to establish a “knowledge based approach” to collaborate on define and communicate of military uniforms.  DLA has the responsibility to communicate and manage the technical requirements among the Services and the Defense Industrial Base.  Currently there is no common environment for collaborating on new requirements among the stakeholders.  MUST will research enabling technologies and apply them to reengineering technical data requirement management process for the common environment recommended by the GAO.  

The Model Based Enterprise will develop capabilities operations to systematically accept, validate, store, item design information in 3D models.  There are two classes of data that must be addressed: newly designed parts for systems still in development and legacy parts for systems that are in sustainment.  The problem with newly designed parts is capturing the designs.  The problem with legacy part is that they do not have engineering models so a specific decision has to be made on the economics of recreating the design in contemporary engineering systems.  

The Technical and Logistical Data Interoperability will pioneer methods to capture data from military Services, Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), and suppliers to form a seamless thread of interoperable and linked data models.

The Proactive Forecasting and Retail Support will roadmap will identify ways to look ahead at military operations and budgets to systematically identify parts there demand changes can be expected.  The alternative is reactively waiting for forecasting to recognize trends which could be after the fact and too late to affect logistics support decisions.  
The Supplier Operations Interface Roadmap will work with DLA process owners, the DLA supply chains and the industrial base, to identify the relevant data sets and most desirable methods of providing DLA suppliers with NIIN inventory visibility where the supplier is contractually responsible for providing a specified level of support. Allowing suppliers to more effectively anticipate DLA’s requirements will improve both DLA and supplier efficiency.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The Pacific Disaster Center (PDC) has been in operation since February 1996. The PDC is a public/private partnership managed by the University of Hawaii (UH) under a cooperative agreement with the Department of Defense.  The Pacific Disaster Center (PDC) function, manpower, and budget resources transferred to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics) (OUSD(AT&amp;L)) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA)in October 2011.
 The USD(P) will continue to be the Operational Sponsor and functional OSD Principal Staff Assistant (PSA) for the program.  The PDC is a world-recognized authority and leader in science and information technology applications relating to humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HA/DR). PDC’s applications and information products enhance preparedness, situational awareness, and civil-military communications for humanitarian missions worldwide, while its national-level socio-economic Risk and Vulnerability Assessments help inform strategies by measuring indicators for national resiliency using scientific methods.

The PDC Program Office’s (USD(P),  ASD(HD&amp;GS), and DASD(DC&amp;MA)) primary responsibility is for management and stewardship of governmental funds provided in Defense Department appropriations for DoD missions associated with DoD CrM, HA/DR, Theater Security Cooperation, and Defense Support to Civil Authorities (DSCA). In doing this, the Program Office develops and provides policy, oversight and guidance, and jointly develops strategic guidelines, programmatic content and priorities with the UH and PDC. The PDC Program Office also serves as a support element of the Hawaii-based organization especially in the area of gaining Federal agency support and resources, as well as business opportunities.</r2:Description>

                                                                <r2:Text>In 2013-2014, the Center’s applications, services, and products were used around the clock by U.S. Agencies as well as by international partners involved in disaster preparedness and response, and those involved in HA/DR operations.  Domestically, the capabilities were used by Department of Defense (DoD), Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Federal Emergency management Agency, state National Guards, and a host of other federal, state, and county emergency managers in the U.S. to better prepare for and respond to disasters. PDC’s application, for instance, was one of the primary tools used by the Hawaii State Governor and The Adjutant General for their decision-making as Hurricane Iselle approached the State in 2014. 
Internationally, the Center supported major partners globally, and in particular those in Southeast Asia and the Americas, regions frequently affected by significant earthquakes, storms, floods, and tsunami threats. In all, PDC’s public applications—providing hazard monitoring, alerting, and related information services—were accessed from at least from 120 countries worldwide, and its mobile (iOS and Android) applications exceeded 1.45 million downloads.

Emphasis areas in FY 2014 included:
•	Improved Situational Awareness and Decision Support Applications, including planned release of internet-based DisasterAWARE (1 major, 2 main, and 8 minor releases) and mobile DisasterALERT (2 iOS and Android releases) applications
•	Expanded national socio-economic risks and vulnerability assessment, and resilience indicators
•	Provided location-based notifications, information, and analytical support to DoD and other HA/DR stakeholders during at least 30 major disasters or events in the US and around the globe
•	Supported 15 exercises in 6 Partner Countries across 3 COCOM AORs
•	Maintained and expanded content and capabilities of global information services to increase situational awareness and to address humanitarian relief operational needs
•	Built capacity in stakeholder agencies through exercise and training, and enhance partnerships with USG agencies, their counterparts in key partner nations, and within I/NGOs to improve outcomes of HA/DR and related activities</r2:Text>

Emphasis areas in FY 2016 include:

•  Improve the simplified DisasterAWARE/RAPIDS user interface (a.k.a. "dashboard") for increased ease-of-use and situational awareness, while allowing the system to accommodate "low bandwidth" operational mode (enabling better support to mobile platforms, as well as, degraded communications) 
• Extend and enhance mobile computing and situational awareness platform for DisasterAWARE/RAPIDS to include:
   a) limited "down range" data collection &amp; sharing capabilities (e.g., damage photos, voice memos, etc.)
   b) investigate and implement degraded but functional/operational "off-grid" capabilities
   c) investigate and implement degraded but operational "low bandwidth" capabilities
• Enhance DisasterAWARE's social media/network visualization capabilities, in collaboration with partners such as ONR-funded research in the subject matter
•  Extend and enhance Bio Surveillance capabilities in collaboration with Navy and Defense Threat Reduction Agency's (DTRA)Bio Surveillance Portal (BSP) Joint Program Executive Office
•  Extend collaboration with DTRA &amp; other data providers in enhancing data fusion capabilities
•  Continue to emphasize and participate jointly- and externally-funded research and application programs to enhance the Center's capabilities and experiences which in turn can be operationalize and applied in direct support of DoD HA/DR and DSCA missions
•  Continue to grow competitive grants and proposals as a means to expand the center’s capabilities, and leverage these new capabilities in support of DoD missions</r2:Text>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Regional International Outreach (RIO) - Partnership for Peace (PfP) Information Management System (PIMS) is an Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) initiative.  The primary focus of the program is a common information technology platform (GlobalNET) to improve international partner outreach and collaboration efforts in a federated environment. A federated environment – characterized by the capacity of DoD institutions and Partners to directly share participants and content across proprietary community websites - fostering networks of partner influencers and enabling better use of DoD resources through collaboration among the Regional Centers for Security Studies, PfP and international partners, other DoD educational institutions and communities as required. The program uses a spiral methodology (making available capabilities as developed), to speed the delivery of open source collaboration technologies the user community. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) oversees execution of the research and development of the GlobalNET effort and its operations, and ensures that the program addresses DoD security cooperation requirements in the context of defense, interagency, and international information sharing and collaboration needs.

The GlobalNET effort focuses on improving collaboration, supporting outreach efforts, and enabling communication among the Regional Centers for Security Studies, the Combatant Commanders, the DSCA, OUSD (Policy), North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s (NATO) Military Partnerships Directorate (MPD), the PfP Consortium of Defense Academies, PfP Partner countries, and other designated DoD institutions and communities. It provides DoD and international partner security practitioners a platform to share information, communicate and collaborate, and improve administrative activities. It also provides the ability to form collaborative communities of interest around security issues. GlobalNET facilitates information sharing and knowledge management concepts in accordance with U.S. policy. PIMS, as a part of the NATO Enlargement Facilitation Act of 1996, implements the Congressional endorsement for the modernization of Defense capabilities in eligible PfP countries relative to their telecommunications infrastructure.  RIO-PIMS provides allies and partner countries the ability to collaborate in critical cooperative activities that underpin the spirit of the PfP program.  The program supports PfP coalition initiatives through development of distributive collaboration tools to support aspects of U.S. and NATO-approved PfP cooperative activities.  This support is important to achieve the interoperability/integration outlined in the Guidance for the Employment of the Force.  RIO-PIMS supports internet-based education and collaboration, exercise simulations, and training center requirements. 

The Regional Centers Person/Activity Management System (RCPAMS) provides an integrated student and activities management framework for the Regional Centers for Security Studies that was designed to complement the capabilities of the Security Assistance Network (SAN).  Data updates in GlobalNET and RCPAMS will be shared to ensure data integrity.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Currently the security requirements according to the DSCA CIO do not meet the new baseline requirements and need to be hardened.  The technology is intended to be hosted at the same facility as RCPAMS taking advantage of economies of scale. At the same time, update and complete new DIACAP paperwork and support DSCA CIO to get a GIG waiver.

Implement the learning management module identified as required. Users have identified the current workflow built into the system as incomplete and it is required to be extended.  The NATO School uses an open source LMS that we will make available via GlobalNET with single sign –on which they currently lack this gives us economies of scale that can be realized and by using NATO School’s open source LMS which will be less costly than extending the software for this functionality.

Common access card (CAC) enable the system.  As the system was designed to support foreign nationals, it does not support CAC authentication and with the security requirements and the inclusion of more US citizens, CAC enablement will provide more access control and easier access.

Migrate the technology from an older code base to a newer version.  GlobalNET is at risk for falling two major software releases behind, increasing the lack of supportability and development personnel.  The update will certify all of the extensions and move to the most recent stable version which will reduce security vulnerabilities and make system extensions less costly to perform and maintain

Continue to research the computer human interface (CHI) ensuring it is closer aligned with the consolidated workflow. We continue to refine the interface such that users are finding operations to be easier and more intuitive to perform.

Deploy a native video teleconference (VTC) capability to replace the existing hosted service.  GlobalNET is currently bundled with a loosely coupled Adobe connect system outside of the GlobalNET stack and hosting environment.  The capability would create a native VTC capability inside of the platform allowing much tighter integrations with messaging, file sharing, white boarding, and chatting and reduce the operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) expense of leasing this service.

Work with the existing platform managers to update the GlobalNET implementation to the newest platform stable release - allowing greater functionality and better security across all members of the platform.

Extend the information exchange between the RCPAMS and GlobalNET.  The exchange is only working for exporting users from RCPAMS to GlobalNET for account provisioning and there are three additional functions to implement.</r2:Text>

This includes expanding the hardware and software to an alternate site to allow additional users to access and use the system concurrently and be a backup site in the event of a disaster or failure.  Because of all of the advanced graphics and expansion of the user base, it is expected that we will need this additional capacity and the best plan to distribute it out to an alternate location.

Ensure that discovery is much easier including adding the capability to refine search results using a keyword based refinement methodology.  The amount of data the system will be collecting dictates greater refinement of the search results.  In addition, build the capability to allow the users to refine the data by multiple folders. 

Re-engineer the security model to allow much greater granular permission on functions.  The current model does not allow permissions down to the activity level and that is need as more users are starting to restrict access to functions. 

Re-engineer the email integration capabilities.  Put more control on the content of sent emails and well as greater capabilities to receive emails and incorporated them into the system as natively entered data elements.</r2:Text>

                                                <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The GlobalNET effort employs a spiral acquisition strategy to ensure a well-defined model for each institution/community that can be exported globally.  The program uses a regional approach to ensure sustainable, leave-behind technology and information sharing procedures.  By partnering with other U.S. Government agencies, existing assets are leveraged to preserve U.S. investments, avoid duplication of effort between agencies, and offer economically prudent solutions to improve information sharing and achieve U.S. security cooperation goals.  Independent Operational Test teams were brought on to ensure that GlobalNET and bears independent validation of the development team’s effort.  GlobalNET has regional based personnel to assist in the adoption of the platform with partners who are not familiar with social collaboration and networking media.  RCPAMS uses a similar spiral approach, testing and fielding approach.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                                                <r2:PerformanceMetrics>RIO-PIMS projects performance is measured in several methods: the successful meeting of stated performance objectives in the statement of work, and meeting target dates in the project management plan; via a combination of statistics including the number of trouble tickets generated on the development site, operational user feedback on development site usability, and design; and the system’s performance during developmental and operational testing.   The use of a 3rd party to execute the operational test ensures that the system meets the performance metrics prior to moving to production.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Overseas Humanitarian Assistance Shared Information System (OHASIS) provides Humanitarian Assistance (HA) offices, including embassy staff, country team members, Combatant Command leads, and the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) the capability to manage and visualize Overseas Humanitarian, Disaster and Civic Aid (OHDACA) funded projects on a web-based map display, automate report generation, coordinate with Inter-Agency and Partner Nation stakeholders, as well as perform a variety of analysis.  

Under the direction of DSCA, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Army Geospatial Center (AGC) is responsible for the entire lifecycle--from system definition to development, support, training, and product improvement of OHASIS. The AGC has been responsible for the OHASIS system since 2005 and has evolved it to the present 2.2 system which contains more than 14,000 projects valued at more than $1.8 billion, with a community of over 3,000 users.  The OHASIS system is a critical and mission essential means for thousands of military and civilian users to develop, staff, coordinate, approve, fund, implement, and manage projects intended to assist the Combatant Commands in accomplishing theater campaign plan objectives and achieve strategic ends states in support of U.S. national security and foreign policy interests.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Overseas Humanitarian Assistance Shared Information System (OHASIS) enables Humanitarian Assistance (HA) offices, including embassy staff, country team members, Combatant Command leads, and the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) to manage and visualize Overseas Humanitarian, Disaster and Civic Aid (OHDACA) projects on a web-based map display, automate report generation, and perform a variety of analysis.  

Under the direction of DSCA, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Army Geospatial Center (AGC) is responsible for the entire lifecycle--from system definition to development, support, training and product improvement of OHASIS. The AGC has been responsible for the OHASIS system since 2005 and has evolved it to the present 2.2 system which contains 15,000 projects valued at more than $1.8 billion, with a community of over 3,000 users.    The OHASIS system is a critical and mission essential means for thousands of military and civilian users to develop, staff, approve and manage projects intended to assist the Combatant Commands in accomplishing theater campaign plan objectives and achieve strategic ends states in support of U.S. national security and foreign policy interests.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Continue to find more efficient ways of integrating with other systems including Pacific Disaster Center, REDi, Cooperation Security JCTD, GTSCMIS, USAID, CAOS, Foreign Assistance Dashboard, MARCIMs, etc.

Continue working the system accreditation through the DSCA CIO.
Refine and implement the “Umbrella Project” concept within the system. The umbrella project will give users a more strategic approach towards our humanitarian assistance investment.</r2:Text>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Global Theater Security Cooperation Management information System (G-TSCMIS) Program is an Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) initiative to develop and deploy a common web-based, centrally hosted Management Information System (MIS) that will serve as the information focus point for the Department of Defense’s (DoD) Security Cooperation (SC) efforts by providing decision makers, SC planners and other users with the ability to view, manage, assess, and report SC activities and events.  G-TSCMIS will consolidate, improve upon, and replace legacy security cooperation systems.  It will provide a comprehensive picture of SC activities, and will contribute to planning more effective cooperative security activities to align or meet desired outcomes in support of SC end states.  The program is an evolutionary rapid Information Technology (IT) acquisition pilot program, as described in FY 2010 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) Section 804, that provides users at every user command with greater capability through several iterations and releases that are developed and implemented over time.  The Department of Navy (DoN) was assigned acquisition lead for the effort by Deputy Secretary of Defense (DEPSECDEF). 

G-TSCMIS is a fully interoperable component of Adaptive Planning and Execution (APEX) and the DoD Joint C2 (JC2) Capability.  The effort will support strategic and operational planning by providing access to reports of programs, activities, events, funding, assessments, and status of achieving defined end states.  G-TSCMIS will provide visualization, assessment, reporting, and data management throughout the conduct of SC activities planning and execution phases.  Information from the SC activities will be binned by separate SC programs, budget lines/funding streams, equipment drawdown, etc.  This will enable users at the tactical level to focus on specific programs, participating forces, events, and activities, while users at the strategic level will be able to access summary reports of geographic regions, resource requirements, or total expenditure of funds by source.  G-TSCMIS support to DoD's SC reporting requirements mandated by federal law for many SC programs and activities.  To adhere to U.S. regulations, G-TSCMIS reports will be tailored to include programs, events, and activities by category, geographical areas, assessments, U.S. staffing levels, and sources of funding. 

G-TSCMIS will interface with other DoD systems, such as Joint Training Information Management System (JTIMS) and Joint Capability Requirements Manager (JCRM). G-TSCMIS will allow decision makers and analysts to identify redundant investments, plan more effective engagements, and find gaps and opportunities for building more capable partners.  The program uses multiple, rapidly executed releases of capability beginning with a Milestone B equivalent initial build decision held in Quarter 1 FY 2012, which resulted in approval from the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) to enter the Incremental and Iterative Development and Deployment (IIDD) phase.  The initial releases require defined objectives and mature technology.  Based on analysis of required capabilities and resources, the Program Office is planning on executing G-TSCMIS in five major releases, each with three iterations, across the period of FY 2012-FY 2020.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>G-TSCMIS will follow the Rapid IT Acquisition approach as detailed in Section 804 of the 2010 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). G-TSCMIS will initiate an evolutionary and iterative development process for a software-only solution using multiple, rapidly executed releases of capability beginning with a Build Decision in FY 2012 and enter the Incremental and Iterative Development and Deployment (IIDD) phase. Once fielded and operational on both NIPR and SIPR, users will access G-TSCMIS over a web browser with information on a centralized server. The development period is planned for FY 2012 through FY 2020. G-TSCMIS contracting used fair opportunity competitive procedures on the Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) MAC for Releases 1 and 2. Barriers to competition were minimized by using performance and functional specifications and equivalent commercial standards.  Releases 3 through 5 will be completed by separate contract(s).  Either another IDIQ MAC or MACs will be used or a new contract or contracts will be created for the final 3 releases.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                                                <r2:PerformanceMetrics>G-TSCMIS performance is measured in several outcome-based methods.  The JC2 Capability Definition Package produced by JS J6 defines the Key Performance Parameters (KPP) and Key System Attributes (KSA) to be met.  JS J6 also approved specific Measures of Effectiveness and Measures of Performance (MOE/MOP), establishing thresholds and objectives for G-TSCMIS software to meet.  Successful meeting of stated performance objectives in the statement of work, and meeting cost, schedule and performance targets as defined in the G-TSCMIS Acquisition Program Baseline are key metrics for the program.   The use of participating Service Operational Test Agencies to perform operational testing ensures G-TSCMIS meets the performance metrics prior to making the software operational.  Additional statistics based metrics, trouble tickets logged by the Service Desk, operational user feedback and IV&amp;V and Developmental tests validate system performance.

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Security Service (DSS) oversees the protection of the nation's most critical technological and information assets, administers the National Industrial Security Program (NISP) on behalf of the Department of Defense and 27 other Federal agencies.  In this capacity, DSS is responsible for providing security oversight, counterintelligence coverage and support to almost 10,000 cleared companies (comprising over 13,500 + industrial facilities and about 1.2 million cleared contractors), and accreditation of more than 14,000 classified information technology systems in the NISP.  DSS also serves as the functional manager responsible for the execution and maintenance of DoD security training.

The Defense Security Service manages the National Industrial Security Program (NISP) to provide an effective, real-time, security support capability for the Military Departments, DoD Agencies, the NISP, and other Federal Agencies.  In compliance with the Expanded Electronic Government, President’s Management Agenda, and the DoD Enterprise Architecture Framework, NISP is the unified offering of security mission systems which facilitate and automate improved national investigative and adjudicative standards, streamline security processes, and increase DoD community collaboration.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Defense Security Service manages the Enterprise Security System (ESS) to provide an effective, real-time, security support capability for the Military Departments, DoD Agencies, the NISP, and other Federal Agencies.  In compliance with the Expanded Electronic Government, President’s Management Agenda, and the DoD Enterprise Architecture Framework, ESS is the unified offering of security mission systems which facilitate and automate improved national investigative and adjudicative standards, streamline security processes, and increase DoD community collaboration.

The DSS Mission Information Technology (IT) systems provide critical service to the major DSS mission areas for Industrial Security Oversight and Security Education.  DSS performs this critical function through operation of its mission production systems to include the Industrial Security Facilities Database (ISFD), the DSS Gateway, and the Security Training Education and Professionalization Portal (STEPP).  RDT&amp;E for DSS mission systems primarily includes pre-planned product improvements to the applications, researching and improving assured information sharing to better posture systems and networks against vulnerabilities, ensuring self-defense of systems and networks, and safeguarding data at all stages for the DSS to increase efficiencies by providing web-based systems to manage certification and accreditation activities. These IT systems are as follows:   

Office of Designated Approving Authority (ODAA) Business Management System (OBMS).  The OBMS will automate the approval and certification process of cleared industry’s classified information processing security plans and operations.  This will increase mission efficiency by providing a web-based system to manage certification and accreditation activities, provide improved reporting capabilities to support DSS and industry through improved metrics, accreditation timeliness and accuracy and reduce the number of unaccredited systems by providing automated notifications to DSS and industry.  

EFCL:  The eFCL will be a centralized repository for information of facilities participating in the National Industrial Security Program (NISP). The eFCL will capture facility information relating to a cleared facility, from the initial processing of the facility clearance, the record decision pertaining to facility clearance request, to include Foreign Ownership Control or Influence (FOCI) information, as well as decommissioning the facility clearance, and capturing the DSS oversight activities.  The eFCL will provide a means for users to submit, update, search, and view facility verification requests.

Industrial Security Facilities Database (ISFD).  ISFD is the main DSS mission system that tracks and executes the National Industrial Security Program for DoD and 27 other Federal Executive Agencies of cleared industrial security facilities.  The ISFD provide users with a nationwide perspective on National Industrial Security Program related facilities, as well as, facilities under DSS oversight in the DoD conventional AA&amp;E program. ISFD provides source data for the DoD Joint Personnel Adjudicative System (JPAS) and the Facility Verification Request (FVR) application.

National Industrial Security System (NISS, formerly known as Field Operations System (FOS).  The NISS is slated as the next generation enterprise capability, replacing the Industrial Security Facility Database (ISFD).  Additionally, NISS will provide seamless integration of other DSS systems and applications, such as eFCL, OBMS, DD-254, and Mobile Workforce Applications.  NISS will provide DSS with comprehensive enhanced capability to manage its entire mission portfolio.  NISS will improve information sharing and collaboration, providing timely and accurate data in the hands of field representatives for decision-making.  The system will provide agency-wide metrics to measure and improve agency performance in providing security oversight and the protection of national security.  

The National Contract Classification System (NCCS).  The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires a DD Form 254 be incorporated in each classified contract, and the National Industrial Security Operating Manual (NISPOM)(4-103a) requires a DD 254 be issued by the government with each Invitation for Bid, Request for Proposal, or Request for Quote. The DD Form 254 provides contractor (or a subcontractor) the security requirements and classification guidance necessary to perform on a classified contract. Contract Security Classification Specification required by DoD 5220.22-4, Industrial Security Regulation and the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) is to develop a federated system for the oversight and management of providing classified information access and guidance required to perform on classified contracts. The DD 254, an underlying business processes, is critical to ensure access to our Nation’s classified information is properly safeguarded.


National Industrial Security Program (NISP) Control Access and Information Security System (NCAISS) formerly known as Identity Management (IdM).  NCAISS is mandatory for compliance with Department of Defense (DoD) Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) Program Management Office and Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Networks and Information Integration (ASD-NII), Joint Task Force for Global Networks Operations (JTF-GNO) Communications Tasking Order (CTO) 06-02, CTO 07-015, and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Memo 11-11 (M-11-11), directing accelerated use of PKI across the enterprise.  This initiative is designed to enable multiple DSS business systems to have service-accessibility that is controlled through PKI-compliant single sign-on authentication.  Expanded use of the NCAISS across the DSS enterprise to provide CAC-based authentication for business support applications to support the SIPRNet and JWICS domains, provide enhanced identity and access control analytics. It will also incorporate any remaining DSS operated application into the DSS NCAISS solution.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Technical Information Center’s (DTIC) unique mission is to provide rapid, accurate, and reliable access to essential research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&amp;E) information, supporting all DoD users.  DTIC, a DoD Field Activity, is the DoD’s singular executive agent and designated source for DoD-funded scientific, technical, engineering, and industry-related information.  Over the past several years, DTIC has evolved to an information delivery house, that through use of the internet, can deliver technical information nearly instantaneously to all DoD users.  DTIC also operates DoD Information Analysis Centers (IACs) focused on Defense Systems, Cyber Security and Information Systems, and Homeland Defense and Security.  DTIC captures, preserves, protects, shares research and development (R&amp;D) information assets, and encourages collaboration to connect user communities.  DTIC seeks to provide a department level mapping of R&amp;D activity.  This activity and its results advance research by providing researchers, warfighters, research and engineering (R&amp;E) management, and decision makers with insight into current and past research conducted, highlighting progress made and by whom, and, just as important, where research leads to dead ends.  As new capability needs are identified, technical challenges arise--rather than starting anew--work can pick up from the point of most recent results.  Through the preservation and sharing of the results of billions of dollars of past DoD investment, DTIC increases the return on past investments and accelerates current efforts.  Through its collaboration tools and outreach to the R&amp;E community, DTIC works to connect researchers across the lab enterprise, to include research and engineering, warfighters and DoD’s industry partners.  DTIC operations focus on five key areas:

1) Document and preserve what works, what has promise (for reuse and additional investments).
2) Provide results that identify dead-ends that do not merit additional investment (avoid waste).
3) Facilitate and encourage engagement among cross-cutting communities of interest (bring together experts across the acquisition enterprise to meet warfighter needs).
4) Present overarching picture of research investment that enables decision-makers to link multiple efforts with integrated capabilities (employ resources to highest priority efforts and coordinate efforts across Services).
5) Protect intellectual property (IP) and industry proprietary data assets entrusted to DTIC’s stewardship (protect information access).

DTIC recognizes the need to accomplish its mission while increasing the value of the services and products we provide in an environment of Department-wide budget reductions.  DTIC has reduced its physical footprint, civilian personnel and contract support; restructured the IAC program; and continues to consolidate its data center.  At the same time, DTIC has taken on additional programs, to include its new role in leading the Department in efforts to provide public access to DoD-funded journal articles and research data and increased outreach to industry through the Defense Innovation Marketplace.

DTIC continues to ensure its activities are efficient and effective, meet users’ expectations, and employ industry best practices and standards, while protecting from cyber threats.  DoD’s $120 Billion annual investment in research, development and procurement, support current and future capabilities.  The results of these efforts are a national asset that DTIC must preserve for reuse across the acquisition enterprise.  Approximately 23 percent of the four million records in DTIC’s information holdings are sensitive DoD only, federal government only and industry proprietary.  DTIC is the only enterprise source for both publicly accessible and DoD sensitive material in a single location.

DTIC’s Information Analysis Center (IAC) Program Office provides core funding, management and oversight of its three IACs.  The IACs are chartered by DoD to collect, analyze, and disseminate worldwide scientific and technical information in specialized fields.  The IAC program just completed a multi-year restructuring from ten IACs to the current three, reducing customer costs and incorporating new DoD technical interest areas.  The new structure will focus on three technology groupings, to include Cyber Security and Information Systems, Homeland Defense and Security, and Defense Systems.  As part of the Department’s Better Buying Power initiative, new multi-award contracts have been put into place, improving competition, small-business presence, and reducing government costs.  The restructured IAC Program will improve affordability, productivity, and standardization within defense acquisition programs.  Providing the acquisition enterprise access to thousands of industry subject matter experts, DTIC’s IACs perform nearly $2.0 Billion of customer funded research and prototyping support annually.  The results of the work are a rich source of material in DTIC’s information asset collections and are available to users across the Department (and other federal agencies, e.g., Department of Energy, Department of Homeland Security).  

This Program Element (PE) supports DTIC mission operations.  DTIC focuses on core mission, and buys space, human resources (HR), financial management, contracting, IT security and communications, and civilian payroll services from expert and efficient DoD providers:  funding provides for salaries and benefits of government civilian personnel assigned to DTIC; training, professional development, and travel for DTIC personnel; support agreements for Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) facility-related services; Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) financial activities and HR services; Defense Information Services Agency (DISA) communications and IT security services; annual maintenance and licensing requirements; supplies, equipment, hardware/software; and support contracts for information technology services, Defense Agencies Initiative (DAI) system integration, and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Act compliance efforts in concert with the Department’s Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) program.  In addition, this PE provides funding in support of the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs, in accordance with Public Law 111-251 (Small Business Reauthorization Act) and Small Business Technology Transfer Program Reauthorization Act. Within the PE, an annual set-aside contribution totaling approximately $400,000 is provided to the DoD's Commercialization Pilot Program, as directed by the Department's Office of Small Business Programs (OSBP).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:SummaryExplanation>Specific changes to the FY 2016 program (net increase of $0.986 Million from the FY 2015 funding level; $3.581 Million from the previous PB Base) are outlined below:

FY 2016 Program Change:  The funding increase eliminates a one year dip in DTIC funding, leveling FY 2016 with FY 2015 and 2017 programs.  This change represents a departmental restoration of DTIC mission funding.  The FY 2016 funding increase directly provides for the following efforts:

- The Department’s activities associated with the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) requirements for public access and open digital data for research efforts.  OSTP policy requires increased public access to the results of federally funded scientific research, including peer reviewed journal articles and digitally formatted scientific data.  The Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC) is the lead agency for DoD’s implementation and compliance.  

- On-going DTIC activities--that would otherwise be suspended--needed for DTIC to meet DoD information technology security and identity management requirements, as well as efforts to expand content available to warfighters and other DTIC users on secured networks.  

Public Access:  The Department’s efforts associated with public access and open digital data provides for a broader collection of technical data, improving access and availability for both DoD and public users.  The scope of the public access initiative expands beyond DTIC’s current mission areas (Budget Activities 6.1 to 6.3) to cover all research performed in the Department.  This government-wide effort encourages further reuse of technical data, and is expected to drive innovation, efficiencies and cost savings to users.  Additional funding in support of the public access &amp; digital data initiative will provide for the following activities:

- DTIC will increase its public access services (services that had been slated for curtailment as a result of previous budget reductions), enhance our research in progress summary database, collect and store manuscripts of peer reviewed journal articles, and develop tools to link public users to journal articles and relevant digital data.

- It is critical for DTIC to bolster its IT systems and infrastructure supporting the central repository for scientific and technical data.  New automated processes will allow for efficient processing and placing of up to 40,000 additional journal articles online per year, a tenfold increase over the current volume, providing access to DoD and public users.

- Establish a compliance system and process linking DoD resources to research, enabling DITC to track and collect all results generated from grants, contracts and in-house work, to include work published in peer-reviewed journal articles.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>DTIC is responsible for developing, coordinating and enabling a strong scientific and technical information (STINFO) program for the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD(R&amp;E)) and the DoD scientific &amp; technical (S&amp;T) enterprise.  In this role, DTIC sets policy for scientific and technical information (STI) exchanges for the research and engineering (R&amp;E) community.  DTIC’s aim is to maximize the availability and use of technical information and products resulting from Defense-funded technical activities while ensuring restrictions to safeguard national security, export control, and intellectual property rights.

Recognizing the common elements across budget justification documents, progress reports, completed work reports, studies, and journal articles, DTIC is mapping relationships to enable users to access the life cycle of research projects from planning to final results.  DTIC employs technology to verify and validate information submitted and improve user confidence in DoD research documentation.

DTIC is leading the Department’s efforts to implement public access to published journal articles, and digital data from research funded by taxpayers.  In this role, DTIC is actively working with partners across the Services, components, other federal agencies and publishers.  Consistent with the Administration’s (Office of Management and Budget) emphasis for open standards and machine readable formats, DTIC initiated the transition from paper and Portable Document Format (PDF) based information to WebService Extensible Markup Language (XML) standard data submission and machine readable delivery.  DTIC partnered with the OSD Comptroller to collect investment account budget justification documentation in XML and embed this XML in PDF for justification books delivered to Congress.  DTIC employed this same technology in collecting S&amp;T progress reports from the Services and Agencies, and Independent Research and Development (IR&amp;D) data from industry.  DTIC is planning the migration of completed technical reports collection to the same open standards – machine readable formats.

Through the use of commercial search technology, DTIC provides an industry leading search capability that links its knowledge of the DoD domain and metadata to support both text searches and data mining.  DTIC continually works to enable additional features within our search capabilities and from commercial partners to improve information discovery and relevance.

With the September 2014 full operating capability (FOC) release of the commercial product based R&amp;E Gateway, DTIC provides the means to connect 60,000+ members in the acquisition enterprise (DoD Labs, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), Program Executive Offices, Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (AT&amp;L) and Combatant Commands (CCMD)).  In an access controlled environment all of DTIC’s unclassified assets, tools and community interaction capabilities foster innovation, competition and identification of solutions.  DoD conducts research at its 60+ labs, in the FFRDC’s, DTIC’s Information Analysis Centers (IACs), through contracts and grants, and across over a dozen distinct priority area communities of interest; this work is available through the R&amp;E Gateway.

To protect information, DTIC maintains a database of registered users; in addition, DTIC utilizes commercial software and follows DoD Identity Management Standards, providing Common Access Card (CAC) users instant authenticated access.  DTIC is working with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to give users more control of their online profile and extend immediate access to federal government employees and contractors holding valid credentials. 

Focus on User Communities and Distribution Points:  DTIC supports user communities on the network where they work, NIPRNET, SIPRNET and Internet, and uniquely provides access controls within unclassified and classified material to protect intellectual property in our search, distribution, and collaboration tools.

- DoD’s Acquisition Enterprise:  As a Field Activity to ASD(R&amp;E)/AT&amp;L, DTIC’s priority is the acquisition enterprise, hosting information assets and tools on the NIPRNET (the primary network for the community).
- Warfighter:  Improving coordination between the acquisition enterprise and warfighter communities, DTIC hosts a subset of information assets and tools on the SIPRNET.  DTIC is working to expand the availability of S&amp;T information, to include Independent Research and Development (IR&amp;D), on the SIPRNET.
- Industry and Academia via Internet:  Engaging industry outside the NIPRNET “firewall” to support Better Buying Power initiatives and encourage the introduction of innovation, DTIC hosts unclassified “public” information and tools accessible to all users on the Internet.  The Public Access initiative adds importance to the public distribution point, to encourage technology transfer of basic and public research to the private sector, and to give an economic boost to small businesses that can use that data to provide new applications to consumers.

Summary.  DTIC protects and preserves DoD’s multi-billion dollar investment in research, which empowers the acquisition enterprise through innovative tools, information systems, and decision support capabilities.  The benefits can be enormous; each 1 percent increase in reuse of S&amp;T, elimination of inefficient redundancy and increased community interaction, results in a more capable military and gives the DoD the opportunity to redirect >$100 Million.  DTIC is uniquely positioned to support and unleash the value of DoD’s R&amp;D portfolio.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>DoD Information Analysis Centers (IACs), established under DoD Instruction 3200.14, serve as a vital resource in providing timely, relevant information directly to users when and where it is needed. IACs serve as a bridge between the warfighter and the Acquisition/Research community, providing essential technical analysis and data support to a diverse customer base, to include the Combatant Commands (CCMDs), the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Defense Agencies, and the Military Services. IACs actively partner and collaborate with Defense Research and Engineering (R&amp;E) focus groups and communities of interest in areas of specialized fields or specific technologies. The IACs create and maintain comprehensive knowledge analysis centers that include historical, technical, scientific, and other data and information collected worldwide. They are staffed with scientists, engineers and information specialists to provide research and analysis to customers with diverse, complex and challenging requirements. IAC operations directly support the warfighter, and play an ongoing and critical role in solving key CCMD operational issues such as cyber security, unmanned aerial vehicle visual/audible signature reduction, and improvements to the ballistic resistance of body armor.  

The IAC Program Management Office at DTIC performs contract acquisition, management, and operational support for IAC contract operations and the technical information that is generated as a result of research and studies.  In a time of shrinking budgets and increasing responsibility, IACs are a valuable resource for accessing scientific and technical information culled from efforts to solve new and historic challenges. Direct IAC customer support activities, such as Technical Area Task (TAT) order processing, Basic Center Operations (BCO) support, Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) activities, contracting/acquisition related activities, etc., are funded in part through partnerships with the Defense R&amp;E community and the annual collection of customer reimbursements for shared direct costs, in accordance with the IAC Reimbursable Review Board (IRRB) recommendations, with OSD-COMPT and Office of General Counsel concurrence. This represents the maximum cost-sharing with IAC customers allowable, per guidance from the OSD Office of General Counsel. Annual IAC efforts and accomplishments are dependent on the level of participation and collaboration by the R&amp;E community at large.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The mission of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is to safeguard the United States and its allies from global weapons of mass destruction (WMD) threats by integrating, synchronizing, and providing responsive expertise, technologies, and capabilities.  This mission directly aligns with several national and Department of Defense (DoD) level guidance/vision documents.  For Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation (RDT&amp;E), these documents include the National Security Strategy, Defense Strategic Guidance (Sustaining U.S. Global Leadership: Priorities for 21st Century Defense), 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review, National Strategy for Combating Terrorism, National Strategy to Combat WMD, Defense Planning Guidance, Guidance for Employment of the Force, 2014 DoD Strategy for Countering WMD, National Military Strategic Plan for the War on Terrorism, and Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan (including the Nuclear Annex).  To achieve this mission, the DTRA has established strategies and tasks to meet the principal objectives of the above referenced documents.  These objectives are: 1) Ensure a safe, secure, and effective nuclear deterrent; 2) Anticipate emerging WMD threats; 3) Provide Combating WMD situational awareness; 4) Assess infrastructure and personnel vulnerabilities; 5) Prevent proliferation and use of WMD; 6) Defend against WMD threats; 7) Defeat WMD threats; 8) Recover from WMD consequences; and 9) Synchronize countering WMD activities. 

The Basic Research Initiative provides for the discovery and development of fundamental knowledge and understanding by research performers comprised from academia and world-class research institutions in Government and industry.  This leverages the DoD's $2 billion plus annual investment in basic research by ensuring a motivation within the scientific community to conduct research benefiting WMD-related defense missions and by improving knowledge of research efforts that benefit nonproliferation, counter proliferation, and consequence management efforts.  These efforts are closely coordinated with DTRA’s Chemical and Biological Technologies Department, which executes a chemical/biological basic research program under DoD’s Chemical and Biological Defense Program.  DTRA’s research interests are coordinated with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and the Services’ basic research programs through the Defense Basic Research Advisory Group.  DTRA reviews research interests annually to focus on technological areas which are not clearly addressed by other basic research efforts.

DTRA’s Basic Research portfolio supports several National and DoD initiatives directly related to Countering WMD (CWMD) including: Office of Science and Technology Policy Nuclear Defense Research and Development Roadmap, FY 2013-2017; Defense Budget Priorities and Choices for FY 2014;  Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Science and Technology Priority Steering Council Roadmap;  2012 Defense Strategic Guidance (Sustaining U.S. Global Leadership: Priorities for 21st Century Defense), and the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review.  In general, these documents direct capability enhancements, projects, and science and technology (S&amp;T) investments that support CWMD and reduce global nuclear dangers. Specifically they include: accelerating the development of standoff radiological/nuclear detection capabilities; researching countermeasures and defenses to non-traditional agents; enhancing nuclear forensics; securing vulnerable materials; developing new verification technologies; developing an in-depth understanding of the capabilities, values, intent, and decision making of potential foes, whether they are states, networks, or individuals; defeating WMD agents; researching biologically-based or inspired materials for DoD applications; and leveraging science, technology, and innovation through domestic and international partnerships and agreements.  Basic research supporting all of these needs is included in this program element under Project RU-Fundamental Research for Combating WMD.

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides for the discovery and development of fundamental knowledge and understanding by research performers drawn primarily from academia and world-class research institutions in government and industry.  This leverages the Department of Defense's (DoD's) $2 billion plus annual investment in basic research by ensuring a motivation within the scientific community to conduct research benefiting weapons of mass destruction (WMD) related defense missions and by improving knowledge of research efforts that benefit nonproliferation, counter proliferation, and consequence management efforts.  These efforts are closely coordinated with the DTRA’s Chemical and Biological Technologies Department initiatives which execute a chemical/biological basic research program under the DoD Chemical and Biological Defense Program.  The DTRA’s research interests are coordinated with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and the Services’ basic research programs through the Defense Basic Research Advisory Group.  DTRA reviews research interests annually to focus on technological areas which are not clearly addressed by other basic research efforts.

This project supports several national and Department initiatives directly related to countering WMD including: Office of Science and Technology Policy, Nuclear Defense Research and Development Roadmap, FY 2013-2017; Defense Budget Priorities and Choices for FY 2014; Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Science and Technology Priority Steering Council Roadmap; 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance (Sustaining U.S. Global Leadership: Priorities for 21st Century Defense), and the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review.  In general, these documents direct capability enhancements, projects, and Science and Technology (S&amp;T) investments that support Countering WMD (CWMD) and reduce global nuclear dangers.  Specifically, they include: accelerating the development of standoff radiological/nuclear detection capabilities; researching countermeasures and defenses to non-traditional agents; enhancing nuclear forensics; securing vulnerable materials; developing new verification technologies; developing an in-depth understanding of the capabilities, values, intent, and decision making of potential adversaries, whether they are states, networks, or individuals; defeating WMD agents; researching biologically-based and inspired materials for DoD applications; and leveraging science, technology, and innovation through domestic and international partnerships and agreements. Specific activities for Project RU include: Sensing and Recognition – Generation of information that provides knowledge of the presence, identity, and/or quantity of material or energy in the environment that may be significant; Network Sciences – Enhance fundamental knowledge of theory, representations, and mapping to improve the WMD-related robustness, resiliency, recovery of, and informational and operational utility associated with and derived from, complex disparate but interdependent networks; Protection Sciences – Advance knowledge for protection of personnel, resources, sensitive systems and infrastructure from WMD; Sciences to Defeat WMD – Phenomena that improves success of defeat actions (use of weapons) including explosives, accessing and defeating target WMDs, such as biological agents and weapons modeling; and Sciences to Secure WMD – Improve understanding of phenomena for verification and compliance with treaties, including test detection.  Additional activities for Project RU include the discovery of revolutionary control methods to monitor and secure components, materials, and weapons, and disrupt proliferation pathways; and cooperative research with global partners – research to reduce the global threat of WMD in collaboration with a broad range of international partners. Finally, this project supports and administers the Cooperative Biological Engagement Program for academic engagements which has the core goals of securing dangerous pathogens, promoting open and active disease reporting and response, advancing transparent research to understand pathogens, and developing potential countermeasures.

The decrease from FY 2014 to FY 2015 reflects a reduced effort in combating WMD basic research resulting in reductions to the number of active basic research awards.  The increase from FY 2015 to FY 2016 maintains the investment in basic research to keep pace with inflation.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The mission of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is to safeguard the United States and its allies from global weapons of mass destruction (WMD) threats by integrating, synchronizing, and providing responsive expertise, technologies, and capabilities.  This mission directly aligns with several national and Department of Defense (DoD) level guidance/vision documents.  For Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation (RDT&amp;E), these documents include the National Security Strategy, Defense Strategic Guidance (Sustaining U.S. Global Leadership: Priorities for 21st Century Defense), 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review, National Strategy for Combating Terrorism, 2014 DoD Strategy for Countering WMD, National Strategy to Combat WMD, Defense Planning Guidance, Guidance for Employment of the Force, 2006 National Military Strategy for Combating WMD, National Military Strategic Plan for the War on Terrorism, and Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan (including the Nuclear Annex).  To achieve this mission, DTRA has established strategies and tasks to meet their principal objectives.  These objectives are: 1) Ensure a safe, secure, and effective nuclear deterrent; 2) Anticipate emerging WMD threats; 3) Provide Combating WMD situational awareness; 4) Assess infrastructure and personnel vulnerabilities; 5) Prevent proliferation and use of WMD; 6) Defend against WMD threats; 7) Defeat WMD threats; 8) Recover from WMD consequences; and 9) Synchronize countering WMD activities. 

A focused and strong WMD threat reduction technology base is critical to meeting these objectives.  This technology base is closely tied with the operational support programs that make up DTRA’s combat support mission.  DTRA's has taken the steps to develop this technology base and provide a foundation for transformational activities within the WMD arena.

Activities funded by Program Element 0602718BR implement a wide set of National Security Presidential Directive 17 and emerging Presidential Policy Directive guidance for prevention of proliferation of WMD and WMD terrorism.  Projects support the prevention and adversary use of WMD through the development of technology to locate and identify nuclear threats, post-detonation forensics, and treaty verification.  Through development of new sensor systems, sensor networks, counterforce and fundamental Counter-WMD (CWMD) research, these programs contribute to securing and interdicting WMD, WMD delivery systems, and related materials.  Finally, programs in this area fund the development of tools for the DTRA Technical Reachback analysis center which supports United States and allied forces, interagency, and civil authorities with 24 hour/7 days per week Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High-yield Explosives (CBRNE) event analysis support.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Starting in FY 2016, detection-related technologies transition to Project RD (Detection Technologies).  Project RF includes Research, Development, Test, &amp; Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) to detect, locate, identify, track, and interdict nuclear and radiological threats. This includes weapons, material, and enablers to their acquisition, and development such as nuclear expertise, financing, or unique technologies. These efforts support Department of Defense (DoD) requirements for combating terrorism, counter/nonproliferation, and homeland defense.

The increase from FY 2014 to FY 2015 is due to increased investments in both nuclear detection Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance efforts and nuclear forensics.  The decrease from FY 2015 to FY 2016 in Project RF is due to the realignment of nuclear threat detection activities into Project RD-Detection Technologies.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Defeat Technologies project develops, integrates, demonstrates and transitions innovative kinetic and non-kinetic weapon capabilities to expand traditional and asymmetric options available to Combatant Commanders to deny, disrupt, and defeat adversarial use of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) while minimizing collateral effects.  Technology development focuses on the physical or functional defeat of (1) chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threat materials, (2) an adversary's ability to deliver the same, and (3) the physical and non-physical support networks enabling both. This project achieves its goals through the systematic identification and maturation of technologies capable of defeating WMD agents or agent based processes, then integrating them into weapons delivery systems for rapid WMD elimination.  This project includes developing specific WMD agent/agent-based process simulants, test infrastructure, and sampling capability required for effective development, testing, and evaluation of next-generation Counter-WMD (CWMD) technologies.

The project places a high priority on understanding, characterizing, and validating potential weapon effects within mathematical confidence as it relates to the unintended release of hazardous threat materials.  

The decrease from FY 2014 to FY 2015 is due to reduced investment in next generation CWMD technologies to balance other priorities.  The increase from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to increased investment in component demonstrations and sub-scale and field testing of WMD defeat and assessment technologies.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Nuclear Survivability project provides innovative technologies for DoD nuclear and conventional forces, associated control and support systems, and facilities to protect and deter nuclear threats to enable mission-essential functions to continue during and after the onset of hostile action by extremists and rogue states. The Nuclear Survivability project provides electromagnetic pulse (EMP) research and standards, Nuclear Weapons Effects (NWE) experimentation, advanced Radiation Hardened Microelectronics (RHM), and human survivability research.  The research from this project supports the 487 mission critical systems identified under DoDI 3150.09, Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Survivability Policy.

DTRA is the DoD designated EMP center of excellence to provide electromagnetic pulse survivability assessments to support national and military operational planning, weapons effects predictions, and national strategic system designs.  DTRA publishes nuclear related military standards and handbooks for the strategic and non-strategic warfighters and program offices as the DoD NWE subject matter expert.

The RHM program responds to DoD space and missile system requirements for nanoelectronics and photonics technology to support DoD strategic mission needs.  This program develops and demonstrates radiation-hardened, high-performance prototype microelectronics to ensure their availability from both private sector and government organizations. Further, the program develops DoD space and satellite nuclear survivability standards and handbooks that provide engineering level detail and defined metrics for all entities with space asset equities.

Pulsed power and laser-driven NWE simulators are available to validate nuclear survivability requirements for DoD missile and space systems, conduct radiation effects research in materials and electronics, and validate computational models.  The Experimental Capabilities Program is working with the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) and the United Kingdom's (UK) Atomic Weapons Establishment to jointly develop new enabling technologies for improved NWE experimentation capabilities for x-rays, gamma rays, and neutrons.

Human survivability conducts research to develop and validate mortality and morbidity models associated with radiological and nuclear weapons effects in urban environments.

The decrease from FY 2014 to FY 2015 is due to reduced investment in nuclear effects simulation/experimentation capability and radiation hardened nanoelectronics.  The increase from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to the realignment of the system vulnerabilities and assessment activities from Project RL-Nuclear &amp; Radiological Effects to Project RI.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The increase from FY 2014 to FY 2015 is due to the net effect of the cancellation of the Experimental Situational Awareness Center, a shift in priorities from weapon effects modeling to electromagnetic pulse modeling, and increased investment in full effects modeling.  The decrease from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to an administrative realignment of the System Vulnerability and Assessment program to Project RI-Nuclear Survivability due to the nature of that effort.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This project provides Combatant Commanders with the prediction capability and the attack options to engage WMD targets.  The project conducts weapon effects phenomenology tests, analyzes data, conducts high performance computer simulations, and creates/modifies software to more accurately model and simulate weapons effects on WMD and related targets.  These efforts will lead to advanced capabilities in countering WMD planning tools.  The Advanced Energetics Program develops new novel energetic materials and weapon design technology for rapid, directed, and enhanced energy release, providing new capability to defeat difficult WMD/Hard and Deeply Buried Targets. The Advanced Energetics Program develops new high energy systems well above current chemical energy levels to defeat WMD targets beyond the reach of traditional high explosive blast/frag warhead technology.

The decrease from FY 2014 to FY 2015 is due to reduced investment in small and medium-scale validation and parametric study experiments for advanced energetics.  The decrease from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to decreased investment in weapons effects modeling.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Combating Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Test and Evaluation Project provides a unique national test bed capability for simulated WMD facility characterization, weapon-target interaction, and WMD facility defeat testing to respond to operational needs by developing and maintaining test beds used by the Department of Defense (DoD), the Military Services, the Combatant Commanders, and other Federal Agencies to evaluate the implications of WMD, conventional, and other special weapon use against United States military or civilian systems and targets.  It leverages 50 years of testing expertise to investigate weapons effects and target response across the spectrum of hostile environments that could be created by proliferate nations or terrorist organizations with access to advanced conventional weapons or WMD (nuclear, biological, and chemical).  The project provides capabilities that support the testing requirements of warfighters, other government agencies, and friendly foreign countries.  It creates testing strategies and a WMD Test Bed infrastructure focusing on the structural response of buildings and Hard and Deeply Buried Targets that house nuclear, biological, and chemical facilities.  It provides support for full and sub-scale tests that focus on weapon-target interaction with fixed soft and hardened facilities to include above ground facilities, cut-and-cover facilities, and deep underground tunnels.  This capability does not exist anywhere else within the DoD and supports the counterproliferation pillar of the National Strategy to Combat WMD.

The decrease from FY 2014 to FY 2015 is due to the cancellation of the Infrastructure Development and Improvement program to balance priorities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Fundamental Research for Combating Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) project conducts technology reviews of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency’s (DTRA’s) Basic Research Program to identify promising emerging science with potential to be matured into CWMD technologies.  The advancement of technology and science into applied technology development efforts focuses upon increasing the stability and utility of mid-to-long term, moderate risk but high payoff science, and emerging technologies for transition to other DTRA applied technology programs.  This effort serves as the bridge between the bench scientist and the applied technologist.

The decrease from FY 2014 to FY 2015 is due to the completion of the University Strategic Partnership activities with the University of New Mexico and Pennsylvania State University.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The mission of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is to safeguard the United States and its allies from global weapons of mass destruction (WMD) threats by integrating, synchronizing, and providing responsive expertise, technologies, and capabilities.  This mission directly reflects several national and Department of Defense (DoD) level guidance/vision documents.  For Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation, these documents include the National Security Strategy, Defense Strategic Guidance (Sustaining U.S. Global Leadership: Priorities for 21st Century Defense), 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review, National Strategy for Combating Terrorism, 2002 National Strategy to Combat WMD, Defense Planning Guidance, Guidance for Employment of the Force, 2014 DoD Strategy for Countering WMD, National Military Strategic Plan for the War on Terrorism, Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan (including the Nuclear Annex), and 2010 Nuclear Posture Review.  To achieve this mission, DTRA has identified principal objectives along with strategies and tasks to ensure the objectives are met.  These objectives are: 1) Ensure a safe, secure, and effective nuclear deterrent; 2) Anticipate emerging WMD threats; 3) Provide Combating WMD situational awareness; 4) Assess infrastructure and personnel vulnerabilities; 5) Prevent proliferation and use of WMD; 6) Defend against WMD threats; 7) Defeat WMD threats; 8) Recover from WMD consequences; and 9) Synchronize countering WMD activities.

The Counterproliferation Initiatives - Proliferation, Prevention, and Defeat program element reduces WMD proliferation and enhances WMD defeat capabilities through advanced technology development.  To accomplish this objective, the DTRA established the following projects:  RA-Information Sciences and Applications, RD-Detection Technologies, RE-Counter-Terrorism Technologies, RF-Forensics Technologies, RG-Defeat Technologies, RI-Nuclear Survivability, RM-WMD Counterforce Technologies, and RT-Target Assessment Technologies.  These projects support technology requirements in line with the Joint Functional Concepts (Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 3170.01).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Information Sciences and Applications project provides technical reachback support to create decision advantage for the United States and our allies through improved situational understanding across the complete Combating Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) mission space. The Technical Reachback effort provides 24 hour/7 days per week information and analyses on potential impacts of a weapon of mass destruction (WMD) event to warfighters and first responders in consult with the DTRA’s CWMD research and development subject matter experts. This effort develops and integrates capabilities and processes to support assessment and estimation of WMD effects and consequences, to include secondary and tertiary effects.  This project has also provided support (through FY 2014) to international CWMD science and technology cooperation by developing modifications, improvements, or new technologies and information tools suitable for foreign release and cooperative efforts. 

The decrease from FY 2014 to FY 2015 was due to the completion of efforts in building partner capacity development activities.  The increase from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to the realignment of funding for Technical Reachback from Project RM-WMD Counterforce Technologies to Project RA to better reflect the nature of those activities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The United States has long recognized the challenges associated with a state actor losing custody of a nuclear weapon or of a violent extremist organization gaining control of such a device.  The Defense Threat Reduction Agency’s research and development mitigates these challenges by enabling Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction efforts through advancing radiation detection capabilities.  There are physical limits to the efficacy of traditional radiation detection, and the successful recovery or interdiction of a weapon may depend on detection capabilities that apply much earlier in the nuclear threat chain continuum.  The nuclear threat chain continuum can be defined as the entire spectrum of activities that might lead to the state loss or violent extremist organization acquisition of a nuclear weapon.  Beginning FY 2016, Project RD will conduct research, development, test, &amp; evaluation (RDT&amp;E) to 1) advance detection—both sensor technology and related methodologies—for signatures/indicators associated with nuclear threat enablers such as nuclear expertise, financing, or unique materials in order to advance U.S. Government capabilities to detect and interdict such threats; and 2) locate, identify, and track Special Nuclear Material by integrating new technologies into detection systems and delivering prototypes for evaluation and further procurement by Services/Special Mission Units. These efforts support Department of Defense (DoD) requirements for combating terrorism, counter/nonproliferation, and homeland defense.

The increase from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to the subdivision of Project RF-Detection and Forensics Technologies into projects RD-Detection Technologies and RF-Forensics Technologies beginning in FY 2016.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Counter-Terrorism Technologies project is an over-arching project that develops and transitions a full spectrum of new technologies to counter emergent weapons of mass destruction (WMD) thus enabling warfighters to improve their ability to detect, disable, interdict, neutralize, and destroy chemical, biological, nuclear production, storage, and weaponization facilities and systems.  This high priority project focuses on support to the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM).  Through enhancing USSOCOM capabilities, this project supports the highest priority mission areas in the National Security Strategy, the National Strategy to Combat WMD, the National Military Strategy to Combat WMD, the Quadrennial Defense Review, and the Guidance on the Employment of the Force.  The following efforts are included:

The CWMD-T technologies program builds upon collaborative efforts with the warfighter.  This program develops proofs of concept and subsequent advancements in research, development, testing, and evaluation and provides multi-mission capabilities that may be applied throughout the entire spectrum of warfare while significantly eliminating collateral damage.  The CWMD-T technologies program develops technologies to enable the warfighter to locate, identify, characterize, and access Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear WMDs, their production and storage facilities, and associated enablers at multiple nodes along the terrorist development/acquisition pathway in order to disrupt, delay, degrade, destroy, or deny WMDs while minimizing risk to U.S. forces.

The Counter WMD-Terrorism (CWMD-T) Counterproliferation research and development (R&amp;D) program is a collaborative effort with USSOCOM in which DTRA manages and sub-allocates a portion of this funding directly to USSOCOM to develop warfighter-unique technologies in support of USSOCOM’s counterterrorism and counterproliferation mission.  New counterterrorism and counterproliferation technologies are developed under USSOCOM management, and in coordination with DTRA, to provide warfighters with the operational capability to counter WMD threats.

Under Project RE, the USSOCOM CWMD-T Support Program integrates and federates all-source intelligence and other information with operational analysis to support Combatant Command (CCMD) planning processes related to CWMD-T.  Research is focused on developing and improving technologies to ingest, organize, interpret, and operationalize large amounts of data from many sources, multiple formats, and all relevant classification levels to provide the warfighter with a dynamic picture of the WMD-T operational environment.

The increase from FY 2014 to FY 2015 was due to increased investments in technology solutions supporting operations in subterranean environments.  The decrease from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to the deferment of lower priority projects until further maturation in technology readiness level.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Forensics Technologies project under the Counterproliferation Initiatives - Proliferation, Prevention and Defeat Program Element emphasizes the advanced technology development and engineering portion of the overall National Technical Nuclear Forensics (NTNF) effort. This project supports the attribution process through development, demonstration, and transition of improved post-detonation NTNF capabilities in the areas of materials collection, debris diagnostics, materials analysis, prompt diagnostics, and device reconstruction. Efforts under this project also support international peacekeeping and nonproliferation objectives, on-site and aerial inspections and monitoring, on-site sampling and sample transport, and on- and off-site analysis to meet forensic, verification, monitoring, and confidence-building requirements.  Prior to FY 2016, Project RF included funding to detect, locate, identify, track, and interdict nuclear and radiological threats.  This included weapons, material, and enablers to their acquisition and development, such as nuclear expertise, financing, or unique technologies.  Efforts support Department of Defense (DoD) requirements for combating terrorism, counter/nonproliferation, and homeland defense.

The decrease from FY 2014 to FY 2015 was due to reduced investment in novel advanced nuclear/radiological detection technologies and restructuring DoD-relevant monitoring and verification activities in support of the DoD proliferation monitoring mission. The decrease from FY 2015 to FY 2016 in Project RF is due to the realignment of nuclear threat detection activities into Project RD-Detection Technologies.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Defeat Technologies project develops, integrates, demonstrates and transitions innovative kinetic and non-kinetic weapon capabilities to expand traditional and asymmetric options available to Combatant Commanders (CCDRs) to deny, disrupt, and defeat adversarial use of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) while minimizing collateral effects from incidentally released agents.  Technology development focuses on the physical or functional defeat of (1) chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threat materials, (2) an adversary's ability to deliver the same, and (3) the physical and non-physical support networks enabling both.  It does so through the systematic identification and maturation of advanced technologies capable of defeating WMD agents or agent based processes, then integrating them into weapons, delivery systems or rapid WMD elimination capabilities.  This project includes developing specific WMD agent/agent-based process simulants, test infrastructure, and sampling capability required for effective development, testing, and evaluation of next-generation capabilities to ensure optimum weapon solutions are achieved based on this technology.  The project addresses defeat of adversaries' offensive WMD programs through integration of current conventional weapons capabilities and next generation kinetic and non-kinetic solutions to provide full-spectrum asymmetric defeat options.  The project addresses requirements delineated in the Quadrennial Defense Review and Strategic Planning Guidance as codified in the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System, Service requirements documents, and Combatant Command and Agency Priority Lists for lethal and non-lethal Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) capability.

The increase from FY 2014 to FY 2015 was due to increased investment in CWMD Hard Target Defeat Weapons Technologies.  The increase from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to increased investment to build and conduct the initial full-scale testing of the Next Generation of CWMD weapon concept.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Nuclear Survivability project develops Radiation Hardened Microelectronics and survivability standards; provides radiation dose assessments; and provides for the execution of force-on-force evaluations and nuclear weapons surety efforts to enhance the protection of nuclear resources.

The Nuclear Test Personnel Review (NTPR) Program, established in public law, confirms participation in nuclear testing and related events and provides radiation dose assessments for atomic veterans.  The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) provides subject matter expertise for the dose reconstructions.  The NTPR is administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Justice for radiogenic disease compensation programs.

The Mighty Guardian force-on-force tests aid in satisfying requirements for the Military Services by providing denial of access to nuclear resources in all environments: operational, storage, and in transit.  The results of the evaluations identify security vulnerabilities to weapons systems that are then addressed through targeted application of research and development projects requested by the resource owners.  These projects are designed to demonstrate, test, and evaluate security enhancement systems prior to the Services' procurement.

Nuclear Weapons Surety, as tasked by the Department of Defense (DoD) Nuclear Weapon System Safety Program, provides Combatant Commands (CCMDs), Military Services, and Joint Chiefs of Staff with technical analyses, studies, research, and experimental data necessary to identify and quantify risks of plutonium dispersal and loss of assured safety due to accidents, fires, or natural causes during peacetime operations of the nation’s nuclear weapon systems.  Additionally, this will provide studies necessary to quantify the probability of success against targeted terrorist attacks on DoD facilities, while leveraging these risk assessment advances.  It also provides new and innovative technologies for the protection of nuclear resources in support of CCMDs and Military Services.  

The decrease from FY 2014 to FY 2015 was due to the net impact of increased investment in stockpile logistics and decreased investment in nuclear surety in FY 2015.  The increase from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to increased investment in the nuclear surety program.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The two major components of this project are: (1) WMD battlespace awareness and (2) counter WMD (CWMD) weapons effects and planning tools.  WMD battlespace awareness efforts seek to provide warfighters with capabilities to find, characterize, and assess WMD threats.  This project provides capabilities through the development and integration of multi-mission Unmanned Aerial Systems payloads to emplace sensing technologies, and remotely sense, identify, track, and target WMD-related threats; and, through the development and integration of low visibility, stand-off, and man-portable chemical agent and biological agent intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance technologies to sense, identify, track, target, and assess WMD-related threats. The CWMD weapons effects and planning tools effort develops modernized, fast-running, and validated CWMD planning tools and integrates modeling and simulation software to aid Combatant Commanders’ targeting and aid weapons officers in choosing the proper weapon, fuze, and employment parameters to optimize the defeat of WMD and related hard targets.

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>For some weapons of mass destruction (WMD) targets and hard and deeply buried targets (HDBTs), physical destruction may not be possible, practical, or desirable with current conventional weapons and employment techniques.  It may be possible or preferable to achieve operational objectives by denying or disrupting the mission or function of the target facility.  Functional defeat, however, requires extensive and highly detailed analysis of the target.  The functional defeat process includes finding and identifying a facility, characterizing its function and physical layout, determining its vulnerabilities to available defeat mechanisms, planning and executing an attack, assessing damage, and if necessary, suppressing reconstitution efforts and re-attacking the facility.  Target Assessment Technologies develops for both the Combatant Commands (CCMDs) and the Intelligence Community (IC), the analytical tools and processes required to find and characterize WMD targets and HDBTs; and then, in near-real-time, assess the results of attacks against those targets.  Overall objectives are to develop new methodologies, processes and technologies for detecting, locating, identifying, physically and functionally characterizing, modeling, and assessing new and existing hard and deeply buried targets to support physical or functional defeat.  Applying these processes to WMD time-dependent target characterization and threat analysis presents a further technical challenge.  

The increase from FY 2014 to FY2015 was due to increased investment in the development and integration of high-priority find, characterize and assess sensor technologies and supporting algorithms and software.  This project has the only identified solution capable of meeting a time sensitive mission critical technology gap.  The increase from FY 2015 to FY 2016 reflects the continuing increased investment in the development and integration of high-priority find, characterize and assess sensor technologies and supporting algorithms and software.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

*Integrated Weapons of Mass Destruction Toolset investments are to be completed in FY 2014.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The mission of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency is to safeguard the United States and its allies from global weapons of mass destruction (WMD) threats by integrating, synchronizing, and providing responsive expertise, technologies, and capabilities.  This mission directly aligns with several National and Department of Defense (DoD) level guidance/vision documents. For Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation, these documents include the National Security Strategy, Defense Strategic Guidance (Sustaining U.S. Global Leadership: Priorities for 21st Century Defense), Quadrennial Defense Review, National Strategy for Combating Terrorism, 2014 DoD Strategy for Countering WMD, National Strategy to Combat WMD, Defense Planning Guidance, Guidance for Employment of the Force, National Military Strategic Plan for the War on Terrorism, and Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan (including the Nuclear Annex).  To achieve this mission, DTRA established strategies and tasks to meet their principal objectives.  These objectives are: 1) Ensure a safe, secure, and effective nuclear deterrent; 2) Anticipate emerging WMD threats; 3) Provide Combating WMD situational awareness; 4) Assess infrastructure and personnel vulnerabilities; 5) Prevent proliferation and use of WMD; 6) Defend against WMD threats; 7) Defeat WMD threats; 8) Recover from WMD consequences; and 9) Synchronize countering WMD activities. 

This program element supports the development of system capabilities for the countering weapons of mass destruction (CWMD) mission.  This funding specifically supports technologies to meet International Monitoring System technology requirements in support of nuclear arms control activities under the Nuclear Arms Control Technology program. Through FY 2014, funding also supported the development of collaborative CWMD analysis capabilities between the DoD and key interagency and international partners through a globally accessible net-centric framework in the form of the Integrated Weapons of Mass Destruction Toolset.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports the development of verification and monitoring capabilities for the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) to counter proliferation and weapons of mass destruction (WMD).  DTRA’s Nuclear Arms Control Technologies (NACT) program performs Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) to improve the sustainability, reliability, and effectiveness of capabilities related to its operational mission to install, operate, maintain, and sustain the waveform and radionuclide nuclear detonation detection stations comprising the U.S. portion of the International Monitoring System (IMS).  This delivers data to the U.S. monitoring and verification community and enables U.S. compliance with the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) in support of U.S. and Department of Defense (DoD) nonproliferation objectives.  
  
The project addresses WMD monitoring, implementation of, and compliance with arms control agreement requirements validated by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics.  This project conforms to the administration’s research and development priorities related to WMD arms control and disablement.  Technical assessments are made against CTBT implementation requirements and U.S. objectives to provide the basis for sound project development, evaluate existing programs, provide data required to inform compliance assessments and support U.S. monitoring policy, decision-makers, and negotiation teams. 
 
The primary RDT&amp;E program emphasis is on improvements that enable the installation of treaty-specific stations, which reduce costs and increase the reliability in diverse and often harsh environments; improve efficiency, performance, reliability, and sustainability of existing stations and treaty-specified verification capabilities; and improve capabilities to detect, characterize, and enable discrimination of, nuclear weapons tests.  The NACT program directly supports U.S. and allied warfighter and national technical monitoring requirements and provides vital data used by the treaty monitoring community, warfighter planners, DoD, other U.S. Government agencies, and international agencies.  

The increase from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is for an enhanced level of investment in research on radionuclide sampling and analytical capabilities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

- Completed infrasound information system enhancements and development of infrasound propagation models to improve detection, identification, and discrimination of sources and signatures of interest.
- Conducted field experiments to collect data required to constrain and validate models.  Models will include fine-scale atmospheric conditions, topography, 3-D winds and effects of non-linear propagation.
- Continued to develop a portable/rapid deployable infrasound array and standard sound source for calibrating infrasound stations/arrays.
- Continued research and development on support system to collect and prioritize station operator requirements to inform required design-build-test activities across the monitoring system.  
- Continued U.S. IMS sensor event signal identification technique research and development of the transportable xenon laboratory (TXL) and associated xenon detection system and prepare for international deployment exercises and demonstrations.  Work performed in advance of the TXL foreign deployment will establish a baseline for this xenon monitoring capability and provide unique opportunities to diagnose and resolve remaining technical concerns and issues, including investigating the “memory effect” recently encountered in these systems as a result of the unintended radio-xenon releases from the Fukushima reactors.  Continued infrasound event clutter and false alarm reduction and noise mitigation analyses.  
- Drove improvements in radionuclide detection and measurement, including xenon gas collection/analysis systems research.  Evaluate detection limits, and yields.  Technical requirements continue to dictate that the U.S. radionuclide laboratory (RL-16) gas system requires additional capability to meet required detection thresholds.  
- Develop test methods to increase xenon gas yields, improve detection efficiencies, and decrease dead volume.  To ensure RL-16 is making a high precision measurement, analysis samples will be peer reviewed and calibrated at certified laboratories.</r2:Text>

CTBT IMS data availability/timeliness performance specifications/requirements are currently 98% data availability for IMS waveform and 95% for IMS radionuclide systems.  Data quality metrics continue to evolve as the entire CTBT IMS capability is exercised and tested.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                                                <r2:Remarks>The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) Nuclear Arms Control program installs, operates, maintains, and sustains the waveform and radionuclide nuclear detonation detection stations comprising the U.S. portion of the International Monitoring Systems (IMS) in order to deliver data to the U.S. monitoring and verification community and to enable U.S. compliance to the terms of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) in support of U.S. and Department of Defense (DOD) nonproliferation objectives.  The project addresses weapons of mass destruction (WMD) monitoring requirements validated by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics.  This project conforms to the administration’s research and development priorities as related to WMD arms control and disablement. Technical assessments are made against CTBT implementation requirements and U.S. objectives to provide the basis for sound project development, evaluate existing programs, and provide the data required to inform compliance assessments, and support U.S. monitoring policy and decision-makers, and negotiation teams.  NOTE:  As this program and its requirements mature and legacy contract vehicles expire, the composition of the performer base under DTRA program management will be dynamic.</r2:Remarks>

Under Project RL, the Net-Centric Architecture program integrated legacy capabilities and facilitated data sharing through a net-centric framework. It provided near-real time collaborative analysis capabilities between the Department of Defense (DoD) and key interagency and international partners through a globally accessible net-centric framework known as the Integrated Weapons of Mass Destruction Toolset.  This toolset migrated the Defense Threat Reduction Agency's (DTRA's) chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear modeling and simulation codes to provide an integrated suite of Combating WMD decision support capabilities. The framework was the only operational chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high-yield explosives (CBRNE) framework in the world that provided capabilities through web applications, net-centric web services, and stand-alone mobile deployments which are validated and accredited for operational use by international, National, state, and local authorities.  

The decrease in FY 2015 is due to the completion of Integrated Weapons of Mass Destruction Toolset investments.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

IWMDT was funded in 2004 by a competitive Cost Plus Award Fee (CPAF) contract for $12.425M over a 3-year period.  At end of FY 2006, its follow-on contract was awarded with an initial $0.300M increment.  IWMDT efforts continued into FY 2013 with $58.555M applied.  The Joint Collaborative Analysis Model, a subcomponent within IWMDT will be openly competed under one of the new DTRA Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contracts for approximately $2.500M for FY  2014.</r2:Remarks>

                                        <r2:SummaryExplanation>In FY2013, the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff directed the transformation of the Joint Experimentation program to an assessment focus.  The Joint Staff no longer supports experimentation functions originally outlined in the Joint Experimentation R-2.  While JS J7 divested this piece, other portions such as concept development and wargaming were retained. The shift in focus aligns more closely with those functions under BA6 RDT&amp;E Management Support.  As a result, this line was zeroed out and the remaining requirement was realigned to Joint Staff Analytical Support, PE 0204571J, BA6.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>In support of the Chairman’s responsibility for the assessment of the capability and adequacy of United States forces to successfully execute the national military strategy the Joint Systems Integration (JSI) Program Element provides mission funding for the Joint Staff J6 C4 Assessments Division (C4AD). C4AD conducts interoperability assessments and develops solutions/recommendations to improve integration of Service, Defense Agency, and coalition systems. 

C4AD's Persistent Command and Control Environment replicates an operational environment and provides Combatant Commands, Services, Agencies and Coalition partners at the joint force headquarters level, a laboratory and assessment venue for the warfighter and capability developer to identify and solve interoperability and integration issues with current and near-term joint and coalition capabilities. With this capability, C4AD assesses system of systems interoperability, operational capability, procedural compliance and technical suitability of emerging and existing systems and programs to confirm readiness for deployment.  

By establishing ground truth for interoperability and suggesting remedies for demonstrated shortfalls, C4AD is an enabler for the Chairman’s priorities to: pioneer new ways to combine and employ emergent capabilities, drive Jointness deeper, sooner in capability development, move quickly toward Joint information and simulation networks that support secure and agile command and control, expand the envelope of interagency and international cooperation, and promote multilateral security approaches and architectures.  In FY 2016, this legacy USJFCOM PE will be consolidated along with PE 0604828J (JFIIT) and PE 0607828J (JII) into a single new Joint Staff PE 0604826J – Joint Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Cyber Integration (JC5I). 

In FY2016 this program element will be consolidated with PE 0604826J - Joint C5 (Joint Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Cyber) Capability Development, Integration, and Interoperability Assessments.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

FY 2016 focus areas include:  Command and Control, Mission Partner Environment, and operations in Cyberspace Capability Development.  This includes the impact of technology advances in wireless devices, modem technology, and small secure digital capabilities on warfighter command and control capabilities to match emerging requirements with near-term technology solutions.  A comprehensive Joint Task Force (JTF) environment will support the integration and operational assessment process and support cyber training, capability development and assessments, separately and in coordination with the Department of Defense Cyber Range Environment (DECRE). This is achieved by maintaining a persistent C5 laboratory environment that allows for a rapidly reconfigurable joint, coalition, and inter-agency interoperability assessments, including participation in the Coalition Interoperability and Assurance Validation (CIAV) which supports on-going war efforts.  In a live setting, a deployable capability allows for range instrumentation and both the collection and analysis of decision quality data for cyber and command and control operations. This objective, joint analysis provides the data and analysis from which Director, Operational Testing and Evaluation decisions are made.</r2:Text>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Joint Integrated Air and Missile Defense Organization (JIAMDO) is the organization within the Department of Defense (DoD) chartered to plan, coordinate, and oversee Joint Air and Missile Defense (AMD) requirements, joint operational concepts, and operational architectures.  As part of the Joint Staff (TJS), JIAMDO supports the Chairman in meeting his Title 10 responsibilities as they relate to air and missile defense issues.  JIAMDO serves as the operational community's proponent for characteristics, requirements, and capabilities in air and missile defense, and is the joint air and missile defense resource proponent within the DoD's resource allocation structures.  JIAMDO also leads AMD mission area and utility analyses, integrates air and missile defense within the Force Protection joint capability area, and conducts evaluations and demonstrations of joint air and missile defense architectures and concepts.

JIAMDO has established a close partnership with Combatant Commands (CCMDs) and maintains liaison offices at all major CCMD locations to facilitate coordination of integration issues and requirements.  In particular, JIAMDO maintains close coordination with U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) in support of ballistic missile defense of the U.S.  It provides the CJCS and the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) the ability to meet statutory responsibilities to review the cost, schedule, and performance criteria of Missile Defense Agency (MDA) missile defense programs, and assesses the validity of those criteria in relation to national and military requirements.  At the request of USSTRATCOM, and at the direction of the CJCS, JIAMDO supports USSTRATCOM in the conduct of Military Utility Assessments and analysis of the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS).  JIAMDO supports the USSTRATCOM mission by ensuring operational and technical requirements are integrated into the theater missile warning architecture.  JIAMDO represents the Joint Staff in work on the AMD Capabilities Based Assessment Joint Service Team.  JIAMDO also provides direct support to U.S. Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) for homeland air surveillance issues.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Joint Integrated Air and Missile Defense Organization (JIAMDO) is the organization within the Department of Defense (DoD) chartered to plan, coordinate, and oversee Joint Air and Missile Defense (AMD) requirements, joint operational concepts, and operational architectures.  As part of the Joint Staff (TJS), JIAMDO supports the Chairman in meeting his Title 10 responsibilities as they relate to air and missile defense issues. JIAMDO serves as the operational community's proponent for characteristics, requirements, and capabilities in air and missile defense, and is the joint air and missile defense resource proponent within the DoD's resource allocation structures.  JIAMDO also leads AMD mission area and utility analyses, integrates air and missile defense within the Force Protection joint capability area, and conducts evaluations and demonstrations of joint air and missile defense architectures and concepts.

JIAMDO has established a close partnership with Combatant Commands (CCMDs) and maintains liaison offices at all major CCMD locations to facilitate coordination of integration issues and requirements.  In particular, JIAMDO maintains close coordination with U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) in support of ballistic missile defense of the U.S.  It provides the Chairman, JCS and the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) the ability to meet statutory responsibilities to review the cost, schedule, and performance criteria of Missile Defense Agency (MDA) missile defense programs, and assesses the validity of those criteria in relation to national and military requirements. At the request of USSTRATCOM, and at the direction of the CJCS, JIAMDO supports USSTRATCOM in the conduct of Military Utility Assessments and analysis of the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS).  JIAMDO supports the USSTRATCOM mission by ensuring operational and technical requirements are integrated into the theater missile warning architecture.  JIAMDO represents the Joint Staff in work on the AMD Capabilities Based Assessment Joint Service Team and provides direct support to U.S. Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) for homeland air surveillance issues.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The first execution of Iron Crucible will focus on the Capstone Concept for Joint Force 2020 (CCJO), the Joint Operational Access Concept (JOAC), the Joint Concept for Entry Operations (JCEO), and the Joint Concept for Rapid Aggregation (JCRA).  The outcome will validate the central idea of the concepts and discovered capability gaps to be considered for future concepts.  In support of the anticipated development of a follow-on to the current CCJO, a sequence of seminars engaging military and civilian DoD experts, academia, and think tanks on the future operations environment beyond 2020 was initiated and will conclude in FY2015 with the publishing of a final report.  Other accomplishments include the completion and signing of the JCEO and JCRA plus implementation plans for JOAC, JCEO and JCRA, and the Joint Concept for Joint Electromagnetic Spectrum Operations (JCJEMSO).</r2:Text>

JSAS encompasses the developmental tools and infrastructure required to conduct analyses and formulates the results to best assist the Chairman in fulfilling his statutory responsibilities.   Under the umbrella of analytical support tools are the Automated Global Force Management Tool (AGT) and the Collaborative Issue Resolution Tool (CIRT), both which will meet requirements set forth in Title 10 U.S.C. and the Unified Command Plan (UCP) for automating the Global Force Management Implementation Guidance Forces For (Assignment and Apportionment) tables.  Additionally, the Joint Organizational Server (JOS) will be the enabler system for Joint Staff personnel to be entered, near-real-time, into the automated Forces For Process.

                                                        <r2:Description>RDT&amp;E funds for the Global Force Management (GFM) program will enable the Assignment, Allocation, and Apportionment functions for forces to meet the requirements set forth in Title 10 U.S.C. and the Unified Command Plan (UCP).  The development of the Secretary of Defense's "Forces for Unified Commands" Memorandum Assignment Tables has historically been a labor intensive staffing process conducted annually.  The automated GFM Toolset is the first downstream consumer of force structure data resident in the seven organization (org) servers that are made available by the GFM Data Initiative (DI) effort.  CIRT has streamlined force management, increased common understanding of force assignment, and supported timely force management decisions.  The objective is to automate the generation of the Global Force Management Implementation Guidance (GFMIG) and Forces For Unified Commands (Forces For) Assignment, Apportionment, and Allocation tables.  These efforts will flatten, streamline, and automate the current process while providing high fidelity data and transparency, and enhance Combatant Commander risk assessment to operational plans.  The Joint Organizational Server (JOS) will be the enabler system for Joint Staff personnel to be entered, near-real-time, into the automated Forces For Process.  Failure to fund for this effort negatively impacts the ability of the Services, CCMDs, Joint Staff (JS) and Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) to efficiently manage force structure resources.</r2:Description>

                                                <r2:PerformanceMetrics>RDT&amp;E development efforts are evaluated based on the performance metrics.  This ensures the JIOR capacity and capability development funding is synchronized against prioritized training and testing requirements, based on designs derived and tested against synchronized requirements, and result in deployed capabilities that are within the enterprise’s capacity to deliver.  Performance metrics include, but are not limited to; cost, time, relevancy, and analytics and as defined below:
• Cost – Does the effort enable the most cost effective cyber training?
• Time – Will the effort enable trainers/ testers to more quickly create and synchronize testing, and more rapidly plan and execute cyber training and test events?
• Relevance – Will the effort enable cyber mission forces certification and re-certification, and training?  Does the capability enable cyber range practitioners to more rapidly reconfigure networks?  Does the capability increase range availability to conduct relevant training based upon realistic design of cyber environments? 
• Analytics – Will the effort enable cyber practitioners to better assess how well individuals, staff and/or units operate under cyber-induced degraded, denied or compromised network conditions?

Measures:
(1) Meet capacity needs to train and certify Cyber Mission Forces (CMF) teams through FY2016.
(2) Complete all planned lifecycle modernization upgrades for FY2016. 
(3) Initiate project to enable hybrid communications transport circuit solution &amp; transition eligible JIOR communication circuits from Defense Research and Engineering Network – Defense Information Systems Network (multi-year project). 
(4) Initiate project to peer the Joint IO Range and the Joint Mission Environment Test Capability 2.0 (JMETC 2.0) in order to leverage each other’s assets/capabilities.  
(5) Host Cyber Guard/Cyber Flag events with less than two priority-1 (urgent fix required) and three priority-2 (immediate fix) problem trouble reports per event.
(6) Complete DoD Architecture Framework (DODAF) Viewpoint surveys and documentation in FY15. Use DODAF findings to vet designs for a virtual mil-ops cyber range with enterprise stakeholders. 
(7) Work towards automating manual paper-driven planning processes in order to reduce event planning timeline. 
(8) Leverage automation to progress towards reducing network reconfiguration time to maximize environment use and reuse of Defense Enterprise Cyber Range Environment (DECRE) ranges.

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element enables USSOCOM to conduct studies and develop laboratory prototypes for applied research and advanced technology development, as well as leverage other organizations' technology projects that may not otherwise be affordable within MFP-11.  Applying small incremental amounts of investments to DoD, other government agencies, and commercial organizations allows USSOCOM to influence the direction of technology development or the schedule against which it is being pursued, and to acquire emerging technologies for Special Operations Forces.  This project provides an investment strategy for USSOCOM to link technology opportunities with capability deficiencies, capability objectives, technology thrust areas, human endurance and sensory performance, and technology development objectives.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project conducts studies and develops laboratory prototypes for applied research and advanced technology developments, and leverages other organizations' technology projects that may not otherwise be affordable within MFP-11.  Small incremental co-investments with DoD, other government agencies, and commercial organizations allows USSOCOM to influence the schedule and direction of technology developments, emerging technologies, and capabilities for Special Operations Forces (SOF), with significant economies of investment.  This USSOCOM investment strategy is used to link technology opportunities with USSOCOM capability deficiencies, capability objectives; technology thrust areas, and technology objectives.  Requirements in these areas may be advertised to industry and government research and development agencies via broad area announcements and calls for white papers.  Sub-projects within the SOF Technology Demonstration effort include:  

•  SOF Technology Development Sub-Project:  This project conducts studies and develops laboratory prototypes for applied research and advanced technology developments, and leverages other organizations' technology projects that may not otherwise be affordable within MFP-11.

•  Tagging, Tracking, and Locating (TTL) Sub-Project:  TTL funds Applied Research projects identified in the USSOCOM Quick Look Capabilities Based Assessments (QL-CBA).  TTL applies leading edge nanotechnology, biometric and biotechnology, and chemistry S&amp;T which is directed towards the development of revolutionary tags, taggants, sensors, communications, and data processing.

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Advanced Technology Development (project S200) conducts rapid prototyping and Advanced Technology Demonstrations (ATDs).  ATDs provide a means for demonstrating and evaluating the utility of emerging/advanced technologies in as realistic an operational environment as possible by Special Operations Forces (SOF) users.  Evaluation results are included in a transition package, which assists in the initiation of or insertion into an acquisition program.  Advanced Technology Development also addresses projects that are a result of unique joint special mission or area-specific needs for which a few-of-a-kind prototypes must be developed on a rapid response basis, or are of sufficient time sensitivity to accelerate the prototyping effort of a normal acquisition program in any phase.  

Engineering Analysis (project SF101) provides rapid response capability for the investigation, evaluation, and demonstration of technologies for SOF platform (ground, air, and maritime) and soldier system unique requirements. Timely application of SOF-unique technology is critical and necessary to meet requirements in such areas as: sensor integration; enhanced situational awareness; near-real-time intelligence to include data fusion, threat detection and avoidance; electronic support measures for threat geo-location and specific emitter identification; navigation; target detection; weapon performance integration; and future SOF platform and soldier system requirements.  Provides additional engineering analysis and testing required to transition items from national forces to theater forces.

Information and Broadcast Systems Advanced Technology (project S225) conducts rapid prototyping, advanced technology demonstrations, and advanced concept technology demonstrations of information and broadcast systems technology.  Includes planning, analyzing, evaluating, and production information systems capabilities and distribution/dissemination broadcast systems capabilities.  It provides a means for demonstrating and evaluating the utility of emerging/advanced technologies in as realistic an operational environment as possible by SOF users.  This project also integrates efforts with each other and conducts technology demonstrations in conjunction with joint experiments and other assessment events.  Evaluation results are included in a transition package, which assists in the initiation of or insertion into an acquisition program.  The project also addresses unique, joint special mission or area-specific needs for which prototypes must be developed on a rapid response basis, or are of sufficient time sensitivity to accelerate the prototyping effort of a normal acquisition program in any phase.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

It is a means for demonstrating and evaluating the utility of emerging/advanced technologies in operationally relevant environments with Special Operations Forces (SOF) users.  This project integrates emerging technologies and presents them in technology demonstrations, in conjunction with joint experiments and other assessment events.  Evaluation results often facilitate the initiation of new programs and the insertion of appropriate technologies to acquisition programs.   The element also addresses unique, joint special mission or area-specific needs for which a few rapid prototypes must be developed on a responsive basis, or are of sufficient time sensitivity to accelerate prototyping efforts of a normal acquisition program in any phase.  Sub-projects within the SOF Special Technology Development efforts include:  

  •  Special Operations Special Technology Sub-Project.  This sub-project integrates emerging technologies and presents them in technology demonstrations, in conjunction with joint experiments and other assessment events.

  • Tagging, Tracking, and Locating (TTL) Technologies Sub-Project.  TTL funds SOF unique ATDs identified in the USSOCOM Quick Look Capabilities Based Assessments (QL-CBA).  TTL rapidly prototypes and expeditiously transitions projects from laboratory to acquisition Programs of Record/operational use to address SOF capability deficiencies.

  • National to Theater Transition Sub-Project.  Conduct additional testing required to transition items from national forces to theater forces. 
  
  • Classified Sub-Project (provided under separate cover).

  • Signature Management Technology Demonstrator (details provided under separate cover).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project conducts rapid prototyping of information and broadcast system technology.  Includes cyber capabilities that predict the best media channels to reach potential target audiences, data mining and information collections tools, propaganda and social behavior analytical tools, cultural analysis tool sets and emerging technologies that support the planning and analytical needs for the Military Information Support Operations (MISO) forces.  It provides a means for demonstrating and evaluating the utility of emerging/advanced technologies in as realistic an operational environment as possible by SOF users.  This project integrates efforts and conducts technology demonstrations in conjunction with joint experiments and other assessment events and performs market research on emerging technologies that support all phases of MISO.  Evaluation results are included in a transition package, which assists in the initiation of or insertion into an acquisition program.  The project also addresses unique, joint special mission or area-specific needs.  Seeks technologies that will transform current MISO capabilities through two major objectives: 1) Exploit technologies capable of disseminating products to reach target audiences across a variety of media to include audiences in denied areas.  2) Automate and improve MISO planning and analytical capability through technologies that are integrated into SOF planning systems (Cultural Analysis, Targeting, Theme Development, Media &amp; Product Selection, Distribution &amp; Dissemination, and Measures of Effectiveness).  Develops software applications that increases the efficiency and shortens the timeline to get MISO dissemination packages approved.  Develops hardware/software tools that facilitate the collaboration and sharing of information and other critical data.  

Broadcast and Dissemination Modernization.  This initiative will initiate and continue development of emergent technologies available in the marketplace to transform and modernize planning, analysis, development, broadcast, distribution, dissemination, and feedback capabilities for MISO forces. This initiative will also continue development of appropriate emerging technologies initially identified by Advance Technology Demonstrations and Joint Capability Technology Demonstrations to transition to acquisition programs. Technologies include: multi-frequency broadcast systems; digital broadcast capabilities; remote controlled electronic paper; near-real-time command and control of unattended systems, especially in denied areas; focused/beam speaker sound technologies; visual projection technologies; advanced commercial broadcast technologies including amplitude modulation and frequency modulation radio transmitters and antenna; television transmitter and antenna systems; internet and telephony dissemination and broadcast systems; technologies capable of long-loiter broadcast and delivery in denied and permissive environment; and technologies that automate and improve planning and analytical capability through integrated capabilities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element is part of the Military Intelligence Program (MIP) that provides for the identification, development, and testing of the Distributed Common Ground/Surface System Special Operations Forces (DCGS-SOF).  The mission tailored infrastructure interconnects the warfighter and sensor data to find and fix enemy combatants and/or terrorists.  The DCGS-SOF program is a network-enabled, interoperable construct allowing continual, unimpeded sharing of intelligence data, information and services within SOF and between the Services, other national intelligence agencies, combatant commands and Multi-National partners in support of a Joint Task Force.  It connects the SOF warfighter with essential intelligence information and provides situational awareness information to SOF leadership at all echelons.  The primary functions of DCGS-SOF are to conduct processing, exploitation and dissemination (PED) for all SOF Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) sensors, permit the collection of SOF data from collection sensors and intelligence databases, share across the DCGS Integration Backbone and provide timely, tailored, all-source, fused intelligence reporting to the SOF warfighter.  This program will employ non-development commercial and government off-the-shelf hardware and software and will leverage from existing technology to the greatest degree possible.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project is part of the Military intelligence Program (MIP) that provides for the identification, development, and testing of the Distributed Common Ground/Surface System Special Operations Forces (DCGS-SOF).  The mission tailored infrastructure interconnects the warfighter and sensor data to find and fix enemy combatants and/or terrorists.  The DCGS-SOF program is a network-enabled, interoperable construct allowing continual, unimpeded sharing of intelligence data, information and services within SOF and between the Services, other national intelligence agencies, combatant commands and Multi-National partners in support of a Joint Task Force.  It connects the SOF warfighter with essential intelligence information and provides situational awareness information to SOF leadership at all echelons.  The primary functions of DCGS-SOF are to conduct processing, exploitation and dissemination (PED) for all SOF Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) sensors, permit the collection of SOF data from collection sensors and intelligence databases, share across the DCGS Integration Backbone and provide timely, tailored, all-source, fused intelligence reporting to the SOF warfighter.  This program will employ non-development commercial and government off-the-shelf hardware and software and will leverage from existing technology to the greatest degree possible.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>•  DCGS-SOF will partner within DOD and with other government agencies to integrate mature technologies into the SOF information enterprise and enable more agile access to and sharing of data and services to meet SOF-peculiar documented requirements.  The technology will allow for seamless integration with DOD, interagency, and coalition ISR tactical PED systems.  The DCGS-SOF program office employs an agile development process with capability insertions into the development baseline for assessment and future deployment into the operational baseline.  All development requirements are prioritized through the DCGS Requirements Working Group (DRWG) chaired by J2.  Once approved the requirements are evaluated and scheduled by engineering.  Using this methodology allows capabilities to be inserted in a fast and agile manner based on user requirements and priorities.  All evolutionary technology insertions (ETIs) in the R-4 schedule are based on current program office projections.  If requirement priorities change based on the DRWG, the ETI and version capabilities identified may change.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element is part of the Military Intelligence Program. This program element identifies, develops, integrates, and tests Special Operations Forces (SOF) - unique mission kits, mission payloads, weapons, and modifications on MQ-1 Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), ground control stations, and training systems as a component of the Medium Altitude Long Endurance Tactical Program.  USSOCOM is designated as the DoD lead for planning, synchronizing, and as directed, executing Overseas Contingency Operations against terrorist networks.  USSOCOM requires the capability to find, fix, finish, exploit, and analyze time-sensitive high-value targets.  These targets can often only be identified with patient collection of information and require rapid, decisive action during the short periods in which they present themselves.  This program element addresses the primary areas of Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, Target (ISR&amp;T) Acquisition, and Strike.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

This program element identifies, develops, integrates, and tests Special Operations Forces (SOF)-unique mission kits, mission payloads, weapons, and modifications on MQ-1 Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), ground control stations, and training systems.  As the supported combatant command, USSOCOM has been designated as the DoD lead for planning, synchronizing, and as directed, executing global operations against terrorist networks.  USSOCOM requires the capability to find, fix, finish, exploit, and analyze time-sensitive high-value targets.  These targets can often only be identified with patient collection of information and require rapid, decisive action during the short periods in which they present themselves.  This project addresses the primary areas of  Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, Target (ISR&amp;T) Acquisition, and Strike.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element is part of the Military Intelligence Program. Two programs are in this program element: Small Unmanned Aerial System (SUAS) and the Multi-mission Tactical Unmanned Aerial System (MTUAS).  SUAS identifies, develops, integrates, and tests Special Operations Forces (SOF) unique mission kits, mission payloads, air vehicle enhancements, and modifications on the SUAS and related ground control stations.  MTUAS identifies, develops, integrates, and tests Special Operations Forces (SOF) unique mission kits, mission payloads, air vehicle enhancements, and modifications on the MTUAS and related ground control stations.   

USSOCOM has been designated as the DoD lead for planning, synchronizing, and as directed, executing global operations against terrorist networks and targets. USSOCOM requires the capability to find, fix, and finish time-sensitive high-value fixed and fleeting targets at the unit and team level without placing personnel and units in harm’s way. These targets can often only be identified with patient collection of information and require rapid, decisive action during the short periods in which they present themselves. This line item addresses the primary areas of Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, and Targeting (ISR&amp;T) capabilities for SOF.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project is part of the Military Intelligence Program. Two programs are in this project: Small Unmanned Aerial System (SUAS) and the Multi-mission Tactical Unmanned Aerial System (MTUAS).  SUAS identifies, develops, integrates, and tests Special Operations Forces (SOF)-unique mission kits, mission payloads, air vehicle enhancements, and modifications on the SUAS and related ground control stations.  MTUAS identifies, develops, integrates, and tests Special Operations Forces (SOF) unique mission kits, mission payloads, air vehicle enhancements, and modifications on the MTUAS and related ground control stations. The current material solution for SUAS is the All Environment Capable Variant (AECV) of the Puma UAS. The current material solution for MTUAS is the Scan Eagle UAS.

USSOCOM has been designated as the DOD lead for planning, synchronizing, and as directed, executing global operations against terrorist networks and targets. USSOCOM requires the capability to find, fix, and finish time-sensitive high-value fixed and fleeting targets at the unit and team level without placing personnel and units in harm’s way. These targets can often only be identified with patient collection of information and require rapid, decisive action during the short periods in which they present themselves. This line item addresses the primary areas of Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, and Targeting (ISR&amp;T) capabilities for SOF.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element consists of a highly competitive three-phase award system that provides qualified small business concerns with the opportunity to propose high quality innovative ideas that meet specific research and development needs of USSOCOM.  Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) is a result of the Small Business Development Act of 1992.  It was enacted by Congress in Public Law 97-219, reenacted by Public Law 99-443, and reauthorized by the SBIR Program Reauthorization Act of 2012.  Starting in FY 1994, the SBIR program was refocused toward dual use and defense reinvestment efforts.  Phase I projects evaluate the scientific technical merit and feasibility of an idea.  Phase II projects expand the results of, and further pursue, the developments of Phase I.  Phase III is for commercialization of the results of Phase II and requires the use of private or non-SBIR federal funding.  USSOCOM participates annually in the DoD Request for Proposal process.  USSOCOM then awards its proposed SBIR projects.  FY 2014 is the first year USSOCOM is participating in the Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program.  The STTR goal is similar to the SBIR program, but the STTR program has the additional goal to expand public/private sector partnerships between small business and nonprofit U.S. research institutions.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project consists of a highly competitive three-phase award system that provides qualified small business concerns with the opportunity to propose high quality innovative ideas that meet specific research and development needs of USSOCOM.  Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) is a result of the Small Business Development Act of 1992.  It was enacted by Congress in Public Law 97-219, reenacted by Public Law 99-443, and reauthorized by the SBIR Program Reauthorization Act of 2012.  Starting in FY 1994, the SBIR program was refocused toward dual use and defense reinvestment efforts.  Phase I projects evaluate the scientific technical merit and feasibility of an idea.  Phase II projects expand the results of, and further pursue, the developments of Phase I.  Phase III is for commercialization of the results of Phase II and requires the use of private or non-SBIR federal funding.  USSOCOM participates annually in the DoD Request for Proposal process.  USSOCOM then awards its proposed SBIR projects.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Aviation Systems Advanced Development:
This project provides for the development, demonstration, and integration of current and maturing technologies for Special Operations Forces (SOF)-unique aviation and training requirements. Timely application of SOF-unique technology is critical and necessary to meet requirements in such areas as: SOF specific avionics; Low Probability of Intercept/Low Probability of Detection (LPI/LPD) terrain following/terrain avoidance radar; Defensive Countermeasures; Electronic Warfare (EW) - Radio Frequency Countermeasures (RFCM); Precision Strike Package (PSP) for AC-130W; AC-130H, AC-130W, and AC-130U Recapitalization, and other SOF airborne platforms; digital terrain elevation data and electronic order of battle; digital maps; enhanced situational awareness; near-real-time Intelligence Surveillance &amp; Reconnaissance (ISR); data fusion; threat detection and avoidance; navigation, target detection, and identification technologies; weapons integration; digital broadcast capabilities; aerial refueling; and ISR payload technological improvements with size, weight, power and integration onto all SOF ISR platforms. 

CV-22 Development:
The CV-22 is a SOF variant of the V-22 vertical medium lift, multi-mission aircraft. The CV-22 project provides long range, high speed, infiltration, exfiltration, and resupply to Special Forces teams in hostile, denied, and politically sensitive areas. This is a capability not currently provided by other existing aircraft. The V-22 Joint Program Office is developing improved capabilities in block increments. The funding in this project supports these block increments as well as associated flight test support. The Block 10 increment was completed in FY 2007, and the Block 20 increment started in FY 2008.  Block 10: Integrated and tested Directional Infrared Countermeasures, a system that protects against infrared guided missiles; designed, integrated and validated the Troop Commander Situational Awareness Station that provides the embarked troop commander access to the CV-22's communication, navigation and mission management system; relocated the ALE-47 chaff and flare dispenser control head to allow any cockpit crew member to activate defensive countermeasures; added a second forward firing chaff and flare dispenser to provide an adequate quantity of consumable countermeasures for the extended duration of SOF infiltration, exfiltration, and resupply missions; and incorporate a dual access feature to the Digital Map System to allow both the pilot and co-pilot to independently access and control the digital map display from the mission computer.
Block 20: Design, integrate, test, and validate enhancements required to meet SOF-unique mission requirements and correct deficiencies identified in previous testing.  This incremental development will provide improved capabilities to include, but not limited to, more robust performance in situational awareness, ISR,  weapons, avionics, survivability, maneuverability, mission deployment and improved reliability and maintainability of the CV platform.

Mission Training and Preparation Systems:
The Special Operations Mission Planning and Execution (SOMPE) project funds the definition, design, development, prototyping, integration, and testing of SOMPE systems to support mission planning, rehearsal, and execution requirements to meet SOF-unique mission requirements and correct deficiencies in current mission planning, rehearsal, and execution capabilities. The MTPS project also includes program management, systems engineering, configuration management, architecture development, risk reduction, and trade study initiatives, as well as initiatives to assure interoperability and commonality between diverse mission planning, rehearsal, and execution systems. 

AC/MC-130J:
The AC/MC-130J project funds core SOF-unique modifications to replace aging AC-130H Spectre, AC-130W Stinger II, AC-130U Spooky, MC-130E Combat Talon I, MC-130P Combat Shadow, MC-130H Combat Talon II.  The 8 AC-130H Spectre, 12 AC-130W Stinger II and 17 AC-130U Spooky airframes will be replaced with MC-130J aircraft modified with the PSP to achieve the AC-130J configuration.  The MC-130J Commando II aircraft perform clandestine or low visibility, single or multi-ship low-level missions intruding politically-sensitive or hostile territories; provide air refueling for special operations helicopters and CV-22 aircraft; airdrop of leaflets, small special operations teams, resupply bundles and combat rubber raiding craft; and provide close air support, air interdiction, armed reconnaissance, escort, and force protection - integrated base defense. Additional capabilities include low-level navigation and in-flight refueling. The Air Force will procure and field basic aircraft, common support equipment, and trainers for USSOCOM. An incremental upgrade approach will be used to incorporate SOF capabilities onto the aircraft and training systems.

Rotary Wing Aviation:
This project develops SOF-unique modifications and upgrades to SOF rotary wing aircraft that operate in increasingly hostile environments.  Rotary wing aircraft supported by this project include: MH-60M, MH-47G, and A/MH-6M. These aircraft provide aviation support to SOF in worldwide contingency operations and low-intensity conflicts. They must be capable of rapid deployment, undetected penetration of hostile areas, and operating at extended ranges under adverse weather conditions to infiltrate, provide logistics for, reinforce, and extract SOF.  The threat is characterized by an extensive and sophisticated ground based air defense system and an upgraded air-to-air capability targeted against helicopters.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The CV-22 is a Special Operations Forces (SOF) variant of the V-22 vertical medium lift, multi-mission aircraft and associated training systems.
The CV-22 provides long range, high speed infiltration, exfiltration, and resupply to Special Forces teams in hostile, denied, and politically sensitive areas. This
is a capability not currently provided by existing aircraft. The V-22 Joint Program Office is developing improved capabilities in block increments supported with rapid
prototyping. The funding in this project supports these block increments as well as associated flight test support. The Block 20 increment started in FY 2008.

Block 20: Design, integrate, test, and validate enhancements required to meet SOF-unique mission requirements and correct deficiencies identified in previous
testing. This incremental development will provide improved capabilities to include, but not limited to, robust performance in situational awareness, weapons, avionics, survivability, maneuverability, mission deployment, improved reliability and maintainability of the CV platform.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

ongoing V-22 production line with minimum impact. Funding for the baseline CV-22 Engineering Manufacturing and Development, known as Block 0, is embedded
in the Navy budget. Block 10 RDT&amp;E funding was sent from USSOCOM to NAVAIRSYSCOM to be placed on contract with the V-22 prime contractor. Block 10 capability is required for compliance with the Joint Operational Requirements Document and associated Milestone III Capabilities Production Document. Block 20 and subsequent block upgrades are planned to follow the same acquisition strategy, with NAVAIRSYSCOM PMA-275 ensuring the integration of SOF-unique systems with the ongoing basic vehicle improvements supporting both the CV-22 and the Marine Corps MV-22.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project funds the definition, design, development, prototyping, integration, and testing of Mission Training and Preparation Systems (MTPS) to support training, avoid obsolescence, and maintain simulator concurrency with weapon system configurations; support mission planning and rehearsal systems enhancements required to meet Special Operations Force (SOF)-unique mission requirements and correct deficiencies identified in previous testing; and support mission planning and rehearsal capabilities in current MTPS. The MTPS project also includes program management, systems engineering, configuration management, architecture development, risk reduction, and trade study initiatives, as well as initiatives to assure interoperability and commonality between diverse SOF training systems.

Special Operations Mission Planning and Execution (SOMPE) develops, integrates, tests, and validates software enhancements required to meet SOF-unique requirements for, and correct deficiencies to, mission planning, preview, and execution software tools to support all phases of SOF operations from deliberate to time-critical. The SOMPE project automates time-sensitive planning activities and provides enhanced situational awareness during mission execution. SOMPE provides the interoperable environment for SOF adaptive planning to integrate global operations including, but not limited to, precision strike software, digital navigation, and unmanned aerial systems command and control. This project also provides the integration of SOMPE with multi-dimensional visualization systems, providing immersive mission rehearsal in minimal timeframes from the SOMPE mission plan. SOMPE is embedded in the USSOCOM Headquarters, Theater Special Operations Commands, Joint Special Operations Task Forces, Joint Special Operations Aviation Components, SOF warfighters, and SOF warfighter platforms.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

MC-130H Combat Talon II, AC-130H Spectre, AC-130W Stinger II, and AC-130U Spooky airframes. The 8 AC-130H Spectre, 12 AC-130W Stinger II and 17 AC-130U Spooky airframes will be replaced with MC-130J aircraft modified with the Precision Strike Package (PSP) to achieve the AC-130J configuration. These platforms perform clandestine or low visibility, single- or multi-ship low-level missions intruding politically-sensitive or hostile territories; provide air refueling for special operations helicopters and CV-22 aircraft; airdrop leaflets, small special operations teams, resupply bundles and combat rubber raiding craft; and close air support (CAS), air interdiction, armed reconnaissance, escort, and force protection - integrated base defense. Additional capabilities include low-level navigation and in-flight refueling.  The Air Force will procure and field basic aircraft, common support equipment, and trainers for USSOCOM. USSOCOM will then employ an incremental upgrade approach to incorporate SOF capabilities onto the Air Force-provided aircraft.

Conducts development, integration, and testing of aircraft enhancements to meet SOF-unique mission requirements. Enhancements include, but are not limited to, SOF communications, mission processors, aircraft performance enhancements, enhanced situational awareness (ESA), electronic warfare and survivability systems, and other SOF mission kits. Provides PSP aircraft infrastructure development.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project develops/upgrades Special Operation Forces (SOF) rotary wing aircraft systems that operate in increasingly hostile environments.  Rotary wing aircraft supported by this project include: A/MH-6M, MH-60M, and MH-47G.  These aircraft provide aviation support to SOF in world-wide contingency operations and low-intensity conflicts and they must be capable of rapid deployment, undetected penetration of hostile areas, and operating at extended ranges under adverse weather conditions to infiltrate, provide logistics for, reinforce, and extract SOF.  The threat is characterized by an extensive and sophisticated ground based air defense system and an upgraded air-to-air capability targeted against helicopters.  Sub-projects include:  

•  A/MH-6M Block 3.0 Upgrade is necessary to restore structural, performance, and safety margins for the aircrews.  An airframe structural modification will address recurring structural failures due to high intensity, high gross weight operations, and a decade of battle damage.  A main/tail rotor drive train and engine control improvement efforts will reduce airframe loads and restore sufficient safety and performance margins.  An avionics upgrade Non-Developmental Item/Commercial Off-the-Shelf (NDI/COTS) will replace obsolescent components and provide improved battlefield situational awareness to the aircrews and customers necessary to support time sensitive mission requirements.  This upgrade is critical in keeping the A/MH-6M aircraft operational through FY 2020 and beyond or until a suitable replacement aircraft is available.  The non-recurring effort supports development, fabrication of test hardware, qualification of components and systems, and data items to support issuance of Government airworthiness releases for structural and software modifications.

•   MH-60M SOF Modernization program provides for the recurring/non-recurring systems engineering and platform integration efforts, to include continued flight and qualification testing and test support for MH-60M Block program.

•   MH-60M Block Upgrades provides the development, integration, and qualification efforts on the MH-60 helicopter to include flight test support, engineering analysis, documentation, and airworthiness substantiation.  

•   Degraded Visual Environment (DVE) solution will fuse information from currently fielded aircraft sensors with emerging technology to display real-time reference points, obstacles, and landing zone information to the aviator.  The DVE solution will provide MH-47/60 aircrews with visual cues for obstacle avoidance and aircraft control during all phases of flight and significantly increase crew and passenger survivability in DVE such as dirt and snow.  This program addresses SOF-unique requirements for rapid fielding and weight limitations, capitalizes on the unique skills of the SOF aviator while integrating with SOF-unique avionics, and leverages to the maximum extent possible, the use of existing sensors on SOF aircraft.  

•   Future Vertical Lift (FVL) program provides for the long-term replacement of an aging fleet of aircraft and provides a significant increase in range, speed, payload, survivability, reliability, and maintainability of vertical lift aircraft to meet emerging mission requirements.  USSOCOM will participate in the service-common development of a joint future vertical lift aircraft by injecting USSOCOM requirements and equities into the initial development and design efforts to minimize SOF-peculiar modifications to the common aircraft.

•   Infrared Countermeasure (IRCM) program provides a low Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) capability suitable for the A/MH-6 Mission Enhanced Little Bird.  The IRCM program will develop, integrate, qualify, and test a complete lightweight IRCM system to include a missile warning system and countermeasure capability.  The      A/MH-6 is the only tactical aircraft in the U.S. Army inventory without protection from infrared guided and other advanced Man Portable Air Defense missiles.

•   MH-47 Modifications and Upgrades program develops technologies to improve performance and safety of the MH-47G and decrease operational costs.  Efforts include the Active Parallel Actuator System (APAS), Active Noise Cancellation (ANC), and Engine Barrier Filter.

•   Mission Processor Upgrade (MPU) program provides for non-recurring engineering (NRE), systems engineering/testing, and future aircraft architecture studies that support the replacement and upgrade of the current mission and video processors for all Army Special Operations Aviation (ARSOA).  Upgrading all internal processors increases the processing power to support critical functionality and emerging technologies that will be integrated into the Common Avionics Architecture System (CAAS).  This MPU provides the processing and memory resources required to incorporate the following functions into the General Purpose Processing Unit (GPPU): (1) Global Air Traffic Management replaces ground-based navigation aids with a capability that meets the international requirement that all aircraft be compliant with digital and space-based navigation systems; (2) Situational Awareness for Safe Aircraft Recovery provides passive survivability for flight operations in all weather conditions by providing three-dimensional displays with flight path guidance to increase battle space awareness in zero-visibility conditions; (3) Cognitive Decision Aiding System fuses information on threat, route, weather, terrain, and friendly forces instantaneously adjusting an aircraft’s route to protect the flight crew in hazardous weather, low levels, and night conditions.

•   Next Generation Forward Looking Infrared (NGFLIR) program is a pre-planned product improvement that incorporates a multispectral sensor (Shortwave Infrared, Image Intensifying TV, and Color Day TV) into the existing Q2 Electro-Optical Sensor System (EOSS).  This will improve targeting, tracking, and aircrew situational awareness.  This program also maximizes the service life of the Q2 sensor by mitigating obsolescence and increasing functionality on the light and heavy assault platforms within the ARSOA fleet.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>•  A/MH-6M Block 3.0 Upgrade comprises three major efforts:  airframe/rotors, engine control, and cockpit.  The airframe/rotors development effort will be a sole-source contract to Boeing, who owns the technical data associated with the A/MH-6 airframe.  The engine control work will be performed by Rolls-Royce and Triumph Electronic Control Systems under sole-source contract to Rolls Royce.  The cockpit avionics architecture will be developed by Rockwell-Collins.  Any new hardware components will be NDI/COTS and will be competitively selected.  Airframe modification and integration work will be conducted at the Special Operations Forces Support Activity (SOFSA) by the incumbent contractor.

•  MH-60M SOF Modernization Program supports the systems integration and qualification efforts on the prototype MH-60M helicopter.  This includes, but is not limited to, government and contractor flight test support, engineering analysis, documentation, and airworthiness substantiation.  Contractor flight test support will be conducted by Sikorsky Aircraft while aircraft modification efforts will be performed at the SOFSA by the incumbent contractor. 

•  MH-60M Block Upgrades are accomplished for 72 MH-60M base aircraft with various contractors and acquisition vehicles.  The SOFSA executes SOF-peculiar upgrade modifications onto the MH-60M base aircraft. 

•  DVE integrates and qualifies a solution to address a safety of flight issue while flying in degraded visual environments.  A competitive source selection process will be conducted for the DVE solution which will procure, integrate, and install components to provide real-time “see through” imagery and heads up display of visual cues for obstacle avoidance and landing zone information during all phases of flight.  DVE will increase MH-60 and MH-47 and warfighter survivability in degraded visual environments.

•  FVL is the SOF aviation participation in the Joint FVL effort to develop the next generation of vertical takeoff and landing aircraft and establishes the foundation for the transformation of the DOD vertical lift aviation capabilities over the next forty years.   

•  IRCM will be a competitive source selection effort that develops, integrates, and qualifies a mission configurable Missile Warning System and IRCM capability which does not currently exist at a weight suitable for the A/MH-6 aircraft.  Special Operations Aviation requires the addition of IRCM to protect against increasingly proliferated and sophisticated infrared-guided weapons.   

•  MH-47 Modifications and Upgrades - These efforts develop technologies to improve performance and safety of the MH-47G and decrease operational costs.  Efforts include the APAS, ANC and Engine Barrier Filter.  The upgrades and modifications mostly consist of Government executed integration, testing, and qualification efforts with some analytical engineering services to be completed.

•  MPU - The GPPU NRE supports improvements to the video processing and Ethernet switch capabilities for CAAS aircraft.  The engineering and testing will be sole-source to Rockwell Collins, the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) for the GPPU.  The Data Concentrator Unit (DCU) Modernization NRE will be used to improve analog-to-digital signal processing and reliability, as well as reduce weight.  The DCU efforts will be sole-source to Sanmina SCI Corporation, the OEM for the DCU.  The Future Aircraft Architecture Studies will be competitively awarded.

•  NGFLIR integration of a multi-spectral sensor into the Q2 EOSS will be sole-source procurement through Raytheon.  As the OEM, Raytheon maintains overall responsibility for the Q2 System, and will develop an acquisition strategy to develop, test, and integrate the multi-spectral sensor.  Raytheon is closely monitoring the joint Technology Applications Program Office/Night Vision Electronic Sensors Directorate multi-spectral work, and is currently using Independent Research and Development to further mature that technology.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element is part of the Military Intelligence Program (MIP) that provides for the identification, development, and testing of Special Operations Forces (SOF) intelligence equipment to identify and eliminate deficiencies in providing timely intelligence to deployed forces. Sub-projects address the primary areas of intelligence dissemination, sensor systems, tagging, tracking, and locating devices, integrated threat warning to SOF mission platforms, and tactical exploitation of national system capabilities.  USSOCOM has developed an overall strategy to ensure that Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) systems continue to provide SOF with the required capabilities into the 21st century.  USSOCOM's C4I systems comprise an integrated network of systems providing positive command and control and timely exchange of intelligence and threat warning to all organizational echelons.  The C4I systems that support this new architecture employ the latest standards and technology by transitioning from separate systems to full integration with the Global Information Grid (GIG).  The GIG allows SOF elements to operate with any force combination in multiple environments.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project is part of the Military Intelligence Program (MIP) that provides for the identification, development, and testing of Special Operations Forces (SOF) intelligence equipment to identify and eliminate deficiencies in providing timely intelligence to deployed forces.  Sub-projects address the primary areas of intelligence dissemination, sensor systems, tagging, tracking, and locating devices, integrated threat warning to SOF mission platforms, and tactical exploitation of national system capabilities.  The systems developed  and tested in this line item are National Systems Support to SOF (NSSS);  Joint Threat Warning System (JTWS);  Hostile Forces - Tagging, Tracking, and Locating (HF-TTL);  Special Operations Tactical Video System (SOTVS);  Special Operations Forces Planning, Rehearsal and Execution Preparation (SOFPREP);  Integrated Survey Program (ISP);  and Sensitive Site Exploitation (SSE).

U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) has developed an overall strategy to ensure that Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) systems continue to provide SOF with the required capabilities throughout the 21st century.  USSOCOM's C4I systems comprise an integrated network of systems providing positive command and control and timely exchange of intelligence and threat warning to all organizational echelons.  The C4I systems that support this new architecture employ the latest standards and technology by transitioning from separate systems to full integration with the Global Information Grid (GIG).  The GIG allows SOF elements to operate with any force combination in multiple environments.  The intelligence programs funded in this project will meet annual emergent requirements and are grouped by the level of organizational element they support: Operational Element (Team) and Above Operational Element (Garrison).    

OPERATIONAL ELEMENT (TEAM)    

•   NSSS.  This program provides a research and development rapid prototyping capability which functions as HQ SOCOM's Tactical Exploitation of National Capabilities program.  NSSS improves the combat effectiveness of USSOCOM, its components, and the Theater Special Operations Commands by leveraging National Agency and Service development efforts to provide innovative space-based intelligence systems technologies and enhancements, products and special communications capabilities to tactical SOF units.  Focus items include:  small, tactical Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) Multi-Intelligence geo-location and targeting capabilities with Rapid Reliable Targeting (RRT) system, enhanced Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) processing capabilities by Fusing Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) with National Technical Means (NTM) and the Enhanced Image Rendering Tool, which allows sharing of NTM Imagery with coalition forces.  NSSS will also improve Signal Intelligence (SIGINT) capabilities by adding unclassified sensors into theater net-centric geo-location architecture, improve detection of Low-Probability of Intercept and Low Probability of Detection signals, and automated radar characterizations which enhances tactical SOF capabilities to find, fix, monitor, and target assets using NTM.

•   JTWS.  This program is an evolutionary acquisition (EA) program effort.  JTWS System of Systems (SoS) is principally a Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) system; however, it can be used under Electronic Warfare and/or Cyber authorities if required.  The JTWS SoS enables the SOF Cryptologic Operator (SCO) to collect, process, locate and exploit threat communications signals of interest in order to provide timely, relevant, and responsive intelligence, cross-cueing, and threat avoidance information directly to the SOF Commanders.  The JTWS SoS is assembled in four variants (level 1): Ground SIGINT Kit (GSK) variant, Maritime variant, Air variant (AVS) and Unmanned Air System (UAS) variant.  Each variant is further subdivided into a functional layer:  (level 2): Communications Intelligence, Electronic Intelligence, and Precision Geo-location (PGL) kits and an implementation layer (level 3) designed around the SCO mission environment and SOF platform specific requirements.

•   HF-TTL.  This program utilizes a commodity procurement strategy to provide SOF warfighters with the necessary tools to find, fix, and finish terrorist networks through the emplacement of sophisticated tags and devices that feed into an integrated architecture.  HF-TTL provides Global Combatant Commanders and SOF operators with an immediate capability to tag, track, and locate people, things and activities.  The HF-TTL program provides actionable intelligence for SOF planners.  The Mission Sets are comprised of a mix of different classes of tags and their associated detection, interrogation, viewing, tracking, and communications systems that are fielded annually to SOF Components and Theater Special Operations Commands (TSOC) based upon dynamic and emergent SOF operational requirements.  

•  SOTVS.  This program provides SOF with critical Special Reconnaissance (SR) equipment that directly supports the planning and execution of SOF missions.  This capability allows the SOF warfighter to meet SOF SR mission requirements to find, fix, finish, exploit, analyze, and disseminate information of adversary’s movement, construct, identification, location; and associated things and activities.  SOTVS provides Global Combatant Commanders and SOF operators with an immediate capability to visually and electronically acquire people, things, and activities and provides actionable intelligence for SOF planners and Commanders.  The SOTVS program consists of a Family of Systems (FoS) that employs an evolutionary acquisition strategy for evolving technology insertion, supplemented with commodity procurement.  The program FoS consists of interoperable equipment to capture and transfer near-real-time ground-based, tactical day/night/reduced visibility, imagery, video, and electronic proximity and movement sensing, all capable of dissemination through SOF organic, global C4I, and commercial communications infrastructures.

ABOVE OPERATIONAL ELEMENT (GARRISON)  

NOTE: Beginning in FY 2016 SOFPREP has been re-aligned from Mission Training and Preparation System program element 1160427BB into Special Operations Intelligence Systems Development program element 1160405BB.

• SOFPREP.  This program serves as the intelligence focal point for production of SOF enhanced Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) (maps, imagery, and terrain data) and 3D scene visualization database. SOFPREP gathers, processes, exploits and disseminates classified high resolution 3D databases and GEOINT data in support of SOF training, mission rehearsal and execution preparation systems. The program builds the common environment for SOF Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) applications and facilitates the integration of authoritative source data to enable the rapid discovery, retrieval, and reuse of GEOINT data across SOF planning, operations, intelligence and M&amp;S.  SOFPREP is a NGA-certified co-producer in support of time-sensitive SOF specific requirements. 

•   ISP.  This program collects and produces current, detailed, tactical planning data to support military operations to counter threats against US citizens, interests, and property located both domestic and overseas. ISP products are specifically tailored packages that provide operational information, as well as intelligence data for use by DOD and the U.S. Department of State to support operational planners for counter-terrorism operations, evacuations, and other rescue missions.

•   SSE.  This program provides the capability to exploit personnel, documents, electronic data, material, and forensic evidence on sensitive sites/objectives.  It allows collection and transmission of unique, measurable biometric signatures, including live/latent fingerprints, iris patterns, and facial features.  It also provides a means to verify against and enroll subjects into the DOD authoritative database, and to query that database to support hold or release decisions.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element provides for development, testing and integration of specialized equipment in the areas of automation, communication, radio, weapon, soldier protection and survival, visual augmentation, lasers and sensors, munition and military information support operations (MISO) systems.  The efforts within this PE improve SOF warfighting capabilities by continuing efforts to develop smaller, lighter, more efficient and more robust capabilities.  The SOF mission mandates that SOF systems remain technologically superior to any threat to provide a maximum degree of survivability while, generally, being conducted in harsh environments for unspecified periods and in locations requiring small unit autonomy.  Communications efforts will maintain a Command, Control, and Communications (C3) link between SOF Commanders and SOF Teams, and provide interoperability with all Services, various agencies of the U.S. Government, Air Traffic Control, commercial agencies and allied foreign forces.  Efforts relating to soldier protection and survival requirements will improve survivability and mobility of SOF while conducting varied missions.  Specialized visual augmentation, lasers and sensors will permit small, highly trained forces to conduct required operations across the entire spectrum of conflict.  Munition efforts include advanced engineering operational system development and qualification efforts related to SOF-peculiar munitions and equipment.  Additionally, MISO efforts include planned operations to convey selected information and indicators to foreign audiences to influence their emotions, motives, objective reasoning, and ultimately, the behavior of foreign governments, organizations, groups and individuals.  

Warrior Systems specialized equipment will permit small, highly trained forces to conduct required operations across the entire spectrum of conflict.  SOF must infiltrate by land, sea, and air to conduct unconventional warfare, direct action, or deep reconnaissance operations in denied areas against insurgent units, terrorists, or highly sophisticated threat forces.  The requirement to operate in denied areas controlled by a sophisticated threat mandates that SOF systems remain technologically superior to threat forces to ensure mission success.

Tactical Systems Development:
This project provides for development, testing, and integration of specialized automation equipment to meet the unique requirements of SOF. Tactical systems provide forward deployed forces with advanced networking, automated data processing, storage, and display capabilities to support situational awareness, mission planning and execution, and command and control (C2) of forces. 

Communications Equipment and Electronics Systems:
This project provides for communication systems to meet emergent requirements to support SOF.  SOF units require communications equipment that improves their warfighting capability without degrading their mobility.  Therefore, SOF Communications Equipment and Electronics is a continuing effort to develop smaller, lighter, more efficient and more robust SOF Command, Control, Communications, and Computer (C4) capabilities.

Tactical Radio Systems:
This project is for development of all SOF tactical radio programs.  SOF units require radio communication equipment that improves their warfighting capability without degrading their mobility.  United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) has developed an overall strategy to ensure that Tactical Radio Systems continue to provide SOF with the required capabilities throughout the 21st century.  SOF Tactical Radios provide the critical C3 link between SOF Commanders and SOF Teams involved in overseas contingency operations (OCO) and training exercises.  They also provide interoperability with all Services, various agencies of the U.S. Government, Air Traffic Control, commercial agencies, and allied/coalition forces.  Tactical Radios rapidly and seamlessly establish and maintain mobile and fixed (C2) communications between infiltrated/operational elements and higher echelon headquarters, allowing SOF to operate with any force combination in multiple environments.

Weapons Systems:
This project provides for next generation system development and pre-planned product improvements (P3I), testing, and integration of specialized weapon systems and weapon accessories to meet the unique requirements of SOF. Efforts include muzzle brakes and suppressors and P3I for assault, sniper, and crew served weapons leveraging the latest technological advances to achieve overmatch capability against emerging threats. 

Soldier Protection and Survival Systems:
This project provides for development, testing, and integration of specialized equipment to meet the unique soldier protection and survival requirements of SOF.  Specialized equipment will improve survivability and mobility of SOF while conducting varied missions.  Current efforts include, but are not limited to counter-improvised explosive device system improvements and testing to meet continually changing technology on the battlefield. 

Body Armor and Associated Equipment:
This project provides specialized equipment with ballistic protection to meet the unique soldier protection and survival requirements of SOF.  Specialized ballistic equipment improves survivability and load bearing equipment impacting the mobility of SOF while conducting varied missions.  This project enhances the SOF Personal Equipment Advanced Requirements (SPEAR) program by supporting body armor plates, soft armor, helmets, and eye protection.  It also provides for the research, development, and testing of a variety of body armor and personal protective equipment to meet current ballistic threats that exists on the battlefield.

Visual Augmentation, Lasers and Sensor Systems:
This project provides for development, testing, and integration of specialized visual augmentation, laser and sensor systems equipment to meet the unique requirements of SOF.  Programs in this area include binocular/monocular devices and visual augmentation to include next generation laser designation and geo-location systems.  

Munitions Development:
This project provides for the advanced engineering, operational system development, and qualification efforts related to SOF-peculiar and Foreign/Non-standard munitions and equipment.  Funding supports development of Insensitive Munitions (IM) technology and evaluation, in accordance with statutory requirement set forth in U.S. Code, Title 10, Chapter 141, Section 2389 (December 2001).  Testing is in accordance with the USSOCOM IM Strategic Plan.  Funding also supports efforts to develop and improve Stand-Off Precision Guided Munitions (SOPGM), including the development and integration of improved warheads, seeker, guidance navigation and control systems, operational flight software and missile delivery to meet SOF requirements.

MISO:
This project provides for the development, test and integration of MISO equipment.  MISO are planned operations to convey selected information and indicators to foreign audiences to influence their emotions, motives, objective reasoning, and ultimately, the behavior of foreign governments, organizations, groups, and individuals.  This project funds transformational systems and equipment to conduct the seven phase MISO process (planning, targeting audience analysis, series development, product development and design, approval, production/distribution/dissemination, and measures of effectiveness) in support of combatant commanders.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides for development, testing, and integration of specialized automation equipment to meet the unique requirements of Special Operations Forces (SOF). Specialized automation equipment will permit small, highly trained forces to conduct required operations across the entire spectrum of conflict. These operations are generally conducted in harsh environments, for unspecified periods and in locations requiring small unit autonomy. SOF must infiltrate by land, sea, and air to conduct unconventional warfare, direct action, or deep reconnaissance operations in denied areas against insurgent units, terrorists, or highly sophisticated threat forces. The requirement to operate in denied areas controlled by a sophisticated threat mandates that SOF systems remain technologically superior to threat forces to ensure mission success.

- The Tactical Local Area Network (TACLAN) provides SOF operational commanders and forward deployed forces advanced networking, automated data processing, storage, and display capabilities to support situational awareness, mission planning and execution, and command and control of forces. The project consists of Suites, Mission Planning Kits and Field Computing Devices, Coalition Local Area Network, and Full Motion Video Kits.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides for communication systems to meet emergent requirements to support Special Operations Forces (SOF). Communications Equipment and Electronics Systems is a continuing effort to develop smaller, lighter, more efficient and more robust SOF Command, Control, Communications, and Computer (C4) capabilities.   

USSOCOM's C4 systems comprise an integrated network of systems providing positive command and control and the timely exchange of information to all organizational echelons.  The C4I systems that support this new architecture employ the latest standards and technology by transitioning from separate systems to full integration within the Global Information Grid (GIG). The GIG is a multitude of existing and projected national assets that allows SOF elements to operate with any force combination in multiple environments. 

  • SOF Deployable Node (SDN) is a family of deployable, super high frequency, multi-band, Satellite Communications (SATCOM) systems providing the transport path for high-capacity, voice, data, video tele-conferencing (VTC), and full motion video at all levels of classification.  It consists of SDN subprograms, transport for intelligence variants, technology insertions and capital equipment replacement.

•  The Special Communications Enterprise (SCE) program includes organizations, practices, processes, services, networks, systems and subsystems that manage and provide clandestine exchange of information between elements (field-to-field, field-to-base, base-to-field) for worldwide deployed SOF units, often in austere environments with heavy adversarial monitoring.  This program transitioned from Program Element 1160402BB, Special Operations Advanced Technology Development.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Tactical Radios provide the critical Command, Control, Communications (C3) link between SOF Commanders and SOF Teams involved in overseas contingency operations (OCO) and training exercises.  They also provide interoperability with all Services, various agencies of the U.S. Government, Air Traffic Control, commercial agencies, and allied foreign forces.  Tactical Radios, which includes SOF Tactical Communications, and Blue Force Tracking, rapidly and seamlessly establish and maintain mobile and fixed Command and Control (C2) communications between infiltrated/operational elements and higher echelon headquarters, allowing SOF to operate with any force combination in multiple environments.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides specialized equipment to meet the unique soldier protection and survival requirements of Special Operations Forces (SOF) to include: Army Rangers; Army Special Forces; Navy Sea, Air, Land (SEAL) teams; Navy Special Boat Units; Air Force Operators; and Marine Forces Special Operations Command.  Specialized equipment improves survivability protection from the environment by providing the operator with hearing protection and clothing systems as well load bearing equipment to improve the mobility of SOF while conducting varied missions and personnel safety equipment such as harnesses and safety retention devices.  These missions are generally conducted in harsh environments, for unspecified periods and in locations requiring small unit autonomy. 

SOF Personal Equipment Advanced Requirements (SPEAR) provides for the research, development, testing and evaluation of a variety of individual and survival equipment to include: ballistic and environmental protective systems, combat uniforms, load carriage systems, communications headsets, and visual augmentation system mounts.  

Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC) provides medical devices, ancillary equipment and Casualty Evacuation (CASEVAC) sets for SOF. The CASEVAC procures a suite of Food and Drug Administration approved medical items including, but not limited, to intraosseous infusion devices, patient monitoring and assessment devices, emergency airway kits, as well as devices that provide SOF the capability to support extraction, extrication, mobility, transportation, and sustainment of casualties in forward areas.  This program fields tactical medical and CASEVAC capabilities with the intention to transition capabilities developed under the National Mission Force Tactical Medical Programs.  This capability provides significant ability to lessen battlefield losses by providing timely, critical lifesaving and evacuation capabilities to the forward-deployed SOF operators. 

Counter Radio Controlled-Improvised Explosive Device (RC-IED) program provides SOF with the ability to counter current and future radio controlled improvised explosive devices threats used by terrorist networks.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides specialized equipment to meet the unique soldier protection and survival requirements of SOF, to include: Army Rangers; Army Special Forces; Navy Sea, Air, Land (SEAL) teams; Navy Special Boat Units; Air Force Operators; and Marine Forces Special Operations Command. Specialized ballistic equipment improves survivability and load bearing equipment impacting the mobility of SOF while conducting varied missions. These missions are generally conducted in harsh environments, for unspecified periods and in locations requiring small unit autonomy. 

This project enhances the SOF Personal Equipment Advanced Requirement (SPEAR) program by supporting body armor plates, soft armor, helmets, and eye protection.  It also provides for the research, development, and testing of a variety of body armor and personal protective equipment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Sensor technology being developed includes image intensification (I2) thermal imaging, short wave infrared (SWIR), multi-spectral, fusion, and other sensor types.  Developments will decrease weight, increase range, increase situational awareness, provide data, image processing, image filtering, determine wind speed, observe bullet trace, and sensor fusion to be able to detect, identify, classify and engage targets at greater ranges.  These projects ensure SOF systems shall remain technologically superior to enemy threats to ensure mission success.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides for the development and acquisition of Military Information Support Operations (MISO) equipment. MISO are planned operations to convey selected information and indicators to foreign audiences to influence their emotions, motives, objective reasoning, and ultimately, the behavior of foreign governments, organizations, groups, and individuals. This project funds transformational systems and equipment to conduct MISO in support of combatant commanders. 

• Prior to FY 2015, the MISO Broadcast Systems (MISOB) consisted of the Media Production Center (MPC) Family of Systems (FoS); Product Distribution System (PDS); Fly Away Broadcast System (FABS); and the Long Range Broadcast System (LRBS). Starting in FY 2015 the MISO Broadcast System will be split into these individual programs of records.  These systems provide fixed or deployable technologies that fulfill the requirements of the MISO seven phase processes in support to theater commanders. This project is comprised of several interfacing systems that can stand alone or inter-operate with other MISO systems as determined by mission requirements and includes:

• Media Production and Broadcast Systems support the MPC and FABS MISO missions.  The MPC includes the fixed site MPC with light and medium media production capability.  FABS is a transit case fly-away broadcast system that consists of a combination of amplitude modulation (AM), frequency modulation (FM), shortwave (SW), and television (TV) transmitters, and radio/TV production systems. 

• LRBS is a family of broadcast systems intended to be integrated to multiple unmanned, long-loiter aerial systems with the capability of broadcasting in AM, FM, SW,TV, Very High Frequency (VHF), TV Ultra High Frequency (UHF) and cellular (Short Message Service, Multi-Media Messaging Service, and Voice).  This system provides the capability of broadcasting MISO messages via multiple mediums into denied foreign areas.

• PDS provides the satellite communications (SATCOM) transport path for the worldwide Military Information Support Operations (MISO) architecture. PDS consists of three variants that are used at different levels of command from the Media Operations Complex (MOC) to the Tactical MISO Teams in order to link MISO planners with review/approval authorities, production facilities, and dissemination elements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides for development and testing of specialized, individual, assault, crew-served weapons, and fire control/surveillance devices to meet the unique requirements of Special Operations Forces (SOF).  SOF often deploys as small, independent, quick reaction, foot-mobile teams independent of primary logistics support. Existing weapons and combat equipment are frequently unsuited to these conditions.  This project enhances all SOF weapons, both individual and crew served, by leveraging the latest technological advances in optional accessories (up to 30 different functions/capabilities) such as day scopes, clip-on night scopes, active aiming laser module, visible lights, grenade launchers, suppressors, hand grips, and close quarters battle sights. Miniature Day-Night Sight for Crew-served Weapons enhances all SOF weapons, by leveraging existing image intensification and thermal technology to improve combat effectiveness for all crew served weapon systems.  Development efforts include test and evaluation of the Advanced Target Pointer Illuminator Aiming Laser hardening to withstand the live-fire shock profiles for the Combat Assault Rifle along with other improvements, Visual Augmentation Systems, and Family of Muzzle Breaks and Suppressors.  Leveraging extensive modeling and simulation efforts executed by National Labs, competitively award RDT&amp;E contracts to select vendors to develop suppressors and flashhiders for select SOF weapon systems. These accessories greatly improve the combat effectiveness of the weapon systems and the survivability of the SOF operator.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project develops, tests, and evaluates Special Operations vehicles and modifications.  The Special Operations Forces (SOF) mission mandates that SOF vehicles remain technologically superior, operate in multiple environments and be able to meet any threat to provide a maximum degree of survivability.  The current family of SOF tactical vehicles include: individual mobility vehicles, light mobility vehicles, medium mobility vehicles, non-standard commercial vehicles, and heavy mobility vehicles.     

Family of Special Operations Vehicles (FSOV).  This initiative provides for product improvements in the areas of suspension, power management, armor protection and unique vehicle design for all SOF tactical vehicle configurations.  Designs must be standardized across all SOF Components that utilize a tactical vehicle.   Improvements include, but are not limited to, new engineering change proposals (ECPs), field safety issues and theater endorsed requirements that make it essential to keep up with the increased weight and minimize the impact to mobility on the basic vehicle.  FSOV develops, integrates and tests Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems in order to reduce space and power claim on vehicles and develop safety and engineering improvements that specifically address the enemy’s changing tactics on the battlefield which typically focuses on survivability, force protection, or mobility.  Specific efforts include but are not limited to: Ground Mobility Vehicles (Medium) effort which provides for a medium vehicle variant capable of meeting specific requirements of internal aircraft transport on the C/MH47 and CV-22.  The effort also provides for engineering costs related to performance, endurance, safety testing, integration and logistical analysis of product samples. Additionally, efforts include ECPs associated with the Non-Standard Commercial Vehicle (NSCV), the Lightweight Tactical All Terrain Vehicle (LTATV). These ECPs will address any identified safety, reliability, and performance concerns.  Finally, funding will be used to support vehicle signature reduction efforts.  The Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) Vehicle Kit.  Effort provides design, prototyping, testing and installation manual development of SOF peculiar integration kits for multiple models of Service-common MRAPs employed by SOF.  Kits will enable SOF unique C4ISR installation and Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station integration to service-common MRAPs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides for engineering and manufacturing development and operational systems development of small combat underwater submersibles and underwater support systems and equipment.  This project also provides for pre-acquisition activities (materiel solutions analysis, advanced component development and prototypes) to respond to emergent requirements.  These submersibles, systems, and equipment are used by Special Operations Forces (SOF) in the conduct of infiltration/extraction, hydrographic/inland reconnaissance, beach obstacle clearance, underwater ship attack, and other missions.  The capabilities of the submersible systems and unique equipment provides small, highly trained forces the ability to successfully engage the enemy and conduct clandestine operations associated with SOF maritime missions.  Sub-projects include:   

•   Shallow Water Combat Submersible (SWCS) (previously Block 1):  This project provides for the engineering, manufacturing, testing, and development of one Engineering Development Model (EDM) to replace the SEAL Delivery System (SDV).  The EDM is being developed due to obsolescence of the SDV system.  This project will utilize mature technologies, which include electric propulsion along with upgraded navigation, communication, and sensor suites.  It also provides for integration efforts with the current Dry Deck Shelter and other diving technologies to meet SOF requirements.  

•   Dry Combat Submersible (DCS):  This project provides for the advanced engineering, manufacturing, testing, and development efforts for a SOF DCS System.  Current efforts are using commercial dry submersible prototypes to assess submersible capabilities and reduce risk in the DCS program.  The DCS is planned to operate from surface ships.  Two commercially built dry submersible prototypes are being manufactured and tested, as well as evaluation of a third leased vehicle.  Significant risk reduction initiatives were added in FY 2013 which allowed for validation of test processes, commercial classification processes, and the development of the SOCOM safety certification process which permits SEALs to operate the submersibles.  In addition, the prototypes will be used to evaluate the capability enhancing technologies in a relevant environment.  Technologies include, but are not limited to Safe Li-Ion batteries, silver zinc batteries, improved sonar systems, advanced battery management system, and a three-dimensional Electro Optical Infrared (EO/IR) Periscope. 

•   Dry Deck Shelter (DDS) Modernization:  This is an FY 2016 new start.  This project provides for the pre-planned product improvements, testing, and integration of specialized underwater systems to meet the unique requirements of SOF, and compatibility with the submarine fleet.  The current DDS is a certified diving system which attaches to modified host submarines that provides for insertion of SOF forces and platforms.  Funding supports product improvements to the current DDS, as well as associated diver equipment for in-service submarine support systems, unmanned underwater vehicles, and follow on development efforts for future SOF payloads.

•   SOF Combat Diving:  This is an FY 2016 new start.  This project provides for the advanced engineering, manufacturing, testing, development and transition of SOF peculiar diving technologies for the SOF combat diver.  Technologies include, but are not limited to commercial and developmental Underwater Breathing Apparatus (UBAs), diver thermal regulation systems, diver communication, tracking and monitoring systems, diver propulsion devices, diver auxiliary equipment and advance concept breathing mixture and procedure development.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The full spectrum of contracting activities is being utilized for any integration and subsystem requirements, using existing contracts where appropriate, government agencies and new contracts as necessary.

•   DCS used Broad Agency Announcements for Research and Development contracts leveraging commercial technologies, practices and safety classification standards to design, build, test and deliver prototypes to refine and validate potential key performance parameters and attributes for the DCS requirements baseline.  The commercial classification of the prototypes will validate the technical maturity to support a milestone B decision.  A competitive contract is planned in FY 2016 for an EMD contract for a production representative vessel.  The full spectrum of contracting activities is being utilized for risk reduction efforts, using existing contracts where appropriate, government agencies and new contracts as necessary.

•   DDS Modernization will use existing Dry Deck Shelter contracts to develop modernization efforts and execute configuration changes required to achieve performance requirements specified by the government.

•   SOF Combat Diving:  The full spectrum of contracting activities is planned to be utilized, using existing contracts where appropriate, government agencies, and leverage from the services.

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides for engineering and manufacturing development, and operational systems development of light, medium, and heavy surface combatant craft and selected items of specialized equipment to meet the unique requirements of Special Operations Forces (SOF).  This project also provides for pre-acquisition activities (materiel solutions analysis, advanced component development and prototypes) to quickly respond to new requirements for surface craft and equipment.  The craft capabilities and unique equipment provide small, highly trained forces the ability to successfully engage the enemy and conduct clandestine operations associated with SOF maritime missions.  Sub-projects include: 

The Combatant Craft Medium (CCM) provides SOF with a versatile, multi-mission surface maritime platform supporting the clandestine tactical movement of four crew and 19 combat equipped SOF in low to medium threat environments.  It will incorporate additional performance capabilities above current platform capabilities such as shock mitigation, improved maneuverability and survivability characteristics.  

The Combatant Craft Heavy (CCH) sub-project represents a family of solutions that will provide engineering support for design and specification of a development combatant craft for movement and maneuver of SOF personnel.  Requirements include maneuverability, reduced detectability with enhanced shock mitigation, and human systems integration.  The current solution for Combatant Craft Heavy is the Sea, Air, and Land Insertion, Observation and Neutralization (SEALION) that was developed as an advanced technology demonstrator by the United States Navy and has been modified and tested for transition to SOF operations.  The CCH will provide medium range insertion capability for SOF personnel in a low to high threat environment.  

The Next Generation Combatant Craft Forward Looking Infrared Radar (CCFLIR) Program provides SOF with day/night, high resolution, and additional spectrum imaging capabilities to augment existing optical and radar sensors.  Technology insertion is needed to reduce the signature properties of the system and to enhance the detection, recognition, identification, and tracking of small and near surface targets and ships.

The Next Generation Surface Systems (NGSRF) sub-project provides a rapid response capability to support SOF Combatant Craft Systems and subsystems.  The NGSRF will explore solutions to support emerging requirements in support of SOF missions.  It provides technology refresh efforts to correct system deficiencies, improve asset life, and enhance mission capability through the means of feasibility studies, analyses of alternatives, pre-developmental risk reduction, and engineering analyses.  Demonstrations and modifications may be made to support emerging capability enhancements such as but not limited to conformal antennas, Identification Friend-or-Foe capabilities, enhanced communications and navigation subsystems, and other minor modifications to craft in support of future missions.  Solutions may be Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) solutions, leveraged from other agency solutions, or new solutions.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>•  CCM acquisition strategy is a competition using a two-phase source selection process.  Phase I involved a Small Business Set-Aside competition for two vendors to design, build and deliver test articles.  Phase II selected a single vendor to provide a fully integrated baseline craft system for test and evaluation with options for production, engineering support and contractor logistic support.  

•  CCH acquisition strategy was to transition the two advanced technology craft from Navy to SOF operations.  Feasibility studies will continue in-house with support from other government agencies or existing contract services to pursue SOF-peculiar requirements for CCH.  Sole source contract was awarded with original equipment manufacturer for developmental modification to SEALION.  Developing long term strategy to procure additional craft in future years. 

•  Next Generation CCFLIR acquisition strategy will conduct full and open competition for next generation systems to support the Combatant Craft Assault, CCM and CCH systems. 

•  NGSRF will evaluate COTS solutions to provide technologies for insertion across craft systems, subsystems, and future craft acquisition planning.  This effort will consider all acquisition strategies available while applying Better Buying Power practices.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Director of Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&amp;E) was created by Congress in 1983.  The Director is responsible under Title 10 for policy and procedures for all aspects of Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&amp;E) within the Department of Defense (DoD).  Particular focus is given to OT&amp;E that supports major weapon system production decisions for acquisition programs included on the Office of Secretary of Defense Test and Evaluation Oversight List that is prepared and approved annually.  Generally, there are about 300 programs on the oversight list including all Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAP) and Major Automated Information Systems (MAIS).  MDAPs may not proceed beyond low-rate initial production (BLRIP) until OT&amp;E of the program is complete.  DOT&amp;E is involved early in the planning phase of each program to ensure adequate testing is planned and executed.  Key elements of DOT&amp;E's oversight authority include: 

-     The approval of component Test and Evaluation Master Plans (TEMPS).
-     The approval of component OT&amp;E Test Plans (TPs).
-     Oversight of Military Department preparation and conduct of field operational tests; analysis and evaluation of the resultant test data; the assessment of the adequacy of the executed test and evaluation programs; and assessment of the operational effectiveness and suitability of the weapon systems.
-     Reporting results of OT&amp;E that supports BLRIP decisions to the Secretary of Defense and Congress, as well as providing an annual report summarizing all OT&amp;E activities and the adequacy of test resources within DoD during the previous fiscal year.
-     The review and make recommendations to the Secretary of Defense on all budgetary and financial matters related to OT&amp;E, including operational test facilities, resources and ranges.

DOT&amp;E also oversees and resources OT&amp;E community efforts to plan and execute joint operational evaluations of information assurance and interoperability
 (IA and IOP) of fielded systems and networks during major Combatant Command (CCMD) and Service exercises, and reports the trends and findings in the annual report.

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Director of Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&amp;E) was created by Congress in 1983.  The Director is responsible under Title 10 for policy and procedures for all aspects of Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&amp;E) within the Department of Defense (DoD).  Particular focus is given to OT&amp;E that supports major weapon system production decisions for acquisition programs included on the Office of Secretary of Defense Test and Evaluation Oversight List that is prepared and approved annually.  Generally, there are about 300 programs on the oversight list including all Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAP) and Major Automated Information Systems (MAIS).  MDAPs may not proceed beyond low-rate initial production (BLRIP) until OT&amp;E of the program is complete.  DOT&amp;E is involved early in the planning phase of each program to ensure adequate testing is planned and executed.  Key elements of DOT&amp;E's oversight authority include: 

-     The approval of component Test and Evaluation Master Plans (TEMPS).
-     The approval of component OT&amp;E Test Plans (TPs).
-     Oversight of Military Department preparation and conduct of field operational tests; analysis and evaluation of the resultant test data; the assessment of the adequacy of the executed test and evaluation programs; and assessment of the operational effectiveness and suitability of the weapon systems.
-     Reporting results of OT&amp;E that supports BLRIP decisions to the Secretary of Defense and Congress, as well as providing an annual report summarizing all OT&amp;E activities and the adequacy of test resources within DoD during the previous fiscal year.
-     The review and make recommendations to the Secretary of Defense on all budgetary and financial matters related to OT&amp;E, including operational test facilities, resources and ranges.

DOT&amp;E also oversees and resources OT&amp;E community efforts to plan and execute joint operational evaluations of information assurance and interoperability
( IA and IOP) of fielded systems and networks during major Combatant Command (CCMD) and Service exercises, and reports the trends and findings in the annual report. 

DOT&amp;E is also involved in increasing the capacity to access realistically advanced cyber warfighting capabilities to keep pace with heightened demand for those capabilities, advancing technologies and the growing cyber threat.

This effort is in direct support of the Director’s Title 10 responsibilities and is a continuing effort.  Funding for FY 2014 provided Operational Test and Evaluation inputs for Test and Evaluation Master Plans, Test Plans, System Acquisition Reports, Defense Acquisition Executive Summary Reports for those programs designated for oversight by DOT&amp;E and OUSD(AT&amp;L).  Key elements of DOT&amp;E oversight authority are identified in Calendar Year 2014 Office of the Secretary of Defense Test and Evaluation Oversight List.  

Information Assurance (IA) and Interoperability (IOP) Evaluations/Cybersecurity and Interoperability Evaluations

DOT&amp;E oversaw and resourced 9 Combatant Command (CCMD) level and 3 Service level assessments in FY 2014.  In addition to the 12 exercise assessments, 3 assessments were performed during visits to operational sites not involved in an exercise.  DOT&amp;E also began a new assessment activity with U.S. Pacific Command whereby more frequent and more focused assessment events will occur as part of a Theater Cyber Readiness Campaign (TCRC).  The cyber Red Teams which supported the FY 2014 assessments used validated cyber Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP’s) and incorporated more advanced cyber threats.  Fiscal year 2014 evaluations included trend analyses across prior year results, both within and across CCMDs.  Critical findings were transmitted to Service and DoD leadership for their awareness and remediation actions.</r2:Text>

This effort is in direct support of the Director’s Title 10 responsibilities and is a continuing effort.  Funding for FY 2015 provides Operational Test and Evaluation inputs for Test and Evaluation Master Plans, Test Plans, System Acquisition Reports, Defense Acquisition Executive Summary Reports for those programs designated for oversight by DOT&amp;E and OUSD(AT&amp;L).  Key elements of DOT&amp;E oversight authority are identified in Calendar Year 2015 Office of the Secretary of Defense Test and Evaluation Oversight List.  

Information Assurance (IA) and Interoperability (IOP) Evaluations/Cybersecurity and Interoperability Evaluations 

DOT&amp;E will oversee and resource approximately 10 CCMD level and 4 Service level assessments in FY 2015.  Three CCMDs will each conduct a TCRC consisting of bi-monthly assessments focused on improved cybersecurity technologies and/or TTPs to address problems identified in prior assessments; the campaigns will each culminate in a major exercise that examines a critical mission aided by the improved technologies and TTPs.  Additionally, assessment teams will observe 3 new CCMD/Service exercises as potential venues for future assessment.  The portrayal of advanced cyber threats and assessment of mission accomplishment in representative threat environments are primary planning objectives for assessments in FY 2015.  The recently approved Persistent Cyber OPFOR will support these more operationally realistic and threat-representative assessments.  Fiscal year 2015 evaluations will include trend analyses across prior year results, both within and across CCMDs.  Critical findings will be transmitted to Service and DoD leadership for their awareness and remediation actions.  The DoD Enterprise Cyber Range Environment (DECRE) will support events across multiple CCMDs for added threat realism during exercise assessments.</r2:Text>

DOT&amp;E will continue to work with the CCMDs to increase the portrayal of advanced cyber threats which are more representative of nation state threats.  The goal is to have the majority of assessments in FY2016 include such advanced threats.  Fiscal year 2016 evaluations will include trend analyses across prior year results, both within and across CCMDs.  Critical findings will be transmitted to Service and DoD leadership for their awareness and remediation actions.  The DoD Enterprise Cyber Range Environment (DECRE) and other cyber range assets with Red Teams portraying advanced cyber adversaries will support most CCMD exercises for added threat realism.</r2:Text>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element consists of three programs:  Live Fire Test and Evaluation, Joint Aircraft Survivability Program (JASP), and Joint Technical Coordinating Group for Munitions Effectiveness (JTCG/ME).  

This Program Element directly supports the Congressional statutory requirements for oversight of Live Fire Test and Evaluation (LFT&amp;E).  The primary objective of LFT&amp;E is to assure that the vulnerability and survivability of Department of Defense (DoD) crew-carrying platforms and the lethality of our conventional munitions are known and acceptable before entering full-rate production.  LFT&amp;E encompasses realistic tests involving actual United States (U.S.) and foreign threat hardware or, if not available, acceptable surrogate threat hardware.  The objective is to identify and correct design deficiencies early in the development process.  A completed LFT&amp;E program and test report is required before programs proceed beyond low-rate initial production (BLRIP).  LFT&amp;E also includes realistic modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) to examine survivability and lethality attributes not assessed during testing.

This Program Element also supports DoD’s Joint Live Fire (JLF) Program and other LFT&amp;E related initiatives.  JLF was begun in 1984 under an Office of the Secretary of Defense charter to test fielded front-line combat aircraft and armor systems for their vulnerabilities as well as fielded weapons, both U.S. and foreign, for their lethality against their respective targets.  Funds are also used to support other initiatives related to quick reaction requests from theater and other areas of personnel survivability.

The Joint Aircraft Survivability Program is the DoD’s focal point for joint service enhancement of military aircraft non-nuclear survivability.  The JASP is chartered by the commanders of the USN Naval Air Systems Command, USA Aviation and Missile Command and USAF Life Cycle Management Center to coordinate and conduct RDT&amp;E to improve military aircraft survivability, develop and standardize aircraft survivability modeling and simulation (M&amp;S), facilitate information exchange on aircraft survivability and support aircraft survivability education for the DoD and U.S. aircraft community.  Each chartering command provides a senior aircraft survivability expert for the JASP Principal Members Steering Group (PMSG), which guides the program and approves projects for funding.  The JASP assesses and reports on combat damage incidents through the Joint Combat Assessment Team (JCAT), is the Executive Agent for the Joint Live Fire Aircraft Systems Program managed by the Live Fire Test office of DOT&amp;E.

The Joint Logistics Commanders Joint Technical Coordinating Group for Munitions Effectiveness (JTCG/ME) was chartered more than 40 years ago to serve as DoD’s focal point for munitions effectiveness information.  This has taken the form of widely used Joint Munitions Effectiveness Manuals (JMEMs) which address all major non-nuclear U.S. weapons.  JTCG/ME authenticates weapons effectiveness data for use in training, systems acquisition, weapon procurement, and combat modeling and simulation.  JMEMs are used by the Armed Forces of the U.S., NATO, and other allies to plan operational missions, support training and tactics development, and support force-level analyses.  JTCG/ME also develops and standardizes methodologies for evaluation of munitions effectiveness and maintains databases for target vulnerability, munitions lethality, and weapon system accuracy.  The JMEM requirements and development processes continues to be driven by operational lessons learned (Enduring Freedom, Iraqi Freedom, Odyssey Dawn and Inherent Resolve) and the needs of Combatant Commands, Services, Military Targeting Committee, and Operational Users Working Groups input for specific weapon-target pairings and methodologies. 

This program element also includes funds to obtain Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) expertise in performing analyses in support of described Live Fire Test and Evaluation tasks, as well as travel funds to carry out the LFT&amp;E, JASP and JTCG/ME programs.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The FY 2014 budget provided Live Fire Test and Evaluation input for Test and Evaluation Master Plans, Test Plans, System Acquisition Reports, Defense Acquisition Executive Summary reports, and Beyond Low Rate Initial Production (BLRIP) reports for those programs designated for oversight by DOT&amp;E and OUSD(AT&amp;L).  The oversight list is maintained continuously and published annually.

JLF Programs and LFT&amp;E Initiatives  

Conducted tests of fielded systems not previously tested under Air, Land, or Sea Joint Live Fire programs to support DOT&amp;E and operator needs.  The need for these tests results from systems being exposed to new threats, used in new unanticipated tactics, or being operated in new combat environments, and the subsequent need for an assessment of their performance.  Continued efforts in support of Personnel Protection Equipment, including testing protocols for combat helmets and body armor.  Addressed urgent requests from theater that directly supported deployed Joint Combat Assessment Team investigation and report to operators. 

Performed JLF projects to provide survivability data on currently fielded U.S. systems.  JLF Air projects tested the vulnerability of PT6 turboprop engines, evaluated the effects of internal configuration on helicopter crew compartment fires, as well as investigated technologies/techniques to reduce generic vulnerabilities to all aircraft, such as to MANPADS, small arms, the effect of yawed projectiles and missile debris on aircraft vulnerability, the lethality of advanced projectiles, and performed a comparison of commonly used test threats.  New projects investigated cabin mounted auxiliary fuel tank vulnerability, vulnerability to high energy lasers, ballistically induced hydrodynamic ram effects, and characterized fragmentation grenades.  JLF Land projects continued to investigate the vulnerability of vehicles to underbody blast and the lethality of U.S. weapons against typical in-theater targets, improved validation data for modeling and simulation tools, the use and validity of manikins, helmets, and improvements to material characteristics used in modeling and simulation.  New projects studied aging effects on fielded armor, irregular fragment penetration, behind helmet blunt trauma skull injuries, and improved ballistic clay formulations.  JLF Sea projects continued to investigate ship vulnerabilities in the areas of commercial standards, equipment and component damage, vulnerabilities of designs and components for new ships, fire damage to ship components, including bulkheads, insulation, and reconfigurable spaces, investigated asymmetric boat threats, and began work on developing small boat vulnerability models.  New projects investigated deep depth underwater explosions, airgun configurations for full ship shock trial alternatives, and explored configurations for augmenting ballistic manikins.

Joint Aircraft Survivability Program (JASP)

In FY 2014 the JASP continued work on 31 multi-year RDT&amp;E projects and initiated 20 new projects approved by the JASP Principal Members Steering Group and OSD/DOT&amp;E.  In the area of susceptibility reduction, the JASP addressed improving the effectiveness and reducing the space, weight and power required for directed energy infrared countermeasures, electronic countermeasures technology and techniques, integrated aircraft survivability equipment, and aircrew situational awareness.  In the area of vulnerability reduction, the JASP continued to address requirements for lighter and more effective vulnerability reduction technology (e.g., armor, fuel containment, fire suppression, and aircrew and passenger protection).  In aircraft survivability Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S), the JASP continued to improve survivability M&amp;S credibility, address operator requirements for survivability data, integrate DIA threat missile models into threat engagement codes, improve the assessment of aircrew and passenger injuries, and address M&amp;S requirements identified by the joint aircraft survivability community.  The JASP completed 42 reports documenting efforts accomplished in FY 2014.

The JCAT continued to support the Air Force, Army, Marine Corps and Navy by assessing combat damage incidents, training operators on threat effects and combat damage assessment, and reporting their findings to combatant commanders and the DoD science and technology and acquisition communities.  The JASP continued supporting aircraft survivability education and information exchange through internet sites (restricted access and classified), by publishing the Aircraft Survivability Journal, developing educational materials and conducting training for the DoD and their contractors.

Joint Technical Coordinating Group for Munitions Effectiveness

JTCG/ME Joint Munitions Effectiveness Manual Weaponeering System (JWS) v2.1.1 software and JTCG/ME generated Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 3160.01 Collateral Effects Radii (CER) tables were used for operational weaponeering and collateral damage estimation calls in direct support of operations in the AFRICOM and CENTCOM Areas of Responsibilities.  To provide continued support to operational commanders, DoD targeteers, weaponeers, and planners, the JTCG/ME developed various analytical and operational methodologies and target geometric models.  Additionally JTCG/ME’s air-to-air and surface-to-air planning model, the Joint-Anti-air Combat Effectiveness System (J-ACE) v5.2.1 was released in April 2014 to provide aircraft survivability data.

The fielded JWS v2.1.1 contains the Fast Integrated Structural Tool (FIST).  FIST is the JMEM operational-level methodology that incorporates the integral modules from the Building Analysis Module (BAM) and Hardened Target Module (HTM) to create a merged tool that generates weapon effectiveness and damage assessments against infrastructure targets to include buildings, bunkers, and tunnels. JWS v2.1.1 also contains approximately 180 new/updated targets, 15 new/updated munitions, new Explosive Equivalent Weights based on blast testing, and an improved 3-D viewer.  In addition, JWS v2.2 development is ongoing to support coalition partners.  The JTCG/ME in conjunction with the JWS Configuration Control Board and the JMEM Production Contractor (JPC) are implementing a re-marking effort in order to facilitate the documentary release of JWS. 

J-ACE v5.2.1 simulates air-to-air and surface-to-air engagements. Blue, Red, and Gray air-to-air missile (AAM) models; and, Red and Gray surface-to-air missile (SAM) flyout models are included. J-ACE v5.2.1 provides updated Joint Anti-Air Model (JAAM) missile fly out model including hundreds of weapon target pairings and JAAM-Enhanced Surface-to-Air Missile Simulation (ESAMS) countermeasures interface. J-ACE v5.2.1 also provides the new “Endgame Manager (EM)" software and data sets. The EM is a new application which adds missile lethality and target vulnerability.  EM allows explicit evaluation of weapon miss distance, fuse performance, weapon lethality and target vulnerability.  EM provides the Probability of kill given an intercept (Pk/i).  Additionally, Joint Anti-Air Model (JAAM) was integrated into the Individual Combat Aircrew Display System (ICADS) and the Personal Computer Debriefing System (PCDS) for direct use for tactics, planning, and training at operational test squadrons for fighters and bombers. 

To more effectively support operational mission planning, particularly at USSTRATCOM, the J-ACE v5.2.1 release also provides a direct interface to force level simulations.  The fidelity is adequate for studying tactics, training evaluation, relative missile performance and scenario planning.

In support of the Combatant Commands and the CJCSI 3160.01, JTCG/ME provided updates for CER values for newly fielded/ updated systems (e.g., SDB II, Griffin, Hellfire, GBU-49/BLU-133, etc.).  In addition, the JTCG/ME released Digital Precision Strike Suite (DPSS) Collateral Damage Estimation (DCiDE) v1.1.1 with “Route CDE Capability” for operational use.  This new capability has been used in support of multiple kinetic strikes since being loaded at the Task Force in Afghanistan.  This tool displays accredited Collateral Damage Estimate Level 1-5 A-C series effective radii reference tables.  Additionally, JTCG/ME trained nearly 300 users at 12 different Commands to support Collateral Damage Estimation decisions.

In support of JMEM methodology improvement, the JTCG/ME accredited two analytical models according to JTCG/ME approved guidelines (i.e., Process Guide-2).  These models are Joint Blast Analysis Model (JBAM) v1.2.2 and Integrated Munitions Effects Assessment (IMEA) v11.0.
 
To address emerging Cyber Operations Joint Munitions Effectiveness Manual (JMEM), JTCG/ME re-deployed Joint Capability Analysis and Assessment System (JCAAS) tools: Computer Network Attack Risk and Effectiveness Analyzer (CREA); Network Risk Assessment Tool (NRAT); Communications &amp; Radar Electronic Attack &amp; Planning Effectiveness Reference (CREAPER); Effectiveness of Psychological Influence Calculator (EPIC); and Joint Broadcast Analysis Tool (JBAT).  Joint Capabilities Analysis and Assessment System in development to provide a shared interface for operational users in selecting the capabilities to best meet given objectives based on capability effectiveness derived from target vulnerability and capability characteristics.  The JCAAS Cyber scope included weapon characterization; coordinating test and target data development; testing and evaluation Cyber data standards; and developing new database schema for Electronic Warfare mission planning.</r2:Text>

The oversight list is maintained continuosly and published annually.

JLF Programs and LFT&amp;E Initiatives

Conduct tests of fielded systems not previously tested under Air, Land, or Sea Joint Live Fire programs to support DOT&amp;E and operator needs.  The need for these tests results from systems being exposed to new threats, used in new unanticipated tactics, or being operated in new combat environments, and the subsequent need for an assessment of their performance.  Continue efforts in support of Personnel Protection Equipment, including combat helmets and body armor.  Continue to address urgent requests that directly support deployed operators and issues of importance to the Congress as they arise.  Continue to perform JLF projects to provide survivability data on currently fielded U.S. systems. 

JLF Air projects will continue to evaluate generic technologies and techniques to decrease vulnerabilities to all aircraft, such as to MANPADS, small arms, and the performance of self-sealing fuel tanks.  New projects will investigate CV-22 armor, ballistic vulnerability of fuel systems on light aircraft, percentage of oxygen allowed to prohibit fuel tank ullage explosions, and functioning of yawed armor piercing incendiary threats.  JLF Land projects will continue to investigate the vulnerability of vehicles to underbody blast and the lethality of U.S. weapons against typical in-theater targets, as well as improving modeling and simulation tools by providing validation data.  New projects will study fielded weapons effects to support warfighter collateral damage estimates and weapon lethality against MOUT structures.  JLF Sea projects will continue to develop key components of alternatives to traditional shock trials of ships and submarines, will continue to investigate ship vulnerabilities in the areas of commercial standards, equipment and component damage, and will investigate vulnerabilities of designs and components for new ships.

Joint Technical Coordinating Group for Munitions Effectiveness

JTCG/ME will continue to field critical JMEMs to enable on-going COCOM operational Weaponeering and collateral damage estimation calls.  In support of operational commanders, DoD targeteers, weaponeers, and planners, the JTCG/ME will release JMEM Weaponeering System (JWS) v2.2 and v2.3, Digital Precision Strike Suite (DPSS) Collateral Damage Estimation (DCiDE) Tool Version 1.2 and the Joint-Anti-air Combat Effectiveness System (J-ACE) Air Superiority (AS) v5.3 in FY 2015.

JWS v2.2 will include an initial DCiDE connectivity, FIST Updates (i.e., quasi-static blast, building types, etc.) and additional updates.  In total, 220 methodology, functionality, weapons/warheads/fuzes and target updates are included.

JWS v2.3 will include a new Imagery Interface to implement aimpoint development leveraging the Tasked Target Text Data (T3D) data format implemented by currently fielded mission planning systems.  JWS software and T3D imagery interface will be modified to support integration of Electronic Light Table (ELT) viewers.  Also, Modernized Integrated Database (MIDB) and Joint Targeting Toolbox (JTT) interfaces will be developed with additional capabilities to support connectivity.  These developments will enable the integration of Weaponeering, Precision Point Mensuration (PPM) and Collateral Damage Estimation. 

JWS v2.3 will also add the updated Gunship Delivery Accuracy Program (GDAP); Rotary Wing Delivery Accuracy Program (RWDAP); Fast Integrated Structural Tool (FIST) v1.2.  

Based on the current guidance and direction from Joint Staff, this JWS 2.2 and future versions will be released to several key coalition partners in support of current operations at International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), Combined Air Operations Centers and Other Joint Commands.

J-ACE v5.3 will provide extended and updated data sets for missile and aircraft target aero-performance, anti-air missile lethality and air target vulnerability. In particular, a total of 15 new or updated Air-to-Air (AA) or Surface-to-Air (SA) Government furnished missile or weapon fly out models will be integrated.  Additionally, Joint Anti Air Model (JAAM) will be updated to include the effect of weapon system reliability on the probability of a successful engagement.  Also, HIVE/BLUEMAX6 will be developed, integrated, and tested for aircraft aero performance models.  BlueMax6 provides a large library of BLUE and RED aircraft models developed by the acquisition and intelligence communities.  Electronic Counter-Measure (ECM) will be developed and tested for an aircraft’s ECM system jamming coverage.  Initially, dynamic visualization of an aircraft’s ECM systems zones of coverage will allow pilots, while developing threat engagement or evasive maneuvers, to consider ECM protection with respect to the threat position.  JAAM-HIVE-ESAMS software interface will be completed to enable Blue CM evaluations against Red Surface to Air Missiles. 

In support of Joint Capability Analysis and Assessment System (JCAAS), Cyber JMEM tools - Computer Network Attack Risk and Effectiveness Analyzer (CREA) and Network Risk Assessment Tool (NRAT) will be updated and upgraded based on Cyber operational users feedback.  Additionally, range testing of Cyber capabilities and targets will be performed to provide empirical evidence of effectiveness and risk associated with the operational employment of cyber capabilities against representative targets.  Test data will be collected, analyzed, archived, and reviewed – and as conditions warrant, submitted to JTCG/ME for accreditation as authoritative effectiveness and risk data for specified capability-target pairings with documented environmental conditions.  
 
JTCG/ME will develop JMEM data for most critical Combatant Commander identified systems and also reduce DVD-ROM update cycles through incremental updates.  Accreditation of tri-Service JMEM operational tools will continue as well as expanding existing databases to incorporate newly fielded weapons (i.e., Air-to-Surface, Surface-to-Surface Direct/Indirect Fire, and Anti-air).  Finally providing connectivity to real time planning systems assessing time sensitive targets will be addressed.

JTCG/ME will also conduct requirement analysis of the current JWS, J-ACE, and DCiDE software to determine options to enhance long-term software maintainability and flexibility to include structural and architectural changes.</r2:Text>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Operational Test Activities and Analyses (OTA&amp;A) programs are continuing efforts that provide management and oversight of test and evaluation functions and expertise to the Department of Defense (DoD).  The OTA&amp;A programs consist of three activities:  Joint Test and Evaluation (JT&amp;E); Threat Systems (TS); and Center for Countermeasures (CCM).

Joint Test and Evaluation projects are test and evaluation activities conducted in a joint military environment that develop process improvements.  These multi-Service projects, chartered by the Office of the Secretary of Defense and coordinated with the Joint Staff, appropriate combatant commanders, and the Services, provide non-materiel solutions that improve:  joint interoperability of Service systems, technical and operational concepts, joint operational issues, development and validation of joint test methodologies, and test data for validating models, simulations, and test beds.  The JT&amp;E projects address relevant joint war fighting issues in a joint test and evaluation environment by developing and providing new tactics, techniques, and procedures to improve joint capabilities and methodologies.

Threat Systems, based on a memorandum of agreement between the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&amp;E) and the Defense Intelligence Agency, provides DOT&amp;E support in the areas of threat resource analysis, intelligence support and threat systems investments.  Threat Systems provides threat resource analyses on the availability, capabilities and limitations of threat representations (threat simulators, targets, models, U.S. surrogates and foreign materiel) and analysis of test resources used for operational testing to support DOT&amp;E’s assessment of the adequacy of testing for those programs designated for oversight by DOT&amp;E and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics.  Threat Systems provides DOT&amp;E assessment officers and other DOT&amp;E activities with program specific threat intelligence support.  Threat Systems also funds management, oversight, and development of common-use threat specifications for threat simulators, threat representative targets, and digital threat models used for test and evaluation.

The Center, a Joint Service Countermeasure (CM) T&amp;E Activity, directs, coordinates, supports, and conducts independent countermeasure/counter-countermeasure (CCM) T&amp;E activities of U.S. and foreign weapon systems, subsystems, sensors, and related components. The Center accomplishes this work in support of DOT&amp;E, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (DASD) for Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&amp;E), weapon system developers, and the Services.  The Center’s testing and analyses directly supports operational effectiveness and suitability evaluations of CM/CCM systems, such as missile warning and aircraft survivability equipment (ASE), used on rotary-wing and fixed-wing aircraft.  The Center develops unique CM/CCM test equipment to support testing in operationally realistic environments. The Center determines effectiveness of precision guided weapon (PGW) systems and subsystems when operating in an environment degraded by CMs.  Analysis and recommendations on CM/CCM effectiveness are provided to Service Program Offices, DOT&amp;E, DASD (DT&amp;E), and the Services.  The Center also supports Service member exercises, training, and pre-deployment activities with expertise on CM/CCM technology and capabilities.

In FY 2014, JT&amp;E had two projects close and  three projects ongoing from FY 2013.  The Joint Deployable Integrated Air and Missile Defense Joint Test closed in June 2014.  The test developed, tested and evaluated tactics, techniques, and procedures to enable the joint task force commander to employ integrated deployable air, cruise missile, and theater ballistic missile defense capabilities.  The Joint Advanced Capability Employment Joint Test closed in August 2014.  The test developed a testable and repeatable methodology for the joint task force commander to employ advanced capabilities to overcome complex targeting challenges. 

Six new feasibility studies were conducted in FY 2014, four of which were selected to conduct joint tests.

Threat Systems

In FY 2014, Threat Systems initiated actions to significantly reduce its DOT&amp;E funded investment program due to budget restrictions.  These reductions affected DOT&amp;E’s ability to make strategic investments to reduce limitations to test due to inadequate threat portrayal.  All other Threat Systems support continued.

Threat Systems continued test planning working group participation and performed technical analyses to identify threat shortfalls; conducted special studies and provided current intelligence support tailored to specific U.S. weapon systems acquisitions; continued managing intelligence “deep dives” to produce intelligence in sufficient detail to develop new threat test assets; operated and maintained the modeling and simulation configuration control board for threat models and simulation used in test facilities; and, continued the development and implementation of a tri-Service and Allied threat M&amp;S roadmap to ensure infrared countermeasure systems have sufficient threat test assets.  Threat Systems proposed, managed and oversaw threat test assets funded by the Test Resource Management Center that support DOT&amp;E-identified threat shortfalls, identified candidate threat systems from the various intelligence agencies for possible development of models for use in test and evaluation.  Threat Systems also continued efforts to maintain a standard set of threat performance models.

These activities help DOT&amp;E carry out its Title 10 responsibilities to assess test adequacy and determine whether testing is realistic and suitable, and promotes common solutions to Service threat representation needs.

The Center

The Center completed 31 T&amp;E activities and analyzed and reported on more than 30 different systems, with special emphasis on rotary wing survivability, CM/CCM employment, warning and targeting systems, and PGWs.  Most programs supported received an independent assessment of our data/findings and test support for their CM/CCM evaluations.  Approximately 55% of the Center’s efforts were spent on aircraft survivability equipment (ASE) testing; with the majority of these efforts in support of rotary wing aircraft.  About 21% of the Center’s efforts were spent on PGW, foreign systems, and other types of field testing not related to ASE.        Approximately 7% of the Center’s efforts were dedicated to training support, with emphasis on CM–based, pre-deployment training for rotary wing units.  Fifteen percent of the Center’s efforts were spent on internal programs to improve test capabilities and to develop test methodologies for new types of T&amp;E activities.  The Center continued to develop multiple test tools for evaluating ASE infrared countermeasure (IRCM) systems and HFI systems.  In addition, the Center is improving its electronic warfare capability with the development of the high-power Portable Range Threat Simulator that will provide a more comprehensive integrated ASE T&amp;E environment.  Our support was distributed across all the Services, as well as intelligence agencies and research and development activities.  About 2% of the Center’s efforts consisted of providing subject matter expertise and other support not directly related to scheduled test activities. 

The Center provided expertise to many organizations and was actively involved in the following panels:  Joint Expendable Countermeasures (JECM) Integrated Product Team, Joint Infrared Countermeasures Multi Sensing Symposia Working Group (MSS IRCM WG), Joint Aircraft Survivability Program (JASP), Foreign Material Exploitation Working Group, Foreign Material Program T&amp;E Subcommittee, Joint Countermeasures T&amp;E Working Group (JCMT&amp;E WG), and JCMT&amp;E WG Hostile Fire Indicator (HFI) subgroup lead.</r2:Text>

In FY 2015, JT&amp;E has two projects slated to close and an estimated four projects ongoing from FY 2014.  Joint Counter Low, Slow, Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), scheduled to close in April 2015, developed and tested integrated air and missile defense operator procedures in order to increase an operator’s ability to detect, track, and identify low, slow, and small UASs and provide timely notification to the commander of the area air defense.  The Unmanned Aircraft Systems Airspace Integration Joint Test, scheduled to close in July 2015, developed and tested DoD UAS procedures to support effective UAS flight operations in the National Airspace System.

Four new feasibility studies will be conducted in FY 2015, two of which will be selected to conduct joint tests.

Threat Systems

In FY 2015, Threat Systems will continue test planning working group participation and perform technical analyses to identify threat shortfalls; conduct special studies and provide current intelligence support tailored to specific U.S. weapon systems acquisitions.  Threat Systems will:  provide intelligence support to DOT&amp;E staff to address specific questions on threat systems affecting programs on the OSD T&amp;E Oversight list; provide briefings and special intelligence reports when necessary; sustain and manage threat M&amp;S to support test and evaluation by overseeing and coordinating intelligence community developed threat models, performing threat model anomaly resolution resolving differences from live fire testing, integrating threat models into T&amp;E facilities and distributing performance and signature models to T&amp;E users; manage Integrated Technical Evaluation and Analysis of Multiple Sources (ITEAMS) efforts supporting programs on the OSD T&amp;E Oversight List by conducting intelligence “deep dives” to produce intelligence in sufficient detail to develop new threat test assets; initiate new ITEAMS leading to the development of new threat systems for T&amp;E if funding is available; represent DOT&amp;E at foreign material exchanges, inter-agency coordinating groups, and non-proliferation groups to raise awareness of T&amp;E needs for foreign material, coordinate service requirements, and de-conflict and prioritize foreign material requirements for T&amp;E; represent DOT&amp;E at the Intelligence Mission Data Oversight Board responsible for development, production and sharing issues affecting the intelligence data supporting weapons systems acquisition; and Oversee legacy DOT&amp;E investments and continue management and oversight of legacy and new Test Resource Management Center-funded threat system investments.

These activities help DOT&amp;E carry out its Title 10 responsibilities to assess test adequacy and determine whether testing is realistic and suitable, and promotes common solutions to Service threat representation needs.

The Center

The Center is scheduled to test, analyze, and report on more than 30 systems and subsystems, with emphasis on rotary wing survivability, CM/CCM employment, and PGWs.  Each program supported will receive an independent assessment of our data/findings and test support for CM/CCM evaluations.  The Center will continue to emphasize support of DOT&amp;E priorities, with a clear focus on Title 10 weapons systems, aircraft survivability and hostile fire initiatives.  The Center will continue to conduct ongoing investigations towards determining and filling the gaps in EW and multimode system testing.  In addition to these test activities, the Center will continue to provide CM expertise in pre-deployment events and training, as well as CM/CCM-focused tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP) development.  The Center will complete the initial development of the MSALTS and JSIS, which will be used in support of testing for both Title 10 programs and ASE urgent operational needs.  The Center will complete the development of a new Remote Launch System capable of launching larger diameter missiles.  The Center will continue working with the Threat Simulator Working Group (TSWG)-sponsored HSIG model.  Our support will be distributed across all the Services, as well as intelligence agencies and research and development activities.

The Center will provide expertise to many organizations and will continue to be actively involved in the following panels:  JECM Integrated Product Team, Joint Infrared Countermeasures Multi Sensing Symposia Working Group (MSS IRCM WG), JASP, Foreign Material Exploitation Working Group, Foreign Material Program T&amp;E Subcommittee, JCMT&amp;E WG, and JCMT&amp;E WG HFI subgroup lead.</r2:Text>

In FY 2016 JT&amp;E has four projects slated to close and an estimated two projects ongoing from FY 2015.  The Joint Base Architecture for Secure Industrial Control Systems Joint Test, anticipated to close in December 2015, will assess and refine joint industrial control systems network tactics, techniques, and procedures to better identify, mitigate, and recover from advanced, persistent cyber-attacks.  The Joint Tactical Air Picture Joint Test is scheduled to close in December 2015 and will develop tactics, techniques, and procedures to provide an improved tactical air picture that decreases the risk of hostile attacks and fratricide as well as increases the effective use of integrated air and missile defense systems.

Four new feasibility studies will be conducted in FY 2016, two of which will be selected to conduct joint tests.
