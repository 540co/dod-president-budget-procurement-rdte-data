DESCRIPTION:

(E96105) CTG, 9MM MARKING, M1041 (BLUE) is used for force on force training engagements.   The cartridge can be fired with existing M9/M11 pistols and M4 rifles with use of a conversion kit.   The M9 kit consists of a replacement barrel only.   The M11 kit consists of a replacement barrel and recoil spring guide.   The M4 kit consist of a replacement upper receiver for 9mm. A blue enameled portion of the M9, M11,and M4 barrels is visible through the ejection port of the weapons.   The projectile leaves a mark upon impact (similar to paintball), enabling after action evaluation of training scenarios.   It differs from paintball in that it is a full complete cartridge with projectile and cartridge case containing a propulsion system for a low velocity launch.   The M1041 is required to hit targets accurately out to 12 meters.   The cartridge has been safety certified to be fired in close proximity at properly protected human subjects.   This item is Code A, approved for service use.

            <proc:Description>This budget line includes 20MM ALL TYPES:

(E08909) The 20MM Multi-Purpose Tracer - Self-Destruct (MPT-SD) cartridge is an improved, fuzeless, pyrotechnically initiated 20mm High Explosive cartridge.  The projectile consists of a heavy walled steel body charged with an explosive mix and an incendiary mix.  The M940 is currently being employed as a force protection munition in the M61 cannon of the Land Based Phalanx Weapon System (LPWS) for Counter-Rocket, Artillery and Mortar (C-RAM).  It is effective against light armor at 1,000 meters and against airborne and light surface targets at 2,000 meters.  The projectile self destructs at 2,300 meters, minimizing collateral surface damage when engaging airborne targets.  The M940 replaced the M246 High Explosive Incendiary-Tracer, Self Destroying (HEI-T-SD) as the primary air defense cartridge.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2017 Base Budget supports critical Army Title 10 war reserve/operational, training, and test requirements IAW DoD Instruction 3000.04 (Munitions Requirements Process) and AR 5-13 (Total Army Munitions Requirements Process and Prioritization System).  War reserve requirements support OSD-approved Combatant Commander Operational Plans, Homeland Defense, and other OSD-directed missions.  Training requirements support individual and collective training of Active and Reserve Component forces at Army schools, home station, and the combined training centers.  Test requirements support the development, fielding, safety, and quality assurance of Army munitions and equipment throughout their life-cycle.

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities. 


(E08909) The 20MM Multi-Purpose Tracer - Self-Destruct (MPT-SD) cartridge is a training standard item used in both training and combat.  FY 2017 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $7.000 million supports the procurement of .189 million M940 cartridges.  The FY 2017 OCO includes $1.077 million to support the COCOM requirement for unit equipment sets to deter potential adversaries and support the European Reassurance Initiative (ERI).  The ERI procurement includes .031 million MPT-SD M940 w/MK7 Link cartridges.

            <proc:Description>(E89600)60MM Mortar, All Types
This line includes 60mm Mortar Ammunition, All Types.

The 60mm Mortar cartridges are designed for use with the M224A1 Lightweight Company Mortar System (LWCMS) in all light infantry battalions including Airborne, Air Assault and Ranger. The short minimum range of the M224 makes the 60mm mortar ammunition well suited for close protective fires against an assaulting enemy, for block-to-block fighting in cities, and combat over close terrain with restricted visibility.  

(E72199)CTG,60MM MORTAR HE EnFrag M1061 (IM) W/M734A1 MOF
The M1061, 60mm High Explosive Enhanced Fragmentation (EF) cartridge with multi-option fuze (Range 70 meter minimum to 3,400 meter maximum) is used against personnel and a higher category of materiel target sets providing both fragmentation and blast effect.  This round uses the insensitive main charge explosive PBNX-110.  Lethality is maintained by an enhanced fragmentation warhead.  The M1061 EF uses the highly reliable and countermeasure resistant M734A1 multi-option fuze.  When the fuze is set in the proximity mode, it functions at a height over the target that is optimized for lethality.  
The M1061 is Code A, approved for service use.

(E92900)CTG, 60MM MORTAR  HE M768 W/PD FUZE
The 60mm High Explosive Cartridges are Insensitive Munitions (IM) enhanced, HE rounds. The M786 High Explosive cartridge (Range 70 meter minimum to 3,400 meter maximum) is used with the new M783 dual safety, point detonating/delay fuze, tail fin assembly, and high fragmentation steel (HF-1) shell body loaded with approximately 2lbs. of an IM explosive. This round is used primarily in training because it is significantly less expensive than the M720A1, the preferred war fighting round. However, the M768 is lethal and can be used in combat.
This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E92200)CTG,60MM Mortar FRPC M769 SERIES W/PRACTICE FUZE
The M769 is a low-cost, full range, practice round that will replace a percentage of the standard HE rounds used in 60mm mortar training. The M769 FRPC (Range 70 meter minimum to 3,500 meter maximum) has been designed to provide the user with realistic training at a fraction of the cost. It is identical in shape, size and weight to the M720/M720A1 HE cartridges. The flash, bang and smoke signature provided by the M775 fuze is channeled to exhaust holes in the rear of the cartridge through the use of a center vent tube.
This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E98600)CTG,60MM Mortar, WP SMOKE M722 SERIES W/PD FUZE
The M722A1 60mm Smoke cartridge is designed as a spotting/marking round. The steel projectile is bulk loaded with white phosphorous. When the fuze functions, it detonates the M85 burster, which ruptures the projectile and disperses the white phosphorus. The M722A1 WP Smoke ((Range 200 meter minimum to 3,200 meter maximum) replaced the M745 mechanical point-detonating fuze with the reliable, safe, and cost effective electronic M783 Point Detonating (PD) and Delay (DLY) fuze.
This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E85700)CTG,60MM MORTAR,ILLUM IR M767 SERIES W/MTSQ FUZE 
The M767 cartridge is a fin stabilized, mortar cartridge that consists of a M776 Mechanical Time Superquick (MTSQ) fuze, a thin wall steel body tube and aluminum tail cone that contains the payload (parachute and canister), and a fin assembly that contains the ignition cartridge and propelling charges.  The payload is base ejected and upon ignition produces infrared (IR) illumination. The advantage of the infrared over conventional illumination is that there is minimal visible light. This reduces the possibility of exposing forward friendly troop positions while also allowing covert adjustment of fire at greater observation distances through use of passive Night Vision Devices (NVD). The M721/M767 Illumination Cartridges (Range 300 meter minimum to 3,175 meter maximum) are ballistically similar to the M720A1 HE Cartridge, allowing a gun to illuminate and fire on the same target without adjustments. 
This item is Code A, approved for service use.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>This budget line includes 81mm Mortar Ammunition, All Types.
The 81mm Mortar cartridges are designed for use with the M252 Mortar Weapon System used by the Stryker Brigade Combat Teams as well as light infantry battalions including Airborne, Air Assault and Ranger.  

(E18403)CTG, MORTAR, 81MM HE M821 W/MOFM 
The 81mm High Explosive (HE) Cartridges are Insensitive Munitions (IM) enhanced, HE rounds. The 81mm HE Cartridges consist of a fuze, a threaded plastic fuze adapter, a High Fragmentation (HF)-1 steel projectile body loaded with approximately 3lbs. of IMX-104 explosive, a plastic obturating ring, a M24 Fin, the M220 Propelling Charges, and a M299 Ignition Cartridge.  The M821A2 HE (Range 70 meter minimum to 5,859 meter maximum) also incorporates the highly reliable and countermeasure resistant M734A1 multi-option fuze.  When the fuze is set in the proximity mode, it functions at a height over the target that is optimized for lethality.
IM features of this cartridge reduce the vulnerability to unplanned stimuli, e.g. fire/heat, shock and impact, while maintaining or exceeding the same level of effectiveness in combat.
These items are Code A, approved for service use.

(E18404)CTG, MORTAR, 81MM HE M889 SERIES W/PD FUZE 
The 81mm High Explosive Cartridges are Insensitive Munitions (IM) enhanced, HE rounds. The 81mm HE Cartridges consist of a fuze, a threaded plastic fuze adapter, a HF-1 steel projectile body loaded with approximately 3lbs. of IMX-104 explosive, a plastic obturating ring, a M24 Fin, the M220 Propelling Charges, and a M299 Ignition Cartridge. The M889A2 HE (Range 70 meter minimum to 5,859 meter maximum) is used with the new M783 dual safety, point detonating/delay fuze.  This round is used primarily in training because it is significantly less expensive than the M821A2, the preferred war fighting round. However, the M889A2 is lethal and can be used in combat.
IM features of this cartridge reduce the vulnerability to unplanned stimuli, e.g. fire/heat, shock and impact, while maintaining or exceeding the same level of effectiveness in combat.
These items are Code A, approved for service use.

(E69600)CTG, MORTAR, 81MM FRPC M879 SERIES W/PRACTICE FUZE
The M879 is a low-cost, full range, practice round that will replace a percentage of the standard HE rounds used in 81mm mortar training. The M879 FRPC (Range 70 meter minimum to 5,800 meter maximum) has been designed to provide the user with realistic training at a fraction of the cost. It is identical in shape, size and weight to the M889A2/M821A2 HE cartridges. The flash, bang and smoke signature provided by the M751 fuze is channeled to exhaust holes in the rear of the cartridge through the use of a center vent tube.
This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E76100)CTG, MORTAR, 81MM VL ILLUM M853 SERIES W/MTSQ FUZE
The M853A1 cartridge is a fin stabilized, mortar cartridge that consists of a M772 Mechanical Time Super Quick (MTSQ) fuze, a thin wall aluminum body tube and aluminum tail cone that contains the payload (parachute and canister), and a fin assembly that contains the ignition cartridge and propelling charges. The payload is base ejected and upon ignition produces visible light illumination. This visible light illumination allows for monitoring of enemy activities and adjustment of fire at greater observation distances during night operations. It also provides a means for day/night signaling. It is particularly useful in combined operations with allies who may not have night vision devices (NVDs). This round illuminates to the full range of the HE round, which allows adjustment of fire at any distance out to the maximum range. The M853A1 (Range 300 meter minimum and 5,050 maximum) is range-matched to the 81mm High Explosive (HE) and smoke cartridges.  
This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E76200)CTG, MORTAR, 81MM RP SMOKE M819 SERIES W/MTSQ FUZE
The M819 Cartridge is a fin stabilized thin wall steel body tube containing 28 pelletized red phosphorous (RP) wedges; it uses the highly reliable M772 Mechanical Time Super Quick (MTSQ) fuze. After a set time delay, the RP wedges are ejected and dispersed on the target to quickly produce an obscuring smoke screen. A full screen can be developed with 3 rounds as opposed to 15 rounds with the M375 series WP cartridge that is used to create smoke screens to cover movement of troops and/or disrupt visibility of enemy forces.
This cartridge was modified to include Gas Absorbent Modules (GAMS) that absorb the phosphine gas emitted by the RP to keep the round stable.  The M819 (Range 300 meter minimum and 4,900 maximum) is range-matched to the 81mm High Explosive (HE) and Illum cartridges.  
This item is code A, approved for service use.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>This budget line item includes 120MM Mortars, All Types.
The 120mm Mortar Cartridges are designed for use with the M120, 120mm Towed Mortar System and the M121 Carrier Mortar System as well as use with the Brigade Combat Team Mortar System.

(E25502)CTG, MORTAR, 120MM HE M933 SERIES W/PD FUZE
The M933A1 120mm High Explosive (HE) cartridge with the M783 Point Detonating/ Delay (PD/DLY) Fuze is used against personnel, bunker and light materiel targets. It consists of a Steel Shell Body with Composition B fill, and aluminum M31 Fin Assembly. The propulsion system utilizes the M1020 Ignition Cartridge and four horseshoe-shaped, water- resistant M234 Propelling Charges. The M933A1 HE (Range 200 meter minimum to 7,200 meter maximum) is used with the new M783 dual safety, point detonating/delay fuze.  This round is used primarily in training because it is significantly less expensive than the M934A1, the preferred war fighting round. However, the M933A1 is lethal and can be used in combat.
This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E25507)CTG, MORTAR, 120MM FRPC M931 SERIES W/PRACT FUZE
The M931 is a low-cost, full range, practice round that will replace a percentage of the standard HE rounds used in 120mm mortar training. The M931 FRPC (Range 200 meter minimum to 7,200 meter maximum) has been designed to provide the user with realistic training for 120mm Mortar crews at a fraction of the cost. It is identical in shape, size and weight to the M933A1/M934A1 HE cartridges.  The M931 is equipped with M781 PD Practice Fuze. The M781 PD Practice Fuze produces a flash, bang, and smoke signature that provides audio/visual feedback to the mortar crew and forward observer.
This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E91300)CTG, MORTAR, 120MM WP SMOKE M929 SERIES W/MOFM
 The M929 White Phosphorous (WP) Smoke Cartridge is used to provide smoke, with some incendiary effect for various screening missions. The cartridge is filled with 5 lbs of WP. The M929 uses the highly reliable and countermeasure resistant M734A1 multi-option fuze when functions, detonates the burster, which disperses the felt pads which are soaked with WP over the target.  The smoke obscuration is generated by a spontaneous reaction between the WP and oxygen.  The M929 (Range 200 meter minimum and 7,200 maximum) is range-matched to the 120mm High Explosive (HE) and Illum cartridges
This item is Code A, approved for service use.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>This budget line includes CARTRIDGE, TANK, 105MM and 120MM ALL TYPES:

(E22125) M724A1E1 Cartridge will replace the (E22100) M724A1 Cartridge and provide the Army with a range limited (7,000 meters, maximum) round which can be safely fired at all training sites.  The Cartridge, M724A1E1, 105mm Target Practice Discarding Sabot with Tracer (TPDS-T) is used for gunnery training in the Army's 105mm Stryker Brigade Combat Team (SBCT) Mobile Gun System (MGS).  This discarding sabot round is similar in external appearance and is ballistically similar out to 2,000 meters with the M900, Armor Piercing Fin Stabilized Discarding Sabot w/Tracer Cartridge.  It is used as a training surrogate for the M900 Cartridge used by the MGS.  The M724A1E1 Cartridge consists of a deep drawn steel cartridge case, electric primer, propellant and a projectile consisting of a sub-projectile (steel core, windshield, fin and tracer) and aluminum sabot.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E73201) Cartridge, 120mm, Target Practice Multi Purpose-Tracer (TPMP-T) M1002 is a target practice cartridge that simulates the size, weight, ballistics and the loader's function of setting the nose switch of the High Explosive Multi-Purpose cartridge M830A1.  This round is fired from the M256 120mm smoothbore cannon on the M1A1/M1A2 Abrams Tank.  The projectile is inert and composed of an aluminum body, steel nose with dummy plastic switch, aluminum tailcone, aluminum sabot, nylon obturators and tracer.  The tailcone imparts spin to the projectile in flight for stabilization and provides the mechanism to limit the projectile's maximum range.  The M1002 replaces the M831A1 cartridge.  Tank crews will conduct live fire training with the cartridge to achieve and maintain gunnery proficiency. This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E73400) 120mm M865 Target Practice Cone-Stabilized Discarding Sabot with Tracer (TPCSDS-T) is a target practice round that simulates the ballistics of the 120mm M829 Series Armor Piercing Fin-Stabilized Discarding Sabot with Tracer (APFSDS-T) round. This round is fired from the M256 120mm smoothbore cannon on the M1A1/M1A2 Abrams Tank.  The projectile is inert and is composed of a steel core, aluminum fin, aluminum sabots, nylon obturator and tracer.  The fin imparts spin to the projectile in flight for stabilization and provides the mechanism to limit the projectile's maximum range.  Tank crews will conduct live fire training with the cartridge to achieve and maintain gunnery proficiency. This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E78007) The 120mm M830A1 High Explosive Anti-Tank, Multi-Purpose w/Tracer,(HEAT-MP-T) cartridge is designed for use against light armor, buildings and bunkers, as well as providing self-defense capability against attack helicopters. The lethal mechanism includes a shaped-charged warhead and blast effect.  This round is fired from the M256 120MM smooth-bore cannon mounted on the Abrams tank.  Additionally, the M830A1 is effective against the side and rear aspects of tanks and dismounted anti-tank and automatic weapon teams (targets not suitable to kinetic energy penetrator cartridges). The fixed round utilizes a combustible cartridge case affixed to a steel stub base and loaded with granular propellant.  The fin-stabilized, high chrome alloy steel projectile body contains press-loaded high explosive and a precision copper liner. The fuze is armed during launch and initiated by an impact switch or proximity sensor, depending upon the operational mode selected by the ammo loader.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E88106) 120mm M829E4 Armor Piercing Fin Stabilized, Discarding Sabot with Tracer (APFSDS-T) cartridge is the follow on to the M829A3 APFSDS-T cartridge.  The M829E4 is the most effective anti-armor kinetic energy cartridge fired from the M256 120mm smoothbore cannon on the M1A1/M1A2 Abrams Tank.  This cartridge has been designed to defeat advances in armor protection, specifically advancement in explosive reactive armor (ERA).  The cartridge incorporates advancements in propulsion, using a temperature insensitive propellant, novel penetrator design, and an advanced composite sabot.  The projectile system consists of a depleted uranium penetrator mated to a drag reducing windshield and flight stabilizing multi-bladed fin, all secured for launch with a composite sabot.  The M829E4 captures several new technologies along with components previously used on previous APFSDS-T cartridges, but incorporates technology advancements to yield significant improvement in performance over previous fielded cartridges.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>(E15101)Artillery Cartridges, 75MM And 105MM, All Types
This budget line includes Cartridge, Artillery, 75mm &amp; 105mm, All Types.

(E15200)CTG, ARTY, 75MM BLANK, M337A1
The 75mm M337A2 is a non-tactical blank cartridge fired from a M116 Howitzer that is used in burial, retreat ceremonies and VIP Salutes.  It consists of a cartridge case containing loosely packed black powder and a press-fitted percussion primer. A fiberglass wad is inserted over the black powder and a polystyrene closing cup is cemented in place with a polyester resin adhesive. When the firing pin of the weapon strikes the primer, a flash is generated which ignites the black powder charge producing flash, smoke, and a loud report to simulate weapon firing.
This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E21501)CTG, ARTY, 105MM HE, M1 W/O FUZE
The 105mm M1 High Explosive (HE) cartridge contains a HE fill and is used primarily for training although some cartridges are expended in combat operations for fragmentation and blast.  The cartridge is loaded with an M67 propellant charge, consisting of seven numbered increment bags sewn together in numerical order. Projectile function is dependent upon the fuze used and may function on impact (instantaneous or delay), above ground at a predetermined height or in proximity to the target area. Fuze function detonates the HE projectile filler resulting in projectile fragmentation and blast.  Range varies from 3.5 to 11.3 kilometers, depending on the number of charge bags used.  The program remanufactures/recapitalizes the remaining unserviceable cartridges through replacement of M67 Prop Charge and Primer at a reduced cost over new production to provide a cost effective training cartridge.  Funding for the 105MM HE, M1 program in FY 2015 through FY 2017 is for recapitalization.
This item is Code A, approved for service use.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>(E89500)ARTILLERY PROJECTILE, 155MM, ALL TYPES
This budget line includes Projectiles, Artillery, 155mm, All Types.  

(E21618)PROJ, ARTY, 155MM EXT RANGE MARKING RD M110A3
The 155mm Smoke White Phosphorous (WP) M110A3 Artillery Round utilizes projectile bodies generated from the current M483 Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munition (DPICM) demilitarization program and incorporates a more producible WP Bulk-filled Canister with 15.0 lbs of WP that provides smoke spotting capability to a maximum range of 22.5 kilometers providing increased operational effectiveness and improved training.  
This item is Code A, not approved for service use.

(E26904)PROJ, Arty, 155MM IR ILLUM M1123
The 155mm M1123 Infrared Illumination projectile is used with night vision devices to illuminate a designated target area to a maximum range of 17.5 kilometers.  The projectile has a hollow, steel-forged body containing an illumination canister, a canister expelling charge in the nose and a drogue parachute in the base.  The illumination canister contains the main parachute and lines, the illumination candle assembly and secondary expelling charge and a delay element holder.  The outer shell of the canister is fitted with four longitudinal fins.  The projectile uses an Electronic Time Fuze.  When the fuze functions, the primary expelling charge ignites forcing the drogue parachute and canister assembly against the base plate, rupturing the base pins and expelling the canister and parachute.  The drogue parachute deploys and the canister fins extend.  The expelling charge also ignites the delay element in the canister nose.  The delay element ignites the secondary expelling charge within the canister after 8 seconds igniting the candle and expelling the main parachute.  With the main parachute open, the illuminate candle descends at 15 feet per second and burns for 120 seconds.  The M1123 Provides Infrared battlefield illumination that is 2.4x larger in diameter than the M1066 Infrared Illuminating projectile.
This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E26900)PROJ, ARTY, 155MM VL ILLUM M1124
The 155MM Visual Light Illumination M1124 fired from 155mm howitzers is used to illuminate the battlefield to a maximum range of 17.5 kilometers.  The projectile has a hollow, steel-forged body containing an illumination canister, a canister expelling charge in the nose and a drogue parachute in the base.  The illuminate canister contains the main parachute and lines, the illuminate candle assembly and secondary expelling charge and a delay element holder.  The outer shell of the canister is fitted with four longitudinal fins.  The projectile uses a Mechanical or Electronic Time fuze.  When the fuze functions, the primary expelling charge ignites forcing the drogue parachute and canister assembly against the base plate, rupturing the base pins and expelling the canister and parachute.  The drogue parachute then deploys and the canister fins extend.  The expelling charge also ignites the delay element in the canister nose.  The delay element ignites the secondary expelling charge within the canister after 8 seconds igniting the candle and expelling the main parachute.  With the main parachute open, the illumination candle descends at 15 feet per second and burns for 120 seconds producing approximately 1,000,000 candlepower.  
This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E27603)PROJ, ARTY, 155MM HE IM TRAINING M1122
The 155mm M1122 High Explosive (HE) projectile will be the primary HE round used for training. The M1122 is a lower cost HE training round. The M1122 will replace the M804A1 and M107 Projectiles for training.  It utilizes M483A1 DPICM metal parts from an ongoing M483A1 demil effort, is filled with high density concrete to simulate the weight of the M795 HE Projectile, and incorporates several Insensitive Munitions (IM) technologies (IMX-101 explosive fill, PBXN-9 Supplementary Charge, Meltable Fuze Well Liner and Meltable Fuze Plug) to increase survivability and safety.  The M1122 will replicate the flight characteristics of the wartime M795 HE projectile with a maximum range of 22.5 kilometers.
This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E66800)PROJ, ARTY, 155MM HE, M795
The M795 High Explosive (HE) Projectile is the primary HE round used for warfare operations with maximum range of 22.5 kilometers.  The M795 incorporates Insensitive Munitions (IM) technologies that reduces vulnerability from unplanned stimuli e.g. fire/heat, shock and impact, while maintaining or exceeding the same level of effectiveness in combat.  The 155mm M795 has a high fragmentation steel (HF1) body projectile filled with 23.8 pounds of IMX101 Explosive fill, PBXN-9 Supplementary Charge, and Meltable Fuze Plug.  The projectile can use several different fuzes (impact, mechanical time, electronic time and short intrusion proximity).  It is used for conventional fire support for harassment and interdiction, fragmentation and blast effect.  The M795 projectile is employed against personnel, trucks, electronic surveillance and target acquisition devices, supply points, command and control and communications (C3) installations, and mechanized and armored forces.
This item is Code A, approved for service use.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>This budget line item includes the Excalibur family of munitions for the use in the M777A2 Lightweight 155mm Howitzer (LW155), the M109A6 Paladin Howitzer, the M109A7 paladin PIM Howitzer and the Swedish Archer Howitzer.

(E80100) Excalibur is a Precision Guided Extended Range 155mm Artillery projectile providing Brigade Combat Teams an organic precision fires capability. Additionally it provides improved fire support capability due to its increased range of 40.5 kilometers and demonstrated accuracy of &lt;3 meters radial miss distances, which enables a first round effect on target reducing the number of rounds required while reducing collateral damage. Excalibur is compatible with the M777A2 Lightweight 155mm Howitzer (LW155), the M109A6 Paladin Howitzer, the M109A7 Paladin PIM Howitzer, and the Swedish Archer Howitzer. Excalibur provides a 35% range increase over current Rocket Assisted Projectiles with a &lt;10 meter circular error probable requirement at all ranges. Excalibur is also highly resistant to Global Positioning System (GPS) jamming. This item is Code A, approved for service use.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.

(E80100) Excalibur is currently fielded and in use by units throughout Afghanistan and deployed globally to support other Military Contingency Operations. Excalibur is an International Cooperative Development program, teamed with the Kingdom of Sweden (KoS), which contributed resources towards the development in accordance with an established Project Agreement. Excalibur Increment Ia-1 was initially fielded to units in Iraq and Afghanistan in response to an urgent need request in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (as of September 2010 re-named to Operation New Dawn) and Operation Enduring Freedom. Increment Ia-2 was fielded in early FY 2012 and greatly increases range from 25.2 kilometers to 40.5 kilometers. Excalibur Increment Ib provides further performance improvements while significantly lowering unit costs. 

Increment Ib completed a successful Initial Operational Test and Evaluation in February 2014 as well as a Full Rate Production Decision Review in June 2014. The Excalibur Increment Ib projectile was Type Classified and Full Material Released in June 2014.

This is a war reserve item currently being used in combat. The FY 2017 request builds a war reserve inventory in accordance with the Army procurement goals. FY 2017 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $39.200 million supports the procurement of 372 Increment Ib projectiles.

The FY 2017 OCO includes $0.140 million to support the COCOM requirement for unit equipment sets to deter potential adversaries and support the European Reassurance Initiative.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>This budget line includes Mines and Mine Clearing Charges, All Types.

E72800 MK7Mod2  The Anti-Personnel Obstacle Breaching System (APOBS) is used by dismounted troops in combat operations to clear a lane through wire obstacles and anti-personnel mines.  This item is a lightweight, self-contained, 1 shot expendable system that is transported and deployed by a 2 man team.  It consists of a line charge/fuze assembly and a rocket motor assembly.  APOBS uses the EX126 Mod 0 rocket motor to propel a line charge over the obstacle.  The line is then exploded, clearing a lane.  The APOBS System is being actively used in Combat Engineering Operations.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>This budget line includes Anti-Personnel Landmine Alternatives (APLA), All Types.

E91700 Spider is a hand emplaced, remotely controlled, anti-personnel munition system that was designed to replace the capability of the persistent anti-personnel landmines banned from use after December 2010 per US Landmine policy.  Spider, as a Man-in-the-Loop system, offers numerous capabilities for asymmetric warfare focusing on small unit force protection.  The system is made up of 4 subsystems:  Man-in-the-Loop (the human operator), Remote Control Station (RCS),the system command and control station, Repeater (a communication link to the munitions that provides extended range), and Munition Control Units (MCU)delivers anti-personnel effects.  The Spider is designed to mitigate the indiscriminate initiation of the lethal mechanism.  A Soldier/Marine makes a conscious decision to engage a target with the lethal mechanism.  Spider's sensor capabilities and controlled munitions provide needed force protection and battlefield shaping.  Spider allows measured and graduated responses including sense only, non lethal, and lethal modes.  Spider also supports net-centric operations by feeding situational awareness information (location and status) into the Battle Command system.  The Spider system with its many desirable features makes it a versatile weapon system that has significant utility across the full spectrum of military operations and will support current and future operations.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.  Type Classification Standard and Full Materiel Release were achieved in July and September 2013 respectively.

E91741 - The MCUs are munitions strategically placed to provide the barrier capability of an obstacle.  The baseline MCU employs up to six (6) replaceable Miniature Grenade Launchers (MGLs) or up to six (6) Munition Adaoter Modules (MAMs), and a replaceable Extended Range Tripline Sensor (ERTS) module with six (6) triplines.

E91711 - The Miniature-Grenade Launcher (MGL) consists of a grenade assembly composed of a high explosive fragmenting warhead that provides lethal effects when launched from a Spider MCU.

E91721 - The Extended Range Tripline Sensor (ERTS) module enables the remote deployment of six (6) triplines.  The ERTS provides a silent (from enemy perspective) intrusion detection capability alerting the RCS operator of the enemy presence in the munition field.  When deployed, the triplines travel 10 to 12 meters along an axis (depending on wind speed and direction) corresponding to the six launch azimuths of the grenades providing approximately 20 to 24 meters of ERTS tripline diameter coverage.  The ERTS do not have to be deployed or installed until the tactical scenario calls for their deployment.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>This budget line procures all Hydra-70 rocket types in support of operational, training and war reserve requirements.  The system provides combat overmatch capability and ensures the availability of munitions to support combat operations.  This system of aerial rockets is used by Army aircraft (AH-64 Apache, H-60 Blackhawk and Special Operations aircraft).  The unguided systems perform a number of roles including anti-materiel, anti-personnel, air-to-ground suppression and illumination.  The guided system is used to provide increased accuracy over the unguided munitions in precision strikes against lightly armored and soft point targets enabling better conformance to restricted rules of engagement. This Hydra-70 rocket funding supports the entire Hydra-70 Rocket System to include resolution of obsolescence, safety, reliability, weapon integration activities, potential test sets, engineering changes, production issues and guidance section repair kits.

NOTE:  QTY EA</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>The Hydra-70 Product Office is the procurement agent for all services, for all variants of 2.75 Rockets.  This budget activity includes both training standard items and items that may be used in both training and combat.  The Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 procurement supports annual training and builds a war reserve inventory in accordance with the Army's procurement goals.  FY 2017 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $87.213 million will procure 55,660 unguided Hydra-70 Rockets and 100 guidance sections. FY 2017 OCO procurement dollars in the amount of $42.851 million will procure 18,419 unguided Hydra-70 Rockets.  Procurement funding is required in FY 2017-2021 in order to support further evaluation and theater requirements pending a decision on an enduring guided rocket capability.  The Army intends to convert any price advantage created through contract negotiations, other service procurement, and/or Foreign Military Sales (FMS) into a buy-to-budget procurement stategy.  Pricing and quantities in FY 2016-2021 is uncertain due to an unknown Mk90 grain price planned for negotiation in FY 2016.

"In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities."</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>Includes Cartridge Actuated Devices (CAD) and Propellant Actuated Devices (PAD) all types. 

CAD/PAD are used in various escape and jettison systems on all types of Army aircraft.  They are required to support aircraft escape, safety, and jettison systems and mission essential needs.  Items are subject to shelf and service life restrictions and, therefore, require replacement at specified intervals.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2017 Base Budget supports critical Army Title 10 war reserve/operational, training, and test requirements IAW DoD Instruction 3000.04 (Munitions Requirements Process) and AR 5-13 (Total Army Munitions Requirements Process and Prioritization System).  War reserve requirements support OSD-approved Combatant Commander Operational Plans, Homeland Defense, and other OSD-directed missions.  Training requirements support individual and collective training of Active and Reserve Component forces at Army schools, home station, and the combined training centers.  Test requirements support the development, fielding, safety, and quality assurance of Army munitions and equipment throughout their life-cycle.

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.

The FY 2017 program is required to assure availability of replacement items when needed and avoid grounding aircraft or rendering aircraft partially mission capable.</proc:Justification>

It is a non-developmental item (NDI) consisting of an energetic tool (ET), a demolition material interface adapter, and an emplacement stand.   The MCD provides EOD with an improved neutralization capability in situations where the use of more traditional methods (attacking the fuzing mechanism or high-order detonation) is not possible or desired.  This item is Code B, not approved for service use.

(E78201) The M980 Demolition Charge is a 20 pound, 38 foot roll of flexible explosive.  It is 10 inches wide and .083 inches thick.  It can be easily cut and formed into various shapes and is primarily used as a cutting charge.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E49100) Flare, AC Countermeasure, M206 Magnesium Teflon IR
The M206 flares are part of a family of advanced IR decoy flares designed for use by Army helicopters and fixed wing aircraft to meet advanced threats in current and future operational environments.  This flare is a Magnesium Teflon Viton flare.  When used together with the M212, a spectrally matched flare, and the M211, a pyrophoric alloy material payload that reacts with air to emit intense IR radiation, it provides protection against a wide range of surface to air threats.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E88900) Flare AC Cntermeasure M211 Pyrophoric Msl IR Decoy
These flares are part of the advanced infrared (IR) decoy/flares design, which are dispensed from Army aircraft to protect against advanced Man-portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS) in current and future operational environments.  The M211 uses a special high surface area metal foil, which rapidly oxidizes when exposed to oxygen.  When one of the flares is dispensed from the host aircraft, the special pyrophoric material payload reacts with air to emit intense IR radiation that is not visible to the naked eye.  The IR radiation diverts heat-seeking missiles away from the aircraft.  When used together with the M212, a spectrally matched flare, and the M206, a Magnesium Teflon Viton flare, the flares provide protection against a wide range MANPADS.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.

            <proc:Description>The Ammunition Peculiar Equipment (APE) program provides support for ammunition operations including surveillance, demilitarization (demil), maintenance, renovation, modification, packaging, and preservation per Army Regulation 700-20, Ammunition Peculiar Equipment.  APE is developed, acquired, and supervised through the Single Manager for Conventional Ammunition per DoD Instruction 5160.68.  APE provides equipment items specifically designed, fabricated, procured, tested, and adopted for use in worldwide United States (US) military ammunition depot operations on conventional ammunition.  APE maintains a central source of standard, modern, safe, efficient, reliable, and environmentally acceptable equipment for ammunition operations.  This equipment is different from production line plant equipment as it disassembles ammunition items into components, sorts and removes hazardous materials to reduce human interaction and improves personnel safety.  Maintenance APE is also designed to perform cleaning and renovation functions on ammunition subjected to deterioration effects (rust, corrosion, weathering, etc) during its storage life.  APE supporting surveillance is key to stockpile sampling and functional testing of the items to assure readiness for combat or training.  Demilitarization APE is similar to maintenance APE, but must go further in disassembly to destroy hazardous components, sort and reclaim salvageable parts or metals.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2017 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $17.275 million will provide APE that must be available to perform ammunition depot operations for conventional ammunition.  These operations cannot be accomplished if the required APE is not supplied in a timely manner.  APE is required to support the Ammunition Stockpile Reliability Program, Surveillance Program, equipment for worldwide maintenance and demil, prepositioned ships, and Government-Owned, Contractor-Operated plants as Government Furnished Equipment.  The APE assets maintain and verify the quality of the ammunition stockpile; thereby saving the cost of purchasing new replacement ammunition.  APE proficiently executes the ammunition demil mission to safely perform disassembly, destruction, or removal processes with an emphasis on recycling, re-utilization and preserving demil assets in a manner that supports ammunition sustainment, safety and environmental compliance.

The APE program provides essential major parts and equipment upgrades at the Demilitarization Facility (DEFAC) in the Republic of Korea (ROK).  A Memorandum of Agreement was signed on 4 November 2011 by US Forces Korea and the ROK Ministry of National Defense, which permits the demil of US titled munitions at this facility.  The DEFAC provides an environmentally safe means of demil for both US and ROK titled munitions, and the demil of US titled munitions at the DEFAC avoids significant retrograde shipment costs.  Ongoing demil operations have depleted the stockpile of US titled munitions at the DEFAC; therefore, these operations will terminate and the facility will be closed down by the end of FY 2017.  The APE located at the facility will be sold to Korea and/or shipped back to the US.  The equipment retrograde costs will be supported by the APE Program. 

The program provides global support to the US Military Services for ammunition sustainment and demil operations, including deployment, operations and support of the Ammunition Supply Point (ASP) suites.  The ASP suites include APE, which will increase the efficiency of the receipt, inspection and issuance of ammunition to the warfighter.  Deployment of APE to support ASP suites will increase efficiencies for ammunition sustainment operations by reducing logistics burdens and related risks.  This allows for better primary mission readiness, enhanced hazardous operations safety and more efficient operating conditions requiring less ammunition retrograde/demil by providing capability to preserve ammunition assets.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>This budget line provides funding for modernization efforts at Government-Owned, Contractor-Operated Army Ammunition Plants (AAPs) and commercial facilities, including replacement of obsolete or worn production equipment, correction of deficiencies and upgrade of infrastructures.  The Industrial Facilities (IF) budget line also establishes, augments and improves ammunition production capabilities through strategic modernization efforts, expands production capacity, maintains environmental compliance, and improves quality of work environment and safety at ammunition plants, as well as emergency modernization and associated construction to address production disruptions at various sites.

This budget line provides funding for preservation, storage and movement of real property facilities and equipment required for anticipated future requirements at active and inactive Army ammunition installations, also known as Layaway of Industrial Facilities (LIF) activities.  Funding will also support consolidation of laid-away production equipment and redistribution of production equipment that cannot be stored on-site.  Laid-away efforts will also include retaining critical operational and technical knowledge of production equipment, such as engineering designs, process data and control manufacturing practices.  Efforts will also include safety-related decontamination, disposal and demolition of production equipment and facilities, and environmental site assessments.

Procurement funds also support the Maintenance of Inactive Facilities (MIF) to include utilities, buildings, plant equipment, special tooling, and special test equipment being retained to support future production requirements.  Additional efforts include support of associated MIF costs such as grounds maintenance, fire protection, equipment security, and administrative support.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2017 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $222.269 million will support modernization projects to include upgrades to the industrial wastewater treatment processes at Holston AAP, upgrades to the small caliber production lines at Lake City AAP, rail system upgrades at Iowa AAP, and modernization improvements to the Nitric Acid Concentrator/Sulfuric Acid Concentrator at Radford AAP.  Funds will support critical work environmental projects, including improvements for personnel safety and health, and efforts to maintain environmental compliance at the ammunition plants.  Funds will also provide engineering support of industrial facilities, pre-design efforts for future-year modernization projects and procurement efforts at Aberdeen and Yuma Test Centers to include production acceptance tests for various ammunition end items.

FY 2017 funding also supports the protection and preservation of industrial facilities at active and inactive Army ammunition installations and equipment that are no longer required for current production but must be retained for future peacetime or emergency production needs.  Funds support the fourth phase of the decontamination and disposal of excess buildings at Holston Army Ammunition Plant (AAP) and the layaway of various load, assemble and pack production lines at Milan AAP.  LIF efforts also include the removal and disposal of legacy Nitrocellulose (NC) present in Hill Tank 417 at Radford AAP, which will significantly reduce environmental and safety issues associated with large quantities of legacy NC.

FY 2017 funding supports the care and maintenance of laid-away equipment and facilities at active and inactive ammunition installations.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>The Conventional Munitions Demilitarization Program provides for the demilitarization (demil) and disposal of Single Manager for Conventional Ammunition (SMCA) managed conventional ammunition and missiles for all Military Services per DoD Directive 5160.65 and DoD Instruction 5160.68 that is unserviceable, obsolete, unsafe, or excess to requirements.  The program accomplishes demil using open burning/open detonation (OB/OD) processes or closed disposal technologies (CDT) with primary emphasis on resource recovery and recycling (R3).  This program also provides for operations, technical support and services; packaging, crating, handling, and transportation (PCHT) of ammunition for demil projects at United States Army depots, plants and activities; commercial contracts that provide CDT demil support and services; and international operations, which include the European and Pacific Theatres.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2017 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $157.383 million will support the demilitarization of conventional ammunition as well as missile and missile components (msl/comp) for all Military Services.

FY 2017 funds will support the United States demil operations of conventional ammunition in both Continental United States (CONUS) and Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS).  CONUS demil operations are performed by a combination of Government Owned, Government Operated (GOGO) depots, Government Owned, Contractor Operated (GOCO) depots as well as commercial contractors.  OCONUS demil operations are performed at Demilitarization Facilities (DEFACs) in the Republic of Korea and Japan as well as commercial contractors in the European Union. 

As of the end of September 2015, the SMCA Resource, Recovery and Disposition Account (B5A) contained 482,391 tons of ammunition in CONUS wholesale storage locations: 443,474 tons of conventional ammunition and 38,917 tons (373,768 eaches) of msl/comp.  During FY 2015, 83,315 tons of demil was accomplished and comprised of 69,343 tons of conventional ammunition and 13,972 tons (149,063 eaches) of msl/comp.  

Stockpile growth and generations: An estimated 38,763 tons of conventional ammunition will enter the B5A in FY 2016, and an estimated 37,169 tons of conventional ammunition will enter the B5A in FY 2017.  During FY 2018 through FY 2021, 323,210 tons of conventional ammunition are forecasted to be added into the B5A.  An estimated 8,749 tons (39,553 eaches) of msl/comp will enter the B5A in FY 2016, and an estimated 13,632 tons (52,356 eaches) of msl/comp will enter the B5A in FY 2017.  During FY 2018 through FY 2021, 50,079 tons (238,053 eaches) of msl/comp are forecasted to be added into the B5A.

Stockpile growth factors: The demil stockpile is expected to grow as a result of Military Services generations as well as other factors such as cluster munitions and land mine policies as well as the disestablishment of War Reserve Stocks Allies (WRSA) accounts at OCONUS locations.  Currently, there are approximately 166,616 tons of cluster munitions in the demil stockpile.  An additional 198,928 tons are expected to be added into the B5A between FY 2016 and FY 2021 to ensure compliance with the Cluster Munitions Policy.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>The Armament Retooling and Manufacturing Support (ARMS) program reuses idle capacity at active and inactive Government-Owned, Contractor-Operated (GOCO) Army Ammunition Plants and GOCO Army Depots through commercialization.  Congress enacted this program in the FY 1993 Defense Authorization Act (Public Law (PL) 102-484) and codified in FY 2000 (10 U.S.C. 4551-4555).  ARMS resources are used for facility strategic reuse plans, marketing plans, building renovation and recapitalization, equipment purchase, relocation, or consolidation, as well as environmental baseline studies and site surveys to encourage commercial use of underutilized Army assets.  The ARMS objectives include sustaining critical manufacturing capabilities and critical skills; reducing facility operating and maintenance costs; decreasing product cost; providing opportunities for small business; and accelerating private sector economic development, employment and investment.  The ARMS program allows the Army to manage portions of the ammunition infrastructure as a commercial business.  This management concept has allowed the Army to apply overhead costs across multiple commercial contracts to reduce operating costs.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2017 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $3.646 million support financial and marketing investments to attract revenue-producing tenants to locate on GOCO Army Ammunition Plants and GOCO Army Depots.  The ARMS program reduces Army cost of ownership and maintains critical munitions industrial base skills.  Revenues collected will be utilized to reduce overhead and total annual operating costs, improve and maintain existing buildings for current tenants, and perform improvements to other vacant buildings to entice potential tenants.</proc:Justification>
