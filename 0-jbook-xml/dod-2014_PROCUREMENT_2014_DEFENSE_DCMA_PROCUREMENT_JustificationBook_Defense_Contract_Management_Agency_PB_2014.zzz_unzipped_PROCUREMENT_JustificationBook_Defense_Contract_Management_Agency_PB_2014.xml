            <proc:Description> DCMAâ€™s mission is to provide Contract Administration Services to the Department of Defense Acquisition Enterprise and its partners to ensure delivery of quality products and services to the warfighter; on time and on cost. To assist in managing its diverse activities, DCMA must procure passenger carrying vehicles and multiple tools that provide critical enterprise capabilities in concert with DCMA initiatives that will afford a high degree of effectiveness, productivity, and efficiency in the accomplishment of the Agency's mission.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>  
  DCMA continues to have the requirement to procure replacement passenger carrying vehicles in support of DCMA's overseas contract administration operations conducted throughout the world.  DCMA is still working to convert its overseas fleet from owned passenger carrying vehicles to long-term commercial leases where available.  With the General Services Administration's (GSA) limited support of leasing vehicle outside of Germany, DCMA will continue to require passenger carrying vehicles procurement authority.

 DCMA is developing an integrated enterprise architecture to maximize existing capabilities and provide situational awareness, acquisition insight, and business intelligence.  We are expanding our situational awareness from an internal focus on business processes to an external focus.  DCMA is also implementing an infrastructure to deploy an Integrated Workflow Management System (IWMS)that will be a records management DoD Directive 5015.2 compliant solution.  In addition DCMA will deploy a new contract writing system in line with the Office of the Secretary of Defense's (OSD) Standard Procurement System (SPS) replacement strategy. These enterprise and infrastructure changes are the reasons for DCMA's FY 2014 program growth. 

  DCMA is executing a strategy to consolidate all web based applications in concert with the integrated enterprise architecture that is being developed. The web-based capabilities support DCMA's unique mission and provide cross functional capabilities that support the full range of acquisition and contract management.  The capabilities help DCMA's acquisition workforce access real time data; thus, enabling them to make sound contract management and business decisions. The objective behind the web-based capabilities is to provide effective and efficient solutions to unique challenges that slow down or hinder performance based contract management for DCMA and other DoD support components.  DCMA will begin monitoring the end user desk top experience as we shift from network availability to network performance monitoring. 

 DCMA has constructed a robust virtual training environment that will support our future initiatives which include the Defense Agency Initiative (DAI) conversion, SPS transition, portal conversion, IWMS deployment, and a learning management system coupled with internal tool upgrades and enhancements. Funds will ensure DCMA employees are fully trained on DCMA capabilities.         </proc:Justification>

                    <proc:Remarks>DCMA's requirement to procure replacement passenger carrying vehicles supports DCMA's overseas contract management mission.  Currently, DCMA maintains field offices in Germany, the Middle East, and the Pacific Rim requiring such vehicles.  We are still working to convert our overseas fleet from owned passenger carrying vehicles to long term commercial leases or leases with the General Services Administration (GSA) where available.   We still do not have this option with GSA for lease services outside of Germany.  Therefore, DCMA continues to require passenger carrying vechicle procurement authority.  </proc:Remarks>
