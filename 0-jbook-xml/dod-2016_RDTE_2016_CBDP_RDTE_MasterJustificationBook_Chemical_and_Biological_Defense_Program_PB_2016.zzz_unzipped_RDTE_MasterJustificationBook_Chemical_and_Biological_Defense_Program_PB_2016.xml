                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Advances fundamental knowledge and promotes theoretical and experimental research in life and physical sciences.  

The Projects within this BA reflect the research areas of Life Sciences(LF1) (e.g. microbiology, biochemistry, pathogenic mechanisms, cell and molecular biology, immunology, and information science) which focus on fundamental efforts to understand living systems' response to biological or chemical agents, to support detection, diagnostics, protection, and medical treatment. 

The projects within in this BA also include efforts in Physical Sciences (PS1) (e.g. chemistry, physics, materials science, and environmental science) which focus on fundamental scientific phenomena.  These support investigation of physical and chemical properties and interactions for enhanced functionalities important to detection, protection, and decontamination.  BA1 also supports Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) efforts through the National Research Council with Post-Doctorate research associate program, a two week summer camp for high school students and teachers, and Military Internships at West Point.  

The projects in this PE are placed in BA1 because they are basic research efforts directed towards non-specific or non-unique military applications.  Basic research technological breakthroughs support applied research (PE 0602384BP) activities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project (PS1) advances fundamental scientific knowledge in physical science areas that include chemistry, physics, materials science, environmental sciences, and nanotechnology that could potentially lead to transformational CB defensive capabilities enhancing Warfighter performance and safety.  Research results in physics, chemistry and materials sciences have potential application in point and standoff detection, as well as protection and decontamination.  Surface and environmental sciences focus on the study of physical and chemical properties and phenomena of interactions, especially with regard to Non Traditional Agents (NTAs), that seek to improve capabilities such as detection, protection, and decontamination.  Research in nanotechnology and nanoscale sciences, such as nanoelectromechanical systems, molecular motors, nano-mechanical resonance sensing, and nano-meter imaging, has potential application across CB capability areas to provide significant enhancement by, for example, decreasing detection response times, increasing medical countermeasure effectiveness against a wider array of threat agents, and providing currently unavailable modalities like detection imbedded in fabrics.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Applies research in the areas of physical technologies (CB protective materials, textiles, and filtration, sensors and sensing algorithms, effects modeling, chemical formulations, processes and methods for hazard mitigation), medical technologies (drug discovery and platform technology development, biomarkers and assay development useful in drug development and diagnostics, human mimicking devices and regulatory science), and non-traditional agent medical and physical defense technologies, including characterization of emerging threats.  Major efforts support development of vaccines, therapeutics, next generation diagnostics systems, next generation chemical detectors, nerve agent pretreatments and individual protection advances.

In the physical sciences area, Project CB2, focuses on continuing improvements in CB defense materiel, including contamination avoidance, decontamination, and protection technologies, as well as biological weapon/agent surveillance.  

The medical program, Project TM2, focuses on the development of antidotes, drug treatments, disease surveillance and point-of-need diagnostic devices, patient decontamination and medical technologies management.  The Medical Countermeasures Initiative (MCMI) was established to provide the capability for the advancement of regulatory science and flexible manufacturing of biological MCM to address CBR threats, including novel and previously unrecognized, naturally-occurring emerging infectious diseases.  

For Non-Traditional Agents (NTAs), Project NT2 consolidates all NTA efforts (both medical and non-medical) including pretreatments, therapeutics, detection, threat agent science, modeling, and protection and hazard mitigation.  

Efforts under this PE will transition to or will provide risk reduction for Advanced Technology Development (PE: 0603384BP), Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (PE: 0603884BP) and System Development and Demonstration (PE: 0604384BP).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project TM2 provides for applied research for innovative technology approaches to advance medical systems designed to rapidly identify, diagnose, prevent, and treat disease due to exposure to all three of radiological, chemical and biological threat agents.  Categories for this project include core science efforts in Medical Chemical, Medical Biological, Diagnostics, and the Medical Countermeasures Initiative (MCMI).  Against radiological threats, this project provides investment for the development of pretreatments (prophylaxis) and post-irradiation therapeutics against radiological/nuclear exposure.  Against chemical and biological agents, this project funds applied research for the investigation of new medical countermeasures to include prophylaxes, pretreatments, antidotes, skin decontaminants, and therapeutic drugs against identified and emerging biological and chemical warfare agents.  Medical Science and Technology (S&amp;T) efforts in this Budget Activity refine promising medical initiatives identified in Budget Activity 1, resulting in the development of countermeasures to protect against and treat the effects of exposure to chemical and biological (CB) agents.  Diagnostic research focuses on providing high quality data closer to the point-of-need comprising devise innovation, panels of biomarkers driven by bioinformatics, and epidemiological modeling tools.  

The Medical Countermeasures Initiative (MCMI) was established to coordinate inter-related advanced development and flexible manufacturing capabilities, providing a dedicated, cost-effective, reliable, and sustainable MCM process that meets the Warfighter and national security needs.  MCMI efforts within science and technology (S&amp;T) are concentrated in advancing two areas: 1) regulatory science and 2) flexible manufacturing technologies and processes for MCMs.  Efforts conducted in these areas are enablers supporting the DoD Medical Countermeasures Advanced Development and Manufacturing (MCM-ADM) capability.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Demonstrates technologies supporting transition to advanced component development in the areas of physical capabilities (biological and chemical detection, situational awareness and effects modeling, and protection and hazard mitigation) and medical capabilities (pretreatments, therapeutics, diagnostics capabilities, and drug manufacturing and regulatory science technologies), including capabilities against non-traditional agents.  Major efforts support enhanced chemical detection capabilities for aerosols and non-traditional agents, expanded capabilities for biosurveillance in pathogen detection and diagnosis, and pretreatments and therapeutics against a broader set of chemical and biological agents.

In the physical sciences area, Project CB3 focuses on demonstrations of CB defense technologies, including biological detection, chemical detection, information system technology for hazard prediction and systems performance, and protection, and decontamination.  The Project continues to pursue solutions against traditional agents. 

All non-traditional agent (NTA)-dedicated research (both medical and non-medical) is consolidated in Project NT3.  This Project includes NTA chemical diagnostics, medical pretreatments, therapeutics, detection, and protection and hazard mitigation.

The medical program in Project TM3, aims to produce biological diagnostic assays and reagents, diagnostic device platforms, pretreatments and therapeutics for bacterial, viral, and toxin threats as well as for chemical threats, and medical devices, as countermeasures for CBR threat agents.  Specific areas of medical investigation include: prophylaxis, pretreatment, antidotes and therapeutics, personnel and patient decontamination, and medical management of casualties.  

Project TT3, Techbase Technology Transition, pursues efforts to enhance military operational capability, concepts of operation, WMD elimination, and hazard mitigation following a biological warfare or chemical warfare attack.

The PE is dedicated to conducting proof-of-principle field demonstrations, and testing system-specific technologies to meet specific military needs.  Work conducted under this PE will transition to and will provide risk reduction for PE 0603884BP/PE 0604384BP activities.

FY 2015 funding includes $132.7 million of base funding and $22.7 million of Ebola emergency funding.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

This project focuses on demonstrating fast and agile scientific responses to enhance or develop capabilities that address emerging threats.  Efforts in this project support an integrated approach to develop new or enhanced countermeasures against novel and emerging threats through innovative science and technology (S&amp;T) solutions for detection, protection, decontamination and medical countermeasures (MCMs).  Efforts supply test methodologies and supporting science to verify capabilities, develop protection and hazard mitigation options, expand hazard assessment tools, and develop MCMs against NTAs.  This project is a comprehensive and focused effort for developing NTA defense capabilities, coordinated with specific interagency partners for doctrine, equipment, and training for the Warfighter and civilian population for defense against NTAs.  This project funds advanced technology development of NTA defense science and technology initiatives and transitions them to Budget Activities 4 and 5.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project TM3 funds preclinical and early phase clinical development of vaccines, therapeutic drugs, and diagnostic capabilities to provide safe and effective medical defense against validated biological threat agents or emerging infectious disease biothreats including bacteria, toxins, and viruses.  Innovative biotechnology approaches to advance medical systems designed to rapidly identify, diagnose, prevent, and treat disease due to exposure to biological threat agents will be evaluated.  In addition this project supports the advanced development of medical countermeasures to include prophylaxes, pretreatments, antidotes, skin decontaminants and therapeutic drugs against identified and emerging chemical warfare threat agents.  Entry of candidate vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostic technologies into advanced development is facilitated by the development of technical data packages that support the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Investigational New Drug (IND) processes, DoD acquisition regulations, and the oversight of early phase clinical trials in accordance with FDA guidelines.  This project also supports the advanced development of medical countermeasures to protect the Warfighter against radiological/nuclear exposure.

The Medical Countermeasures Initiative (MCMI) was established to coordinate inter-related advanced development and flexible manufacturing capabilities, providing a dedicated, cost-effective, reliable, and sustainable MCM process that meets the Warfighter and national security needs.  MCMI efforts within science and technology (S&amp;T) are concentrated in advancing two areas: 1) regulatory science and 2) flexible manufacturing technologies and processes for MCMs.  Efforts conducted in these areas are enablers supporting the DoD Medical Countermeasures Advanced Development and Manufacturing (MCM-ADM) capability.

FY 2015 funding includes $87.6 million of base funding and $22.7 million of Ebola emergency funding.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

These programs offer an opportunity to identify and efficiently mature emerging technologies including limited objective experiments, laboratory experiments, risk reduction efforts, engineering and integration.  These demonstrations and programs seek to demonstrate the potential for enhanced military operational capability and/or cost effectiveness.  This project addresses four family of products areas: Biological Resiliency, Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Elimination, Hazard Mitigation and Facilities Protection.  Biological resiliency efforts are targeted to reduce biological threats.  WMD Elimination addresses detection, identification, verification and baseline assessments in support of expeditionary forces deployed in non-permissive environments.  Hazard Mitigation addresses Chemical, Biological, and Radiological (CBR) remediation and decontamination processes.  Facilities protection transitions mature technologies to improve individual and critical infrastructure protection capabilities for U.S. and coalition Warfighters.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Operational forces have an immediate need to survive, safely operate, and sustain operations in a Chemical and Biological (CB) threat environment across the continuum of global, contingency, special operations/low intensity conflict, counternarcotics, and other high-risk missions.  This program element supports the Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) of medical and non-medical CB defensive equipment and materiel.  Congress directed centralized management of Department of Defense (DoD) medical and non-medical CB Defense initiatives.  DoD missions for civil support operations have recently expanded and have resulted in providing focus to develop technologies to support CB counterterrorism initiatives.  ADC&amp;P is conducted for an array of chemical, biological, and toxin detection and warning systems providing early warning, collector concentrators, generic detection, improved reagents, and decontamination systems using solutions that will remove and/or detoxify contaminated materiel without damaging combat equipment, personnel, or the environment.  CB sensors and diagnostics enhance the Departments environmental and medical surveillance efforts by improving the monitoring and surveillance of threats and forces preparing for and engaged in military operations.  These efforts are required to enable military commanders and the Military Health System to prevent, treat, and mitigate threats to individual Service Members and military units.  Integration of CB sensor and diagnostic data from the programs in this ACD&amp;P will also be usable within the homeland security and Federal public health common operating pictures.  

The Department of Defense is responsible for research, development, acquisition, and deployment of medical countermeasures to prevent or mitigate the health effects of CB threats to the Armed Forces and directs strategic planning for and oversight of programs to support medical countermeasures development and acquisition for our Armed Forces personnel.  The CB medical threat to the Armed Forces, in contrast with public health threats to U.S. citizens, encompasses all potential or continuing enemy actions that can render a Service Member combat ineffective.  CB medical threats, because they apply as a whole to military units deployed on a specific mission and/or operations, may result in the unit being unable to complete its mission.  CB medical countermeasures developed by DoD, unlike those developed to support U.S. population, must support military commanders practical operational requirements and deployment strategies and must emphasizes prevention of injury and illness and protection of the force.  Preventive measures in this ACD&amp;P, such as vaccines against the most likely biological threat agents and traditional / non-traditional chemical agent prophylaxis, conserves fighting strength, decreases the logistics burden by reducing the need for larger deployed hospital footprint and greater demand for tactical and strategic medical evacuation, and satisfies the need for greater flexibility in military planning and operations.  When vaccines and other prophylactic medical countermeasures are not available, efforts on this ACD&amp;P support pre-hospitalization treatment, en-route care, hospital care, and long-term clinical outcomes.  Specific items in this category include improvements to CB diagnostics and therapeutics to mitigate the consequences of biologic agents and exposure to ionizing radiation due to nuclear or radiological attacks.  DoD is the only Federal activity conducting ACD&amp;P on these prophylactic, diagnostic, and therapeutic CB medical countermeasures.  

The Department of Defense coordinates its efforts with the Departments of Health and Human Services to promote synergy and minimize redundancy.  The Department of Defense ensures coordination by participating in the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise interagency strategic planning process ("One Portfolio").  The Department of Defense's longstanding experience and success in CB medical countermeasure research, development, acquisition, and deployment not only ensures protection of the Armed Forces, it also accelerates and improves the overall national efforts in CB medical countermeasure research, development, and acquisition because of its unique facilities, testing capabilities, and trained and experienced personnel.  

ACD&amp;P also supports the development of updated test capabilities to evaluate Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Defense systems.  Also included is the Techbase Technology Transition effort which validates high-risk/high-payoff technologies that could significantly improve Warfighter capabilities.  

The projects in this program element support efforts in the technology development phase of the acquisition strategy and are therefore correctly placed in Budget Activity 4.

FY 2015 funding includes $163.2 million of base funding and $17.3 million of Ebola emergency funding.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) Project supports Component Advanced Development and System Integration (CAD/SI) of reconnaissance, detection, identification, and hazard prediction equipment, hardware, and software.  Experimentation and demonstration will be used in this phase to reduce risk and inform supporting materiel solutions, CONOPS and TTPs.  Individual efforts are: (1) Biosurveillance (BSV), (2) Next Generation Chemical Detector (NGCD); (3) Non-Traditional Agent (NTA) Defense: and Test Equipment, Strategy and Support (TESS) focuses on Test Infrastructure improvements and initiatives.

Biosurveillance (BSV) actively gathers, analyzes, and interprets collected information that includes biosphere data that relate to disease activity and threats to human or animal health in order to achieve early warning of health threats, early detection of health events, and overall situational awareness of disease activity.  BSV will align the biosurveillance efforts across DoD and national strategies.  BSV will scope and influence BSV capabilities as products to meet Warfighter requirements through innovative management of key BSV initiatives.  BSV requirements address medical and physical CBRN mission needs spanned in over 11 requirements documents and through Combatant Commander (COCOM) identified needs.  BSV funds will support Joint US Forces Korea (USFK) Portal and Integrated Threat recognition (JUPITR) ATD/BSV ATD which will find, demonstrate, transition, and transfer the best operational concepts and technology solutions in support of a holistic approach to countering biological threats from the laboratory to operational use and theater confirmation of a Biological Event.  JUPITR ATD will consist of four legs; Early Warning (EW), Biological Identification Capabilities Sets (BICS), Assessment of Environmental Detectors (AED), and Biosurveillance Portal (BSP).  The JUPITR ATD will provide the USFK with a holistic biosurveillance capability to provide early warning, detection, collection, identification, and theater confirmation of a Biological event.  The JUPITR ATD consists of filling capability gaps through information sharing and communication systems and detection/diagnostic systems for the USFK.  Outputs will focus on proving component, CONOPS, and subsystem transition into relevant technologies that are currently programs of record (PORs) NGDS, TDS and CALS.  Systems used in Operational Demonstration will be left behind with a two year sustainment plan for continuing use.  Whole system live agent test (WSLAT) of AED units will support JPM NBC CA business case analysis for maritime and fixed site Point Biological Detection.

The Next Generation Chemical Detector (NGCD) consists of several detection systems.  The systems will address sampling of multiple phases of matter; locating liquids and solids on surfaces; and vapor and aerosol monitoring.  NGCD will detect and identify non-traditional agents, chemical warfare agents (CWAs), and toxic industrial chemicals (TICs) in the air and on surfaces.  The NGCD will provide improved CWA/TIC selectivity and sensitivity on multiple platforms as well as multiple environments.  These detectors will improve detection, consequence management, reconnaissance, and weapons of mass destruction (WMD) interdiction capabilities.  The NGCD focuses on developing three detection systems; the NGCD variant 1 - Detector Alarm, the NGCD variant 2 - Survey Detector, and the NGCD variant 3 - Sample Analyzer detectors simultaneously during the TMRR Phase.  The NGCD variant 1 will provide Joint Warfighters with a capability to detect and identify Non-Traditional Agents (NTAs), Chemical Warfare Agents (CWAs) and Toxic Industrial Chemicals (TICs) in aerosol and vapor forms.  The NGCD variant 2 will provide Joint Warfighters with a capability to detect and identify liquid and solid CWAs, NTAs, and TICs on surfaces.  The NGCD variant 3 will provide Joint Warfighters with a capability to collect NTA, CWA, and TIC chemical samples for all states of matter, identify, and quantify the chemical agent of interest in support of reconnaissance, surveillance, site assessment, and decontamination to check and confirm clean.

The Non-Traditional Agent (NTA) Defense program supports the chemical and biological (CB) defense efforts as acquisition programs address emerging threat requirements across the full spectrum of commodities.  Dedicated systems engineering analyses to identify projects that will transition information, technologies, and capabilities into acquisition programs that account for the breadth and depth of emerging threats which span the full range of military missions.  By leveraging previous work done on NTAs (NTA DETECT) within the DoD, interagency cooperation, and international partnerships, the NTA Defense program will provide essential enablers such as threat understanding; operational impacts of performance trades; and comprehensive, integrated, and layered defense concepts against current NTA threats.  The program will develop a balanced portfolio which will target capabilities to reduce risk from technology gaps inherent from emerging threats.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>BIOSURVEILLANCE (BSV)

BSV is a set of capabilities that acquire, integrate, and analyze medical, environmental, and incident management data using existing and next generation systems, medical and non-medical sample collection tools and identifiers/diagnostics; and transition hardware/software tools and devices as residuals from the Biosurveillance Joint United States Force Korea (USFK) Portal and Integrated Threat Recognition (JUPITR) Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD).  Lessons learned from the ATD will be transitioned to the programs of record associated with the CBDP (such as NGDS, TDS &amp; CALS).  The acquisition strategy will address the materiel solutions identified out of the multiple Biosurveillance (BSV) related Analysis of Alternatives (AoA's).

NEXT GENERATION CHEMICAL DETECTOR (NGCD)

System Engineering and market survey results suggested the most effective way to develop NGCD was to divide the program into four unique capabilities to detect and identify the full spectrum of chemical compounds in all phases of matter.  The Government awarded ten (10) contracts in June 2014 to support Technology Maturation Risk Reduction (TMRR) acquisition phase activities in three of the four capability areas.  Three (3) contracts for the Air Monitoring capability, four (4) contracts for the Surface survey capability, and three (3) contracts for the Multi-Sample Analysis capability.  Full and Open competition will be used to award Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contracts with production options for each capability at Milestone B.  Candidates for acceleration to provide partial capability will be selected from either the NGCD2 or NGCD1, based on emerging breadboard test results.

NON TRADITIONAL AGENT DEFENSE (NTA DEFENSE)

The Non-Traditional Agent (NTA) Defense program supports the Chemical Biological Defense Program (CBDP) to develop countermeasures for all emerging threats across all commodities.  The NTA Defense program consists of a number of projects and initiatives through full and open contract actions that: (1) evaluate COTS and GOTS technologies and systems, (2) conduct demonstrations and experiments, (3) integrates Intelligence Community threat analysis, JRO/ J-8 operational risk analysis with systems technical performance to identify technologies or systems that can be rapidly developed, and deployed, and/or transitioned to an Acquisition Program for technology insertion or derive an Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) to a fielded system, and (4) coordination of DoD, interagency, international NTA projects.  These initiatives allow CBDP/JPEO to mitigate risk against emerging threats and better prepare the warfighter to deal with technological surprise across the full range of military missions.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

This Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) Project supports Component Advanced Development and System Integration (CAD/SI) for programs that provide a comprehensive, integrated and layered CBRN protection and response capability for military installations and specialized military consequence management units both at home and abroad.  Particular emphasis is placed on improving military-civilian interoperability in CBRN detection and response capabilities; providing tiered levels of CBRN protection and response capabilities to military installations; and tailored modular and integrated Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) solutions to consequence management units.  

This program also supports the acquisition and delivery of an integrated chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and explosive (CBRNE) rapid response capability for National Guard Bureau's (NGB) Weapons of Mass Destruction Civil Support Teams (WMD-CST) and Special Purpose Units - Chemical Biological Equipment (SPU-CBE) which consists of the CBRNE Enhanced Response Force Package (CERFP), the United States Marine Corps Chemical Biological Incident Response Force (CBIRF) the United States Army Reserve (USARC) Chemical Recon Platoons, Decon Platoons, Defense Support of Civil Authority CBRN Response Force (DCRF), and the 20th Support Command Nuclear Disablement (NDT) and CBRNE Teams.  Key activities of this program include ongoing life cycle assessments for the portfolio of fielded commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) CBRNE equipment, identification and evaluation of emerging technologies, prioritization and fielding of improved capabilities to meet established requirements, and the establishment of institutionalized training.  The overall capability package includes hand held detection, protection, decontamination, situational awareness software assessment and sampling tools, The purpose of this program is to address legacy requirements gaps/deficiencies for WMD-CST's and SPU-CBE's where they exist through the streamlined acquisition of COTS/government-off-the-shelf (GOTS) capability upgrades that incorporate proven advancements in technology to satisfy mission performance standards.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project supports the development of Contamination Mitigation (ConMit) systems utilizing solutions that will remove and/or detoxify contaminated material without damaging combat equipment, personnel, or the environment.  ConMit systems provide a force restoration capability for units that become contaminated.  Development efforts will provide systems that reduce operational impact and logistics burden, reduce sustainment costs, increase safety, and minimize environmental effects associated with decontamination and contamination mitigation operations.  Experimentation and demonstration will be used in this phase to reduce risk and inform supporting materiel solutions, CONOPS and TTPs.

The programs supported under this Project include (1) Decontamination Family of Systems (DFoS), (2) Contamination Indicator Decontamination Assurance System (CIDAS), (3) General Purpose Decontaminant (GPD), (4) Joint Service Equipment Wipe (JSEW), and (5) Joint Biological Aircraft Decontamination (JBAD) System.  

The DFoS program facilitates the rapid transition of mature Science and Technology (S&amp;T) research efforts to existing Decontamination or ConMit Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) Programs of Record and guides S&amp;T community efforts toward meeting the needs of the Warfighter.  Leveraging the outcome of the Materiel Development Decision (MDD) (3QFY11) directed Analysis of Alternatives (AoA), DFoS will develop a Family of Systems (FoS) to provide novel preparatory and responsive contamination mitigation technologies to meet the capability gaps for decontaminating chemical and biological (CB) warfare agents and Non Traditional Agents (NTA) from personnel, equipment, vehicle, ship, and aircraft interiors/exteriors, terrain and fixed facility interiors/exteriors.  

CIDAS will provide a contamination indicator/decontamination assurance technology; it will consist of an indicator and an applicator, for which there will be three configurations.  The indicator will be sprayed on tactical vehicles, aircraft, ships, crew-served weapons, and individual weapons that may have been exposed to traditional and non-traditional chemical contamination.  CIDAS is a new capability for the Joint Forces that will reduce the logistics burden of decontamination by indicating presence and location of traditional (Nerve and Blister) and non-traditional chemical agents on militarily relevant surfaces pre- and post-decontamination.

General Purpose Decontaminant (GPD) is a liquid decontaminant that will provide thorough decontamination capabilities for tactical vehicles, shipboard surfaces, crew-served weapons, and individual/personal weapons in hostile and non-hostile environments that have been exposed to traditional and non-traditional CB contamination. 

The Joint Service Equipment Wipe (JSEW) is a decontamination wipe that will provide immediate/operational decontamination capabilities for sensitive and non-sensitive equipment in hostile and non-hostile environments that have been exposed to chemical agents/contamination and shall decontaminate Nerve and Blister agents from a starting liquid challenge of 10 g/m2 to less than or equal to 1 g/m2 and non-traditional agents from a starting liquid challenge of 5 g/m2 to less than or equal to 1 g/m2.  In addition, the JSEW is intended to be a replacement for the Individual Equipment Decontamination Kit (M295).  Follow on increments of JSEW may include biological agent capability and/or use on skin.

The JBAD System program is a new start in FY15.  The JBAD System will provide thorough biological decontamination of the interior and exterior of tactical and cargo aircraft.  The JBAD System is a capability set that will include a shelter to encapsulate an airframe, a decontamination delivery system (e.g. hot-humid air-blower, etc.), environmental control and monitoring system(s), and other ancillary components required to ensure efficacious biological agent decontamination.  It will provide the capability to decontaminate biologically contaminated airframes to safe levels and allow more rapid return to service.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The DFoS is utilizing an incremental acquisition strategy to transition various developmental technology efforts (Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS), and DoD technology efforts) to meet high priority Warfighter capability gaps.  DFoS will support Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAPs) and Programs of Record by guiding S&amp;T efforts and transitioning mature technologies to meet program requirements.

DFoS CONTAMINATION INDICATOR DECONTAMINATION ASSURANCE SYSTEM (DFoS CIDAS)

The CIDAS program will follow an evolutionary acquisition strategy in consonance with the Joint Requirements Office (JRO)/User developed capability documents.  Following MS A, collaborated with JSTO/DTRA efforts, including the Hazard Mitigation, Materiel and Equipment Restoration (HaMMER) Advanced Technology Development Operational Demonstration and Extended User Evaluations, and conducted technology demonstrations on candidate indicator and applicator technologies to mitigate risk and identify affordable mature technologies that meet requirements.  Determined need for and initiated Government designed large scale applicator to meet specific User requirements.  Following MS B, use full and open competition to award a performance based contract with options for LRIP and FRP for indicator and small and mid scale applicator systems.  Integrate and test contractor and Government designs in DT and operational testing.

DFoS GENERAL PURPOSE DECONTAMINANT (DFoS GPD)

Due to the maturity levels of the systems entering the Technology Development (TD) phase, the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) issued an Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) which approved GPD to by-pass Milestone (MS) B and enter directly to MS C Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP).  During the TD Phase (which includes CP I, CP II), the GPD Program employed a Competitive Prototyping (CP) effort to facilitate the evaluation of Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) technologies releasing an Request for Proposal (RFP) as a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial and Non-Developmental Items (NDI), utilizing full and open competition.  As the GPD program enters the final phase of Technology Development (Developmental Test), the program will continue to follow an evolutionary acquisition strategy.  The production contract in support of MS C is a single award for LRIP with four option years for FRP, using Full and Open Competition in accordance with FAR Subpart 6.1. This strategy ensures that all prospective sources, with the capability of meeting the program requirements, have the opportunity to participate.

DFoS JOINT SENSITIVE EQUIPMENT WIPE (DFoS JSEW)

Due to the maturity levels of the systems entering the Technology Development (TD) phase, the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) issued an Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) which approved JSEW to pursue a Milestone (MS) A to MS C Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) acquisition strategy.  During the TD Phase (which includes CP I, CP II), the JSEW Program employed a Competitive Prototyping (CP) effort to facilitate the evaluation of Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) technologies releasing an Request for Proposal (RFP) as a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial and Non-Developmental Items (NDI), utilizing full and open competition.  As the JSEW program enters the final phase of Technology Development (Developmental Test), the program will continue to follow an evolutionary acquisition strategy.  The JSEW acquisition strategy to support upcoming JSEW contracting efforts for DT, LRIP, and FRP is a single contract award for DT, with options for LRIP and FRP, using Full and Open Competition in accordance with FAR Subpart 6.1.  This strategy ensures that all prospective sources, with the capability of meeting the contract requirements, have the opportunity to participate.

JOINT BIOLOGICAL AGENT DECONTAMINATION SYSTEM (JBAD)

The JBAD System program will leverage the Joint Biological Agent Decontamination System Joint Capability Technology Demonstration to mature and deliver incremental capabilities to meet Air Mobility Command and US Transportation Command needs for interior and exterior decontamination of aircraft against biological agents.  The JBAD will employ full and open competition and competitive prototyping during the Engineering Manufacturing and Development (EMD) phase.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project provides for Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P).  Experimentation and demonstration will be used in this phase to reduce risk and inform supporting materiel solutions, CONOPS and TTPs.

The Joint Service General Purpose Mask (JSGPM) Advanced Respiratory Protection Initiative (ARPI) will address improved mask protection, filter protection against Toxic Industrial Chemicals (TIC)/Toxic Industrial Materials (TIM) and improved profile and breathing resistance; and wearability compatibility/integration.  This will be accomplished through class-based analysis, Filtration Advanced Screening Test (FAST), desorption study, and advanced CBRN filtration efforts.  Several technologies are being pursued by the Joint Science and Technology Office (JSTO), with two specific technologies being pursued in the FY14-16 timeframe.  The JSGPM ARPI effort will investigate alternative designs and modifications to Zirconium hydroxide, Zinc, Argentum (Silver), Triethylene di-amine (TEDA)) (ZZAT) to further increase filtration of TICs and Chemical Warfare Agents (CWA).  ZZAT is a zirconium hydroxide based filtration media that can potentially be layered with carbon.  The first technology, known as Cobalt-Zinc ZZAT (CoZZAT), uses a layered bed of carbon concept to improve TIC and CWA protection capabilities, while the second technology known as Metal Organic Framework (MOF), is an engineered media that is a porous crystalline compound made up of metal ions and organic bridging molecules (ligands) for targeted removal of chemicals.  The JSGPM APRI effort will also investigate various applications of nanofiber particulate media.

The Uniform Integrated Protection Ensemble (UIPE) is a Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear (CBRN) protective system offering the capability to select a tailored material solution based on the expected threat level commensurate with operational mission requirements.  Where appropriate, a family of systems approach that meets the scope of UIPE individual protection capability needs will be utilized.  The objective of UIPE is to fully integrate CBRN and toxic industrial material (TIM) protections into an ensemble, identical in fit and form to the combat uniform (including mask - helmet integration and protective boots and gloves), thus negating the need for separate protective ensemble components.  This integrated protection approach will result in increased warfighter operational performance in a CBRN environment.  The UIPE program will develop, integrate, test, procure and field incremental capability solutions that are modular in function and offer improvements in form and fit over current systems; the program will explore trade-space in areas such as protection level, heat stress, durability, antimicrobial properties, flame resistance, launderability, self-detoxification, and protection time in order to provide capabilities that afford maximum utility to the warfighter.  Where appropriate modeling and simulation tools will be used to lower UIPE program risks, reduce costs, and ensure a high confidence in selected technologies.  UIPE is aimed specifically at providing enhanced individual protection capabilities to the warfighter through reduction of physiological and psychological effects associated with CBRN protective garment thermal burden, weight, and bulk.  The UIPE program will consider modernization in order to ensure that the warfighter retains access to state of the art capability to support future operational mission requirements.

The UIPE Increment 2 (UIPE 2) will build upon and enhance the capabilities attained in UIPE 1.  UIPE 2 will provide reduced thermal burden and weight compared to current protective ensembles.  UIPE 2 will develop, integrate, test, procure, and field incremental capability solutions that are modular in function and offer improvements over current systems.  The program will explore trade-space in areas such as protection level, heat stress, durability, antimicrobial properties, flame resistance, launderability, self-detoxification, and protection time in order to provide capabilities that afford maximum utility to the Warfighter.  Where appropriate, modeling and simulation tools will be used to lower UIPE 2 program risks, reduce costs, and ensure a high confidence in selected technologies.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>JS GENERAL PURPOSE MASK (JSGPM)

The JSGPM Advanced Respiratory Protection Initiative (ARPI) effort is using the M61 filter contracts awarded to 3M and Avon to develop improved filters for the JSGPM.  There is a continual technology refreshment CLIN that allows for filter development tasks to be awarded under this contract.  The tasks can be competed between the two awardees or award to both to ensure competition on future spares and delivery orders.  As filter technologies transition from the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) and Joint Science and Technology Office (JSTO), the technologies will be matured from system/subsystem prototyping demonstration technologies at Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 to actual system "mission proven" through successful mission operations in a mission environment at TRL 9.  There are multiple technologies being explored by DTRA, thus, this is a continual product improvement effort to enhance filtration.  The JSGPM ARPI effort will investigate alternative designs and modifications to ZZAT (Zirconium hydroxide, Zinc, Argentum (Silver), Triethylene di-amine (TEDA)) to further increase filtration of TICs and Chemical Warfare Agents (CWA).  ZZAT is a zirconium hydroxide based filtration media that can potentially be layered with carbon.  The first technology, known as Cobalt-Zinc ZZAT (CoZZAT), uses a layered bed of carbon concept to improve TIC and CWA protection capabilities, while the second technology known as Metal Organic Framework (MOF), is an engineered media that is a porous crystalline compound made up of metal ions and organic bridging molecules (ligands) for targeted removal of chemicals.

CBRN UNIFORM INTEGRATED PROTECTION ENSEMBLE (UIPE)

The UIPE 2 supports an evolutionary acquisition strategy with the intent of protecting the Warfighter from operationally relevant and non-traditional chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN)/toxic industrial hazards during Joint Force operations.  UIPE 2 will leverage the approved UIPE CBRN initial capabilities document (ICD) to build on and enhance capabilities attained in UIPE 1 by continuing to provide integrated individual protective equipment that enables the Warfighter to operate in a contaminated environment with no or minimal degradation to performance.  UIPE 2 will perform trade space analysis by releasing a Request for Information for materials and closures.  This analysis will not only provide a baseline assessment but will feed the requirements development process.  The final UIPE 2 garment design will be government owned in order to control interfaces and insert future technologies.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project provides for Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P).  Experimentation and demonstration will be used in this phase to reduce risk and inform supporting materiel solutions, CONOPS and TTPs.

Efforts included in this project are: (1) Joint Effects Model (JEM); (2) the Joint Warning and Reporting Network (JWARN); (3) the Biosurveillance Portal (BSP) and (4) Software Support Activity (SSA).  

The Joint Effects Model (JEM) is a web-based software application that supplies the Department of Defense (DoD) with the one and only accredited tool to effectively model and simulate the effects of Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) weapon strikes and incidents.  JEM is capable of providing all Warfighters with the ability to accurately model and predict the time-phased impact of CBRN and Toxic Industrial Chemical/Material (TIC/TIM) events and effects.  JEM supports planning to mitigate the effects of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) and to provide rapid estimates of hazards and effects into the Common Operational Picture (COP).

Follow-on increments of JEM will refine and display hazard areas in near real time to reflect inputs such as meteorological, oceanographic, or actual agent concentration data.  JEM will automatically receive input data from the Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (C4I) system on which it resides such as historical climatology, local observations, weather forecasts, natural environmental threats (i.e.: pandemic influenza, etc.), terrain data, intelligence information, or population data.  Increment 2 will allow manual user input for factors such as concentrations of chemical warfare agents or actual exposure measurements and forecast sheltering stay-times and provide for modeling sheltering time through user-defined scenarios.

The Joint Warning and Reporting Network (JWARN) is an accredited Department of Defense (DOD) warning and reporting system that provides a standardized warning and reporting capability for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) and Toxic Industrial Materials (TIM) incidents.  

JWARN supports the Joint Force Commander (JFC) by improving force protection capabilities for units operating in chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear environments.  JWARN provides a digital display of CBRN 1-6 reports on the Common Operational Picture, displayed through Service provided C4I systems resident at all echelons of command.  JWARN will be operated by CBRN and non-CBRN trained personnel operating in the operations center at various command nodes.  This provides commanders with situational awareness to inform decision making for force protection criteria, unmasking operations, decontamination, and continuity of operations in a contaminated environment.  Future sensor configurations will forward sensor inputs directly to JWARN via established communication lanes, removing the man-in-the-loop requirement with the current system configuration.  JWARN will be information system classification agnostic and must be able to operate on
unclassified, secret, top secret, and mission partner IT Systems without increasing system operator requirement, i.e.: sensor to COP via one communication loop.  As a result, sensors will then be able to communicate with JWARN on the same network, regardless of classification.

The Biosurveillance Portal (BSP) is a new start in FY16.  BSP is a web-based enterprise environment that will facilitate collaboration, communication, and information sharing in support of the detection, management, and mitigation of man-made and naturally occurring biological events.  BSP bridges the communication gaps in the biosurveillance domain to provide a central access point for biosurveillance information and situational awareness for DoD, interagency and allied partners supporting the early identification and response to biological events.

BSP provides an integrated suite of web-based components designed to support public health officers, environmental officers, clinicians, physicians, and CBRN personnel as they maintain their situational awareness of local, regional, and global biological threats to the force.  BSP does not duplicate existing DoD capabilities, but rather leverages existing tools and technologies to provide users across multiple organizations and disciplines with a centralized "one-stop shop" for all of their biosurveillance resources. 

As software-intensive systems, JEM, JWARN, and BSP have no separately identifiable unit production components.  JEM and JWARN are designated as ACAT III programs and unit cost calculations including Program Acquisition Unit Cost/Average Procurement Unit Cost (PAUC/APUC) and Operations and Sustainment (O&amp;S) average annual per unit costs are not applicable.  Expect BSP to be similarly designated.

The Software Support Activity (SSA) is a Chem-Bio Defense user developmental support and service organization to facilitate net-centric interoperability of systems in acquisition for the Warfighter.  The SSA provides the CBRN Warfighter with Joint Service solutions for Integrated Architectures, Data Management/Modeling, Information Assurance (IA), Interoperability Certifications, Verification, Validation and Accreditation (VV&amp;A) to support interoperable and integrated net-centric, service-oriented solutions for CBRN systems.  The SSA emphasizes development of reference implementations to guide Government and industry system and software developers to ensure that their products meet common interoperability standards.  The latest technologies/products include the definition of a Common CBRN Sensor Integration Standard (CCSI) and the CBRN Data Model.  These technologies and direct enablers for the development of CBRN integrated sensor networks and the dissemination of CBRN information across all users.  The SSA directly supports Chemical and Biological Defense Program (CBDP) initiatives by providing common service oriented architectures and frameworks for the collection and dissemination of Bio-Surveillance and other critical CBRN information.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>JOINT EFFECTS MODEL (JEM)

JEM Increment 2 acquisition will utilize the JROC's "IT Box" construct for software development.  The intent is to provide the next generation of capability with current and future technologies, as stated in the IS ICD, in less time and fielding products to the service more frequently than an incremental delivery approach.

As part of this strategy, JEM program office developed and issued a competitive prototyping contract in April 2013 where two offerers were given the same Technical Data Package (TDP), performance Work Statement (PWS), and software requirements and were tasked to deliver a JEM prototype that implements the CCMI architecture.  This competitive prototyping strategy
was successful and a single JEM integrator, General Dynamics Information Technology (GDIT), was selected as the prime development contract in December 2013. 

The current contractor for JEM 2.0 will provide all capabilities defined in the Requirement Definition Package 1 (RDP-1) document produced by the Joint Requirements Office (JRO).  The JRO will release RDPs-2, 3, and 4 over the next three years prior to contract completion.  It is anticipated when the contract is re-competed in FY18 that there will be four of five capability drops not yet developed under RDP-2 and two of five under RDP-3.  The follow-on contract in FY18 will be responsible for developing the remaining capabilities under the JEM 2.0 contract.  The JEM follow-on contract will utilize full and open competition and will be referred to as the JEM development, modernization and sustainment contract.

The JEM IS ICD describes the notional implementation plan for fielding of future JEM capabilities among four separate JEM Requirement Definition Packages (RDPs).  RDP-1 contains the baseline capabilities for software and was released in June of 2014.  RDP-2 will be released after the completion of RDP-1.  This RDP will incorporate emerging capabilities that the Joint Science and Technology Office determines has reached a sufficient enough maturity for incorporation into JEM, such as ability to model new agents.  Requirements to integrate baseline capabilities into a version that can be fielded on service C2 systems will be released in RDP-3.  RDP-3 will be released following RDP-1 but prior to RDP-2, to rapidly allow baseline capabilities to be incorporated into C2 systems.  RDP-4 is a notional package that would allow the Science and Technology community a venue to use the JEM program to develop a version of the product for S&amp;T use.  Capabilities that are only required for the Science and Technology community and not for operational users would be implemented in RDP-4.  Capabilities in RDP-4 would not be required to go to Operational Test, as they would not be fielded to operational users. 

RDP 1 - Baseline Capabilities: There are 5 planned Capability Drops (CD) within RDP 1.
RDP 2 - Emerging Capabilities: There are 5 planned Capability Drops (CD) within RDP 2.
RDP 3 - C2 Integration: There are 8 planned Capability Drops (CD) within RDP 3 tied to all the various Strategic and Service C2 Systems
RDP 4 - Analytical Support: There are 2 planned Capability Drops (CD) within RDP 4.

After an over-arching MS B with the MDA, each RDP will have an associated Build Decision.  Each CD will have an associated fielding decision.

JOINT WARNING &amp; REPORTING NETWORK (JWARN)

JWARN Increment 2 utilizes the JROC's "IT Box" construct for software requirements management and development.  The intent is to provide the next generation of capability with current and future technologies, as stated in the IS ICD, in less time and away from an incremental delivery approach.  This effort is being executed under a Cost-Plus-Award Term Incentive structure to gain maximum benefit to the Government in maintaining the fielded baseline and future software capability development and was awarded under a full and open competition Request for Proposal (RFP).  The JWARN Program will procure a Sensor Connectivity Capability (SCC) (hardware materiel solution) in order to facilitate the transfer of CBRN sensor information from legacy CBRN sensors to DoD networks.  This solution will be external to the CBRN Sensors and Service-identified network transmission device(s).

BIOSURVEILLANCE PORTAL (BSP)

BSP will utilize the JROC's "IT Box" construct for program requirements, management, and development.  The intent is to provide the next generation of capability with current and future technologies in less time and fielding products to the DoD utilizing an incremental delivery approach.  IT Box enables programs to tailor the incrementally fielded software program model in the DODI 5000.02 Interim to conduct multiple, more frequent fielding events in lieu of a single fielding event.

SOFTWARE SUPPORT ACTIVITY (SSA)

The SSA provides enterprise-wide services and coordination across all CBDP programs that contain data or software, or are capable of linking to the Global Information Grid (GIG).  The SSA facilitates interoperability, integration, and supportability of existing and developing IT and National Security Systems (NSS).  Phase 1a identifies CBDP programs that deal with data or software, and have an IT component.  This will be followed by coordination to facilitate the concepts of interoperability, integration and supportability of enterprise-wide services.  Next follows work with user communities to develop and demonstrate enterprise-wide common architectures, products and services.  Phase 2 will support the application of the enterprise-wide architectures, products and services into the programs, with verification of compliance with the defined products and services.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) Project supports: 

The Medical Countermeasure Test and Evaluation (MCM T&amp;E) Capability performs T&amp;E and provides the essential data packages to support US Food and Drug Administration approval of leading biodefense medical countermeasure candidates to protect the Warfighter and the Nation.  This capability provides dedicated capacity for DoD to conduct biosafety level-4 (BSL-4) Good Laboratory Practice (cGLP) T&amp;E studies to meet programmatic needs following all applicable regulatory, biosurety, and safety standards.

Biosurveillance (BSV) actively gathers, analyzes, and interprets collected information that includes biosphere data that relate to disease activity and threats to human or animal health in order to achieve early warning of health threats, early detection of health events, and overall situational awareness of disease activity.  BSV will align the biosurveillance efforts across DoD and national strategies.  BSV will scope and influence BSV capabilities as products to meet Warfighter requirements through innovative management of key BSV initiatives.  BSV requirements address medical and physical CBRN mission needs spanned in over 11 requirements documents and through Combatant Commander (COCOM) identified needs.  BSV funds will support Joint US Forces Korea (USFK) Portal and Integrated Threat recognition (JUPITR) ATD/BSV ATD which will find, demonstrate, transition, and transfer the best operational concepts and technology solutions in support of a holistic approach to countering biological threats from the laboratory to operational use and theater confirmation of a Biological Event.  JUPITR ATD will consist of four legs; Early Warning (EW), Biological Identification Capabilities Sets (BICS), Assessment of Environmental Detectors (AED), and Biosurveillance Portal (BSP).  The JUPITR ATD will provide the USFK with a holistic biosurveillance capability to provide early warning, detection, collection, identification, and theater confirmation of a Biological event.  The JUPITR ATD consists of filling capability gaps through information sharing and communication systems and detection/diagnostic systems for the USFK.  Outputs will focus on proving component, CONOPS, and subsystem transition into programs of record (PORs) and/or integration into existing PORs.  Excursion for whole system live agent test (WSLAT) of AED units will support JPM NBC CA Mission for Point Biological Detection.  The Biosurveillance (BSV) program will transfer from the Medical Countermeasures (MB) Project to the Contamination Avoidance (CA) Project effective FY 2016.

The Countermeasures for Multi-Drug Resistance-Bacterial (CMDR-B) program develops medical countermeasures (MCMs) for Service members for protection against multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria, including Biological Warfare Agents (BWAs) and organisms that are genetically modified to be MDR.  The resulting products(s) will be US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved to prevent or minimize effects of MDR bacterial exposures.  Leveraging collaborative Department of Defense (DoD), United States Government, and industry efforts will reduce program risk, lower program cost, and accelerate the delivery of therapeutics to the Warfighter.  The program has established a translational team with the Joint Science and Technology Office for animal model work and pipeline candidates that could transition to CMDR-B for Advanced Development.

The Emerging Infectious Diseases Therapeutics (EID Tx) program is developing and will deliver a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved, broad-spectrum medical countermeasure to the Warfighter for protection against naturally occurring or biologically engineered viruses.  EID Tx is pursuing influenza indication as the first step in the development of a broad spectrum antiviral drug due to a clear and established FDA regulatory approval pathway.  The drug in development is highly efficacious against multiple influenza viruses, including the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus, H5N1 avian influenza virus, the most recently identified H7N9 virus from the outbreak in China, and drug resistant strains of influenza viruses.  This drug has also demonstrated efficacy against other viruses of concern to the DoD's biodefense program.  FDA approval for an influenza treatment is anticipated following completion of the SDD phase.  Ongoing EID Tx drug development will be leveraged to demonstrate additional broad-spectrum MCM's against naturally occurring and/or engineered biowarfare threats.  To meet the mission need of "one drug, many bugs" EID Tx is testing product efficacy on BWA threats.  This will allow the military to leverage a product that will be FDA approved for influenza against other viruses. 


The Hemorrhagic Fever Virus (HFV) MCS Acquisition Program develops medical countermeasures (MCMs), using high threat, extremely lethal Biological Warfare Agents (BWAs) of the Filoviridae family agents (Ebola) as a model system.  Medical countermeasures will be advanced through the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensure/approval via the FDA 'Animal Rule', which allows for the demonstration of efficacy in relevant animal model(s) when human testing is not ethically feasible.  HFV will also conduct animal model development and refinement as needed to support the pivotal animal efficacy testing required under the FDA 'Animal Rule'.  Completion of Phase I trials, animal model development, and manufacturing scale up are the focus of the ACD&amp;P phase.  FDA approval for Filovirus therapeutics are expected following completion of the SDD phase.  

The NGDS is an evolutionary acquisition family of systems to provide increments of capability over time across many echelons of the Combat Health Support System.  The mission of the NGDS is to provide Chemical, Biological and Radiological (CBR) threat and infectious disease identification and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared diagnostics to inform individual patient treatment as defined in the approved NGDS Capabilities Development Document (CDD) and CBR situational awareness and disease surveillance as defined in the Common Analytical Laboratory (CALS) CDD.  NGDS Increment 1 (NGDS Inc 1) will significantly improve diagnostic capability for deployable combat health support units (Role 3) while also improving operational suitability and affordability by developing FDA cleared biological warfare agent (BWA) and infectious disease in vitro diagnostic (IVD) assays on existing commercial diagnostic device with a well established FDA regulatory history and pipeline of commercial non-BWA infectious disease diagnostic tests.  The NGDS Inc 1 program has a streamlined MS A to MS C - Limited Deployment acquisition strategy.  BA4 funds support the NGDS Increment 1 program through the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction phase to complete competitive prototyping activities, initiate development of six BWA IVDs (Anthrax, Ebola, Marburg, Plague, Tularemia and Q-Fever), initiate the development of BWA environmental surveillance assays, multiservice operational test assessment, and Urgent Material Release of systems and Ebola emergency use diagnostic test in support of the DoD's Ebola Response and Preparedness initiative under Title X.  NGDS Increment 2 will complement NGDS Increment 1 by developing diagnostics biological pathogens and toxins, and addressing diagnostics for chemical and radiological exposures, and to provide capability to lower echelons of care.  NGDS Increment 2 will also conduct collaborative work with the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency to accelerate development of a ruggedized Ebola detection and diagnostic system for use in austere environments in support of the DoD's Ebola Response and Preparedness initiative under Title X.

The Department of Defense (DoD) funds the technology development phase for vaccines that are directed against validated biological warfare (BW) weapons to include bacteria, viruses, and toxins of biological origin.  Effective medical countermeasures to negate the threat of these biological warfare (BW) agents are urgently needed.  Vaccines have been identified as the most efficient countermeasure against the validated threat of BW weapons.  The multiple Trivalent Filovirus Vaccine (VAC FILO) Program will offer protection against the threat of Ebola and Marburg viruses.  The current budget supports development and acceleration of two multiple candidates, in response to the Ebola outbreak, to provide an interim fielding capability, through the Technology Development Phase.  The DoD anticipates that the Food Drug Administration (FDA) will approve this vaccine using the 'Animal Rule', which allows for the demonstration of efficacy on relevant animal model(s).  During this phase a scalable manufacturing process is developed.  This process will be used to develop current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) lots suitable for a Phase 1 clinical trial.  In addition, animal safety and efficacy studies will be conducted to support an Investigational New Drug (IND) submission to the FDA.  These efforts will support a Milestone B decision and entry into the Engineering, Manufacturing, and Development (EMD) phase.  The DoD is the Public Health Emergency Countermeasures lead for the advanced development of the Filovirus Vaccine.

The Ricin toxin is a validated bioweapon threat due to its availability and efficiency of production.  The program supports one DoD vaccine candidate including manufacturing cGMP lots; and the continuation of animal model and assay development studies.  These efforts also include a Phase 1b clinical trial, regulatory integration, and a manufacturing technology transfer to the ADM capability.  The DoD is the Public Health Emergency Countermeasures lead for the advanced development of the Ricin Vaccine.

The Western, Eastern, and Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis (VAC WEVEE) Vaccine program initiated competitive candidates in FY13 to reduce program risk, and is developing two candidates through the Technology Development Phase.  The efforts to be conducted during this period include: develop pilot scale manufacturing processes and manufacture of cGMP lots to support nonclinical and clinical studies; develop vaccine formulation that meets the logistical requirements of the DoD; conduct non-clinical GLP safety studies; submit Investigational New Drug (IND) applications; and conduct Phase 1 clinical human safety studies.  The DoD anticipates that the FDA will approve these products using the 'Animal Rule', which allows for the demonstration of efficacy in relevant animal model(s).  These efforts will support a Milestone B decision and entry into the EMD phase.  The DoD is the Public Health Emergency Countermeasures lead for the advanced development of the WEVEE Vaccine.

FY 2015 funding includes $89.1 million of base funding and $17.3 million of Ebola emergency funding.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Funds support GLP toxicology studies (Battelle); Nonhuman primate efficacy studies (USAMRIID); Immunological testing of Phase 1 samples (Battelle/USAMRIID); qualification of Human ELISA (Battelle).  These efforts are needed to support the Phase II/III clinical trials and interim fielding capability of this candidate in FY15.  Contracts and work plans are in place.  This vaccine candidate will only address EBOLA not the core trivalent effort, however, data from these studies will support development and acceleration of the trivalent vaccine.  The ELISA efforts are critical to establishing a standardized assay for measuring the immune response across multiple vaccine platforms.  Collection of safety and efficacy data in humans has the potential to decrease FDA licensure requirements versus full licensure under the animal rule.</r2:Text>

The MCM T&amp;E Capability is being implemented in three phases.  Phase 1 (completed in FY13) established support contracts, agreements, and developed a capability implementation plan to utilize and maintain the existing and planned new US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) facility and staff.  Phase 2 executes the implementation plan, bringing the facility, equipment, personnel, and technical and business processes into a state of readiness to conduct BSL-4 studies under full GLP compliance.  In FY14, the capability established a new Program Management Office and organizational structure, implemented information technology tools for secure management of data, trained and integrated GLP-qualified staff, and validated supporting technology for conduct of T&amp;E studies.

After attaining a scheduled Initial Operational Capability (IOC) at the end of FY14 and moving into Phase 3, the focus of FY15 will be on conducting secondary capability assessments and refinements, broadening and adapting contract support plans to meet increased customer demand, updating the Life-Cycle Sustainment Plan, and conducting multiple T&amp;E studies.  MCM T&amp;E sustainment costs during Phase 2 and beyond will be offset by costs from specific MCM development programs where possible.  The period of FY16 to FY19 will continue secondary capability assessments and refinements and will focus on transition of the capability to the new USAMRIID facility, after which Full Operational Capability (FOC) will be reached.

BIOSURVEILLANCE (BSV)

BSV is a set of capabilities that acquire, integrate, and analyze medical, environmental, and incident management data using existing and next generation systems, medical and non-medical sample collection tools and identifiers/diagnostics; and transition hardware/software tools and devices as residuals from the Biosurveillance Joint United States Force Korea (USFK) Portal and Integrated Threat Recognition (JUPITR) Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD).  Lessons learned from the ATD will be transitioned to the programs of record associated with the CBDP (such as NGDS, TDS &amp; CALS).  The acquisition strategy will address the materiel solutions identified out of the multiple Biosurveillance (BSV) related Analysis of Alternatives (AoA's).

COUNTERMEASURES FOR DRUG RESISTANT BACTERIA (CMDR-B)

The CMDR-B program develops MCMs for MDR (multi-drug resistant) bacteria, including BWAs and organisms that are genetically modified to be MDR.  The resulting product(s) will be US FDA-approved to prevent or minimize effects of MDR bacterial exposures.  CMDR-B will follow an integrated acquisition and regulatory pathway to achieve FDA approval for drug candidates.  The CMDR-B Program intends to fund multiple candidates to address competitive prototyping and mitigate drug development risk.  In FY13, a Market Survey and RFI were completed assessing current anti-bacterial countermeasure technologies.  Results confirmed technologies exist that are of sufficient maturity to enter advanced development.  CMDR-B is establishing collaborative relationships with DoD, other USG entities and international partners to reduce program risk, lower program cost, and accelerate delivery of MCMs to the Warfighter.  Milestone A is anticipated in FY15.

EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES - THERAPUTIC (EID TX)

The goal of the EID Tx program is to develop a safe and effective MCM against biothreats of interest to the DoD.  The first step of the acquisition strategy is to develop an MCM for influenza due to a clear and established FDA regulatory approval pathway.  The Phase 2 clinical trial is complete, demonstrating both safety and efficacy in humans.  Program was authorized by FDA to move forward at End of Phase 2 meeting on 3 SEP 13.  Phase 3 clinical trials for EID Tx against influenza began during 1QFY14.  Following successful FDA approval of the drug against influenza in 3QFY16, EID Tx will utilize an incremental approach to label extensions of this broad spectrum therapeutic.  The development strategy for additional label extensions of the antiviral drug consists of detailed characterization of antiviral activities of the broad-spectrum compound against multiple virus families using cell-based and animal model systems.  Using the results of the cell-based assays efficacy assessment of the drug against high-priority viruses of biodefense concern will be performed using small animal studies.  The results of the proof of concept studies will determine the best candidate to move forward for the Label Extension (LE) starting in FY15.

HEMORRHAGIC FEVER VIRUS (HFV)

The acquisition strategy uses an evaluation of a drug candidate against the lethal Ebola Zaire viruses.  Following a successful Milestone B and entry into SDD phase, the program will conduct expanded human clinical safety studies, definitive animal efficacy, and toxicology studies, required for FDA approval.  The performer will submit a New Drug Application for the Ebola Zaire therapeutic during the SDD Phase.  During the Production and Deployment phase, full rate manufacturing and stockpile production will be pursued.  If the FDA mandates post-marketing surveillance studies, they will be conducted during Production and Deployment.

NEXT GENERATION DIAGNOSTICS SYSTEM (NGDS)

The term "Role" is used to describe the stratification of the four tiers in which medical support is organized, on a progressive basis, to conduct treatment, evaluation, resupply, and functions essential to the maintenance of the health of the force.  Role 3 support is normally provided at Division or Service equivalent level and includes specialist laboratory resources.  The NGDS Inc 1 program has a streamlined MS A to MS C - Limited Deployment acquisition strategy.  The NGDS Inc 1 is intended to replace the legacy Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS) beginning in FY17.  NGDS Increment 2 (NGDS Inc 2) will complement NGDS Inc 1 by developing diagnostic capabilities for biological pathogens and toxins and address diagnostics for chemical and radiological exposures, and to provide capability to lower echelons of care.

NGDS Increment 2 will conduct technology development FY14-FY16 prior to MS B.  The acquisition strategy and capability to be developed will be informed by the results of the Analysis of Alternatives to be completed 4QFY14.  NGDS Increment 2 is intended to be complementary to NGDS Increment 1 to expand the breadth and depth of diagnostics to CBR threats, pre-symptomatic diagnostics, and far forward echelons of care.

MB7 funds will support development, testing, and FDA approval of additional assays after system fielding.

FILOVIRUS (VAC FILO)

The Government will develop multiple Filovirus vaccine candidates through a Phase 1 clinical trial.  In response to the Ebola outbreak, efforts have been accelerated to provide an interim fielding capability.  The Government will serve as the integrator for the Technology Development Phase by managing and coordinating the various vaccine development contracts.  At MS B, the best prototype will be selected through a full and open competition to transition to the Engineering &amp; Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase with delivery of a FDA licensed Filovirus Vaccine.  The development contracts will be a mix of Cost Plus and Firm Fixed Price.  In addition, the Program Office will partner with DoD agencies and laboratories to include U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases.  This DoD program is the Public Health Emergency Countermeasures lead for the advanced development of this vaccine, and is leveraging expertise across the Federal and International sectors to ensure programmatic success.

RICIN VACCINE (VAC RIC)

A ricin vaccine will protect against exposure to the ricin toxin, an identified BW threat.  The Government will serve as the integrator during this phase by managing and coordinating the various vaccine development efforts.  Additionally, the Program Office will partner with DoD agencies and laboratories to include U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases.  FY14 funding will allow the completion of essential efforts.  These efforts include manufacturing of cGMP lots, animal model efficacy studies, and assay development.  These efforts also include a Phase Ib Clinical Trial to measure the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine in humans.  FY14 funds support the Phase 1b clinical study through FY15.  FY16 funding will fund the initiation of the manufacturing technology transfer to the ADM capability.

WESTERN EASTERN VENEZUELAN EQUINE ENCEPH VACCINE (VAC WEVEE)

The WEVEE acquisition strategy uses a parallel evaluation of two vaccine candidates through a Phase 1 clinical trial to achieve competitive prototyping in the Technology Development phase.  The lead candidate is more mature than the second candidate.  Several potential decision points will be used to assess the candidates for possible down select.  The schedule is based on a down select to prototype one.  The Government will serve as the integrator during this phase by managing and coordinating the various vaccine development efforts.  At MS B, the best prototype will be selected through a full and open competition to transition to the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase, with delivery of a FDA-licensed WEVEE vaccine.  The development efforts will be a Cost Plus and Firm Fixed Price CLINs.  Additionally, the Program Office will partner Health and Human Services/National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases (HHS/NIAID), DoD agencies, and laboratories to include U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USMRIID).  This DoD program is the Public Health Emergency Countermeasures lead for the advanced development of this vaccine and is leveraging expertise across the Federal and International sectors to ensure programmatic success.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project provides for the development of medical materiel and other medical equipment items necessary for the Technology Development phase of the acquisition life cycle for the advanced development of medical countermeasures (MCMs) for chemical warfare agents including diagnostic equipment, prophylactic, pre-treatment, and therapeutic drugs, and individual/casualty decontamination compounds.  A family-of-systems approach for medical defense against chemical warfare agents is required to provide protection, to sustain performance in a chemical environment, and to provide for self-aid/buddy-aid and medical treatment of chemical casualties.  Fielding of prophylactic, pre-treatment, and therapeutic drugs and medical devices requires Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval.  Given the family-of-systems approach for development of chemical MCMs for the treatment of nerve agent intoxication, multiple long-term studies are required to obtain FDA approval to deliver products that effectively integrate with current and projected therapeutic regimens.  Efficacy testing of most candidate drugs against chemical warfare agents cannot be conducted in humans; therefore, animal surrogate models must be developed and employed.  The program currently funds: Improved Nerve Agent Treatment System (INATS) an enhanced nerve agent treatment regimen consisting of an improved oxime to replace the current fielded oxime 2-pralidoxime chloride (2-PAM), product formulation enhancements to increase survival, and expanded pretreatment indications for the use of pyridostigmine bromide (PB), the active component of Soman Nerve Agent Pretreatment Pyridostigmine (SNAPP).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The Improved Nerve Agent Treatment System (INATS) advanced development provides an enhanced capability treatment regimen offering greater protection over a broader spectrum of toxic nerve agent threats.  Components of the development include (1) a new and improved oxime (replacing 2-pralidoxime chloride (2-PAM)) to provide protection across current and emerging threats, (2) expanded nerve agent indications for a fielded, single indication, pyridostigmine bromide (PB) product, and (3) insertion of a centrally-acting (CA) anticholinergic agent to the treatment regimen to increase survivability and decrease morbidity.  The INATS treatment regimen both improves the performance of, and eventually replaces the Antidote Treatment Nerve Agent Auto-injector (ATNAA), while expanding warfighter pretreatment options. 

INATS' evolutionary Acquisition Strategy, recently expanded by the Joint Program Executive Office, Chemical and Biological Defense (JPEO-CBD) to (1) align all Department of Defense nerve agent therapeutics under it, and to (2) insert a centrally-acting (CA) anticholinergic agent, employs an incremental approach to provide independent, and more rapid deliveries of oxime, expanded PB indications, and CA capabilities than in a combined treatment regimen delivery.  To accomplish this, separate Milestone B and C reviews for the oxime and CA developments, and decision reviews for PB expansion beyond the combined-development Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TM&amp;RR) Phase will be conducted.  In the TMRR phase, close collaborations will occur between the Joint Program Manager - Medical Countermeasure Systems (JPM-MCS)), and the science/ technology, and user communities to assess technical viability, capability delivery options, and to refine operational concepts; the Government will be the systems integrator overseeing the conduct of oxime and centrally acting formulation development efforts, nonclinical toxicology and efficacy studies, clinical safety studies, and efficacy studies addressing the PB indication.  In the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase for the oxime and CA each capability, the Government will continue as system integrator with integration support from commercial partners to ensure that INATS development and manufacture is in accordance with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations and guidelines; the commercial integration partner(s) will perform a Phase 2 human clinical safety study, nonclinical toxicology studies and definitive animal efficacy studies; the system integrator will also oversee the manufacture of improved oxime and CA formulations and delivery system that is stable under operationally relevant temperatures.  The system integrator will submit a New Drug Application and seek FDA approval for the INATS product.  In the Production and Deployment (P&amp;D) Phase, the system integrator, with a commercial partner, will pursue full-rate and stockpile production and will conduct any FDA mandated post-marketing surveillance studies; the system integrator will transfer contracting/logistical responsibilities to the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) while remaining to monitor program performance through disposal as the life-cycle manager.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

TESS test infrastructure products are aligned in four groups to include: (1) Sense Laboratory (Chemical); (2) Sense Laboratory (Biological); (3) Individual Protection, Collective Protection and Decontamination (Shield and Sustain); and (4) Sense (Field).  Additionally, TESS supports the analysis of the infrastructure investment opportunities, system engineering processes and business case analyses.

(1) Sense Laboratory (Chemical): The products for this area is the Non-Traditional Agent Defense Test System (NTADTS) and improvements to the Dynamic Test Chamber (DTC).  The NTADTS provides a new capability to conduct chemical defense testing against current and emerging threat agents.  The NTADTS supports testing of decontamination, collective protection, individual protection, and contamination avoidance products.  The DTC provides a new capability for testing chemical point detection systems against chemical warfare agents in various environmental conditions.  The CBD acquisition programs supported are Dismounted Reconnaissance Sets Kits and Outfits (DR SKO), Next Generation Chemical Detector (NGCD), Joint Sensitive Equipment Wipes (JSEW), and Common Analytical Laboratory System (CALS).  Future efforts will include the development of test methods and methodologies for additional classes of agents.  

(2) Sense Laboratory (Biological): The product for this area is the Joint Ambient Breeze Tunnel (JABT) and the Active Standoff Chamber (ASC), which is currently used for point detection.  The JABT and ASC improvements will provide a tech refresh to existing infrastructure and allow for test results to be integrated into the Dugway Proving Ground (DPG) test Data Management System (DMS).  The CBD acquisition programs supported are the Joint Biological Tactical Detection System (JBTDS), and the Joint USFK Point and Integrated Threat Recognition (JUPITR) Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD).

(3) Individual Protection, Collective Protection and Decontamination (Shield and Sustain): This product for this area is the Materials Test Capabilities (MTC).  The CBD acquisition programs supported is Uniform Integrated Protective Ensemble - II (UIPE- Increment 2)

(4) Sense (Field): The product for this area is the Test Grid.  The Test Grid effort provides a fully instrumented grid for chemical and biological simulant field test capabilities that integrate referee systems; dissemination equipment; cloud tracking equipment; meteorological equipment; and DPG test Data Management System (DMS).  The CBD acquisition programs supported are the Joint Expeditionary Collective Protection (JECP), Next Generation Chemical Detector (NGCD), Joint Biological Tactical Detection System (JBTDS), and the Joint USFK Point and Integrated Threat Recognition (JUPITR) Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Operational forces have an immediate need to survive, safely operate, and sustain operations in a Chemical and Biological (CB) threat environment across the continuum of global, contingency, special operations/low intensity conflict, counternarcotics, and other high-risk missions.  Operating forces have a critical need for defense against worldwide proliferation of CB warfare capabilities and for medical treatment of CB casualties.  Congress directed centralized management of Department of Defense (DoD) CB Defense initiatives, both medical and non-medical.  This program element supports the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) of medical and physical CB defensive equipment and materiel.  Projects within BA5 are structured to consolidate Joint and Service-unique tasks within four commodity areas: contamination avoidance, individual and collective force protection, decontamination, and medical countermeasures.  This consolidation provides for development and operational testing of equipment for Joint Service use and for Service-unique requirements.  

Contamination avoidance efforts under this system development program will provide U.S. forces with real-time hazard assessment capabilities.  They include multi-agent point and remote chemical detection for ground, aircraft, and shipboard applications; automated warning and reporting systems; integrated radiation detection and monitoring equipment; and enhanced battlefield reconnaissance capabilities.  Force protection efforts will increase protection levels while decreasing physical and psychological burdens imposed by protective equipment.  

The Secretary of Defense is responsible for research, development, acquisition, and deployment of medical countermeasure equipment and materiel to prevent or mitigate the health effects of CB threats to the Armed Forces and directs strategic planning for and oversight of programs to support medical countermeasures development and acquisition for our Armed Forces personnel.  The CB medical threat to the Armed Forces, in contrast with public health threats to U.S. citizens, encompasses all potential or continuing enemy actions that can render a Service Member combat ineffective.  CB medical threats, because they apply as a whole to military units deployed on a specific mission and/or operations, may result in the unit being unable to complete its mission.  CB medical countermeasures developed by DoD, unlike those developed to support the U.S. population, must support military commanders practical operational requirements and deployment strategies and must emphasize prevention of injury and illness and protection of the force.  Preventive measures in this SDD, such as vaccines and chemical prophylaxis, conserves fighting strength, decreases the logistics burden by reducing the need for larger deployed hospital footprint and greater demand for tactical and strategic medical evacuation, and satisfy the need for greater flexibility in military planning and operations.  When vaccines and other prophylactic medical countermeasures are not available, efforts on this SDD support pre-hospitalization treatment, en-route care, hospital care, and long-term clinical outcomes.  Specific items in this category include CB diagnostics, and therapeutics to mitigate the consequences of biologic threats and exposure to ionizing radiation due to nuclear or radiological attacks.  

The Department of Defense coordinates its efforts with the Departments of Health and Human Services to promote synergy and minimize redundancy.  The Department of Defense ensures coordination by participating in the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise interagency strategic planning process ("One Portfolio").  The Department of Defense's longstanding experience and success in CB medical countermeasure research, development, acquisition, and deployment not only ensures protection of the Armed Forces, it also accelerates and improves the overall national efforts in CB medical countermeasure research, development, and acquisition because of its unique facilities, testing capabilities, and trained and experienced personnel.  

The projects in this program element support efforts in the engineering and manufacturing phase of the acquisition strategy and are therefore correctly placed in Budget Activity 5.

FY 2015 funding includes $335.9 million of base funding and $10.0 million of Ebola emergency funding.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports System Development and Demonstration and Low Rate Initial Production (SDD/LRIP) of an array of reconnaissance, detection and identification equipment, and warning systems.  Experimentation and demonstration will be used in this phase to reduce risk and inform supporting materiel solutions, CONOPS and TTPs.  Efforts included in this project are: (1) Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Dismounted Reconnaissance Systems (CBRN DRS); (2) Joint Biological Tactical Detection System (JBTDS); (3) Next Generation Chemical Detector (NGCD); (4) Non-Traditional Agent (NTA) Defense Support; (5) Non-Traditional Agent (NTA) Detection Support, and (6) the Global Biosurveillance Technology Initiatives (GBTI).

The CBRN Dismounted Reconnaissance Systems (CBRN DRS) consists of portable, commercial and government off-the-shelf equipment which provides personnel protection from current and emerging CBRN hazards through detection, identification, sample collection, decontamination, marking, and hazard reporting for CBRN threats.  The system supports Dismounted Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and CBRN Site Assessment missions which enable more detailed and near real-time CBRN information flow to the Warfighter.  The program will address emerging CBRN threat requirements in order to provide an enhanced capability for the future.  

The Joint Biological Tactical Detection System (JBTDS) program will develop, integrate, test, and produce the first lightweight, low cost biological surveillance system that will detect, collect, and identify biological warfare agent aerosols.  JBTDS will provide warning through the Joint Warning And Reporting Network (JWARN) and archive sample for follow-on analyses.  JBTDS, providing near real-time local audio and visual alarm, may be employed by any Military User.  JBTDS components will be man-portable, battery-operable, and easy to employ.  JBTDS will develop a tactical common identifier using technology from the Next Generation Detection System.  JBTDS will provide notification of a hazard and enhance battle space awareness to protect and preserve the force.  When networked, JBTDS will augment existing biological detection systems to provide a theater-wide seamless array capable of biological detection, identification and warning to support time sensitive force protection decisions.

The Next Generation Chemical Detector (NGCD) is several detection systems for multi phase of matter sampling, location of liquid and solids on surfaces, and vapor and aerosol monitoring.  NGCD will detect and identify non-traditional agents, chemical warfare agents (CWAs), toxic industrial chemicals (TICs) in the air and on surfaces.  The NGCD will provide improved NTA/CWA/TIC selectivity and sensitivity on multiple platforms as well as multiple environments.  There are four capability areas.  of which three; Air Monitor, Surface Survey and Multi-sample Analysis were awarded contracts in the Technical Maturation and Risk Reduction Phase.  The fourth capability - personal chemical detection is still in technology development, These sensors will improve detection, consequence management and reconnaissance, and weapons of mass destruction (WMD) interdiction capabilities.  The scope of the project includes detection of agent a few feet away from the detector as well as the sampling point of the detector. 

The Non-Traditional Agent (NTA) Defense program supports the on-going chemical and biological (CB) defense efforts as acquisition programs address emerging threat requirements across the full spectrum of commodities.  Dedicated initiatives and projects will transition information, technologies, and capabilities into acquisition programs that account for the breadth and depth of emerging threats which span the full range of military missions.  By leveraging previous work done on NTAs (NTA DETECT) within the DoD, interagency cooperation, and international partnerships, the NTA Defense program will provide essential enablers such as threat understanding; operational impacts of performance trades; and comprehensive, integrated, and layered defense concepts against current CB threats.  The program will develop a balanced portfolio which will target capabilities to reduce risk from technology gaps inherent from emerging threats.  Additional efforts in conducting systems engineering analysis will occur in order to identify and consolidate capability knowledge gaps and prioritize required investments.

The Non-Traditional Agent (NTA) Detect project will identify, evaluate and continue to transition advanced detection and identification system(s) through follow-on technology insertion efforts which enhance the Domestic Response Capability (DRC), CBRN DRS (Dismounted Reconnaissance Sets, Kits, and Outfits), and Next Generation Chemical Detector programs.  These efforts will ensure that specialized units will maintain situational awareness and have the ability to respond to emerging threats.  The systems provide a mid-term capability to detect emerging threat materials and afford the Warfighter the ability to support domestic response and force protection missions.  These systems will leverage common core technologies to detect and identify threats that can be exploited for lab deployable, fixed site and handheld applications.

The Global Biosurveillance Technology Initiatives (GBTI) will develop a globally-distributed, fully integrated and networked, state-of-the-art analytical capability for biological threats that will enable the compression of the discovery-to-decision timeframe and provide awareness and understanding of the baseline biological threat footprint.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear Dismounted Reconnaissance Systems (CBRN DRS) program uses a government-off-the-shelf (GOTS)/commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) non-developmental item (NDI) single step acquisition approach to full capability.  This strategy employs an NDI acquisition concept to establish a simplified management framework to translate mission needs and emerging technology capabilities into a stable, affordable, and well-managed acquisition program.  CBRN DRS systems will be produced using a workshare approach between Organic assets and Contractor workforce.

JOINT BIO TACTICAL DETECTION SYSTEM (JBTDS)

The JBTDS program will use an evolutionary acquisition strategy.  Under this approach, capability is developed based on current technologies, recognizing up front the need for potential technology insertion as technology advances to provide better and more cost effective capabilities.  Technology insertions will provide militarily useful and supportable operational capabilities that can be developed, produced, deployed, and sustained.  JBTDS will make maximum use of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) and Government off-the-shelf (GOTS) technology.  The JBTDS program is coordinating with Common Analytical Laboratory System and Next Generation Diagnostic System (NGDS) to share information and leverage potential common identification technology solutions.  JBTDS will utilize the contract mechanism through NGDS develop a NGDS tactical variant identifier.  Full and open competition will be utilized at MS B for the Engineering and Manufacturing Development contract with options for Low Rate Initial Production and Full Rate Production.

NEXT GENERATION CHEMICAL DETECTOR (NGCD)

System Engineering and market survey results suggested the most effective way to develop NGCD was to divide the program into four unique capabilities to detect and identify the full spectrum of chemical compounds in all phases of matter.  The Government awarded ten (10) contracts in June 2014 to support Technology Maturation Risk Reduction (TMRR) acquisition phase activities in three of the four capability areas.  Three (3) contracts for the Air Monitoring capability, four (4) contracts for the Surface survey capability, and three (3) contracts for the Multi-Sample Analysis capability.  Full and Open competition will be used to award Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contracts with production options for each capability at Milestone B.  Candidates for acceleration to provide partial capability will be selected from either the NGCD2 or NGCD1, based on emerging breadboard test results.

NON TRADITIONAL AGENT DEFENSE (NTA DEFENSE)

The Non-Traditional Agent (NTA) Defense program supports the Chemical Biological Defense Program (CBDP) to develop countermeasures for all emerging threats across all commodities.  The NTA Defense program consists of a number of projects and initiatives through full and open contract actions that: (1) evaluate COTS and GOTS technologies and systems, (2) conduct demonstrations and experiments, (3) integrates Intelligence Community threat analysis, JRO/ J-8 operational risk analysis with systems technical performance to identify technologies or systems that can be rapidly developed, and deployed, and/or transitioned to an Acquisition Program for technology insertion or derive an Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) to a fielded system, and (4) coordination of DoD, interagency, international NTA projects.  These initiatives allow CBDP/JPEO to mitigate risk against emerging threats and better prepare the warfighter to deal with technological surprise across the full range of military missions.

NON TRADITIONAL AGENT DETECTION (NTA DETECT)

The Non-Traditional Agent (NTA) Detection technology assessments, performance tradeoff analyses, and mission decomposition transitioned a detection capability through incremental acquisition that afforded the Warfighter ability to attain situational awareness and respond to unknown and emerging hazards.  COTS/GOTS assessments were used in order to lower program risks, reduce costs, and ensure a higher confidence in selected technologies.  The project will address next priority mission areas and threats underneath the NTA Defense profile.

GLOBAL BIO TECH INITIATIVE (GBTI)

Global Biosurveillance Technology Initiative (GBTI) will use an evolutionary acquisition strategy.  Under this approach capability is developed and fielded based on current technologies and user needs.  Technology insertions will provide state-of-the art analytical capability for biological threats.  GBTI will make maximum use of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) and government off-the-shelf (GOTS) technology.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

This project supports a comprehensive, integrated and layered Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear (CBRN) protection and response capability for military installations and specialized military consequence management units both at home and abroad.  Particular emphasis is placed on improving military-civilian interoperability in CBRN detection and response capabilities; providing tiered levels of CBRN protection and response capabilities to military installations; and tailored modular and integrated COTS solutions to consequence management units.  

Included in this project are the following developmental efforts:

The Common Analytical Laboratory System capability (CALS) will be modular, scalable and adaptable to a variety of concept of operations (CONOPS) and environmental conditions.  Currently, fielded systems have been designed independently by various agencies with the intent of meeting a specific units requirements.  As a result, multiple mobile lab configurations exist with differing sustainment tails and lacking in commonality.  The analytical detection package fielded will be fitted to the specific mission and CONOPS of the gaining unit and be able to detect and identify Chemical Warfare Agents (CWAs), Toxic Industrial Chemicals (TICs), Toxic Industrial Materials (TIMs) and Biological Warfare Agents (BWAs).  Users of the system will include the National Guard Bureau Civil Support Teams, the Army 20th Support Command, the Army Medical Laboratory, the Air Force, and the Navy. 

The Special Purpose Unit - Chemical Biological Equipment (SPU CBE) program supports the evaluation and acquisition integrated chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and explosive (CBRNE) rapid response capabilities for National Guard Bureau's (NGB) Weapons of Mass Destruction Civil Support Teams (WMD-CST) and Special Purpose Units - Chemical Biological Equipment (SPU-CBE) which consists of the CBRNE Enhanced Response Force Package (CERFP), the United States Marine Corps Chemical Biological Incident Response Force (CBIRF), United States Marine Corps Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF), the United States Army Reserve (USARC) Chemical Recon Platoons, Decon Platoons, Defense Support of Civil Authority CBRN Response Force (DCRF), and the 20th Support Command Nuclear Disablement (NDT) and CBRNE Teams, United States Air Force BAT, BEE, PAM, and Navy FDPMU.  Key activities of this program include ongoing life cycle assessments for the portfolio of fielded commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) CBRNE equipment, identification and evaluation of emerging technologies, prioritization and fielding of improved capabilities to meet established requirements, and the establishment of institutionalized training.  The overall capability package includes hand held detection, protection, decontamination, situational awareness software assessment and sampling tools, The purpose of this program is to address legacy requirements gaps/deficiencies for WMD-CST's and SPU-CBE's where they exist through the streamlined acquisition of COTS/government-off-the-shelf (GOTS) capability upgrades that incorporate proven advancements in technology to satisfy mission performance standards.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Funding supports System Development and Demonstration and Low Rate Initial Production (SDD/LRIP) of Joint Service Chemical, Biological, and Radiological (CBR) Collective Protection (CP) systems that are smaller, lighter, less costly to produce and maintain, and more logistically supportable enabling mission accomplishment in CBR environments.  CP systems can be installed on any type of platform, such as, hard and soft shelters, vehicles, ships, aircraft, and buildings.  CP systems provide spaces safe from the effects of CBR contamination.  Experimentation and demonstration will be used in this phase to reduce risk and inform supporting Concept of Operations (CONOPS) and Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs).


The system included in this project is the Joint Expeditionary Collective Protection (JECP).

JECP provides the Joint Expeditionary Forces a CP capability which is lightweight, compact, modular, and affordable.  A family of systems is planned that will allow the application of CP to transportable soft-side shelters, enclosed spaces of opportunity, and in remote austere locations as a standalone resource.  JECP will be capable of protecting personnel groups of varying size, unencumbered by Individual Protective Equipment (IPE), from the effects of CB agents, Toxic Industrial Materials (TIMs), radiological particles, heat, dust, and sand.  The employment of JECP is a strategic deterrence against enemy use of CBR agents or TIMs, and will reduce the need for personnel and equipment decontamination.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Strategy based on evolutionary development, based on a family of systems approach.  After MS B, awarded competitive Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF) contract to Science Applications International Corporation (now Leidos) in 2008 to build prototypes subjected to robust engineering developmental testing and Operational Assessment during the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) phase.  After MS C, awarded a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) option to Leidos in September 2013 for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) systems to support formal Developmental Testing (DT) and Multi-Service Operational Test &amp; Evaluation (MOT&amp;E) events.  In addition, a Fixed Price Incentive Successive Target (FPIS) option was awarded to Leidos in January 2014 to perform non-recurring engineering (NRE) and logistic product development associated with the LRIP system configurations.  Following a successful Full Rate Production (FRP) decision, award a FFP option with five one-year ordering periods.  Full and open competition will be used with an updated system performance specification to award follow-on production contracts.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides System Development and Demonstration (SDD) for: (1) the Contaminated Human Remains Pouch (CHRP); (2) the Decontamination Family of Systems (DFoS); (3) Contamination Indicator Decontamination Assurance System (CIDAS); (4) General Purpose Decontaminant (GPD); (5) Joint Service Equipment Wipe (JSEW); (6) Joint Biological Aircraft Decontamination (JBAD) System; and (7) Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP).  Experimentation and demonstration will be used in this phase to reduce risk
and inform supporting materiel solutions, CONOPS and TTPs.

The Contaminated Human Remains Pouch (CHRP) program will provide the capability to protect personnel handling and processing human remains contaminated with Chemical, Biological, Radiological, or Nuclear (CBRN) contamination.  The CHRP is a body bag designed to contain chemical, biological, or radiological contaminated fluids and gasses from contaminated remains.  The CHRP will fulfill gaps as described in the Mortuary Affairs (MA) Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) for safe intra-theater handling and transport of contaminated human remains (CHR).  The CHRP will provide protection by containing CHR during recovery and transport from the point of fatality to the MA Activity.  The CHRP will contain fluid and vapor CBRN hazards associated with the CHR to reduce the spread of contamination and reduce the hazard to personnel handling the CHR and the environment.  Successful development and procurement of the CHRP will provide Warfighters with the capability to safely handle, transport, and temporarily store or inter CHR in a theater of operations.

The Decontamination Family of Systems (DFoS) program facilitates the rapid transition of mature Science and Technology (S&amp;T) research developments to existing Decontamination or Contamination Mitigation ICD Programs of Record and guides S&amp;T community efforts toward meeting the needs of the Warfighter.  DFoS will develop a Family of Systems (FoS), to include equipment, to improve decontamination processes, and decontaminant solutions to meet the capability gaps for decontaminating Non-Traditional Agents (NTA) and chemical and biological (CB) warfare agents from personnel, equipment, vehicle interiors/exteriors, terrain, and fixed facilities.  

CIDAS is a contamination indicator/decontamination assurance technology.  It will consist of an indicator and an applicator, for which there will be three configurations.  The indicator will be sprayed on tactical vehicles, aircraft, ships, crew-served weapons, and individual weapons that may have been exposed to traditional and non-traditional chemical contamination.  CIDAS is a new capability for the Joint Forces that will reduce the logistics burden of decontamination by indicating presence and location of traditional (Nerve and Blister) and non-traditional chemical agents on militarily relevant surfaces pre- and post-decontamination.

General Purpose Decontaminant (GPD) is a liquid decontaminant that will provide thorough decontamination capabilities for tactical vehicles, shipboard surfaces, crew-served weapons, and individual/personal weapons in hostile an non-hostile environments that have been exposed to traditional and non-traditional CB contamination.
 
The Joint Service Equipment Wipe (JSEW) is a decontamination wipe that will provide immediate/operational decontamination capabilities for sensitive and non-sensitive equipment in hostile and non-hostile environments that have been exposed to chemical agents/contamination and shall decontaminate Nerve and Blister agents from a starting liquid challenge of 10 g/m2 to less than or equal to 1 g/m2 and non-traditional agents from a starting liquid challenge of 5 g/m2 to less than or equal to 1 g/m2.  In addition, the JSEW is intended to be a replacement for the Individual Equipment Decontamination Kit (M295).  Follow on increments of JSEW may include biological agent capability and/or use on skin.

The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) Decontamination System MDAP project will develop an integrated decontamination containment system and decontaminant delivery system to support the JSF Live Fire Test and Evaluation (LFT&amp;E) to satisfy specific F-35 decontamination requirements through aircraft-unique interfaces and demonstrate the aircraft's ability to meet CB decontamination and survivability requirements.

The JBAD System will provide thorough biological decontamination of the interior and exterior of tactical and cargo aircraft.  The JBAD System is a capability set that will include a shelter to encapsulate an airframe, a decontamination delivery system (e.g. hot-humid air-blower, etc.), environmental control and monitoring system(s), and other ancillary components required to ensure efficacious biological agent decontamination.  It will provide the capability to decontaminate biologically contaminated airframes to safe levels and allow more rapid return to service.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The CHRP Government design and manufacture acquisition strategy will leverage current Mortuary Affairs (MA) equipment, such as the Human Remains Pouch (HRP), to identify metrics and performance specifications necessary for the handling of non-contaminated human remains, and expand the performance to fill the identified capability gap for safe handling of contaminated human remains (CHR).  CHRP will develop two Government designed systems to meet performance specifications and provide a fielded capability for safe intra-theater handling and transport of CHR.  At MS C, an effective and suitable system will be chosen for entry into the Production and Deployment Phase from two candidate systems based on testing results and a cost-benefit analysis.  Manufacturing and production will occur at Government facilities.  The strategy includes an additional effort under a directed requirement to incorporate a CHRP variant into a system designed to provide a transport capability to return CHR to Continental United States (CONUS).

The Government design strategy will emphasize meeting Key Performance Parameters (KPPs) using design attributes not offered by the commercial sector and materials with existing test data to provide Services two options at different cost and performance points.  The CHRP will use EMD Phase testing to determine the capability of Government design candidates to meet the requirements outlined in the MA ICD and the CHRP CDD.  At MS C, an effective and suitable system will be chosen for entry into the Production and Deployment Phase from two candidate systems based on testing results and a cost-benefit analysis with input from the user community.

DECONTAMINATION FAMILY OF SYSTEMS (DFoS)

The DFoS is utilizing an incremental acquisition strategy to transition various developmental technology efforts (Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS), and DoD technology efforts) to meet high priority Warfighter capability gaps.  DFoS will support Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAPs) and Programs of Record by guiding S&amp;T efforts and transitioning mature technologies to meet program requirements.

MAJOR DEFENSE ACQUISITION PROGRAM (MDAP)

The JSF Decontamination System effort will utilize sole source contracting to leverage and integrate commercially available technologies to provide a decontamination delivery system for the Joint Strike Fighter program office in support of the JSF Live Fire Test and Evaluation (LFT&amp;E).

DFoS CONTAMINATION INDICATOR DECONTAMINATION ASSURANCE SYSTEM (DFoS CIDAS)

The CIDAS program will follow an evolutionary acquisition strategy in consonance with the Joint Requirements Office (JRO)/User developed capability documents.  Following MS A, collaborated with JSTO/DTRA efforts, including the Hazard Mitigation, Materiel and Equipment Restoration (HaMMER) Advanced Technology Development Operational Demonstration and Extended User Evaluations, and conducted technology demonstrations on candidate indicator and applicator technologies to mitigate risk and identify affordable mature technologies that meet requirements.  Determined need for and initiated Government designed large scale applicator to meet specific User requirements.  Following MS B, use full and open competition to award a performance based contract with options for LRIP and FRP for indicator and small and mid scale applicator systems.  Integrate and test contractor and Government designs in DT and operational testing.

DFoS GENERAL PURPOSE DECONTAMINANT (DFoS GPD)

Due to the maturity levels of the systems entering the Technology Development (TD) phase, the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) issued an Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) which approved GPD to by-pass Milestone (MS) B and enter directly to MS C Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP).  During the TD Phase (which includes CP I, CP II), the GPD Program employed a Competitive Prototyping (CP) effort to facilitate the evaluation of Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) technologies releasing an Request for Proposal (RFP) as a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial and Non-Developmental Items (NDI), utilizing full and open competition.  As the GPD program enters the final phase of Technology Development (Developmental Test), the program will continue to follow an evolutionary acquisition strategy.  The production contract in support of MS C is a single award for LRIP with four option years for FRP, using Full and Open Competition in accordance with FAR Subpart 6.1. This strategy ensures that all prospective sources, with the capability of meeting the program requirements, have the opportunity to participate.

DFoS JOINT SENSITIVE EQUIPMENT WIPE (DFoS JSEW)

Due to the maturity levels of the systems entering the Technology Development (TD) phase, the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) issued an Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) which approved JSEW to pursue a Milestone (MS) A to MS C Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) acquisition strategy.  During the TD Phase (which includes CP I, CP II), the JSEW Program employed a Competitive Prototyping (CP) effort to facilitate the evaluation of Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) technologies releasing an Request for Proposal (RFP) as a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial and Non-Developmental Items (NDI), utilizing full and open competition.  As the JSEW program enters the final phase of Technology Development (Developmental Test), the program will continue to follow an evolutionary acquisition strategy.  The JSEW acquisition strategy to support upcoming JSEW contracting efforts for DT, LRIP, and FRP is a single contract award for DT, with options for LRIP and FRP, using Full and Open Competition in accordance with FAR Subpart 6.1.  This strategy ensures that all prospective sources, with the capability of meeting the contract requirements, have the opportunity to participate.

JOINT BIOLOGICAL AGENT DECONTAMINATION SYSTEM (JBAD)

The JBAD System program will leverage the Joint Biological Agent Decontamination System Joint Capability Technology Demonstration to mature and deliver incremental capabilities to meet Air Mobility Command and US Transportation Command needs for interior and exterior decontamination of aircraft against biological agents.  The JBAD will employ full and open competition and competitive prototyping during the Engineering Manufacturing and Development (EMD) phase.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides Engineering &amp; Manufacturing Development Phase and Low Rate Initial Production (EMD/LRIP) for individual protection equipment, with the goal of providing equipment that allows the individual soldier, sailor, airman, or Marine to operate in a contaminated Nuclear, Biological and Chemical (NBC) environment with little or no degradation of his/her performance.  Experimentation and demonstration will be used in this phase to reduce risk and inform supporting materiel solutions, CONOPS and TTPs.

Included in this program are: 

(1) The Joint Service Aircrew Mask (JSAM) for Tactical Aircraft (TA), Strategic Aircraft (SA), Joint Strike Fighter (JSF), and Rotary Wing (RW) are Acquisition Category (ACAT) III programs developed to provide respiratory and ocular protection.  The JSAM will be a lightweight chemical and biological (CB) protective mask that will be worn as CB protection for most Army, Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps fixed wing (FW) and RW aircrew members.  All JSAM variants will be compatible with most below-the-neck (BTN) CB protection ensembles and existing aircrew life support equipment (ALSE).  They will include a protective hood assembly, CB filter, blower assembly, and an intercom for ground communication.  They will also provide flame protection, demist/emergency demist, and anti-drowning features.  The goal of the JSAM programs is to develop, manufacture, field, and sustain an aircrew respirator system that, in conjunction with BTN clothing ensembles, will provide the capability for all aircrew to operate in an actual or perceived CB warfare environment.  

In FY14, the JSAM FW program was separated into two programs: JSAM TA and JSAM SA.  The JSAM TA and SA respirators are being developed for use in the majority of DoD FW aircraft except for the F-35 JSF.  The JSAM TA program will provide CB and anti-G protection up to nine times the vertical force (Gz), for aircrew in high-performance aircraft.  The JSAM SA program will be used in aircrew positions that do not require anti-G protection and provide CB protection for positions that only need pressure breathing for altitude.  

The JSAM-JSF is a CB respirator being specifically designed to support the F-35.  It is designed to ensure that system integration and qualification of CB protection and survivability requirements are achieved as derived from the JSF Operational Requirements Document.  Prior to FY15, this project was funded under the JSAM funding line.  When integrated with aircraft and pilot mounted equipment, the JSAM-JSF will provide combined CB, hypoxia and anti-G protection to all F-35 users, including the United States Air Force (USAF), Navy (USN), Marine Corps (USMC), and International Partners.  

The JSAM MPU-5 RW mask is being developed for use by pilots and aircrew in the majority of DoD RW aircraft in the United States Army (USA) except AH-64 users, USAF, USN, USMC, and United States Coast Guard (USCG).  The JSAM RW will integrate with most BTN CB ensembles, normal aircrew flight equipment, and RW flight helmets.  The system contains a removable face plate, allowing the user to fly "face free" in Mission Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP) 2 (garment and boots) and easily convert to MOPP 3 (garment, boots, and mask) when the threat level dictates, thereby reducing physiological burden and improving field of view.  If threat level warrants, the user can install their face plate into an already donned hood and enter MOPP 4 without removing their flight helmet.  


(2) The Joint Service General Purpose Mask (JSGPM) Advanced Respiratory Protection Initiative (ARPI) will address improved mask protection, filter protection against Toxic Industrial Chemicals (TIC)/Toxic Industrial Materials (TIM) and improved profile and breathing resistance; and wearability compatibility/integration.  This will be accomplished through class-based analysis, Filtration Advanced Screening Test (FAST), desorption study, and advanced Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) filtration efforts.  Several technologies are being pursued by the Joint Science and Technology Office (JSTO), with two specific technologies being pursued in the FY14-16 timeframe.  The JSGRPM ARPI effort will investigate alternative designs and modifications to ZZAT (Zirconium hydroxide, Zinc, Argentum (Silver), Triethylene di-amine (TEDA)) to further increase filtration of TICs and Chemical Warfare Agents (CWA).  ZZAT is a zirconium hydroxide based filtration media that can potentially be layered with carbon.  The first technology, known as Cobalt-Zinc ZZAT (CoZZAT), uses a layered bed of carbon concept to improve TIC and CWA protection capabilities, while the second technology known as Metal Organic Framework (MOF), is an engineered media that is a porous crystalline compound made up of metal ions and organic bridging molecules (ligands) for targeted removal of chemicals.  The JSGPM APRI effort will also investigate various applications of nanofiber particulate media.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The overall JSAM acquisition approach is phased due to the complexity of interfacing with almost 200 aircraft types and models with different mission sets, Aviation Life Support Equipment (ALSE), cockpit layouts, priorities, etc.  JSAM will pursue two materiel solutions for fixed wing aircraft via; the JSAM for Tactical Aircraft (TA) and JSAM for Strategic Aircraft (SA) programs.  JSAM TA and SA must be compatible with current CB ensembles and provide flame protection and will replace all existing Pressure Breathing for Gravity (PBG) and non-PBG CB aircrew respirators.  The JSAM TA (A/P22P-14A) utilizes a phased acquisition strategy to provide aircrew of all Services with individual head-eye-respiratory protection against Chemical-Biological (CB) warfare agents.  The JSAM TA effort will test the Pressure Breathing for Gravity (PBG) Mask to aircraft platforms.  The JSAM SA (Modified M53 (MM53)) effort will test and field a mask for aircrew positions not requiring PBG capabilities.  This contract was awarded via sole source to Avon Protection Systems, Cadillac, Michigan to modify and field a commercially available mask (M53).

JS AIRCREW MASK ROTARY WING (JSAM RW)

The respirator is being developed under a competitive Cost Plus Fixed Fee contract, which is also used by JSAM Apache and Apache Block III.  A sole source Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) will be awarded for LRIP and will include options for spare parts, Full Rate Production, and Apache Block III upgrades.

JS AIRCREW MASK FIXED WING STRATEGIC AIRCRAFT (JSAM SA)

The JSAM SA acquisition approach involves modifying the fielded M53 ground mask design in order to add Pressure Breathing for Altitude (PBA), up to 40,000 feet above sea-level, and middle ear equalization capabilities.  The JSAM SA mask is intended to be fielded to the United States Air Force (USAF), United States Navy (USN), United States Marine Corps (USMC), United States Army (USA), and United States Coast Guard (USCG).
 
The overall acquisition strategy is to initially produce and field the JSAM SA masks in four LRIP phases.  This phased approach will allow the JSAM SA mask to be fielded to aircrew of the most applicable aircrafts in the shortest amount of time.  At the end of each LRIP phase, the aircraft associated with each phase will have achieved an Initial Operating Capability (IOC) with the JSAM SA mask.  The remaining aircrew, not given a JSAM SA mask during the LRIP phases, will receive their masks after FRP.  At the end of FRP, the Services will have achieved their Full Operating Capability (FOC) with the mask.  LRIP 1 will consist of fielding the JSAM SA mask to most of the USAF E-3 and USN P-3C aircrew.  Based on technical difficulty and mission need, the JSAM SA program will work with the Services to determine which LRIP phase (i.e. 2, 3, or 4) will include the remaining aircraft.
 
The overall test strategy involves four major phases.  The first test phase consists of Design Verification Testing (DVT) which will evaluate developmental prototype masks prior to CDR.  The second test phase is Developmental Testing (DT) to support Milestone C/LRIP.  The third test phase is Operational Testing (OT) of LRIP assets to support IOC fielding to USAF E-3 and USN P-3C aircrew.  The final test phase is combined DT/OT for the LRIPs 2, 3, and 4.
 
The contract strategy consists of two sole-source contracts with Avon Protection Systems, the manufacturer of the base M53 mask.  The first contract, which was awarded on 31 July 2013, covers all activities during Engineering, Manufacturing, and Development (EMD) phase.  The second contract, which is planned to be awarded after Milestone C/LRIP, will cover the activities during the Production and Deployment (PD) phase including all LRIP and FRP builds.

JS AIRCREW MASK FIXED WING TACTICAL AIRCRAFT (JSAM TA)

The JSAM TA planned solution for the USAF F-22 Readiness requirement is an integration effort and an Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) to the Navy's A/P22P-14(A).  The ECP will provide CB-protection capability to F-22 pilots while providing valuable test data to be used to evaluate potential candidates for the JSMA TA solution.  The JSAM TA program plans to pursue a full-and-open competition for the production contract to cover Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) and Full Rate Production (FRP).  Comparative gate testing will be conducted to support the source selection process for the full and open competition.  The Government plans to competitively award one, Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Incentive contract with an option for production.  Subsequent integration efforts will be completed for each aircraft platform.

JS AIRCREW MASK JOINT STRIKE FIGHTER (JSAM JSF)

JSAM-JSF is specifically designed for the F-35 (Joint Strike Fighter) to be incorporated within the JSF platform and fielded to US Services and international partners.  JSAM-JSF is being developed concurrently with other JSF equipment including life support and pilot flight equipment.  JSAM-JSF initially leveraged a JSAM-FW design and shared the same base contract with a Cost Plus Incentive Fee delivery order.

JS GENERAL PURPOSE MASK (JSGPM)

The JSGPM Advanced Respiratory Protection Initiative (ARPI) effort is using the M61 filter contracts awarded to 3M and Avon to develop improved filters for the JSGPM.  There is a continual technology refreshment CLIN that allows for filter development tasks to be awarded under this contract.  The tasks can be competed between the two awardees or award to both to ensure competition on future spares and delivery orders.  As filter technologies transition from the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) and Joint Science and Technology Office (JSTO), the technologies will be matured from system/subsystem prototyping demonstration technologies at Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 to actual system "mission proven" through successful mission operations in a mission environment at TRL 9.  There are multiple technologies being explored by DTRA, thus, this is a continual product improvement effort to enhance filtration.  The JSGPM ARPI effort will investigate alternative designs and modifications to ZZAT (Zirconium hydroxide, Zinc, Argentum (Silver), Triethylene di-amine (TEDA)) to further increase filtration of TICs and Chemical Warfare Agents (CWA).  ZZAT is a zirconium hydroxide based filtration media that can potentially be layered with carbon.  The first technology, known as Cobalt-Zinc ZZAT (CoZZAT), uses a layered bed of carbon concept to improve TIC and CWA protection capabilities, while the second technology known as Metal Organic Framework (MOF), is an engineered media that is a porous crystalline compound made up of metal ions and organic bridging molecules (ligands) for targeted removal of chemicals.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports System Development and Demonstration and Low Rate Initial Production (SDD/LRIP).  Experimentation and demonstration will be used in this phase to reduce risk and inform supporting materiel solutions, CONOPS and TTPs.

Efforts included in this project are: (1) Joint Effects Model (JEM); (2) the Joint Warning and Reporting Network (JWARN); (3) Biosurveillance Portal (BSP); and (4) Software Support Activity (SSA).

The Joint Effects Model (JEM) is a web-based software application that supplies the Department of Defense (DoD) with the one and only accredited tool to effectively model and simulate the effects of Chemical, Biological,
Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) weapon strikes and incidents.  JEM is capable of providing all Warfighters with the ability to accurately model and predict the time-phased impact of CBRN and Toxic Industrial Chemical/Material (TIC/TIM) events and effects.  JEM supports planning to mitigate the effects of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) and to provide rapid estimates of hazards and effects into the Common Operational Picture (COP).

Follow-on increments of JEM will refine and display hazard areas in near real time to reflect inputs such as meteorological, oceanographic, or actual agent concentration data.  JEM will automatically receive input data from the Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (C4I) system on which it resides such as historical climatology, local observations, weather forecasts, natural environmental threats (i.e.: pandemic influenza, etc.), terrain data, intelligence information, or population data.  Increment 2 will allow manual user input for factors such as concentrations of chemical warfare agents or actual exposure measurements and forecast sheltering stay-times and provide for modeling sheltering time through user-defined scenarios.

The Joint Warning and Reporting Network (JWARN) is an accredited Department of Defense (DOD) warning and reporting system that provides a standardized warning and reporting capability for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) and Toxic Industrial Materials (TIM) incidents.  

JWARN supports the Joint Force Commander (JFC) by improving force protection capabilities for units operating in chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear environments.  JWARN provides a digital display of CBRN 1-6 reports on the Common Operational Picture, displayed through Service provided C4I systems resident at all echelons of command.  JWARN will be operated by CBRN and non-CBRN trained personnel operating in the operations center at various command nodes.  This provides commanders with situational awareness to inform decision making for force protection criteria, unmasking operations, decontamination, and continuity of operations in a contaminated environment.  Future sensor configurations will forward sensor inputs directly to JWARN via established communication lanes, removing the man-in-the-loop requirement with the current system configuration.  JWARN will be information system classification agnostic and must be able to operate on
unclassified, secret, top secret, and mission partner IT Systems without increasing system operator requirement, i.e.: sensor to COP via one communication loop.  As a result, sensors will then be able to communicate with JWARN on the same network, regardless of classification.

The Biosurveillance Portal (BSP) is a web-based enterprise environment that will facilitate collaboration, communication, and information sharing in support of the detection, management, and mitigation of man-made and naturally occurring biological events.  BSP bridges the communication gaps in the biosurveillance domain to provide a central access point for biosurveillance information and situational awareness for DoD, interagency and allied partners supporting the early identification and response to biological events.

BSP provides an integrated suite of web-based components designed to support public health officers, environmental officers, clinicians, physicians, and CBRN personnel as they maintain their situational awareness of local, regional, and global biological threats to the force.  BSP does not duplicate existing DoD capabilities, but rather leverages existing tools and technologies to provide users across multiple organizations and disciplines with a centralized "one-stop shop" for all of their biosurveillance resources.

As software-intensive systems, JEM, JWARN, and BSP have no separately identifiable unit production components.  JEM and JWARN are designated as ACAT III programs and unit cost calculations including Program Acquisition Unit Cost/Average Procurement Unit Cost (PAUC/APUC) and Operations and Sustainment (O&amp;S) average annual per unit costs are not applicable.  Expect BSP to be similarly designated.

The Software Support Activity (SSA) is a Chem-Bio Defense user developmental support and service organization to facilitate net-centric interoperability of systems in acquisition for the Warfighter.  The SSA provides the CBRN Warfighter with Joint Service solutions for Integrated Architectures, Data Management/Modeling, Information Assurance (IA), Interoperability Certifications, Verification, Validation and Accreditation (VV&amp;A) to support interoperable and integrated net-centric, service-oriented solutions for CBRN systems.  The SSA emphasizes development of reference implementations to guide Government and industry system and software developers to ensure that their products meet common interoperability standards.  The latest technologies/products include the definition of a Common CBRN Sensor Integration Standard (CCSI) and the CBRN Data Model.  These technologies and direct enablers for the development of CBRN integrated sensor networks and the dissemination of CBRN information across all users.  The SSA directly supports Chemical and Biological Defense Program (CBDP) initiatives by providing common service oriented architectures and frameworks for the collection and dissemination of Bio-Surveillance and other critical CBRN information.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>JOINT EFFECTS MODEL (JEM)

JEM Increment 2 acquisition will utilize the JROC's "IT Box" construct for software development.  The intent is to provide the next generation of capability with current and future technologies, as stated in the IS ICD, in less time and fielding products to the service more frequently than an incremental delivery approach.

As part of this strategy, JEM program office developed and issued a competitive prototyping contract in April 2013 where two offerers were given the same Technical Data Package (TDP), performance Work Statement (PWS), and software requirements and were tasked to deliver a JEM prototype that implements the CCMI architecture.  This competitive prototyping strategy
was successful and a single JEM integrator, General Dynamics Information Technology (GDIT), was selected as the prime development contract in December 2013. 

The current contractor for JEM 2.0 will provide all capabilities defined in the Requirement Definition Package 1 (RDP-1) document produced by the Joint Requirements Office (JRO).  The JRO will release RDPs-2, 3, and 4 over the next three years prior to contract completion.  It is anticipated when the contract is re-competed in FY18 that there will be four of five capability drops not yet developed under RDP-2 and two of five under RDP-3.  The follow-on contract in FY18 will be responsible for developing the remaining capabilities under the JEM 2.0 contract.  The JEM follow-on contract will utilize full and open competition and will be referred to as the JEM development, modernization and sustainment contract.

The JEM IS ICD describes the notional implementation plan for fielding of future JEM capabilities among four separate JEM Requirement Definition Packages (RDPs).  RDP-1 contains the baseline capabilities for software and was released in June of 2014.  RDP-2 will be released after the completion of RDP-1.  This RDP will incorporate emerging capabilities that the Joint Science and Technology Office determines has reached a sufficient enough maturity for incorporation into JEM, such as ability to model new agents.  Requirements to integrate baseline capabilities into a version that can be fielded on service C2 systems will be released in RDP-3.  RDP-3 will be released following RDP-1 but prior to RDP-2, to rapidly allow baseline capabilities to be incorporated into C2 systems.  RDP-4 is a notional package that would allow the Science and Technology community a venue to use the JEM program to develop a version of the product for S&amp;T use.  Capabilities that are only required for the Science and Technology community and not for operational users would be implemented in RDP-4.  Capabilities in RDP-4 would not be required to go to Operational Test, as they would not be fielded to operational users. 

RDP 1 - Baseline Capabilities: There are 5 planned Capability Drops (CD) within RDP 1.
RDP 2 - Emerging Capabilities: There are 5 planned Capability Drops (CD) within RDP 2.
RDP 3 - C2 Integration: There are 8 planned Capability Drops (CD) within RDP 3 tied to all the various Strategic and Service C2 Systems
RDP 4 - Analytical Support: There are 2 planned Capability Drops (CD) within RDP 4.

After an over-arching MS B with the MDA, each RDP will have an associated Build Decision.  Each CD will have an associated fielding decision.

JOINT WARNING &amp; REPORTING NETWORK (JWARN)

JWARN Increment 2 utilizes the JROC's "IT Box" construct for software requirements management and development.  The intent is to provide the next generation of capability with current and future technologies, as stated in the IS ICD, in less time and away from an incremental delivery approach.  This effort is being executed under a Cost-Plus-Award Term Incentive structure to gain maximum benefit to the Government in maintaining the fielded baseline and future software capability development and was awarded under a full and open competition Request for Proposal (RFP).  The JWARN Program will procure a Sensor Connectivity Capability (SCC) (hardware materiel solution) in order to facilitate the transfer of CBRN sensor information from legacy CBRN sensors to DoD networks.  This solution will be external to the CBRN Sensors and Service-identified network transmission device(s).

BIOSURVEILLANCE PORTAL (BSP)

BSP will utilize the JROC's "IT Box" construct for program requirements, management, and development.  The intent is to provide the next generation of capability with current and future technologies in less time and fielding products to the DoD utilizing an incremental delivery approach.  IT Box enables programs to tailor the incrementally fielded software program model in the DODI 5000.02 Interim to conduct multiple, more frequent fielding events in lieu of a single fielding event.

SOFTWARE SUPPORT ACTIVITY (SSA)

The SSA provides enterprise-wide services and coordination across all CBDP programs that contain data or software, or are capable of linking to the Global Information Grid (GIG).  The SSA facilitates interoperability, integration, and supportability of existing and developing IT and National Security Systems (NSS).  Phase 1a identifies CBDP programs that deal with data or software, and have an IT component.  This will be followed by coordination to facilitate the concepts of interoperability, integration and supportability of enterprise-wide services.  Next follows work with user communities to develop and demonstrate enterprise-wide common architectures, products and services.  Phase 2 will support the application of the enterprise-wide architectures, products and services into the programs, with verification of compliance with the defined products and services.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project funds medical countermeasures, development of reagents, assays, diagnostic equipment, biosurveillance and supporting efforts.

The Advanced Development and Manufacturing (ADM) capability (formerly the Medical Countermeasures Advanced Development and Manufacturing (MCMI) program) provides core and drug development services to include the establishment, commissioning, validation, and attainment of Current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP)/Current Good Laboratory Practice (cGLP) for a MCM ADM capability for the Department of Defense (DoD).

The ADM effort is being executed in two phases.  Phase 1 is for the establishment, commissioning, and validation of the ADM capability.  This project funds the establishment of the ADM capability in Alachua, Florida.  Two ADM cGMP suites, capable of operating at Bio Surety Level (BSL) 3 will be established during the base contract period.  There are contract options to incrementally increase capacity.  Upon attainment of cGMP capability Phase 2 begins.  During Phase 2, the contractor team will support and maintain the ADM capability in a state of readiness to support MCM development (to include cGMP manufacturing) and assist in training personnel in its use.  The second phase includes transition and integration of new technologies to support MCM FDA required development activities.  Phase 1 and 2 contract was awarded in March 2013 to Nanotherapeutics, Inc., Alachua, FL.  The ADM capability sustainment costs during Phase 2 will originate from Government MCM programs using this capability.

Biosurveillance programs align the biosurveillance efforts across the DoD and national strategies.  The BSV program will scope and influence BSV capabilities as products to meet Warfighter requirements through innovative management of key BSV initiative.  BSV will also support the Joint US Forces Korea (USFK) Portal and Integrated Threat Recognition (JUPITR) ATD which will find, demonstrate, transition, and transfer the best operational concepts and technology solutions in support of a holistic approach to countering biological threats from laboratory to operational use.  Depending on the maturity, outputs will focus on providing component, CONOPS, and subsystem transition into programs of record (PORs) and/or integration into existing PORs.  Technologies identified from the JUPITR ATD will be fielded in FY16 to Pacific Command (PACOM).  Future ATD developments will continue to bridge communication gaps between US Forces across other Combatant Command (COCOMs).  The Biosurveillance (BSV) program will transfer from the Medical Countermeasures (MB) Project to the Contamination Avoidance (CA) Project effective FY 2016.

The Critical Reagents Program's (CRP) strategy establishes a core research and development capability by developing biological threat agent reference materials (strains, antigens, antibodies and nucleic acids) and detection/diagnostic assays for biothreat agent detection.  These reagents/assays are leveraged across multiple programs to meet the requirements of the Warfighter and Joint biological defense systems and support the biological defense community.  Through the Targeted Acquisition of Reference Materials Augmenting Capabilities (TARMAC) initiative, the CRP will use a systematic approach to the introduction of new materials and information into MCM development.  

The Emerging Infectious Diseases Therapeutics (EID Tx) program is developing and will deliver a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved, broad-spectrum medical countermeasure to the Warfighter for protection against naturally occurring or biologically engineered viruses.  EID Tx is pursuing influenza indication as the first step in the development of a broad spectrum antiviral drug due to a clear and established FDA regulatory approval pathway.  The drug in development is highly efficacious against multiple influenza viruses, including the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus, H5N1 avian influenza virus, the most recently identified H7N9 virus from the outbreak in China, and drug resistant strains of influenza viruses.  This drug has also demonstrated efficacy against other viruses of concern to the DoD's biodefense program.  FDA approval for an influenza treatment is anticipated following completion of the SDD phase.  Ongoing EID Tx drug development will be leveraged to demonstrate additional broad-spectrum MCM's against naturally occurring and/or engineered biowarfare threats.  To meet the mission need of "one drug, many bugs" EID Tx is testing product efficacy on BWA threats.  This will allow the military to leverage a product that will be FDA approved for influenza against other viruses.

The Hemorrhagic Fever Virus (HFV) MCS Acquisition Program develops medical countermeasures (MCMs), using high threat, extremely lethal Biological Warfare Agents (BWAs) of the Filoviridae family agents (Ebola) as a model system.  Medical countermeasures will be advanced through the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensure/approval via the FDA 'Animal Rule', which allows for the demonstration of efficacy in relevant animal model(s) when human testing is not ethically feasible.  HFV will also conduct animal model development and refinement as needed to support the pivotal animal efficacy testing required under the FDA 'Animal Rule'.  Completion of Phase I trials, animal model development, and manufacturing scale up were the focus of the ACD&amp;P phase.  FDA approval for Filovirus therapeutics are expected following completion of the SDD phase.  HFV will also support the Ebola outbreak by performing Phase 2 clinical trials in Africa.

The NGDS is an evolutionary acquisition family of systems to provide increments of capability over time across many echelons of the Combat Health Support System.  The mission of the NGDS is to provide Chemical, biological and radiological (CBR) threat, and infectious disease identification and FDA-cleared diagnostics to inform individual patient treatment and CBR situational awareness and disease surveillance.  NGDS Increment 1 will significantly improve diagnostic capabilities for deployable combat health support units (role 3) while also improving operational suitability and affordability.  The term "Role" is used to describe the stratification of the four tiers in which medical support is organized, on a progressive basis, to conduct treatment, evacuation, resupply, and functions essential to the maintenance of the health of the force.  Role 3 support is normally provided at Division or Service equivalent level and includes specialist laboratory resources.  NGDS Increment 2 will compliment NGDS Increment 1 by addressing biological pathogens and toxins, diagnostics for chemical and radiological exposures, and to provide capability to lower echelons of care.

The DoD funds the development of vaccines that are directed against validated biological warfare (BW) weapons to include bacteria, viruses, and toxins of biological origin.  Effective medical countermeasures to negate the threat of these BW agents are urgently needed.  Vaccines have been identified as the most efficient countermeasure against the validated threat of BW weapons.  Products under development in this budget item include Recombinant Botulinum A/B and Plague vaccines.  Efforts to be conducted during the Engineering Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase include the development of large scale manufacturing process and validation of that process, nonclinical studies, demonstration of manufacturing consistency, and expanded clinical human safety studies.  The results of these efforts, and those conducted during the EMD phase, will be used to submit a Biologic License Application (BLA) to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for product licensure.  To evaluate vaccine effectiveness, pivotal animal studies will be conducted concurrently with the Phase 3 clinical trial to satisfy the requirements of the FDA's "Animal Rule".  The DoD anticipates that the FDA will approve these products using the Animal Rule, which allows for the demonstration of efficacy in relevant animal model(s).  Upon FDA licensure, the product will transition to full-scale licensed production.  

The DoD also has the mission to maintain Investigational New Drug (IND) vaccines in Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) storage and to conduct the periodic potency and sterility testing of these materials to support submissions to the FDA.  These IND vaccines will be used to provide additional levels of protection to laboratory workers in the Special Immunizations Program (SIP) conducting research on these diseases.

FY 2015 funding includes $169.5 million of base funding and $10.0 million of Ebola emergency funding.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The ADM capability awarded a competitive ten (10) year [two base years with four 2 year options] Cost Plus Fixed fee (CPFF) contract to Nanotherapeutics, Inc., Alachua, Florida.

BIOSURVEILLANCE (BSV)

BSV is a set of capabilities that acquire, integrate, and analyze medical, environmental, and incident management data using existing and next generation systems, medical and non-medical sample collection tools and identifiers/diagnostics; and transition hardware/software tools and devices as residuals from the Biosurveillance Joint United States Force Korea (USFK) Portal and Integrated Threat Recognition (JUPITR) Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD).  Lessons learned from the ATD will be transitioned to the programs of record associated with the CBDP (such as NGDS, TDS &amp; CALS).  The acquisition strategy will address the materiel solutions identified out of the multiple Biosurveillance (BSV) related Analysis of Alternatives (AoA's).

CRITICAL REAGENTS PROGRAM (CRP)

The Critical Reagents Program's (CRP) strategy establishes a core research and development capability to develop biological threat agent reference materials (antigens, nucleic acids, and antibodies) and detection and diagnostic assays for biothreat agent detection that shall be used across multiple detection and diagnostic platforms.  In addition, this strategy includes a formal, validated advanced development process for transitioning new assays into production and subsequent integration with the appropriate detection/diagnostic platform.

EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES - THERAPUTIC (EID TX)

The goal of the EID Tx program is to develop a safe and effective MCM against biothreats of interest to the DoD.  The first step of the acquisition strategy is to develop an MCM for influenza due to a clear and established FDA regulatory approval pathway.  The Phase 2 clinical trial is complete, demonstrating both safety and efficacy in humans.  Program was authorized by FDA to move forward at End of Phase 2 meeting on 3 SEP 13.  Phase 3 clinical trials for EID Tx against influenza began during 1QFY14.  Following successful FDA approval of the drug against influenza in 3QFY16, EID Tx will utilize an incremental approach to label extensions of this broad spectrum therapeutic.  The development strategy for additional label extensions of the antiviral drug consists of detailed characterization of antiviral activities of the broad-spectrum compound against multiple virus families using cell-based and animal model systems.  Using the results of the cell-based assays efficacy assessment of the drug against high-priority viruses of biodefense concern will be performed using small animal studies.  The results of the proof of concept studies will determine the best candidate to move forward for the Label Extension (LE) starting in FY15.

HEMORRHAGIC FEVER VIRUS (HFV)

The acquisition strategy uses an evaluation of a drug candidate against the lethal Ebola Zaire viruses.  Following a successful Milestone B and entry into SDD phase, the program will conduct expanded human clinical safety studies, definitive animal efficacy, and toxicology studies, required for FDA approval.  The performer will submit a New Drug Application for the Ebola Zaire therapeutic during the SDD Phase.  During the Production and Deployment phase, full rate manufacturing and stockpile production will be pursued.  If the FDA mandates post-marketing surveillance studies, they will be conducted during Production and Deployment.

NEXT GENERATION DIAGNOSTICS SYSTEM (NGDS)

The term "Role" is used to describe the stratification of the four tiers in which medical support is organized, on a progressive basis, to conduct treatment, evaluation, resupply, and functions essential to the maintenance of the health of the force.  Role 3 support is normally provided at Division or Service equivalent level and includes specialist laboratory resources.  The NGDS Inc 1 program has a streamlined MS A to MS C - Limited Deployment acquisition strategy.  The NGDS Inc 1 is intended to replace the legacy Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS) beginning in FY17.  NGDS Increment 2 (NGDS Inc 2) will complement NGDS Inc 1 by developing diagnostic capabilities for biological pathogens and toxins and address diagnostics for chemical and radiological exposures, and to provide capability to lower echelons of care.

NGDS Increment 2 will conduct technology development FY14-FY16 prior to MS B.  The acquisition strategy and capability to be developed will be informed by the results of the Analysis of Alternatives to be completed 4QFY14.  NGDS Increment 2 is intended to be complementary to NGDS Increment 1 to expand the breadth and depth of diagnostics to CBR threats, pre-symptomatic diagnostics, and far forward echelons of care.

MB7 funds will support development, testing, and FDA approval of additional assays after system fielding.

BOTULINUM  VACCINE (VAC BOT)

The Prime System Contractor (Dynport Vaccine Company/DVC LLC, Frederick MD) will function as the FDA regulatory sponsor and will perform all ancillary, regulatory, quality assurance, and data management as required by the FDA.  The current budget supports development through FDA licensure of a recombinant bivalent (A and B) botulinum vaccine.  Other serotypes will be developed through an evolutionary approach, as funding becomes available.  The Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) phase included the manufacture of candidate current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) lots, animal safety testing, and initial clinical trials.  During this phase, the vaccine was evaluated for safety and immunogenicity in a small human clinical trial (Phase 1).  During the Engineering Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase, the prime contractor stabilized the vaccine formulation, validated the manufacturing process and testing protocols, optimized the delivery systems and manufactured consistency lots.  Phase 2 clinical trials were performed and provided additional safety data.  The remaining efforts to be conducted during the SDD phase include the Phase 3 clinical trial to demonstrate safety in an expanded volunteer population and evaluation of efficacy in pivotal animal studies to satisfy FDA requirements for the Animal Rule.  The Low rate Initial Production (LRIP) decision will be conducted after the manufacturing process has been validated and consistency lots have been produced.  A Biologics License Application is submitted to the FDA will all clinical, nonclinical, and manufacturing data.  The FDA grants licensure to products that are determined to be safe and efficacious.

PLAGUE VACCINE (VAC PLG)

The Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) phase included the manufacture of candidate current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) lots, animal safety testing, and initial clinical trials.  During this phase, the vaccine was evaluated for safety and immunogenicity in a small human clinical trial (Phase 1).  In order to reduce technical program risk in the Plague vaccine program, the program office conducted competitive prototyping between a US vaccine candidate and a United Kingdom vaccine candidate.  During the 2008 Resource Allocation Decision, the US Plague Vaccine candidate was selected for development through licensure under a Prime System Contract.  The Prime System Contractor (Dynport Vaccine Company/DVC LLC, Frederick MD) currently functions as the FDA regulatory sponsor and performs all ancillary, regulatory, quality assurance, and data management as required by the FDA.  A Project Arrangement is in place with the United Kingdom and Canada.  During the Engineering Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase, the prime contractor stabilized the vaccine formulation, validated the manufacturing process and testing protocols, optimized the delivery systems and manufactured consistency lots.  Phase 2 clinical trials were performed and provided additional safety data.  The remaining efforts to be conducted during the EMD phase include the Phase 3 clinical trial to demonstrate safety in an expanded volunteer population and evaluation of efficacy and duration of protection in pivotal animal studies to satisfy FDA requirements for the Animal Rule .  The Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) decision will be conducted after the manufacturing process has been validated and consistency lots have been produced.  A Biologics License Application will be submitted to the FDA with all clinical, nonclinical, and manufacturing data.  The FDA grants licensure to products that are determined to be safe and efficacious.  Currently, the Phase 3 clinical trial has been delayed about 12-14 months due to new guidance from the FDA that all documentation concerning vaccine production (large scale engineering and consistency lot manufacturing) and formulation and Fill/Finish (vialing) must be completed and approved prior to the start of the Phase 3 clinical trial.  This was normally done concurrently with the Phase 3 clinical trial.

SPECIAL IMMUNIZATION PROGRAM (VAC SIP)

The SIP effort is to store IND vaccines used to potentially provide additional protection to laboratory workers performing research on the infectious agents for Tularemia, Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE), Western Equine Encephalitis (WEE), Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis (VEE), and Q-Fever.  Efforts include Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) storage and periodic potency testing to support the FDA regulated Investigational New Drug (IND) reporting requirements.  This Department of Defense program supports the Federal interagency with this effort, as well as academic and industry partners.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

This project supports efforts in the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) phase of the acquisition strategy for prophylactic, pre-treatment, and therapeutic drugs and diagnostic medical devices for the protection, treatment, detection, and medical management of chemical warfare agent exposures.  Project funds research and development of safety studies, manufacturing scale-up, process validation, drug interaction, performance test, and submission of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) drug licensure application(s).  This program currently funds: (1) Bioscavenger (BSCAV), a new capability, to be used as a prophylaxis against nerve agents; (2) Advanced Anticonvulsant System (AAS), which consists of the drug midazolam in an autoinjector, to be used as an enhanced treatment for nerve agent induced seizures and will be a replacement for the currently fielded Convulsant Antidote for Nerve Agent (CANA) autoinjector, which uses diazepam; and (3) Improved Nerve Agent Treatment System (INATS) an enhanced nerve agent treatment regimen consisting of an improved oxime to replace the current fielded oxime 2-pralidoxime chloride (2-PAM), a centrally acting therapeutic to increase survival, and studies to generate data to support use of pyridostigmine bromide (PB), as a pretreatment for nerve agents in addition to soman.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The Advanced Anticonvulsant System, consists of Midazolam in an autoinjector for treatment of nerve agent induced seizures.  Midazolam, injected intramuscularly, will treat traditional nerve agent and non-traditional agent-induced seizures and prevent subsequent neurological damage.  Midazolam is more water-soluble than diazepam (the currently fielded medication to control nerve agent-induced seizures) and terminates nerve agent-induced seizures more quickly than diazepam.  AAS will not eliminate the need for other protective and therapeutic systems.

A contractor shall be responsible for conducting activities associated with drug development in a manner consistent with eventual approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  The contractor shall sponsor the drug to the FDA and hold all approvals and/or licenses.  During the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) Phase, large scale manufacturing, Phase 2 human clinical safety studies and definitive animal efficacy studies will be conducted.  FDA approval of the countermeasure is an exit criterion for the SDD phase.  During the Production and Deployment Phase, sufficient quantities of product to meet Initial Operational Capability will be purchased.  Subsequent purchases will be made by the Defense Logistics Agency.  Any post-marketing surveillance requested by the FDA will be the responsibility of the contractor.

In addition, the program will assess the viability of establishing an alternative manufacturing capability for currently fielded autoinjectors used for therapeutic treatment and medical management of chemical warfare agent exposures.

BIOSCAVENGER (BSCAV)

Used a serial evaluation of candidates to achieve competitive prototyping in the Technology Development Phase which culminated in a down-select decision.  The Bioscavenger program issued a Request For Proposal (RFP) to select the best value for the government for a prophylaxis to support an initial limited user group.  During the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) phase the program will continue to exercise management oversight with system integration support of a commercial partner to ensure that manufacturing of the product is in accordance with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations and guidelines.  The RFP for product manufacturing includes options for transition to the Medical Countermeasures Initiative (MCMI) Advanced Development and Manufacturing (ADM) capability.  Prior to FDA licensure, a commercial partner will perform a Phase 2 human clinical safety study, definitive animal efficacy studies, and toxicology studies.  The system integrator will also develop and manufacture a product formulation and delivery system and will submit a New Drug Application and seek FDA approval.  The SDD phase will culminate in FDA licensure of the Bioscavenger.  During the Production and Deployment phase, the Bioscavenger program, in conjunction with a commercial partner, will pursue full rate production and conduct any FDA-mandated post-marketing surveillance studies.  Concurrently the Bioscavenger program will conduct an analysis of alternative manufacturing technologies, investigate additional product indications, and pursue an expanded force prophylaxis once alternate technologies have matured.

IMPROVED NERVE AGENT TREATMENT SYSTEM (INATS)

The Improved Nerve Agent Treatment System (INATS) advanced development provides an enhanced capability treatment regimen offering greater protection over a broader spectrum of toxic nerve agent threats.  Components of the development include (1) a new and improved oxime (replacing 2-pralidoxime chloride (2-PAM)) to provide protection across current and emerging threats, (2) expanded nerve agent indications for a fielded, single indication, pyridostigmine bromide (PB) product, and (3) insertion of a centrally-acting (CA) anticholinergic agent to the treatment regimen to increase survivability and decrease morbidity.  The INATS treatment regimen both improves the performance of, and eventually replaces the Antidote Treatment Nerve Agent Auto-injector (ATNAA), while expanding warfighter pretreatment options. 

INATS' evolutionary Acquisition Strategy, recently expanded by the Joint Program Executive Office, Chemical and Biological Defense (JPEO-CBD) to (1) align all Department of Defense nerve agent therapeutics under it, and to (2) insert a centrally-acting (CA) anticholinergic agent, employs an incremental approach to provide independent, and more rapid deliveries of oxime, expanded PB indications, and CA capabilities than in a combined treatment regimen delivery.  To accomplish this, separate Milestone B and C reviews for the oxime and CA developments, and decision reviews for PB expansion beyond the combined-development Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TM&amp;RR) Phase will be conducted.  In the TMRR phase, close collaborations will occur between the Joint Program Manager - Medical Countermeasure Systems (JPM-MCS)), and the science/ technology, and user communities to assess technical viability, capability delivery options, and to refine operational concepts; the Government will be the systems integrator overseeing the conduct of oxime and centrally acting formulation development efforts, nonclinical toxicology and efficacy studies, clinical safety studies, and efficacy studies addressing the PB indication.  In the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase for the oxime and CA each capability, the Government will continue as system integrator with integration support from commercial partners to ensure that INATS development and manufacture is in accordance with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations and guidelines; the commercial integration partner(s) will perform a Phase 2 human clinical safety study, nonclinical toxicology studies and definitive animal efficacy studies; the system integrator will also oversee the manufacture of improved oxime and CA formulations and delivery system that is stable under operationally relevant temperatures.  The system integrator will submit a New Drug Application and seek FDA approval for the INATS product.  In the Production and Deployment (P&amp;D) Phase, the system integrator, with a commercial partner, will pursue full-rate and stockpile production and will conduct any FDA mandated post-marketing surveillance studies; the system integrator will transfer contracting/logistical responsibilities to the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) while remaining to monitor program performance through disposal as the life-cycle manager.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This funding supports the Chemical Biological Defense Portfolio (CBDP) Test Equipment, Strategy, and Support (TESS) efforts.  TESS provides test infrastructure products for testing and evaluating chemical and biological defense systems throughout the life cycle acquisition process.  TESS test infrastructure products are aligned in four groups to include: (1) Sense Laboratory (Chemical); (2) Sense Laboratory ((Biological); (3) Sense (Field); and (4) Individual Protection, Collective Protection and Decontamination (Shield and Sustain).

(1) Sense Laboratory (Chemical) : The products for this area are the Dynamic Test Chamber (DTC) for chemical point sensors, and Non-Traditional Agent Defense Test System (NTADTS).  The DTC provides a new capability for testing chemical point detection systems against chemical warfare agents in various environmental conditions.  The NTADTS provides a new capability to conduct chemical defense testing against current and emerging threats.  The NTADTS supports testing of Decontamination, Collective Protection, Individual Protection, and Contamination Avoidance products.  The CBD acquisition programs supported are Dismounted Reconnaissance Sets Kits and Outfits (DR SKO), Next Generation Chemical Detector (NGCD), Joint Sensitive Equipment Wipes (JSEW), and Common Analytical Laboratory System (CALS).

(2) Sense Laboratory (Biological): The product for this area is the Whole System Live Agent Test (WSLAT) Chamber.  The WSLAT Chamber supports testing of all biological point detection systems in production configuration in biological live agent Biological Safety Level 3 (BSL-3) environments.  The CBD acquisition programs supported are the Joint Biological Tactical Detection System (JBTDS) and the Joint USFK Point and Integrated Threat Recognition (JUPITR) Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD).

(3) Sense (Field): The product for this area is a fully instrumented simulant Test Grid.  The Test Grid effort provides a fully instrumented grid for chemical and biological simulant field test capabilities that integrate referee systems; dissemination equipment; cloud tracking equipment; meteorological equipment; and test Data Management System (DMS).  The CBD acquisition programs supported are the Joint Expeditionary Collective Protection (JECP), Next Generation Chemical Detector (NGCD), Joint Biological Tactical Detection System (JBTDS) and the Joint USFK Point and Integrated Threat Recognition (JUPITR) Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD).

(4) Individual Protection, Collective Protection and Decontamination (Shield and Sustain): IPEMS provides an articulated robotic mannequin that simulates Warfighters activities and includes under ensemble agent sensing capability for evaluating IPE against chemical warfare agents.  IPEMS consists of an articulated robotic mannequin, exposure chamber, control room, and real time under-ensemble sensor system.  The individual protective equipment CBD programs supported include: Uniform Integrated Protection Ensemble Increment 1 (UIPE 1), UIPE Increment 2, Joint Service Aircrew Mask Fixed Wing (JSAM FW) and Rotary Wing (JSAM RW), and the Joint Service General Purpose Mask (JSGPM).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Budget Activity includes research, development, testing and evaluation management support for the Department of Defense (DoD) Chemical and Biological Defense Program (CBDP).

Program Element 0605384BP supports Joint Doctrine and Training (Project DT6), sustains the technical test capability at West Desert Test Center (WDTC) (Project DW6); sustains the core Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&amp;T) laboratory infrastructure (Project LS6), provides for program management and financial management support (Project MS6), and supports the Joint Concept Development and Experimentation (JCDE) program (Project O49).  

The Joint Training and Doctrine Support (DT6) project funds development of Joint Doctrine and Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) for developing CB defense systems.  This project also funds CB modeling and simulation to support the Warfighter.

The Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB) is a set of test installations, facilities, and ranges which are regarded as "national assets".  These assets are sized, operated, and maintained primarily for DoD test and evaluation missions.  However, the MRTFB facilities and ranges are also available to commercial and other users on a reimbursable basis.  WDTC is designated as the primary element of the MRTFB to primarily conduct CB Defense test and evaluation.  The DW6 Project provides operating funds to WDTC to ensure that DoD test customers are only charged direct costs of testing and that overhead expenses are centrally funded.  It finances the required institutional test operating costs.  Institutional test operating costs include institutional civilian and contractor labor; repair and maintenance of test instrumentation, equipment, and facilities; and replacement of test equipment.

The Laboratory Support (LS6) project funds laboratory infrastructure to maintain and enhance DoD infrastructure capabilities to counter an expanding threat space, exploit advances in technology; and develop and transition CB defense equipment and countermeasures to the Warfighter.

The management support (MS6) project, provides management support for the DoD CBDP to allow program overview and integration of overall medical and non-medical programs by the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Nuclear, Chemical, and Biological Defense Programs (ASD(NCB)), through the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Chemical Biological Defense Programs (DATSD(CBD)); funds management by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA); Development, coordination, and approval of joint CBRND requirements, management of multi-service and joint CBRND doctrine, tactics, techniques and procedures; training, leader development, education, exercises, and development of the CBDP Program Objective Memorandum (POM) by the Joint Requirements Office; Joint RDA planning, input to the Annual Report to Congress and Program Objective Memorandum (POM) development by the Program Analysis and Integration Office (PAIO); review of Joint plans and the consolidated CB Defense POM Strategy by Army in its Executive Agent role.  

The management support project also funds the Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) Executive mission to establish test infrastructure investment strategy and adequate testing for Developmental Testing (DT) and Operational Testing (OT) of Department of Defense (DoD) Chemical Biological Defense (CBD) systems and components throughout the systems' acquisition life cycle, as required in the RDA Plan under the Joint Test Infrastructure Working Group (JTIWG) program.  The JTIWG program funds T&amp;E Early Involvement, test threat planning, Fielded Equipment Assessments, T&amp;E studies, and T&amp;E Standards planning and development to support testing the CBD systems for all services to include radiological, nuclear, medical T&amp;E efforts.  

The Joint Concept Development and Experimentation (O49) project funds the planning, conduct, evaluation, and reporting on Joint tests (for other than developmental hardware) and accomplishment of operational research assessments in support of requirements received from the Services and the Combatant Commanders for already fielded equipment and systems.

This Budget Activity also funds Program Element 0605502BP, which supports the Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) program.  The overall objective of the Chemical and Biological Defense (CBD) SBIR program is to improve the transition or transfer of innovative CBD technologies between DoD components and the private sector for mutual benefit.  The CBD program includes those technology efforts that maximize a strong defensive posture in a CB environment using passive and active means as deterrents.  These technologies include CB detection; information assessment (identification, modeling, and intelligence); contamination avoidance; and protection of both individual soldiers and equipment.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project provides the technical and operational capability for testing Department of Defense (DoD) Chemical and Biological (CB) defense materiel, equipment, and systems from concept through production at West Desert Test Center (WDTC), a Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB) located at Dugway Proving Ground (DPG).  Project provides overhead (institutional) funding required to operate WDTC in compliance with Section 232 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for FY03 (Public Law 107-314 - December 2002). 

WDTC is the reliance center for all DoD CB defense testing and provides the United States' only combined range, chamber, toxic chemical lab, and bio-safety level-3 (BSL-3) test facility.  Total institutional test operating costs are to be provided by the OSD Chemical and Biological Defense Program IAW Program Budget Decision 250 (1996).  

WDTC uses state-of-the-art chemical and life sciences test facilities and test chambers to perform CB defense testing of protective gear, decontamination systems, detectors, equipment, and non-materiel CB defense solutions while maintaining safety, security, and surety of chemical agents and biological pathogens.  WDTC also provides a fully instrumented outdoor range capability for testing with simulants that can be correlated to the laboratory testing with live agents to ensure reliable and repeatable data is generated to support acquisition decisions of CB defense equipment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The SBIR Program is a Congressionally mandated program established to increase the participation of small business in federal research and development (R&amp;D).  Currently, each participating government agency must reserve 2.5% of its extramural R&amp;D for SBIR awards to competing small businesses.  The goal of the SBIR Program is to invest in the innovative capabilities of the small business community to help meet government R&amp;D objectives while allowing small companies to develop technologies and products which they can then commercialize through sales back to the government or in the private sector.

The Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Program like SBIR, is a Government-wide program, mandated by the Small Business Research and Development Enhancement Act of 1992, PL 102-564.  STTR was established in FY94 as a three-year pilot program.  In early 1996, the General Accounting Office (GAO) conducted a comprehensive review of the Government-wide STTR Program to determine the effectiveness of the pilot program.  Upon review of the GAO report, Congress voted to reauthorize the STTR Program to the year 2000, consistent with the authorization period for the SBIR Program.

STTR was established as a companion program to the SBIR Program and is executed in essentially the same manner; however, there are several distinct differences.  The STTR Program provides a mechanism for participation by university, Federally-Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), and other non-profit research institutions.  Specifically, the STTR Program is designed to provide an incentive for small companies and research at academic institutions and non-profit research and development institutions to work together to move emerging technical ideas from the laboratory to the marketplace to foster high-tech economic development and to advance U.S. economic competitiveness.  Each STTR proposal must be submitted by a team which includes a small business (as the prime contractor for contracting purposes) and at least one research institution, which have entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement for the purposes of the STTR effort.  Furthermore, the project must be divided up such that the small business performs at least 40% of the work and the research institution(s) performs at least 30% of the work.  The remainder of the work may be performed by either party or a third party.  The budget is separate from the SBIR budget and is significantly smaller (0.15% of the extramural R&amp;D budget vs.  2.5% for the SBIR Program).

The DoD has consolidated management and oversight of the CBDP into a single office within the OSD.  The Army was designated as the Executive Agent for coordination and integration of the Chemical and Biological Defense (CBD) program.  The executive agent for the SBIR/STTR portion of the program is the Army Research Office-Washington.

The overall objective of the CBD SBIR/STTR program is to improve the transition or transfer of innovative CBD technologies between DoD components and the private sector for mutual benefit.  The CBD program includes those technology efforts that maximize a strong defensive posture in a biological or chemical environment using passive and active means as deterrents.  These technologies include chemical and biological detection; information assessment, which includes identification, modeling, and intelligence; contamination avoidance; and protection of both individual soldiers and equipment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear Dismounted Reconnaissance Systems (CBRN DRS) program uses a government-off-the-shelf (GOTS)/commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) non-developmental item (NDI) single step acquisition approach to full capability.  This strategy employs an NDI acquisition concept to establish a simplified management framework to translate mission needs and emerging technology capabilities into a stable, affordable, and well-managed acquisition program.  CBRN DRS systems will be produced using a workshare approach between Organic assets and Contractor workforce.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

The JSGPM Advanced Respiratory Protection Initiative (ARPI) effort is using the M61 filter contracts awarded to 3M and Avon to develop improved filters for the JSGPM.  There is a continual technology refreshment CLIN that allows for filter development tasks to be awarded under this contract.  The tasks can be competed between the two awardees or award to both to ensure competition on future spares and delivery orders.  As filter technologies transition from the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) and Joint Science and Technology Office (JSTO), the technologies will be matured from system/subsystem prototyping demonstration technologies at Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 to actual system "mission proven" through successful mission operations in a mission environment at TRL 9.  There are multiple technologies being explored by DTRA, thus, this is a continual product improvement effort to enhance filtration.  The JSGPM ARPI effort will investigate alternative designs and modifications to ZZAT (Zirconium hydroxide, Zinc, Argentum (Silver), Triethylene di-amine (TEDA)) to further increase filtration of TICs and Chemical Warfare Agents (CWA).  ZZAT is a zirconium hydroxide based filtration media that can potentially be layered with carbon.  The first technology, known as Cobalt-Zinc ZZAT (CoZZAT), uses a layered bed of carbon concept to improve TIC and CWA protection capabilities, while the second technology known as Metal Organic Framework (MOF), is an engineered media that is a porous crystalline compound made up of metal ions and organic bridging molecules (ligands) for targeted removal of chemicals.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project provides for the upgrade and modernization of fielded Information Systems including the Joint Effects Model (JEM) and the Joint Warning and Reporting Network (JWARN).  This project also provides for the Software Support Activity (SSA).

Efforts included in this project are: (1) Joint Effects Model (JEM); (2) the Joint Warning and Reporting Network (JWARN); and (3) Software Support Activity (SSA).

JEM and JWARN utilize the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) Manual prescribed Agile Information Technology Box "IT Box" construct for managing requirements for the follow-on increments of capability development.  The "IT Box" is an acquisition approach and methodology regarding how software systems should be developed and fielded.  It is a process that differs from the way DoD acquires hardware systems.  The acquisition approach uses the Information Systems Initial Capabilities Document (IS ICD) to describe the required operational capabilities for the entire development effort.  These overarching requirements are further broken out into Requirements Definition Packages (RDPs) released over the life of the product instead of a single Capability Development Document released early in the program.  

IT Box enables programs to tailor the incrementally fielded software program model in the DODI 5000.02 Interim to conduct multiple, more frequent fielding events in lieu of a single fielding event.  Programs conduct a single Milestone B (MSB) decision by the Milestone Decision Authority that covers the entire program.  MSB is followed by a series of supporting Build Decisions (BDs), delegated to Joint Project Manager Information Systems, associated with each RDP as they are released.  The supporting BDs will ensure incorporation of mature technology and development efforts culminating in incremental deliveries of capability to Joint and Service Command and Control (C2) architectures.  Instead of a single Milestone C decision and fielding event for one increment, the program will return to the MDA for more frequent fielding decisions, as often as annually, as portions of capability are determined suitable and operationally effective.  These multiple fielding efforts are based on providing capabilities with the most value to the operators based on Warfighter priorities/needs, maturation of the technology being incorporated and available resources supporting the effort.  

As software-intensive systems, both JEM and JWARN have no separately identifiable unit production components.  Both are designated ACAT III programs and unit cost calculations including Program Acquisition Unit Cost/Average Procurement Unit Cost (PAUC/APUC) and Operations and Sustainment (O&amp;S) average annual per unit costs are not applicable.

The Software Support Activity (SSA) is a Chem-Bio Defense user developmental support and service organization to facilitate net-centric interoperability of systems in acquisition for the Warfighter.  The SSA provides the CBRN Warfighter with Joint Service solutions for Integrated Architectures, Data Management/Modeling, Information Assurance (IA), Interoperability Certifications, Verification, Validation and Accreditation (VV&amp;A) to support interoperable and integrated net-centric, service-oriented solutions for CBRN systems.  The SSA emphasizes development of reference implementations to guide Government and industry system and software developers to ensure that their products meet common interoperability standards.  The latest technologies/products include the definition of a Common CBRN Sensor Integration Standard (CCSI) and the CBRN Data Model.  These technologies and direct enablers for the development of CBRN integrated sensor networks and the dissemination of CBRN information across all users.  The SSA directly supports Chemical and Biological Defense Program (CBDP) initiatives by providing common service oriented architectures and frameworks for the collection and dissemination of Bio-Surveillance and other critical CBRN information.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>JOINT EFFECTS MODEL (JEM)

JEM Increment 2 acquisition will utilize the JROC's "IT Box" construct for software development.  The intent is to provide the next generation of capability with current and future technologies, as stated in the IS ICD, in less time and fielding products to the service more frequently than an incremental delivery approach.

As part of this strategy, JEM program office developed and issued a competitive prototyping contract in April 2013 where two offerers were given the same Technical Data Package (TDP), performance Work Statement (PWS), and software requirements and were tasked to deliver a JEM prototype that implements the CCMI architecture.  This competitive prototyping strategy
was successful and a single JEM integrator, General Dynamics Information Technology (GDIT), was selected as the prime development contract in December 2013. 

The current contractor for JEM 2.0 will provide all capabilities defined in the Requirement Definition Package 1 (RDP-1) document produced by the Joint Requirements Office (JRO).  The JRO will release RDPs-2, 3, and 4 over the next three years prior to contract completion.  It is anticipated when the contract is re-competed in FY18 that there will be four of five capability drops not yet developed under RDP-2 and two of five under RDP-3.  The follow-on contract in FY18 will be responsible for developing the remaining capabilities under the JEM 2.0 contract.  The JEM follow-on contract will utilize full and open competition and will be referred to as the JEM development, modernization and sustainment contract.

The JEM IS ICD describes the notional implementation plan for fielding of future JEM capabilities among four separate JEM Requirement Definition Packages (RDPs).  RDP-1 contains the baseline capabilities for software and was released in June of 2014.  RDP-2 will be released after the completion of RDP-1.  This RDP will incorporate emerging capabilities that the Joint Science and Technology Office determines has reached a sufficient enough maturity for incorporation into JEM, such as ability to model new agents.  Requirements to integrate baseline capabilities into a version that can be fielded on service C2 systems will be released in RDP-3.  RDP-3 will be released following RDP-1 but prior to RDP-2, to rapidly allow baseline capabilities to be incorporated into C2 systems.  RDP-4 is a notional package that would allow the Science and Technology community a venue to use the JEM program to develop a version of the product for S&amp;T use.  Capabilities that are only required for the Science and Technology community and not for operational users would be implemented in RDP-4.  Capabilities in RDP-4 would not be required to go to Operational Test, as they would not be fielded to operational users. 

RDP 1 - Baseline Capabilities: There are 5 planned Capability Drops (CD) within RDP 1.
RDP 2 - Emerging Capabilities: There are 5 planned Capability Drops (CD) within RDP 2.
RDP 3 - C2 Integration: There are 8 planned Capability Drops (CD) within RDP 3 tied to all the various Strategic and Service C2 Systems
RDP 4 - Analytical Support: There are 2 planned Capability Drops (CD) within RDP 4.

After an over-arching MS B with the MDA, each RDP will have an associated Build Decision.  Each CD will have an associated fielding decision.

JOINT WARNING &amp; REPORTING NETWORK (JWARN)

JWARN Increment 2 utilizes the JROC's "IT Box" construct for software requirements management and development.  The intent is to provide the next generation of capability with current and future technologies, as stated in the IS ICD, in less time and away from an incremental delivery approach.  This effort is being executed under a Cost-Plus-Award Term Incentive structure to gain maximum benefit to the Government in maintaining the fielded baseline and future software capability development and was awarded under a full and open competition Request for Proposal (RFP).  The JWARN Program will procure a Sensor Connectivity Capability (SCC) (hardware materiel solution) in order to facilitate the transfer of CBRN sensor information from legacy CBRN sensors to DoD networks.  This solution will be external to the CBRN Sensors and Service-identified network transmission device(s).

SOFTWARE SUPPORT ACTIVITY (SSA)

The SSA provides enterprise-wide services and coordination across all CBDP programs that contain data or software, or are capable of linking to the Global Information Grid (GIG).  The SSA facilitates interoperability, integration, and supportability of existing and developing IT and National Security Systems (NSS).  Phase 1a identifies CBDP programs that deal with data or software, and have an IT component.  This will be followed by coordination to facilitate the concepts of interoperability, integration and supportability of enterprise-wide services.  Next follows work with user communities to develop and demonstrate enterprise-wide common architectures, products and services.  Phase 2 will support the application of the enterprise-wide architectures, products and services into the programs, with verification of compliance with the defined products and services.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project provides for the upgrade and modernization of fielded Medical Biological defense equipment/systems including the Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS) and Next Generation Diagnostic Systems (NGDS) suite.  

JBAIDS is a commercial off-the-shelf development/production effort started in August 2003 that focused on rapid development and fielding efforts to deliver a critical capability to identify bacterial and viral agents in environmental surveillance and clinical specimen sample types.  By 2005, 16 biological warfare (BW) agent surveillance detection kits were fielded along with the first JBAIDS in vitro diagnostic (IVD) assay cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  JBAIDS currently has seven IVD kits cleared by the FDA, JBAIDS achieved full operational capability (340 systems delivered all Services) in July 2011.  JBAIDS efforts in 2012-2016 will focus on adding surveillance food and water pathogen detection assays as well as laptop retrofit and fielding.  Also, the development team will focus on completing Pre-Emergency Use Authorization (Pre-EUA's) packages annually for FDA review.  The operational development RDT&amp;E funds will be used to oversee the configuration management of the system to include the conduct of annual software security information assurance (IA) updates on fielded software and monitor analyzer/laptop parts obsolescence.


The NGDS is an evolutionary acquisition family of systems to provide increments of capability over time across many echelons of the Combat Health Support System.  The mission of the NGDS is to provide Chemical, Biological and Radiological (CBR) threat and infectious disease identification and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared diagnostics to inform individual patient treatment as defined in the approved NGDS Capabilities Development Document (CDD) and CBR situational awareness and disease surveillance as defined in the Common Analytical Laboratory (CALS) CDD.  NGDS Increment 1 (NGDS Inc 1) will significantly improve diagnostic capability for deployable combat health support units (Role 3) while also improving operational suitability and affordability by developing FDA cleared biological warfare agent (BWA) and infectious disease in vitro diagnostic (IVD) assays on existing commercial diagnostic device with a well established FDA regulatory history and pipeline of commercial non-BWA infectious disease diagnostic tests.  The NGDS Inc 1 program has a streamlined MS A to MS C - Limited Deployment acquisition strategy.  BA7 funds will be used to complete the development of assays initiated during the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) phase and needed for JBAIDS replacement as well as fund the development of three objective assays (Burkholderia, Alpha Virus, and Orthopox).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) was selected to design and manufacture additional surveillance assay kits to detect food and water pathogens, along with diagnostic kits to detect additional threat agents.  The program plans to conduct the annual JBAIDS Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) software compliance certification in addition to any logistics sustainment issues associated with parts obsolescence.  Additionally, the JBAIDS program office continues to partner with the US Army Medical Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), other DoD and US Government laboratories to develop FDA Pre-Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) packages for biological warfare agents (BWA's) that could be used as biological warfare threats to DoD military forces.

NEXT GENERATION DIAGNOSTICS SYSTEM (NGDS)

The term "Role" is used to describe the stratification of the four tiers in which medical support is organized, on a progressive basis, to conduct treatment, evaluation, resupply, and functions essential to the maintenance of the health of the force.  Role 3 support is normally provided at Division or Service equivalent level and includes specialist laboratory resources.  The NGDS Inc 1 program has a streamlined MS A to MS C - Limited Deployment acquisition strategy.  The NGDS Inc 1 is intended to replace the legacy Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS) beginning in FY17.  NGDS Increment 2 (NGDS Inc 2) will complement NGDS Inc 1 by developing diagnostic capabilities for biological pathogens and toxins and address diagnostics for chemical and radiological exposures, and to provide capability to lower echelons of care.

NGDS Increment 2 will conduct technology development FY14-FY16 prior to MS B.  The acquisition strategy and capability to be developed will be informed by the results of the Analysis of Alternatives to be completed 4QFY14.  NGDS Increment 2 is intended to be complementary to NGDS Increment 1 to expand the breadth and depth of diagnostics to CBR threats, pre-symptomatic diagnostics, and far forward echelons of care.

MB7 funds will support development, testing, and FDA approval of additional assays after system fielding.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
