                                    <r2:ProgramElementNote>This program element (PE) incorporates Minerva Research Initiative activities, which include university-led basic research in social science and sponsored research faculty chair positions at defense education institutions, and activities to implement the basic research office strategic plan for the Department of Defense (DoD).</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Basic research provides the DoD with a deep and broad awareness of current directions in science and engineering through the scientific performers in areas of research that are important to U.S. military capabilities including, among others, physics and the physical sciences, materials science, chemistry and chemical engineering, electrical engineering, applied mathematics, computer science, mechanical and aerodynamic engineering, ocean sciences, biological sciences, and the social sciences.  Basic research sustains scientific and engineering communities in areas that form the critical technical underpinnings of DoD capabilities.  Basic research through exploration and discovery provides the unique means for disruptive non-incremental advances that can improve or radically change military strategy and operations. 

The Minerva Research Initiative is a university-based social science basic research program directed from within the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and executed by the Services, consistent with the January 2012 priorities document "Sustaining U.S. Global Leadership: Priorities for 21st Century Defense" and the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) requirements.  This program seeks to build a deeper understanding of the social, cultural, and political forces that shape regions of the world of strategic importance to the United States.  Deeper understanding of the cultural and political environments where threats, such as radical actors and regime disruptions, develop supports more effective strategic and operational policy decisions.

The Strategic Support for Basic Research (SSBR) program funds initiatives to implement the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD(R&amp;E)) strategic plan for defense basic research.  This plan defines specific and quantifiable actions to help create conditions for defense basic research investments capable of creating high-payoff, transformative scientific breakthroughs for DoD.  The SSBR initiatives support the five aims of: (1) providing scientific leadership; (2) attracting the Nation’s best Scientists and Engineers (S&amp;Es); (3) ensuring the coherence and balance of the Basic Research portfolio; (4) fostering connections between DoD performers and DoD; and (5) improving the efficiency of the defense research business environment.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Basic research provides the DoD with a deep and broad awareness of current directions in science and engineering through the scientific performers in areas of research that are important to U.S. military capabilities including, among others, physics and the physical sciences, materials science, chemistry and chemical engineering, electrical engineering, applied mathematics, computer science, mechanical and aerodynamic engineering, ocean sciences, biological sciences, and the social sciences.  Basic research sustains scientific and engineering communities in areas that form the critical technical underpinnings of DoD capabilities.  Basic research through exploration and discovery provides the unique means for disruptive non-incremental advances that can improve or radically change military strategy and operations. 

The Minerva Research Initiative is a university-based social science basic research program directed from within the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and executed by the Services, consistent with the January 2012 priorities document "Sustaining U.S. Global Leadership: Priorities for 21st Century Defense" and the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) requirements.  This program seeks to build a deeper understanding of the social, cultural, and political forces that shape regions of the world of strategic importance to the United States.  Deeper understanding of the cultural and political environments where threats, such as radical actors and regime disruptions, develop supports more effective strategic and operational policy decisions.

The Strategic Support for Basic Research (SSBR) program funds initiatives to implement the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD(R&amp;E)) strategic plan for defense basic research.  This plan defines specific and quantifiable actions to help create conditions for defense basic research investments capable of creating high-payoff, transformative scientific breakthroughs for DoD.  The SSBR initiatives support the five aims of (1) providing scientific leadership; (2) attracting the Nation’s best Scientists and Engineers (S&amp;Es); (3) ensuring the coherence and balance of the Basic Research portfolio; (4) fostering connections between DoD performers and DoD; and (5) improving the efficiency of the defense research business environment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The purpose of the National Defense Education Program (NDEP) is to attract, engage, and develop current and future generations of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) talent to benefit the Department of Defense (DoD) mission.  NDEP is DoD’s primary program to execute high quality, experiential STEM efforts for pre-Kindergarten-12th Grade (PK-12) students through world-class researchers to address DoD’s STEM workforce needs, and to provide current and future scientific and technological capabilities.  NDEP initiatives align with the four priority areas of the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) Committee on STEM Education (CoSTEM) Federal Five-Year STEM Strategic Plan: (1) STEM teacher training, (2) groups underrepresented in STEM, (3) STEM undergraduate education, and (4) STEM engagement. 

NDEP consists of three components:  (1) Science, Mathematics, and Research for Transformation (SMART); (2) the National Security Science and Engineering Faculty Fellowship (NSSEFF); and (3) pre-Kindergarten-12th Grade (PK-12).  NDEP aligns to the Science and Technology (S&amp;T) priorities and emerging scientific research areas, the integrated STEM/Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Institutions (HBCU/MIs) synchronized with the Federal Five-Year STEM Strategic Plan, the DoD STEM Strategic Plan and the in-progress DoD Strategic Workforce Plan.  NDEP components are guided and informed by the Office of Management and Budget’s “Use of Evidence and Evaluation in the 2014” memorandum and are consistent with Government Accountability Office guidance on assessment and evaluation practices. 

SMART awards highly competitive scholarships-for-service to undergraduate and graduate students in 19 academic STEM disciplines and moves graduates directly into DoD's workforce following graduation.  Internships provide SMART scholars with an opportunity to engage in hands-on research and work experiences in DoD labs, thereby enhancing their educational experience and building a public service commitment to the Department’s mission.  Since its inception as a pilot program in FY 2005, SMART has supported approximately 1,130 students from bachelor’s to doctoral levels and to date approximately 550 have completed program studies and transitioned into the DoD workforce.  SMART ensures that DoD has a steady infusion of highly educated, high caliber U.S. technical talent, prepared in areas of critical importance to DoD, ready to apply their technical knowledge, skills, and abilities to help DoD fulfill its mission. 

NSSEFF supports 29 world-class researchers (NSSEFF Fellows) in areas of critical importance to DoD and ensures the cultivation of exceptional future talent.  The NSSEFF Fellows work with approximately 100 undergraduate students, 200 graduate students, and 100 post-doctoral scholars at their respective academic institutions.  Three cohorts of NSSEFF Fellows, with the first selected in FY 2008, have provided critical connections between academia and the DoD science and engineering enterprise.  Fellows’ work spans all seven DoD S&amp;T priorities and the six emerging scientific research areas.  NSSEFF Fellows serve as speakers at DoD events, reviewers on panels for DoD science, and as collaborators with scientists and engineers at DoD’s laboratories and other research facilities.

NDEP PK-12 engages, develops, and attracts STEM talent for future DoD military and civilian workforce needs via 68 local sites and nine national organizations.  NDEP PK-12 leverages the DoD’s STEM expertise to connect students, teachers, schools, and public sector and industry partners with DoD subject matter experts (SMEs) primarily in those communities adjacent to DoD laboratories and bases where the talent pool resides.  Authentic STEM experiences for teachers and students include hands-on activities that are aligned with DoD’s technical workforce requirements.  Since FY 2007, NDEP PK-12 has increased the number of DoD facilities that directly engage local education authorities (LEAs) to: (1) build student interest in STEM fields and disciplines and in careers specific to DoD; (2) develop DoD-relevant science, engineering and mathematics skills; and (3) provide future talent to fulfill DoD’s demand for highly skilled STEM professionals. NDEP PK-12 has utilized 4,100 exceptional DoD STEM professionals to reach 500,000 students and 8,300 teachers in 30 states. As one specific example, DoD SMEs contributed over 8,000 hours to lead FIRST Robotics Competition teams, with over 90 percent of team members reporting that the hands-on experience taught them about how science and technology can be used to solve real-world science and engineering problems.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The purpose of the National Defense Education Program (NDEP) is to attract, engage, and develop current and future generations of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) talent to benefit the Department of Defense (DoD) mission.  NDEP is DoD’s primary program to execute high quality, experiential STEM efforts for pre-Kindergarten-12th Grade (PK-12) students through world-class researchers to address DoD’s STEM workforce needs, and to provide current and future scientific and technological capabilities.  NDEP initiatives align with the four priority areas of the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) Committee on STEM Education (CoSTEM) Federal Five-Year STEM Strategic Plan: STEM teacher training, groups underrepresented in STEM, STEM undergraduate education, and STEM engagement. 

NDEP consists of three components:  (1) Science, Mathematics, and Research for Transformation (SMART); (2) the National Security Science and Engineering Faculty Fellowship (NSSEFF); and (3) pre-Kindergarten-12th Grade (PK-12).  NDEP aligns to the Science and Technology (S&amp;T) priorities and emerging scientific research areas, the integrated STEM/Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Institutions (HBCU/MIs) synchronized with the Federal Five-Year STEM Strategic Plan, the DoD STEM Strategic Plan and the in-progress DoD Strategic Workforce Plan.  NDEP components are guided and informed by the Office of Management and Budget’s “Use of Evidence and Evaluation in the 2014” memorandum and consistent with Government Accountability Office guidance on assessment and evaluation practices. 

SMART awards highly competitive scholarships-for-service to undergraduate and graduate students in 19 academic STEM disciplines and moves graduates directly into DoD's workforce following graduation.  Internships provide SMART scholars with an opportunity to engage in hands-on research and work experiences in DoD labs, thereby enhancing their educational experience and building a public service commitment to the Department’s mission.  Since its inception as a pilot program in FY 2005, SMART has supported approximately 1,130 students from bachelor’s to doctoral levels and to date approximately 550 have completed program studies and transitioned into the DoD workforce.  SMART ensures that DoD has a steady infusion of highly educated, high caliber U.S. technical talent, prepared in areas of critical importance to DoD, ready to apply their technical knowledge, skills, and abilities to help DoD fulfill its mission. 

NSSEFF supports 29 world-class researchers (NSSEFF Fellows) in areas of critical importance to DoD and ensures the cultivation of exceptional future talent.  The NSSEFF Fellows work with approximately 100 undergraduate students, 200 graduate students, and 100 post-doctoral scholars at their respective academic institutions.  Three cohorts of NSSEFF Fellows, with the first selected in FY 2008, have provided critical connections between academia and the DoD science and engineering enterprise.  Fellows’ work spans all seven DoD S&amp;T priorities and the six emerging scientific research areas.  NSSEFF Fellows serve as speakers at DoD events, reviewers on panels for DoD science, and as collaborators with scientists and engineers at DoD’s laboratories and other research facilities.

NDEP PK-12 engages, develops, and attracts STEM talent for future DoD military and civilian workforce needs via 68 local sites and nine national organizations.  NDEP PK-12 leverages the DoD’s STEM expertise to connect students, teachers, schools, and public sector and industry partners with DoD subject matter experts (SMEs) primarily in those communities adjacent to DoD laboratories and bases where the talent pool resides.  Authentic STEM experiences for teachers and students include hands-on activities that are aligned with DoD’s technical workforce requirements.  Since FY 2007, NDEP PK-12 has increased the number of DoD facilities that directly engage local education authorities (LEAs) to: (1) build student interest in STEM fields and disciplines and in careers specific to DoD; (2) develop DoD-relevant science, engineering and mathematics skills; and (3) provide future talent to fulfill DoD’s demand for highly skilled STEM professionals. NDEP PK-12 has utilized 4,100 exceptional DoD STEM professionals to reach 500,000 students and 8,300 teachers in 30 states. As one specific example, DoD SMEs contributed over 8,000 hours to lead FIRST Robotics Competition teams, with over 90 percent of team members reporting that the hands-on experience taught them about how science and technology can be used to solve real-world science and engineering problems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                        <r2:Description>SMART is a scholarship-for-service program that provides support to high performing U.S. graduate and undergraduate students in 19 academic STEM disciplines identified as areas of future workforce need by DoD.  

The disciplines align with the Department’s seven S&amp;T priorities and emerging scientific research areas.  The disciplines are: Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering; Biosciences; Chemical Engineering; Chemistry; Civil Engineering; Cognitive, Neural, and Behavioral Sciences; Computer Science; Electrical Engineering; Geosciences; Industrial and Systems Engineering; Information Sciences; Materials Science and Engineering; Mathematics; Mechanical Engineering; Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering; Nuclear Engineering; Oceanography; Operations Research; and Physics.  Upon completion of their degree, students fulfill a service commitment to DoD on a one-to-one payback per year of education funded.  In part, SMART success is measured by participants that remain in the DoD workforce beyond their required service commitment.

Oversight of the SMART program falls under the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (OASD(R&amp;E)).  Two types of individuals participate in the program: retention scholars who are current DoD employees and recruitment scholars who are college students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate programs and represent new talent for the DoD.  Internships provide SMART scholars with an opportunity to engage in hands-on research and work experiences in DoD labs, thereby enhancing their educational experience and building a public service commitment to the Department’s mission.

Since FY 2005, approximately 1,130 students have participated in SMART at approximately 160 sponsoring facilities.  As of July 2012, approximately 550 SMART scholars have transitioned into the service commitment phase.  To date, these scholars have transitioned as civilian employees into the Air Force, Army, Navy, and other DoD components.  Among those who transitioned to employment, 82 percent who have completed their service commitment are still employed by DoD beyond their original service commitment.</r2:Description>

The FY 2012 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) directed the OSD to retain oversight and execution of the HBCU/MI program.  Accordingly, FY 2012 funds were reprogrammed from Army PE 0601104A to OSD PE 0602228D8Z for program execution. 

The FY 2013 PBR requested funds for the HBCU/MI program under Army PE 0601104A.  To comply with direction of the Congress, OSD will submit a reprogramming request in FY 2013 to transfer funds from the Army PE 0601104A to OSD PE 0602228D8Z. 

In FY 2014, funding for the HBCU/MI program is requested under OSD budget activity 1, PE 0601228D8Z.  The OSD Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD(R&amp;E)) retains oversight and execution of the program.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The HBCU/MI program provides support in fields of science and engineering that are important to national defense.  The DoD HBCU/MI Program encourages participation of small minority schools as well as large minority research institutions.  This competitive program provides support through grants or contracts for research, education assistance, instrumentation purchases, and technical assistance as described below:

•  Research.  The research grants are to further the knowledge in the basic scientific disciplines through theoretical and experimental activities.  Collaborative research allows university professors to work directly with military laboratories or other universities.

•  Education.  Education assistance funds are used by minority institutions to strengthen their academic programs in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) thereby increasing the number of under-represented minorities obtaining undergraduate and graduate degrees in these fields.  These grants provide equipment, scholarships, cooperative work/study opportunities, visiting faculty programs, summer programs, and a variety of other enhancements designed to support students and to encourage them to pursue careers in STEM.

•  Infrastructure.  This program allows universities to purchase basic laboratory equipment for research and education program enhancements to highly sophisticated research instruments, such as lasers and spectrometers.

•  Technical assistance.  These funds are used to design programs that enhance the ability of minority institutions to successfully compete for future Defense funding. The objective is to assist the HBCU/MI community in areas such as proposal writing and administration of grants and contracts.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectNote>The FY 2012 President’s Budget Request (PBR) transferred the Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Institutions (HBCU/MI) program from the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) to the Army.  The FY 2012 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) directed the OSD to retain oversight and execution of the HBCU/MI program.  Accordingly, FY 2012 funds were reprogrammed from Army PE 0601104A to OSD PE 0602228D8Z for program execution. 

The FY 2013 PBR requested funds for the HBCU/MI program under Army PE 0601104A.  To comply with direction of the Congress, OSD will submit a reprogramming request in FY 2013 to transfer funds from the Army PE 0601104A to OSD PE 0602228D8Z. 

In FY 2014, funding for the HBCU/MI program is requested under OSD budget activity 1, PE 0601228D8Z.  The OSD Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD(R&amp;E)) retains oversight and execution of the program.</r2:ProjectNote>
                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The HBCU/MI program provides support in fields of science and engineering that are important to national defense.  The DoD HBCU/MI Program encourages participation of small minority schools as well as large minority research institutions.  This competitive program provides support through grants or contracts for research, education assistance, instrumentation purchases, and technical assistance as described below:

•  Research.  The research grants are to further the knowledge in the basic scientific disciplines through theoretical and experimental activities.  Collaborative research allows university professors to work directly with military laboratories or other universities.

•  Education.  Education assistance funds are used by minority institutions to strengthen their academic programs in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) thereby increasing the number of under-represented minorities obtaining undergraduate and graduate degrees in these fields.  These grants provide equipment, scholarships, cooperative work/study opportunities, visiting faculty programs, summer programs, and a variety of other enhancements designed to support students and to encourage them to pursue careers in STEM.

•  Infrastructure.  This program allows universities to purchase basic laboratory equipment for research and education program enhancements to highly sophisticated research instruments, such as lasers and spectrometers.

•  Technical assistance.  These funds are used to design programs that enhance the ability of minority institutions to successfully compete for future Defense funding. The objective is to assist the HBCU/MI community in areas such as proposal writing and administration of grants and contracts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The program invests in and demonstrates technologies from a Joint Service perspective, thus ensuring the development of technology with the broadest applicability while avoiding duplication of efforts.

Munition Area Technology Groups (MATGs) and Fuze Area Technology Groups (FATGs) have been established for each munition and capability area and are tasked with: 1) coordinating, establishing, and maintaining five, ten, and fifteen year technology development plans and roadmaps, 2) coordinating biannual meetings to review technical and programmatic details of each funded and proposed effort, 3) developing and submitting Technology Transition Agreements in coordination with appropriate PEOs for insertion in their Insensitive Munitions (IM) Strategic Plans / Fuze Technology Development Plan, and 4) interfacing with other MATGs / FATGs and IM / fuze science and technology projects as appropriate.  The Joint Insensitive Munitions Technology Program (JIMTP) and Joint Fuze Technology Program (JFTP) will utilize a Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) (consisting of senior Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of Energy (DOE) laboratory representatives, and senior Munitions PEO representatives) to provide program oversight, policy, direction, and priorities during its annual meeting.

The Insensitive Munitions (IM) effort will demonstrate enabling technologies needed to develop weapons in compliance with requirements established in United States Code, Title 10, Chapter 141, Section 2389 and DoD Instruction 5000.1.  This effort will take promising technologies demonstrated at the laboratory scale and transition them into demonstration programs utilizing generic hardware based on priority munitions identified in the PEO IM Strategic Plans.  Mature demonstrated IM technology can be transitioned, thereby decreasing their program costs and schedule risk and facilitating spin-offs to other non-compliant munitions within their portfolios.

The JIMTP investments focus on five Munition Areas:  1) High Performance Rocket Propulsion (HPP), 2) Minimum Signature Rocket Propulsion (MSP), 3) Blast and Fragmentation Warheads (BFW), 4) Anti-Armor Warheads (AAW), and 5) Propulsion (GP).  MATGs, under tri-service leadership, have developed technology roadmaps for each Munition Area that are used to guide investments based on goals consistent with the DoD IM Strategic Plan.  These IM technologies, alone or in combination, will be developed and tested at the small-scale, and for eventual incorporation in hardware, simulating real-world munitions, to demonstrate their utility and feasibility. 

The Enabling Fuze Technology effort will also demonstrate fuze enabling technologies needed to develop weapons that address priority capability areas identified in the Guidance for Development of the Force (GDF), the Secretary of Defense Memorandum, DoD Policy on Cluster Munitions and Unintended Harm to Civilians, and shortfalls in current weapon systems.  This effort will develop fuzing technologies and mature them for transition into advanced technology (6.3) programs and/or design tools and protocols for weapon fuzing.  In this way, the Service and Industrial base weapon and fuze will be able to heavily leverage and apply these emerging and promising technologies in fuzing modeling and simulation tools, multi-point initiation, high reliability fuze architectures, survivable components, modular fuze packaging, and fuze sensor. 

The Joint Fuze Technology Program investments focus on four specific capability areas that have been identified by Department strategic guidance and current shortfalls in weapon systems and will be validated by the PEOs and the Heads of the Service Science and Technology (S&amp;T) communities.  These capability areas are:  1) Hard Target Survivable Fuzing, 2) Tailorable Effects Weapon Fuzing, 3) High Reliability Fuzing, and 4) Enabling Fuze Technologies and Common Architecture.

This effort will take promising technologies developed at the laboratory scale and transition them into demonstration programs utilizing generic hardware based on the priority munitions identified in the DoD IM Strategic Plan.  Mature and demonstrated IM technology can be transitioned, thereby decreasing the program costs and schedule risk.  This will additionally promote spin-offs to other non-compliant munitions within the DoD portfolio.  Without new technology, future variants of current weapon systems will have the same, or worse, response to IM stimuli.  New weapon developments will face similar challenges. 

The JIMTP investments focus on five Munition Areas:  1) High Performance Rocket Propulsion, 2) Minimum Signature Rocket Propulsion, 3) Blast and Fragmentation Warheads, 4) Anti-Armor Warheads, and 5) Gun Propulsion.  Munition Area Technology Groups (MATGs), under tri-service leadership, have developed technology roadmaps for each Munition Area that are used to guide investments based on goals consistent with the DoD IM Strategic Plan.  The program is structured around these five areas with clear cross-cutting tasks.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

These technologies, when applied to rocket motors, improve IM response to one or more threats, while not degrading the response to other IM threats and at least maintaining munition performance.  Technologies include, but are not limited to, rocket propellant ingredients (including synthesis, characterization and scale-up), reduced smoke or smoky propellants (including formulation, characterization and scale-up), rocket motor case design, materials for active and passive thermal mitigation, shock mitigation materials and techniques, passive and active coatings, active and passive venting techniques for motor cases or containers, ignition systems, sensors, and thrust mitigation techniques.  Operating conditions may be controlled or widely varying in both temperature and vibration.  The five, ten, or fifteen year goals of the HPP MATG are concentrated on solving the IM response of missile propulsion systems due to Fragment Impacts and Slow Cook Off for the majority of HPP rocket motors, and solving the Fast Cook Off response of very large HPP motors.</r2:Description>

This effort will develop enabling technologies at the laboratory scale and transition them into 6.3 demonstration programs for weapons where priority capabilities and technology needs have been identified and validated by the Program Executive Officers (PEOs) and the Heads of the Service Science and Technology (S&amp;T) communities.  Mature 6.2 fuze technologies will be transitioned, thereby decreasing their program costs and schedule risk and facilitating spin-offs to other munitions within their portfolios.
Under the Joint Fuze Technology Program (JFTP), investments are focused on specific capability areas that have been identified by Department strategic guidance and current shortfalls in weapon systems and validated by the PEOs and Heads of the Service S&amp;T communities.  These four capability areas are: 1) Hard Target Survivable Fuzing, 2) Tailorable Effects (TE) Weapon Fuzing, 3) High Reliability Fuzing, and 4) Enabling Fuze Technologies and Common Architecture.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

First, improved modeling and simulation capabilities provide the validated computational tools necessary for hard target applications.  Second, basic phenomenology and understanding of the Fuze Environment is the science-based endeavor of providing the test equipment, instrumentation, and analysis techniques for experimentation and data gathering necessary for next generation fuzing.  Third, hard target survivable fuze components are developed to increase the effectiveness of facility denial munitions by improving the prediction tools and testing methodologies to evaluate the survivability and functionality of legacy and future fuzes.  Development of these technologies will enable next generation boosted and hypersonic penetrators to execute missions against hardened and deeply buried targets.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementNote>The FY 2012 President’s Budget Request (PBR) transferred the Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Institutions (HBCU/MI) program from the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) to the Army.  The FY 2012 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) directed the OSD to retain oversight and execution of the HBCU/MI program.  Accordingly, FY 2012 funds were reprogrammed from Army PE 0601104A to OSD PE 0602228D8Z for program execution. 

The FY 2013 PBR requested funds for the HBCU/MI program under Army PE 0601104A.  To comply with direction of the Congress, OSD will submit a reprogramming request in FY 2013 to transfer funds from the Army PE 0601104A to OSD PE 0602228D8Z. 

In FY 2014, funding for the HBCU/MI program is requested under OSD budget activity 1, PE 0601228D8Z.  The OSD Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD(R&amp;E)) retains oversight and execution of the program.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The HBCU/MI program provides support in fields of science and engineering that are important to national defense.  The Department of Defense (DoD) HBCU/MI Program encourages participation of small minority schools as well as large minority research institutions.  This competitive program provides support through grants or contracts for research, education assistance, instrumentation purchases, and technical assistance as described below:

•  Research.  The research grants further the knowledge in the basic scientific disciplines through theoretical and experimental activities.  Collaborative research allows university research staff to work directly with military laboratories or other universities.

•  Education.  Minority institutions use education assistance funds to strengthen their academic programs in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) thereby increasing the number of under-represented minorities obtaining undergraduate and graduate degrees in these fields.  These grants provide equipment, scholarships, cooperative work/study opportunities, visiting faculty programs, summer programs, and a variety of other enhancements designed to support students and to encourage them to pursue careers in STEM.

•  Infrastructure.  This program allows universities to purchase basic laboratory equipment for research and education program enhancements and highly sophisticated research instruments, such as lasers and spectrometers.

•  Technical assistance.  HBCU/MI uses these funds to design programs that enhance the ability of minority institutions to successfully compete for future Defense funding.  The objective is to assist the HBCU/MI community in areas such as proposal writing and administration of grants, and contracts.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectNote>The FY 2012 President’s Budget Request (PBR) transferred the Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Institutions (HBCU/MI) program from the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) to the Army.  The FY 2012 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) directed the OSD to retain oversight and execution of the HBCU/MI program.  Accordingly, FY 2012 funds were reprogrammed from Army PE 0601104A to OSD PE 0602228D8Z for program execution. 

The FY 2013 PBR requested funds for the HBCU/MI program under Army PE 0601104A.  To comply with direction of the Congress, OSD will submit a reprogramming request in FY 2013 to transfer funds from the Army PE 0601104A to OSD PE 0602228D8Z. 

In FY 2014, funding for the HBCU/MI program is requested under OSD budget activity 1, PE 0601228D8Z.  The OSD Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD(R&amp;E)) retains oversight and execution of the program.</r2:ProjectNote>
                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The HBCU/MI program provides support in fields of science and engineering that are important to national defense.  The Department of Defense (DoD) HBCU/MI Program encourages participation of small minority schools as well as large minority research institutions.  This competitive program provides support through grants or contracts for research, education assistance, instrumentation purchases, and technical assistance as described below:

•  Research.  The research grants further the knowledge in the basic scientific disciplines through theoretical and experimental activities.  Collaborative research allows university research staff to work directly with military laboratories or other universities.

•  Education.  Minority institutions use education assistance funds to strengthen their academic programs in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) thereby increasing the number of under-represented minorities obtaining undergraduate and graduate degrees in these fields.  These grants provide equipment, scholarships, cooperative work/study opportunities, visiting faculty programs, summer programs, and a variety of other enhancements designed to support students and to encourage them to pursue careers in STEM.

•  Infrastructure.  This program allows universities to purchase basic laboratory equipment for research and education program enhancements and highly sophisticated research instruments, such as lasers and spectrometers.

•  Technical assistance.  HBCU/MI uses these funds to design programs that enhance the ability of minority institutions to successfully compete for future Defense funding.  The objective is to assist the HBCU/MI community in areas such as proposal writing and administration of grants and contracts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Lincoln Laboratory (LL) research line program is an advanced technology research and development effort conducted through a cost reimbursable contract with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).  The LL Program funds innovations that directly lead to the development of new system concepts, technologies, components and materials in support of Lincoln Laboratory’s missions in Advanced Electronics Technology, Communications Systems, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Systems and Technology, Tactical Systems, Space Control, and Air and Missile Defense.  For FY 2013 the LL Program will support these missions by conducting research and development in five core science and engineering disciplines and four technical initiatives:
- Advanced Devices, with emphasis on development of materials, devices, and subsystems utilizing microelectronic, photonic, biological, and chemical technologies to enable new system approaches to Department of Defense (DoD) sensors.
- Optical Systems and Technologies, including the development of focal planes, integrated imagers, imaging and spectroscopic detection systems.
- RF Systems and Technologies, including the development of novel active and passive Radio Frequency (RF) sensors and development of electronic protection and electronics attack technologies and system concepts.
- Information, Computation, and Exploitation, which seeks to develop novel architectures, tools, and techniques for the processing, fusion, interpretation, computation, and exploitation of multi-sensor, multi-intelligence data. 
- Cyber Security, includes developing technologies and new techniques for the protection of systems against cyber attack and exploitation.
- Technical Initiatives, include biological sciences to aid the warfighter and develop tools for biological research; autonomous systems technologies with the objective of developing mobile, autonomous, robotic platforms that demonstrate key capabilities needed for a wide range of defense applications; quantum information sciences to develop basic technologies that support the storage, transport, and computation of quantum information; and novel and engineered materials that utilize nano-manufacturing techniques to create meta or other materials with unique physical and optical properties not readily found in nature.

Supporting these and other priority technology and capability areas are work efforts entitled Technical Intelligence and Testbed for Comparative Analysis:
- Technical Intelligence is working to develop a comprehensive understanding of technology emergence and advancement in a range of relevant scientific areas such as nanotechnology, directed energy, and propulsion.  Some details are classified, but one focus area is working to establish a broad horizon scanning and technology forecasting capability through a collaborative effort by the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Intelligence Community.  This effort will develop insight into our relative position in science and technology around the world over time, as well as determine potential impacts on DoD capability development and future threat environments.  
- The Testbed for Comparative Analysis will enable the evaluation of quantitative, horizon scanning and technology forecasting techniques for discovering disruptive technologies that may impact the DoD.  This effort will provide the DoD with objective ways to evaluate the accuracy of existing and future horizon scanning and technology forecasting efforts.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

JASONs is a group of approximately 65 appropriately cleared experts who provide detailed independent technical assessments of challenging technological problems.  JASON members are primarily fully tenured professors in physics, mathematics, biosciences, and engineering disciplines who hold active Sensitive Compartmented Information-level clearances.  The annual outputs of the JASONs are studies provided across the leadership and program manager levels which inform and often shape programmatic and technical decisions involving millions of dollars.  JASONs were previously funded through university research programs, but their level of technical expertise in systems and development is appropriate for incorporation into Applied Research.

The technical intelligence program is working to develop a detailed understanding of both the opportunity and threat aspects from military-relevant technology emergence and advancement across a range of scientific, technology and capability areas.  These areas include but are not limited to quantum information sciences, data analytics and data-intensive systems, novel manufacturing, directed energy and other emerging technologies to fight and win in denied and contested environments.  Some details are classified, but the focus is to work collaboratively across the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Intelligence Community (IC) to establish a broad horizon scanning and technology forecasting capability.  This capability is coupled with implementation of technical net assessments and other approaches to develop detailed analyses of the opportunities and threats posed by the technology and relevant counter-capabilities where impact appears most significant.  These efforts will develop insight into our relative position in science and technology around the world over time, as well as determine potential impacts on DoD capability development and future threat environments.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

JASON studies focused on the areas most important in the security environment at the time.  For the Technical Intelligence portion some details are classified.  The program developed frameworks for S&amp;T baseline assessments for the S&amp;T Intelligence priorities and full technical net assessments on global technology advancement.  This program continued 'five eyes' collaboration with the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand to continue assessments on emerging and disruptive technologies and will leverage the best collection of methodologies for scanning/discovery, prioritization, and assessment of the military relevance for those emerging technologies.  The program continued the effort of the National Academy of Sciences (under the National Research Council) through the Board of Global Science and Technology to engage globally on targeted areas of science and technology to understand global shifts and their relevance to national security.  The Board sponsored several conferences in countries in reference to technologies of interest, with the initial focus on the large data challenge.  In coordination with the National Intelligence Committee and the Defense Intelligence Community effort to Strengthen Science and Technology Analysis, this program continued a strong partnership with the intelligence community to provide clear feedback on products, improve articulation of S&amp;T requirements, and define higher impact products for future development.  Technical Intelligence continued to update and refine the S&amp;T Intelligence priorities and mechanisms for increasing information flow from the intelligence community.  </r2:Text>

JASON studies will be focused on the area most important in the security environment at the time.  For the Technical Intelligence portion some details are classified.  The program will work to develop a detailed understanding of both the opportunity and threat aspects from military-relevant technology emergence and advancement across a range of scientific, technology and capability areas.  These areas include but are not limited to quantum information sciences, data analytics and data-intensive systems, novel manufacturing, directed energy, and other emerging technologies to fight and win in denied and contested environments.  Some details are classified, but the focus is to work collaboratively across the DoD and the IC to establish a broad horizon scanning and technology forecasting capability.  This capability is coupled with implementation of technical net assessments and other approaches to develop detailed analyses of the opportunities and threats posed by the technology and relevant counter-capabilities where impact appears most significant.  These efforts will develop insight into our relative position in science and technology around the world over time, as well as determine potential impacts on DoD capability development and future threat environments.</r2:Text>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Systems 2020 will set the technical foundation for the Department's system needs for the next decade.  This initiative funds Office of the Secretary of Defense and Service research and development efforts in key technologies and tools for design and development of complex systems.  The program seeks to develop enabling technologies that will support the rise of a new class of adaptable systems, and will spawn a new generation of engineering tools and markets that could revolutionize systems engineering practice.

Systems 2020 research initiatives will investigate advanced engineering technologies and provide experimental platforms to assess the feasibility of proposed solutions.  These areas include:  (1) Multi-dimensional, multi-feature design and engineering tradespace analysis approaches computed rapidly, accurately and within an integrated environment; (2) Techniques to generate multiple alternative designs with data structures enabling modeling of lifecycle implications such as producibility and sustainability; and (3) Novel decision-making techniques that interface engineering and operational data and inputs while guarding against premature or stovepiped design choices.  Together these efforts address opportunities to improve system adaptability and will develop techniques to balance design choices against costs for future adaptation precipitated by unexpected threats, changing missions, and disruptive technologies, while operating with far greater speed and agility. </r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

These areas include:  (1) Multi-dimensional, multi-feature design and engineering tradespace analysis approaches computed rapidly, accurately and within an integrated environment; (2) Techniques to generate multiple alternative designs with data structures enabling modeling of lifecycle implications such as producibility and sustainability; and (3) Novel decision-making techniques that interface engineering and operational data and inputs while guarding against premature or stovepiped design choices.  Together these efforts address opportunities to improve system adaptability and will develop techniques to balance design choices against costs for future adaptation precipitated by unexpected threats, changing missions, and disruptive technologies, while operating with far greater speed and agility.

The PE is oriented toward the design, development, and improvement of prototypes and new processes to meet general mission area requirements, and to translate promising research into solutions for military needs.  Efforts are situated within the seven DoD S&amp;T priorities and focus areas and will include studies, feasibility evaluations, and non-system specific technology efforts.  Investigations conducted in this PE will facilitate concept exploration efforts and studies of alternative concepts.  Efforts are formulated and managed by teams of subject matter experts drawn from the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Military Services, and Defense Agencies.  The PE will also provide necessary administrative support to the Priority Steering Councils and S&amp;T Focus Areas.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementNote>Change from FY 2013 to FY 2014 reflects a realignment of the program from the Data to Decisions Applied Research program element (PE) 0602663D8Z to the Applied Research for the Advancement of Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Priorities PE 0602251D8Z.

The goals of this program will be shifted to the Department of Defense (DoD) Components under the direction of the Research and Engineering Executive Committee and will conform with the DoD Data to Decision Priority Steering Council roadmaps.  Historically, the Joint Data Management program was restructured to evolve into the revised Data to Decisions Applied Research program, a FY 2012 new start, to support the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review mission:  Succeed in counterinsurgency, stability, and counterterrorism operations.  Additionally this program addresses a signed Secretary of Defense S&amp;T priority, Data to Decisions, which reduces the cycle time and manpower requirements for analysis and use of large data sets.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The DoD response to a changing threat environment includes an expansion of the types of sensors deployed, new types of information collected, and different features used to classify these new threats.  As the DoD increases the capability and capacity to generate increasing amounts of data from numerous sensors in the battlespace, the issue of handling very large data sets has become more challenging.  From a technical perspective, data creation speeds have outpaced the speed and ability to transport, store and process the data created.  S&amp;T investigation into new and novel ways to manage and exploit this data is required to more efficiently use sensor assets and effectively use information in a timely fashion.

The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Data to Decisions program (PEs 0602663D8Z and 0603663D8Z) uniquely addresses three specific gap areas not addressed by Component S&amp;T:  minimal dedicated Data to Decisions research to support Joint and emerging mission areas; DoD needs a mechanism to increase responsiveness of Component Data to Decisions research and lower the time-to-solution across a broad DoD-wide user base; and limited investment in multi-disciplinary research investigations of Data to Decisions issues and solutions.  The OSD Data to Decisions program pulls together research efforts to address shortfalls within the context of Joint and emerging missions to ensure that the distinctive needs of these joint analysts and decision makers are addressed by DoD science and technology.  As an example, irregular warfare, non-state terrorism movements, and uncertain environmental patterns that trigger major weather disasters are producing a reality for military and government leaders where traditional physics-based sensors alone are insufficient to plan current and future actions in a region of interest or need.  Component Data to Decisions efforts focus on developing technology to overcome a particular challenge within a mission or advance a particular priority area of that Component, as a result the Research and Engineering Database has over 388 references to Decision Support programs all of which are designed to address a specific need over the course of several years.  However, there exists no other program in the DoD that focuses on technology development efforts to speed the delivery of the Component solutions and lessons learned to a DoD-wide user base.  The OSD Data to Decisions program provides the common platform (access to datasets, infrastructure, and metrics) to integrate and evaluate the technology development and research methods to support various missions driven by the challenge problems.  This ability to rapidly evaluate technology development and research methods will allow technology transfer for mission analysis not previously foreseen and lower the time-to solution across DoD by rigorously analyzing technical performance for more immediate use.  Traditional approaches within research seek to advance machine systems for a specific mission effect resulting in large complex data sets.  While necessary for sensor system improvements, potential Data to Decisions solutions require a coupling of automated data analysis with human analysts, operators, and decision makers in order to reduce time and limit the number of people required.  Many research studies, workshops, and analysis have stated that solutions to data issues are multi-disciplinary.  The OSD Data to Decisions program is in the unique position to reach across Components and research disciplines to blend promising research in new ways in response to cross-service Challenge Problem statements.  For Challenge Problems, contextual understanding will result from research combining human sciences with computer processing techniques to take advantage of a person’s cognitive ability to fuse and assimilate multiple sources and types of information for new insights.  </r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The OSD Data to Decisions (D2D) program (PEs 0602663D8Z and 0603663D8Z) uniquely addresses three specific gap areas not addressed by Component Science and Technology (S&amp;T):  1) minimal dedicated D2D research to support Joint and emerging mission areas; 2) DoD needs a mechanism to increase responsiveness of Component D2D research and lower the time-to-solution across a broad DoD-wide user base; and 3) limited investment in multi-disciplinary research investigations of D2D issues and solutions.

The D2D program establishes the demonstration and experimentation environment to conduct independent evaluations of research efforts that have the most potential of minimizing the impact of the increasing amount of information available and required to support military operational decision-making.  The intent is to leverage existing research investments within defense S&amp;T and provide proper evaluations and assessments to facilitate technology transition.  The Applied Research program concentrates on the development portion of this collaborative effort, focusing on the development of improved algorithms, relative to FY 2012 state of the art, to be demonstrated and validated in the 6.3 D2D program test bed.  The D2D Advanced Development (6.3) program uses a spiral development model with four-steps.  Each year Operational teams will choose a series of cross-service challenge problems dominated by a specific sensing modality.  Representative data for each of those problems will then be collected for testing against that problem.  A Development team will design algorithms and data management architectures using high-level languages and self-test on controlled data sets to address those challenge problems.  Independent assessment will occur with sequestered data sets, but each development tool will also be tested against new sensors not included in the self-testing to determine fragility and applicability.  A Transition team will host the developed algorithms as services in a spiraling prototype system that will support rapid prototyping and transition.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

- Developed three unique tracking systems, with three distinct approaches that work in cluttered urban environments where conventional tracking approaches fail.  Evaluated the performance of the approaches with three different WAMI sensors.  
- Researched methods to discover and provide contextual information to the analyst about MOVINT data such as scene location, object movement, and object proximity.  Developed activity models from WAMI tracks focusing on low level behaviors including moving straight, turning, and making u-turns.  For tracks enriched with GPS information showed demonstrated the feasibility of identifying individual drivers and deviations from expected routes in a highly controlled environment.</r2:Text>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Our military forces require resilient, reliable networks and computer systems to conduct effective operations.  However, the number and sophistication of threats in cyberspace are rapidly growing, making it urgent and critical to improve the cyber security of Department of Defense (DoD) networks to counter those threats and assure our missions.  This program focuses on innovative and sustained research in both cyber security and computer network operations to develop new concepts to harden key network and computer components, design new resilient cyber infrastructures, increase the military’s ability to fight and survive during cyber attacks, disrupt nation-state level attack planning and execution, measure the state of cyber security, and explore and exploit new ideas in cyber warfare for agile cyber operations and mission assurance. 

The Cyber Applied Research program element is budgeted in the applied research budget activity because it emphasizes an approach to develop new security paradigms and architectures to enable agile cyber operations in a resilient and trustworthy cyberspace.  These approaches will include moving from cyber defense to cyber resilience by changing the defensive terrain of our existing digital infrastructure, identifying ways to raise the risk and lower the value of attack from an advanced, persistent cyber threat, and focusing on mission assurance.  The Cyber Applied Research program builds on the existing basic and applied research results and transition new successful applied research results to the Cyber Advanced Technology Development program element (0603668D8Z).

This program focuses on integrating computer network defense and computer network operations, addressing the advanced persistent threat, and filling DoD technology gaps as identified in the 2012 Cyber Priority Steering Council Science &amp; Technology Roadmap and assessments conducted by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research &amp; Engineering (OASD(R&amp;E)).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The program is developing technology options through the DoD S&amp;T organizations within and across the following technical areas:

INFORMATION ASSURANCE AND COMPUTER NETWORK DEFENSE (IA/CND):
Develop technologies to harden DoD network components; evolve from network defense to mission assurance; and enable systems to operate through cyber attacks in degraded and contested environments.

COMPUTER NETWORK OPERATIONS (CNO):
Disrupt adversary attack planning and execution; explore game-changing ideas over the full spectrum of CNO and new concepts in cyber warfare; increase collaboration between disparate research communities within CNO; and address identified gaps in DoD CNO S&amp;T to prepare for cyber conflict against advanced persistent threats.

CYBER METRICS AND EXPERIMENTATION:
Explore new analytical methodologies, models, and experimental data sets to establish metrics to measure a system’s state of security, apply the scientific method to establish the foundations of a scientific framework in which cyber security research can be conducted to test hypothesis with measurable and repeatable results, and quantitative experimentation and assessment of new cyber technologies.


Beginning in FY 2014, the program will expand research in cyber command and control to provide warfighters and commanders new situational awareness, course of action analysis, cyber operational agility and cyber mission control. This research will include protection of tactical networks, weapons systems and platforms.  The six new technical thrust areas include:

TRUST:
Develop approaches and methods to establish known degree of assurance that devices, networks, and cyber-dependent functions perform as expected, despite attack or error.  This technical area encompasses all aspects of the assessment, establishment, propagation, maintenance, and composition of trust relationships between devices, networks, and people. 

RESILIENT INFRASTRUCTURE:
Entails the ability to withstand cyber attacks, and sustain or recover critical functions.  A resilient infrastructure has the ability to continue to perform its functions and provide its services to required levels during an attack.  The objective in this area is to develop integrated architectures that are optimized for their ability to absorb (cyber) shock, and recover in a timely fashion to a known secure state, even if this is at the expense of degraded performance.  Resilient Algorithms and Protocols covers ways to develop novel protocols and algorithms to increase the repertoire of resiliency mechanisms available to the infrastructure and architecture.  Research is needed to develop resiliency at lower levels with specific algorithms and protocols to support higher-level resiliency architectures.

AGILE OPERATIONS:
Explore new methods and technologies to dynamically reshape cyber systems as conditions/goals change, to escape harm, or to manipulate the adversary.  These capabilities present technology challenges in the areas of Autonomic Cyber Agility and Cyber Maneuver.  Cyber Maneuver is a new way to manage systems dynamically in a cyber situation.  It is a set of emerging methods for maintaining defensive or offensive advantage in cyber operations.  It entails developing mechanisms that enable goal-directed reshaping of cyber systems.  Cyber maneuver encompasses reallocation for repurposing a device or platform, reconfiguration for changing the way a system performs a task, and relocation for altering the operating location in a logical or physical topology. Autonomic Cyber Agility covers several forms of agility.  As cyber infrastructures increase in scale and complexity, there is an urgent need for autonomous and agile mechanisms to reconfigure, heal, optimize, and protect defensive and offensive cyber mechanisms.  

ASSURING EFFECTIVE MISSIONS:
Develop the ability to assess and control the cyber situation in the mission context. While the focus in cyber research is often placed on individual technologies, how these technologies work toward an effective mission is critical for the DoD.  The objective of Assuring Effective Missions presents technology challenges in the areas of Cyber Mission Control and Effects at Scale. Cyber Mission Control covers the ability to orchestrate cyber systems to achieve an overarching mission goal.  There is a critical need for tools that can map information technology assets to missions and use modeling and simulation, or other techniques, to perform dynamic analysis of asset criticality and course-of-action alternatives.  Inherent in Cyber Mission Control is the ability to automatically derive and fuse information about the characteristics of information technology systems in a manner that allows us to describe, analyze, observe, and control the operation of information technology components.  A key goal of this research area is to have tools that enable commanders to assess and direct different information technology maneuvers in conjunction with mission actions.  Effects at Scale encompass full spectrum challenges that intersect with cyber becoming a new full-fledged domain of warfare.

CYBER MODELING, SIMULATION, AND EXPERIMENTATION (MSE):
Develop modeling and simulation capabilities that are able to sufficiently simulate the cyber environment in which the DoD operates and enable a more robust assessment and validation of cyber technology development.  There are two technical challenges associated with cyber modeling, simulation, and experimentation:  Cyber Modeling and Simulation and Cyber Measurement.  Cyber Modeling and Simulation seeks to develop tools and techniques that enable analytical modeling and multi-scale simulation of complex cyber systems.  Cyber Measurement develops cyber experimentation and test range technology to conduct controlled, repeatable experiments, providing the ability to track the progress of cyber research investments in a quantitative fashion.  This area will explore new analytical methodologies, models, and experimental data sets to establish metrics to measure a system’s state of security, apply the scientific method to establish the foundations of a framework in which cyber security research can be conducted, to test hypothesis with measurable and repeatable results, and the quantitative experimentation and assessment for new cyber technologies.  These new methodologies will enable the exploration modeling and simulation tools and techniques that can drive innovation in research and aid in integrated experimentation and transition to operations to simulate the cyber environment with sufficient fidelity, and to integrate cyber modeling and simulation with the traditional modeling and simulation related to the kinetic domain.   
 
EMBEDDED, MOBILE, AND TACTICAL ENVIRONMENTS (EMT):
Increase the overall emphasis on the Department’s cyber systems that rely on technology beyond wired networking and standard computing platforms.  The objective in the area of embedded and tactical systems is to develop tools and techniques that assure the secure operation of microprocessors within our weapons platforms and systems; enable security in real-time systems; and establish security in disadvantaged, intermittent, and low-bandwidth environments.  This research also seeks to expand and cultivate military-grade techniques for securing and operating with enterprise-style commodity mobile devices, such as smart phones, tablets, and their associated infrastructures.  With the constant evolution of these devices and their respective infrastructures it is of the utmost importance to provide a secure environment where these devices can be effectively utilized, monitored and tracked.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The OSD HSCB Modeling Program is a vertically integrated effort to research, develop, and transition technologies, tools, and systems to programs of record and users in need.  The program exists to optimize U.S. forces’ ability to perform population-centric sensing, understand behaviors driven by social and cultural variables, and select effective courses of action in the full range of military operations.  Program research will enhance population-centric intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities for understanding the increasingly complex global environment to address national strategic challenges such as instability, aggression, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and violent extremism.  In three integrated program elements (PE), the program will conduct applied research, mature and demonstrate advanced technology, and develop transitionable methods, technology, tools, and prototypes.  Work under PE 0602670D8Z  will focus on developing an applied science base, to include validated theory and methods, along with knowledge products and resources to support sociocultural behavior data collection, analysis and forecasting of sociocultural behavior, course of action planning, and effects analysis.  Research will address needs in two areas:  modeling and data.  It will develop and validate theoretical constructions, generate knowledge products, and develop stand-alone computational models of sociocultural behavior; and improve methods for collecting data that will facilitate model development and enhance forecasting and analysis capabilities.  The program will ensure that supported research is clearly tied to warfighters and their needs. 

Human behavior based theory, knowledge products, and stand-alone models will support development of software to help users represent, understand, and forecast sociocultural behavior at strategic, operational, and tactical levels.

Improved data collection methods will help build the sociocultural science base, facilitate subsequent model development and validation, and address emerging data types and sources.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Software is key to meeting the Department of Defense’s (DoD’s) increasing demand for high-quality, affordable, and timely national defense systems.  With growing global parity in software engineering, the DoD must maintain leadership to avoid strategic surprise.  To assist the DoD in retaining a long-term differential advantage over potential adversaries, the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) Applied Research Program Element (PE) seeks to establish a program of applied research that will develop and evaluate the feasibility and practicality of software and computer science concepts with the potential to improve future DoD systems. 

The SEI Applied Research PE will initially have four main research thrusts:  (1) measurement techniques for the effectiveness of software technologies and methods; (2) design principles and tools for evolvable, scalable ecosystems; (3) models of computational behaviors; and (4) cyber-tradecraft and analytics.  These thrusts have known military applications and can be associated with active areas of basic research.  The SEI Applied Research PE seeks to translate this promising basic research into solutions for broadly defined military needs.  This PE will leverage the expertise of the SEI Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) in advanced technology development and technology transition to design, develop, and improve tools, prototypes, and new processes that meet general requirements for software-intensive DoD systems.

The SEI Applied Research PE will also conduct research in multicore computing, architecture-led iterative incremental development (Agile at scale); and emerging software and computer science areas that can act as catalysts for acquiring DoD systems with improved performance.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                        <r2:Description>Research projects at the SEI FFRDC will be awarded under this PE beginning in FY 2014 on a competitive basis across the SEI.  The “Heilmeier” assessment criteria will form the basis for selection at the SEI FFRDC.  Therefore, funding levels in each thrust area may vary from year to year.  Research will address the PE goal of assisting the DoD to retain a long-term differential advantage over potential adversaries in the area of software-intensive systems.

The four main thrust areas are:

1) Design principles and tools for evolvable, scalable ecosystems.  The commercial world has many successful examples of software ecosystems, but the DoD has not capitalized on these to the same extent.  This thrust looks beyond implementing ecosystems in a DoD context and seeks to implement the underlying principles in a way that makes automated creation, evolution, and scaling of ecosystems easier.

2) Measurement techniques for the effectiveness of software technologies and methods.  Modern tools, integrated development environments, and software engineering processes have captured large data sets about development activities.  This thrust seeks to study the metrics that affect cost, schedule, quality, and performance based on real-world observation and experiment.  

3) Models of Computational Behaviors.  System performance depends on end-to-end models of computational behavior that include the user, architecture, source and object code, firmware components, and processor hardware.  This thrust seeks to study emerging ideas that better model end-to-end computational behavior.  

4) Cyber-tradecraft and analytics.  Cyberwarfare is an increasingly important and rapidly evolving dimension on the modern battlefield.  This thrust seeks to investigate methods that will give the DoD enduring advantages in the cyber battlespace such as reverse software engineering, automated code &amp; malware analysis, code-level software resiliency (e.g., randomizing and time variant techniques), and other techniques such as those found in the Software Security Assurance State-of-the-Art Report.  

The SEI Applied Research PE will also conduct research in multicore computing, architecture-led iterative incremental development (Agile at scale); and emerging software and computer science areas that can act as catalysts for acquiring DoD systems with improved performance.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program addresses advanced technology development associated with improving the lethality, reliability, safety, and survivability of munitions and weapon systems.  The goal is to develop and demonstrate joint enabling technologies that can be used by the Program Executive Officers as they develop their specific weapon programs.  The program invests in and demonstrates technologies from a Joint Service perspective, thus ensuring the development of technology with the broadest applicability while avoiding duplication of efforts.

Munition Area Technology Groups (MATGs) and Fuze Area Technology Groups (FATGs) have been established for each munition and capability area and are tasked with: 1) coordinating, establishing, and maintaining five, ten, and fifteen year technology development plans and roadmaps, 2) coordinating biannual meetings to review technical and programmatic details of each funded and proposed effort, 3) developing and submitting Technology Transition Agreements in coordination with appropriate Program Executive Offices (PEO) for insertion in their Insensitive Munition (IM) Strategic Plans / Fuze Technology Development Plan, and 4) interfacing with other MATGs / FATGs and IM / fuze science and technology projects as appropriate.   The Joint Insensitive Munitions Technical Program (JIMTP) and Joint Fuze Technical Program (JFTP) will utilize a Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) (consisting of senior DoD and DOE laboratory representatives and senior Munitions PEO representatives) to provide program oversight, policy, direction, and priorities during its annual meeting.

The Insensitive Munitions effort will demonstrate enabling technologies needed to develop weapons in compliance with Insensitive Munitions requirements established in United States Code, Title 10, Chapter 141, Section 2389 and DoDI 5000.1.  This effort will take promising technologies demonstrated at the laboratory scale and transition them into demonstration programs utilizing generic hardware based on priority munitions identified in the PEO IM Strategic Plans.  Mature and demonstrated IM technology can be transitioned, thereby decreasing their program costs and schedule risk and facilitating spin-offs to other non-compliant munitions within their portfolios.

The JIMTP investments focus on five Munition Areas:  1) High Performance Rocket Propulsion, 2) Minimum Signature Rocket Propulsion, 3) Blast and Fragmentation Warheads, 4) Anti-Armor Warheads, and 5) Gun Propulsion.  Munition Area Technology Groups (MATG), under tri-service leadership, have developed technology roadmaps for each Munition Area which are used to guide investments based on goals consistent with the PEO IM Strategic Plans.  These IM technologies, alone or in combination, will be incorporated in hardware, simulating real-world munitions, to demonstrate their utility and feasibility as part of Technology Transition Agreements with PEOs.

The Enabling Fuze Advanced Technology effort will also demonstrate fuze enabling technologies needed to develop weapons that address priority capability areas identified in the Guidance for Development (GDF) of the Force, the Secretary of Defense Memorandum, DoD Policy on Cluster Munitions and Unintended Harm to Civilians, and shortfalls in current weapon systems.  This effort will take promising technologies demonstrated at the laboratory scale and transition them into demonstration weapons and programs based on priority capabilities and technology needs identified and validated by the PEOs and the Heads of the Service Science and Technology (S&amp;T) communities.  In this way, promising multi-point initiation architectures, high reliability fuze architectures, survivable components, modular fuze packaging, and components produced based on ease of manufacturing can be integrated into munitions applications and its ability to address required capability needs will be validated.  Mature fuze technologies will be transitioned to Weapon PEO’s and/or Industry, thereby decreasing program costs and schedule risk while facilitating technology into potentially broader range of munitions applications.

The JFTP investments focus on four specific capability areas that have been identified by the Department strategic guidance and current shortfalls in weapon systems and as validated by the PEOs and the Service S&amp;T communities.  These capability areas are:  1) Hard Target Survivable Fuzing, 2) Tailorable Effects Weapon Fuzing, 3) High Reliability Fuzing, and 4) Enabling Fuze Technologies and Common Architecture.   These Fuzing technologies will be incorporated in weapon applications to demonstrate their maturity and utility as part of Technology Transition Agreements with PEOs.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

These technologies, when applied to rocket motors, improve IM response to one or more threats, while not degrading the response to other IM threats and at least maintaining munition performance.  Technologies include, but are not limited to, rocket propellant ingredients (including synthesis, characterization and scale-up), reduced smoke or smokey propellants (including formulation, characterization and scale-up), rocket motor case design, materials for active and passive thermal mitigation, shock mitigation materials and techniques, passive and active coatings, active and passive venting techniques for motor cases or containers, ignition systems, sensors and thrust mitigation techniques.  Operating conditions may be controlled or widely varying in both temperature and vibration.  The five, ten, and fifteen year goals of the HPP MATG are concentrated on solving the IM response of missile propulsions systems due to Fragment Impacts and Slow Cook Off for the majority of High Performance Propulsion rocket motors, and solving the Fast Cook Off response of very large High Performance Propulsion motors.</r2:Description>

The five, ten, and fifteen year goals of the GP MATG are concentrated on solving the IM response of gun propulsion munitions to Fragment Impact, and Slow Cook Off threats.</r2:Description>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This effort will demonstrate fuze enabling technologies needed to develop weapons that address priority capability areas identified in the Guidance for Development of the Force, the Secretary of Defense Memorandum, DoD Policy on Cluster Munitions and Unintended Harm to Civilians, and shortfalls in current weapon systems.  This effort will take promising technologies integrated and tested to Technical Readiness Level (TRL) five and demonstrate the technologies to a TRL-six utilizing weapon hardware based on priority capabilities and technology needs identified and validated by the Program Executive Officers (PEOs) and the Heads of the Service S&amp;T communities.  Mature demonstrated fuze technology will be transitioned, thereby decreasing their program costs and schedule risk and facilitating spin-offs to other munitions within their portfolios.  Under the Joint Fuze Technology Program (JFTP), investments are focused on specific capability areas that have been identified by Department strategic guidance and current shortfalls in weapon systems and validated by the PEOs and Heads of the Service S&amp;T communities.  These four capability areas are:  1) Hard Target Survivable Fuzing, 2) Tailorable Effects (TE) Weapon Fuzing, 3) High Reliability Fuzing, and 4) Enabling Fuze Technologies and Common Architecture.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

First, improved modeling and simulation capabilities provide the validated computational tools necessary for hard target applications.  Second, basic phenomenology &amp; understanding of the Fuze Environment is the science-based endeavor of providing the test equipment, instrumentation, and analysis techniques for experimentation and data gathering necessary for next generation fuzing.  Third, hard target survivable fuze components are developed to increase the effectiveness of facility denial munitions by improving the prediction tools and testing methodologies to evaluate the survivability and functionality of legacy and future fuzes.  Development of these technologies will enable next generation boosted and hypersonic penetrators to execute missions against hardened and deeply buried targets.</r2:Description>

These technologies will enable the next generation of cluster munitions to achieve the required greater than 99% reliability goal.  Evolving DoD emphasis on increased weapon system reliability is driving the need to consider new and novel approaches for achieving increased fuze reliability while maintaining or enhancing fuze design safety.  DoD policy, higher weapon reliability expectations and harsher weapon system operational requirements are dictating the need for higher fuze reliability than available using current technologies.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>P206, Explosive Ordnance Disposal/Low-Intensity Conflict (EOD/LIC).  The EOD/LIC Program develops and delivers advanced capabilities for military Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) operators and Special Operations Forces (SOF) to meet the challenges of improvised explosive devices (IEDs), force protection, and the war on terrorism.  EOD/LIC efforts focus in two areas:  support to SOF to combat terrorism; and access, detection, identification, and neutralization of all types of conventional explosive ordnance and improvised explosive devices.  Requirements submitted by the Joint Service EOD and Service Special Operations communities are prioritized and approved by OASD (SO/LIC).  With a decreased budget, CTTSO will proceed with The Improvised Device Defeat (IDD) subgroup expanding its inclusion of joint service EOD operators in its efforts since the Department’s announcement to cancel PE 0603121D8Z.  IDD will absorb the appropriate joint service EOD requirements for prioritization and interagency coordination going forward.  IDD will use the limited resources it possesses to provide the broadest possible capability improvement to the community.
  
P207, Special Reconnaissance Capabilities (SRC).  The SRC Program exploits, leverages, and integrates DoD’s service and agency efforts to improve surveillance and reconnaissance tools (unattended sensors, tagging and tracking devices, data infiltration/exfiltration, remote delivery, and mobility/delivery of sensors), while providing risk reduction for DoD and other agency technology and development programs.  The SRC Program identifies, integrates, and operationalizes the technical tools for the collection of actionable information against a variety of targets and mission requirements, including emerging requirements , and maintains DoD’s on-line catalog of tools in order to minimize crisis response time for special reconnaissance and surveillance. 
 
P208, Information Dissemination Concepts (IDC).  The IDC Program addresses technology capabilities necessary to enable sustained information dissemination campaigns in denied areas.  The IDC program, working as necessary with DoD and the interagency, develops, modifies, and demonstrates concepts, mechanisms, platforms and payloads to propagate themes and messages that convince target audiences to take action favorable to the United States and its allies. The Surveillance, Collection, and Operations Support (SCOS) subgroup has managed the IDC project for CTTSO since gaining oversight of the funding.  The language program orchestrated by SCOS will remain, albeit with a drastic reduction in funding without PE 0603121D8Z.
 
P209, Irregular Warfare Support (IWS).  The IWS Program (IWSP) develops adaptive and agile capabilities and methodologies to support irregular warfare in the current and evolving strategic environments. IWSP supports joint, interagency, and other partners who conduct or counter irregular warfare through indirect and asymmetric approaches, though they may employ a full range of military and other capabilities, in order to erode an adversary’s power, influence, and will. Solutions include material and non-material operational analysis, concept development, field experimentation, and delivery of capabilities, to defeat the motivations, sanctuaries, and enterprises of targeted state and non-state actors.  As evidenced by every applicable Defense and National Security strategy document, (e.g., 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance (DSG), “Sustaining U.S. Global Leadership: Priorities for 21st Century Defense, Irregular Warfare capabilities are vital to U.S. security.  CTTSO, in coordination with the ASD (SO/LIC), is in the process of reviewing options to continue the IWS capability that is critical to the combating terrorism community.

The EOD/LIC Program develops and delivers advanced capabilities for military Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) operators and Special Operations Forces (SOF) to meet the challenges of improvised explosive devices (IEDs), force protection, and the war on terrorism.  EOD/LIC efforts focus in two areas:  support to SOF to combat terrorism; and access, detection, identification, and neutralization of all types of conventional explosive ordnance and improvised explosive devices.  Requirements submitted by the Joint Service EOD and Service Special Operations communities are prioritized and approved by OASD (SO/LIC).  With a decreased budget, CTTSO will proceed with The Improvised Device Defeat (IDD) subgroup expanding its inclusion of joint service EOD operators in its efforts since the Department’s announcement to cancel PE 0603121D8Z.  IDD will absorb the appropriate joint service EOD requirements for prioritization and interagency coordination going forward.  IDD will use the limited resources it possesses to provide the broadest possible capability improvement to the community.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The primary objective of the SRC program is to seek out and identify technical tools for the collection of actionable data and information which will assist DoD in its execution of operations against violent extremist organizations.  To accomplish this objective, the program leverages emerging and existing developmental technologies from government and commercial ventures and operationalizes them to meet near term reconnaissance and surveillance operational requirements.  The operational tools transition unattended sensors, tagging devices, data transfer, remote delivery, and mobility/delivery of sensors into established Programs of Record throughout the DoD.  The program evaluates new and existing technical surveillance technologies and incorporates results into a reference database for future access.</r2:Description>

The IDC Program addresses technology capabilities necessary to enable sustained information dissemination campaigns in denied areas.  The IDC program, working as necessary with DoD and the interagency, develops, modifies, and demonstrates concepts, mechanisms, platforms and payloads to propagate themes and messages that convince target audiences to take action favorable to the United States and its allies. The Surveillance, Collection, and Operations Support (SCOS) subgroup has managed the IDC project for CTTSO since gaining oversight of the funding.  The language program orchestrated by SCOS will remain, albeit with a drastic reduction in funding without PE 0603121D8Z.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The IWS Program (IWSP) develops adaptive and agile capabilities and methodologies to support irregular warfare in the current and evolving strategic environments. IWSP supports joint, interagency, and other partners who conduct or counter irregular warfare through indirect and asymmetric approaches, though they may employ a full range of military and other capabilities, in order to erode an adversary’s power, influence, and will. Solutions include material and non-material operational analysis, concept development, field experimentation, and delivery of capabilities, to defeat the motivations, sanctuaries, and enterprises of targeted state and non-state actors.  As evidenced by every applicable Defense and National Security strategy document, (e.g., 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance (DSG), “Sustaining U.S. Global Leadership: Priorities for 21st Century Defense, Irregular Warfare capabilities are vital to U.S. security.  CTTSO, in coordination with the ASD (SO/LIC), is in the process of reviewing options to continue the IWS capability that is critical to the combating terrorism community.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Combating Terrorism Technical Support (CTTS) program developed and delivered capabilities that addressed needs and requirements with direct operational application in the national effort to combat terrorism.  Projects are distributed among 9 mission categories: Advanced Analytics and Capabilities, Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosives; Improvised Device Defeat; Investigative Support and Forensics; Personnel Protection, Physical Security; Surveillance, Collection, and Operations Support; Tactical Operations Support; and Training Technology Development.  This program is a diverse, advanced technology development effort that capitalizes on interagency and international participation to demonstrate the utility or effectiveness of technology when applied to combating terrorism requirements.  It includes technology capability development, proof-of-principle demonstrations in field applications, and coordination to transition from development to operational use.  CTTS manages approximately 450 individual projects in support of Defense, federal, state, local, and international customers and partners.

For the Department of Defense, CTTS focused on requirements that support military forces in demanding or hostile environments in Afghanistan, Yemen, Africa, the Philippines, and Colombia; by rapidly developing and delivering leading edge products such as tactical sensors and unmanned vehicles, personal and physical protection, user friendly apps for analytical tools and reference guides, and weapons, sights, and ammo modifications.  Several of the highly successful products include Legacy human source information programs in Afghanistan and Mexico, the Lighthouse and PALANTIR information collection and analysis systems, the Enhanced Mortar Targeting System (EMTAS), and Insider Threat Situation Awareness Training. 

For U.S. federal, state and local law enforcement and first responders, CTTS improved personal protection equipment for chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high explosive protection; as well as developed apps for interactive reference data to assist in identifying and neutralizing threat agents in the field and in laboratories.  CTTS also hosted interagency and foreign partner information exchange seminars and capability exercises to share and enhance response techniques and procedures for first responders.  

FY14 plans for CTTS will continue to address combating terrorism requirements from Defense, federal, state, local, and international customers and partners at home and abroad.  As U.S. forces are withdrawn from Afghanistan, CTTS will continue to address force protection needs for the remaining forces, as well as develop releasable technology solutions that may assist Afghan security forces.  Additionally, CTTS will address technology requirements requested from USSOCOM’s field components as they begin to increase their regional operations tempo in other parts of the world. Special emphasis will be for the Theater SOF in Africa and to support Theater SOF in the Pacific in support of the National Strategy to shift focus towards the Pacific.  Another areas of increased emphasis will be in the protection of U.S. personnel, to include State Department personnel in locations overseas that need increased security.  CTTS will also address technology and advanced analytical analysis requirements that will enhance Customs and Border Patrol along the U.S. Southwest Border; and will partner with Homeland Security as they identify requirements that will proactively address improvised explosive devices in a domestic environment.

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Combating Terrorism Technical Support (CTTS) program developed and delivered capabilities that addressed needs and requirements with direct operational application in the national effort to combat terrorism.  Projects are distributed among 9 mission categories: Advanced Analytics and Capabilities, Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosives; Improvised Device Defeat; Investigative Support and Forensics; Personnel Protection, Physical Security; Surveillance, Collection, and Operations Support; Tactical Operations Support; and Training Technology Development.  This program is a diverse, advanced technology development effort that capitalizes on interagency and international participation to demonstrate the utility or effectiveness of technology when applied to combating terrorism requirements.  It includes technology capability development, proof-of-principle demonstrations in field applications, and coordination to transition from development to operational use.  CTTS manages approximately 450 individual projects in support of Defense, federal, state, local, and international customers and partners.

For the Department of Defense, CTTS focused on requirements that support military forces in demanding or hostile environments in Afghanistan, Yemen, Africa, the Philippines, and Colombia; by rapidly developing and delivering leading edge products such as tactical sensors and unmanned vehicles, personal and physical protection, user friendly apps for analytical tools and reference guides, and weapons, sights, and ammo modifications.  Several of the highly successful products include Legacy human source information programs in Afghanistan and Mexico, the Lighthouse and PALANTIR information collection and analysis systems, the Enhanced Mortar Targeting System (EMTAS), and Insider Threat Situation Awareness Training. 

For U.S. federal, state and local law enforcement and first responders, CTTS improved personal protection equipment for chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high explosive protection; as well as developed apps for interactive reference data to assist in identifying and neutralizing threat agents in the field and in laboratories.  CTTS also hosted interagency and foreign partner information exchange seminars and capability exercises to share and enhance response techniques and procedures for first responders.  

FY14 plans for CTTS will continue to address combating terrorism requirements from Defense, federal, state, local, and international customers and partners at home and abroad.  As U.S. forces are withdrawn from Afghanistan, CTTS will continue to address force protection needs for the remaining forces, as well as develop releasable technology solutions that may assist Afghan security forces.  Additionally, CTTS will address technology requirements requested from USSOCOM’s field components as they begin to increase their regional operations tempo in other parts of the world. Special emphasis will be for the Theater SOF in Africa and to support Theater SOF in the Pacific in support of the National Strategy to shift focus towards the Pacific.  Another areas of increased emphasis will be in the protection of U.S. personnel, to include State Department personnel in locations overseas that need increased security.  CTTS will also address technology and advanced analytical analysis requirements that will enhance Customs and Border Patrol along the U.S. Southwest Border; and will partner with Homeland Security as they identify requirements that will proactively address improvised explosive devices in a domestic environment.

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This effort will investigate new concepts and technologies that fill critical warfighter needs with joint and interoperable systems at all echelons of warfare.  Through advanced mathematics and engineering methodologies, the Joint Interoperability Directorate will work to institutionalize joint interoperability concepts throughout the DoD to ensure reduced fratricide, increased force effectiveness, and decreased taxpayer cost through fully interoperable weapons remains a focus throughout the acquisition and program development processes.  Working closely with programs in the advanced technology development phase, this effort will result in reviews of program technology feasibility from an interoperability perspective and push to proof of concept through prototyping and modeling.

Joint Interoperability has additional efforts to develop advanced mathematics techniques to manage large volumes of sensor data to solve DoD Battlefield challenges, to review new interoperability technologies, and to review program documentation not only to ensure a joint and interoperable approach, but also to mature technologies that advance warfighter effectiveness and that apply technology rapidly to battlespace challenges.

Funding for this Program Element ends in FY 2012.

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Director, Joint Interoperability provides oversight and guidance to initiatives and programs that support the joint tactical warfighter to enable reduced fratricide, increased force effectiveness, and decreased taxpayer cost through fully interoperable weapons systems, down to the tactical level of engagement.  Joint interoperability is the force multiplier that will enable our warfighters to fight jointly, be more efficient and effective in the battlespace, and allow warfighters to fight in the battle and not the tactical Command, Control, and Communications (C3) displays.  Sharing of systems and information across Services, and with coalition and non-DoD partners, has the benefit of a more rapid and better coordinated response to an ever more agile adversary.  It also enables the full exploitation of our costly (legacy and future) weapon systems at full kinematic range and makes full use of the assets in theater.  The taxpayers also benefit from reducing the cost of weapon system procurement by paying once versus multiple times for weapons systems that are used by Services in the battlespace.

They will develop novel approaches to implement non-classical methods to solve computationally intensive problems like fusing numerous sensors that are generating terabytes of data in Afghanistan.  Our ability to sense has far exceeded our ability to process data into information.  Developing algorithms that are more computationally efficient at discerning information from large datasets will place smaller demands on our limited bandwidth and better enable the disadvantaged user to get information down to the tactical level.

Joint Interoperability removes barriers to communication and acts as a force multiplier to enable our warfighters to fight more efficiently and effectively across the spectrum of operations and is focused on maturing technologies that advance warfighter effectiveness and that apply technology rapidly to battlespace challenges.  Examples of the types of projects that are envisioned under this Program Element will focus on reducing fratricide, increasing force effectiveness, and reducing major acquisition program costs through fully interoperable weapons systems operating at tactical levels.  Typically these projects are on the technology maturity scale where an idea or technology opportunity is proven and demonstrated.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The mission of the Department of Defense (DoD)/Department of Energy (DOE) Joint Munitions Technology Development Program (JMP) is to develop new and innovative warhead, explosive, fuzing, and lifecycle technologies and tools to enable major improvements in conventional munitions.  The JMP supports the development and exploration of advanced munitions concepts and enabling technologies that precede Service-specific system engineering.  A Memorandum of Understanding signed in 1985 by DoD and DOE provides the basis for the cooperative effort and for cost-sharing the long-term commitment to this effort.  The DoE matches the DoD JMP funds budgeted in this justification dollar for dollar.  Through this interdepartmental cooperation, DoD’s relatively small investment leverages DOE’s substantial investments in intellectual capital and highly specialized skills, advanced scientific equipment and facilities, and computational tools not available within DoD.  Under the auspices of the JMP, the integration of DOE technologies with Joint and Individual Services’ needs have provided major advances in warfighting capabilities over many years and continues to play a crucial role in the exploration, development, and transition of new technologies needed by the Services.

The JMP seeks to develop:  improved modeling and simulation tools for munitions design and evaluation, including evaluation of vulnerability (for example:  design of insensitive munitions (IM)); novel experimental techniques and material property databases to support modeling and simulation; higher power and safer explosives and propellants; miniaturized, lower cost, and higher reliability fuzes, initiators, power systems, and sensors; design tools to enable development of higher performance warheads and weapons such as penetrators that are hardened against high impact loads; and tools to assess the health and reliability of the munitions stockpile and predict lifetimes based on these assessments.

The JMP is aligned with Department strategic plans and policies such as:

– Munitions for contingency operations, particularly for the reduction of unintended collateral effects.
– Reducing time and cost for acquisition of munitions.
– Rapidly transitioning science and technology (S&amp;T) to support the warfighter in today’s conflicts.
– Establishing future core capabilities and maintaining our national S&amp;T capabilities through joint investment and interagency cooperation and teaming.
– Aiding in recruiting and retaining high-caliber scientists and engineers at DoD S&amp;T organizations.
– Developing advanced munitions technologies to support the increased role of conventional weapons to deter and respond to non-nuclear attack, as described in the Nuclear Posture Review report.
– Developing safer munitions that are compliant with IM standards to meet statutory and Department policy requirements.

The JMP has established a successful collaborative community of DoD and DOE scientists and engineers.  This community develops technologies of interest to both Departments within a structured framework of technical reviews and scheduled milestones.  The JMP is administered and monitored by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and reviewed annually by the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), which is comprised of over 25 senior executives from the Army, Navy, Air Force, Special Operations Command, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, OSD, and DOE.  Projects are organized in eight Technology Coordinating Groups (TCG) that bring together the disciplines necessary to properly evaluate technical content, relevance, and progress.  The TCG conduct semi-annual technical peer reviews of JMP projects and plans.  DoD Service laboratory technical experts lead each of the TCG to ensure that the technologies under development address high-priority DoD needs.  The JMP also promotes more in-depth technical exchange via short-term visiting scientist and engineer assignments at both the DOE and the DoD laboratories.

The JMP has a long history of successful transitions and significant Return on Investment (ROI).

– The JMP is the primary provider of high performance structural mechanics computer codes used by DoD.  According to the FY 2010 High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP) Requirements Analysis Report, the DOE computer codes are used for over 70 percent of all (classified and unclassified) structural mechanics simulations and for virtually all of the classified calculations run by DoD on HPCMP platforms.  The Department expects this heavy reliance on DOE codes to grow for several reasons including: preference for using DOE codes because they are export-controlled; DOE codes are scalable, incorporate multiphysics, and run on massively parallel computer systems; and the Department can obtain source codes to modify for individual Service needs.
– A significant number of defense industrial contractors also use the DOE structural mechanics computer codes.
– CHEETAH, a standalone thermochemical computer code, is the most widely used code by DoD and defense contractors for predicting performance of energetic materials.
– The Army Research &amp; Engineering Development Center (ARDEC) has stated that the DOE computer codes are now routinely used to design all new warheads.  The use of these tools has reduced the number of validation tests required for each new warhead from about five to one with concomitant cost and time savings.
– The Army Research Laboratory has used DOE computer codes to develop and deploy new armor solutions to Iraq and Afghanistan with unprecedented speed.
– New munitions’ case material and explosive fill technologies provide the warfighter with a lethal and low collateral damage capability.  These technologies have been transitioned to the Focused Lethality Munition variant of the Small Diameter Bomb, which is currently fielded.  The technologies are also the basis for a new GBU 129 weapon that is currently under rapid development to meet a Joint Urgent Operational Need requirement for a low-collateral Mk-82 class weapon.
– The Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization (JIEDDO) has supported applications of JMP technologies, including: compact synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems for counter-Improvised Explosive Device (IED) efforts; pre-deployment training of military personnel by DOE explosive experts on how to recognize feed stocks and processes for homemade explosives; and use of massively parallel, multiphysics computer codes to understand how explosive blast waves cause brain injury and how to mitigate these injuries.
– An erosive initiator technology developed under the JMP has been transitioned to the Services for use in selectable output weapons and self-destruct capabilities.
– A novel approach to controlling the sensitivity and therefore the initiability of explosives using microwave energy, as well two new, insensitive energetic materials have transitioned to development projects in the Joint Insensitive Munitions Technology and Joint Fuze Technology Programs.
– Reliability analysis tools were used by Army Missile Command to assess Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM), Advanced Medium Range Air to Air Missile (AMRAAM), and Tube-launched, Optically-tracked, Wire command data-linked guided Missile (TOW).
– Robotic demilitarization processing systems were installed at several locations, including a system at Hawthorne Army Depot to recover copper shape charge liners, Comp A5, and grenade bodies. 

The JMP also works with the Defense Ordnance Technology Consortium (DOTC) and the National Warheads and Energetics Consortium (NWEC) of industrial suppliers to equitably and efficiently transition JMP technologies to defense industrial contractors.  In addition to the computer codes mentioned earlier, the JMP has transitioned case technology for low-collateral weapons, low-temperature co-fired ceramic technology for smaller, less expensive fuze electronic components, and erosive initiator technology for selectable effects weapons to defense industrial suppliers.

The integrated DoD and DOE efforts within the JMP are transitioning new munitions’ technologies to the Department and the defense industrial base through the advanced development process.  The JMP is a focal point for collaborative work by nearly 300 DoD and DOE scientists and engineers.  Technical leaders from both Departments consider the JMP a model of cooperation, both within their respective departments and between departments.  The highly challenging technical objectives of the approximately 35 JMP projects require multi-year efforts and sustained, long-term investments to achieve success.

The JMP projects are divided into five technical focus areas:  Computational Mechanics and Material Modeling; Energetic Materials; Initiators, Fuzes, and Sensors; Warhead and Penetration Technology; and Munitions Lifecycle Technologies.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The mission of the Department of Defense (DoD)/Department of Energy (DOE) Joint Munitions Technology Development Program (JMP) is to develop new and innovative warhead, explosive, fuzing, and lifecycle technologies and tools to enable major improvements in conventional munitions.  The JMP supports the development and exploration of advanced munitions concepts and enabling technologies that precede Service-specific system engineering.  A Memorandum of Understanding signed in 1985 by DoD and DOE provides the basis for the cooperative effort and for cost-sharing the long-term commitment to this effort.  The JMP funds budgeted in this justification are matched dollar for dollar by DOE funds.  Through this interdepartmental cooperation, DoD’s relatively small investment leverages DOE’s substantial investments in intellectual capital and highly specialized skills, advanced scientific equipment and facilities, and computational tools not available within DoD.  Under the auspices of the JMP, the integration of DOE technologies with Joint and Individual Services’ needs has provided major advances in warfighting capabilities over many years and continues to play a crucial role in the exploration, development, and transition of new technologies needed by the Services.

The JMP seeks to develop: improved modeling and simulation tools for munitions design and evaluation, including evaluation of vulnerability (for example:  design of insensitive munitions (IM)); novel experimental techniques and material property databases to support modeling and simulation; higher power and safer explosives and propellants; miniaturized, lower-cost, and higher reliability fuzes, initiators, power systems, and sensors; design tools to enable development of higher performance warheads and weapons—such as penetrators—that are hardened against high impact loads; and tools to assess the health and reliability of the munitions stockpile and predict lifetimes based on these assessments.

The JMP is aligned with Department strategic plans and policies such as:

– Munitions for contingency operations, particularly for the reduction of unintended collateral effects.
– Reducing time and cost for acquisition of munitions.
– Rapidly transitioning science and technology (S&amp;T) to support the warfighter in today’s conflicts.
– Establishing future core capabilities and maintaining our national S&amp;T capabilities through joint investment and interagency cooperation and teaming.
– Aiding in recruiting and retaining high-caliber scientists and engineers at DoD S&amp;T organizations.
– Developing advanced munitions technologies to support the increased role of conventional weapons to deter and respond to non-nuclear attack, as described in the Nuclear Posture Review report.
– Developing safer munitions that are compliant with IM standards to meet statutory and Department policy requirements.

The JMP has established a successful collaborative community of DoD and DOE scientists and engineers.  This community develops technologies of interest to both Departments within a structured framework of technical reviews and scheduled milestones.  The JMP is administered and monitored by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and reviewed annually by the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), which is comprised of over 25 senior executives from the Army, Navy, Air Force, Special Operations Command, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, OSD, and DOE.  Projects are organized in eight Technology Coordinating Groups (TCG) that bring together the disciplines necessary to properly evaluate technical content, relevance, and progress.  The TCG conduct semi-annual technical peer reviews of JMP projects and plans. DoD Service laboratory technical experts lead each of the TCG to ensure that the technologies under development address high-priority DoD needs.  The JMP also promotes more in-depth technical exchange via short-term visiting scientist and engineer assignments at both the DOE and the DoD laboratories.

The JMP has a long history of successful transitions and significant Return on Investment (ROI).

– The JMP is the primary provider of high performance structural mechanics computer codes used by DoD.  According to the FY 2010 High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP) Requirements Analysis Report, the DOE computer codes are used for over 70 percent of all (classified and unclassified) structural mechanics simulations and for virtually all of the classified calculations run by DoD on HPCMP platforms.  The Department expects this heavy reliance on DOE codes to grow for several reasons including: preference for using DOE codes because they are export-controlled; DOE codes are scalable, incorporate multiphysics, and run on massively parallel computer systems; and the Department can obtain source codes to modify for individual Service needs.
– A significant number of defense industrial contractors also use the DOE structural mechanics computer codes.
– CHEETAH, a standalone thermochemical computer code, is the most widely used code by DoD and defense contractors for predicting performance of energetic materials.
– The Army Research &amp; Engineering Development Center (ARDEC) has stated that the DOE computer codes are now routinely used to design all new warheads. The use of these tools has reduced the number of validation tests required for each new warhead from about five to one with concomitant cost and time savings.
– The Army Research Laboratory has used DOE computer codes to develop and deploy new armor solutions to Iraq and Afghanistan with unprecedented speed.
– New munitions’ case material and explosive fill technologies provide the warfighter with a lethal and low collateral damage capability.  These technologies have been transitioned to the Focused Lethality Munition variant of the Small Diameter Bomb, which is currently fielded.  The technologies are also the basis for a new GBU 129 weapon that is currently under rapid development to meet a Joint Urgent Operational Need requirement for a low-collateral Mk-82 class weapon.
– The Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization (JIEDDO) has supported applications of JMP technologies, including: compact synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems for counter-Improvised Explosive Device (IED) efforts; pre-deployment training of military personnel by DOE explosive experts on how to recognize feed stocks and processes for homemade explosives; and use of massively parallel, multiphysics computer codes to understand how explosive blast waves cause brain injury and how to mitigate these injuries.
– An erosive initiator technology developed under the JMP has been transitioned to the Services for use in selectable output weapons and self-destruct capabilities.
– A novel approach to controlling the sensitivity and therefore the initiability of explosives using microwave energy, as well two new, insensitive energetic materials have transitioned to development projects in the Joint IM Technology and Joint Fuze Technology Programs.
– Reliability analysis tools were used by Army Missile Command to assess Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM), Advanced Medium Range Air to Air Missile (AMRAAM), and Tube-launched, Optically-tracked, Wire command data-linked guided Missile (TOW).
– Robotic demilitarization processing systems were installed at several locations, including a system at Hawthorne Army Depot to recover copper shape charge liners, Comp A5, and grenade bodies. 

The JMP also works with the Defense Ordnance Technology Consortium (DOTC) and the National Warheads and Energetics Consortium (NWEC) of industrial suppliers to equitably and efficiently transition JMP technologies to defense industrial contractors.  In addition to the computer codes mentioned earlier, the JMP has transitioned case technology for low-collateral weapons, low-temperature co-fired ceramic technology for smaller, less expensive fuze electronic components, and erosive initiator technology for selectable effects weapons to defense industrial suppliers.

The integrated DoD and DOE efforts within the JMP are transitioning new munitions’ technologies to the Department and the defense industrial base through the advanced development process.  The JMP is a focal point for collaborative work by nearly 300 DoD and DOE scientists and engineers.  Technical leaders from both Departments consider the JMP a model of cooperation, both within their respective departments and between departments.  The highly challenging technical objectives of the approximately 35 JMP projects require multi-year efforts and sustained, long-term investments to achieve success.

The JMP projects are divided into five technical focus areas:  Computational Mechanics and Material Modeling; Energetic Materials; Initiators, Fuzes, and Sensors; Warhead and Penetration Technology; and Munitions Lifecycle Technologies.

                                                        <r2:Description>The goals of this technical focus area are to develop new energetic materials (EM) and supporting technologies to satisfy the competing requirements for smaller, more lethal, and safer munitions.  Work is primarily focused on explosives, gun and rocket propellants, and, to a lesser extent, pyrotechnics.  The projects include development of:  new EM, including new molecules in a range of particle size and morphologies; new EM formulations; a fundamental understanding of energetic properties and performance; and computational tools for analysis of performance and sensitivity.  New materials and formulations are developed with the recognition that cost must be feasible, chemical feed stocks reliable, and manufacturing processes suitable for scale-up to production levels.

Both federal statute and Department policy direct the development of safer, less sensitive munitions.  Making munitions less sensitive while maintaining explosive or propellant performance is a difficult challenge.  This goal is best attained through a combination of new EM development, EM characterization, and more sophisticated modeling and simulation tools.  It is cost-prohibitive to qualify weapons for compliance with insensitive munitions requirements through testing alone.  A better, in many cases, the only means to qualify these weapons is with the combination of analysis based on validated computational tools and a few well-designed tests.

The Department requires munitions that provide selectable effects.  To achieve these effects, weapons designers need to thoroughly understand the performance of EM used in both the main weapon fill and the initiation systems.  Distributed fuzing systems can provide selectable effects as well as safer munitions, but such complex small-scale systems require more complete knowledge of EM detonation physics and in, some cases, new EM designed for this application.

The desire for smaller and lighter munitions is driven in large part by the increasing dependence on unmanned weapons platforms and to some extent by the need to reduce logistical burden, especially energy consumption.  New EM are needed to meet the munitions weight and size requirements while maintaining lethality and safety.

The Department is working to increase the range and velocity of weapons and to develop weapons against hardened targets.  These applications subject the EM to high accelerations and shock loads.  To support the development of these new systems, we need to improve our ability to model EM under impact loads and to characterize relevant properties to determine their ability to survive in these aggressive environments.  We may also need to develop new, more robust EM that survive impact loads while maintaining lethality and initiability.

The specific projects in the energetic materials technical focus area are:
– Synthesis, properties, and scale-up of new energetic compounds.
– Insensitive munitions and surety.
– New energetic materials formulation and characterization.
– CHEETAH thermochemical code development and experiments.
– Micro- and nano-energetics synthesis and initiation.
– Hazards analysis of energetic materials.
– Reaction processes of energetic materials.
– Microfluidic reactor synthesis of sensitive explosives.
– Energetics chemistry and properties.

                                                        <r2:Description>The goals of this technical focus area are to develop new materials, components, diagnostic techniques, and modeling and simulation tools for fuzing systems.  Initiators, fuzes, and sensors must work reliably together to prevent unintended detonation, to correctly detect intended targets, and to initiate detonation when required.  Projects in this focus area support the Department’s needs to miniaturize fuzing systems.  Smaller systems are required for several reasons including: compatibility with smaller and lighter weapons systems; trading volume in munitions for other components such as additional explosive, larger power sources, or guidance systems; increasing reliability through redundancy (use two or more smaller initiating systems); and upgrading existing sub-munitions with smarter and more reliable fuzing systems.  The miniaturization of fuzing systems requires new material and components, new power systems, new diagnostic techniques, and improved modeling tools for microdetonics.  The Department also needs weapons systems with selectable effects and these effects can be achieved with multi-point initiation systems.  Such systems are inherently more complex and require improved characterization of initiator materials and components as well as more sophisticated modeling and simulation tools.  To attain greater precision and to avoid unintended collateral effects when weapons are used in the complex environment of counter-insurgency or counter-terrorist operations, target sensors must be reliable and provide high-fidelity discrimination.  Two projects in this focus area are developing technologies to achieve this level of performance in compact packages.
The specific projects in the initiators, fuzes, and sensors technical focus area are:
– Firing systems technology:  FireMod firing set code model development and validation, 1.6 hazard classification detonator development, and initiation and detonation physics on the millimeter scale.

                                                        <r2:Description>This focus area supports the development of new warheads and penetrator weapons through advances in materials processing and characterization, instrumentation, and computational codes.  In recent years there have been very large increases in warhead performance directly attributed to our ability to understand and accurately model the physics and fine details of new warhead designs, and to advances in increasingly sophisticated material processing.  The Department’s requirement to achieve more precise weapon effects with minimum collateral damage is supported by work on controlled fragmentation, non-fragmenting warhead cases, and multiphase blast explosives (MBX).  More recently, increases in performance and reductions in vulnerability are being achieved through improved warhead integration into munitions using a systems-oriented approach.

The goals for penetrator weapons are to investigate, develop, and transition advanced technologies for the design, development, and performance assessment of the next generation of high performance, precision strike weapons.  This effort directly supports national initiatives to defeat hard and deeply buried targets, which are proliferating worldwide, and to deny/defeat weapons of mass destruction.  The work addresses high-velocity penetration into granular materials (sand and soil), penetration into advanced concrete, new penetrator materials and designs, and non-inertial onboard instrumentation.

– Multiphase blast munitions (MBX) technology.
– Erosive initiation technology.

                                                        <r2:Description>This focus area supports improving the Department’s ability to understand, measure, predict, and mitigate safety and reliability problems caused by materials aging and degradation in weapons systems.  Current stockpile assessment methods typically focus on addressing materials aging and reliability problems after they occur, rather than anticipating and avoiding future problems or failure mechanisms.  The overall objective of this work is to develop a toolset of computational models that are able to quantitatively predict materials aging processes and ultimately improve the long-term reliability of weapons systems, sub-assemblies, and/or components.  These objectives are achieved by:  identifying aging mechanisms, quantifying the rates at which those aging mechanisms occur, developing predictive models, and using these models to predict the munitions stockpile reliability.  An additional objective of this work is to develop technologies and methodologies to enable munitions health management and condition-based maintenance.

The specific projects in the warhead and penetration technology focus area are:
– Predictive materials aging including: solder interconnect reliability, corrosion of electronics, and adhesive degradation.
– MEMS reliability.
– Military use of commercial, off the shelf (COTS) electronics.
– Complex system health assessment. </r2:Description>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Department of Defense must be ready to meet the widespread and growing proliferation of asymmetric electronic threats that are proliferating at an alarming rate, enabled by widely available commercial electronic components and devices.  These range from improvised devices constructed from commercially available electronic and industrial components to dedicated military devices that could be used in ways that diminish our technological advantage in conflicts with nation-states.  The surprisingly fast appearance of these threats is accelerating and is now happening faster than the requirements and acquisition process can respond.

The use of asymmetric devices is well understood by terrorists and nation-states alike.  Using man portable air defense systems, mortars, and improvised explosive devices actuated by electronics components terrorists have attacked both air and ground forces and pose a threat in any region due to their portability.  Unmanned aircraft systems, also strongly enabled by electronics components are proliferating and pose a threat both as a military capability and as a potential terrorist weapons delivery mechanism.  

Technological surprise and speed of appearance are two asymmetries that highlight the need to rapidly develop and field Electronic Warfare, Information Operations and Asymmetric Warfare capabilities capable of neutralizing such threats in ways that are both fiscally and temporally responsive.  This program element investigates means to rapidly mitigate asymmetric threats by integrating advanced commercial and military off-the-shelf technologies in innovative ways and rapidly demonstrating new technological capabilities to augment and/or reduce risk when inserted into service programs of record.  Efforts will also look for methods to employ asymmetric principles against our adversaries.

Beginning in FY 2014, the Joint Electronic Advanced Technology (JEAT) project reorganized to be in better alignment with Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering electronic warfare research priorities.  Particularly, JEAT establishes three pillars that will support the JEAT approach to innovation:  1) experimentation, 2) advanced concepts development/demonstration, and 3) innovative technology exploration.  The overarching JEAT philosophy is to be adaptive and to help lead the pace of rapid electronic systems development and the evolving threat picture.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Department of Defense (DoD) must be ready to meet the widespread and growing proliferation of asymmetric electronic threats that are proliferating at an alarming rate, enabled by widely available commercial electronic components and devices.  These range from improvised devices constructed from commercially available electronic and industrial components to dedicated military devices that could be used in ways that diminish our technological advantage in conflicts with nation-states.  The surprisingly fast appearance of these threats is accelerating and is now happening faster than the requirements and acquisition process can respond.

The use of asymmetric devices is well understood by terrorists and nation-states alike.  Using man portable air defense systems, mortars, and improvised explosive devices actuated by electronics components terrorists have attacked both air and ground forces and pose a threat in any region due to their portability.  Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), also strongly enabled by electronics components are proliferating and pose a threat both as a military capability and as a potential terrorist weapons delivery mechanism.  

Technological surprise and speed of appearance are two asymmetries that highlight the need to rapidly develop and field Electronic Warfare, Information Operations and Asymmetric Warfare capabilities capable of neutralizing such threats in ways that are both fiscally and temporally responsive.  This program element investigates means to rapidly mitigate asymmetric threats by integrating advanced commercial and military off-the-shelf technologies in innovative ways and rapidly demonstrating new technological capabilities to augment and/or reduce risk when inserted into service programs of record.  Efforts will also look for methods to employ asymmetric principles against our adversaries.

Beginning in FY 2014, the Joint Electronic Advanced Technology (JEAT) project reorganized to be in better alignment with Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD(R&amp;E)) electronic warfare research priorities.  Particularly, JEAT establishes three pillars that will support the JEAT approach to innovation:  1) experimentation, 2) advanced concepts development/demonstration, and 3) innovative technology exploration.  The overarching JEAT philosophy is to be adaptive and to help lead the pace of rapid electronic systems development and the evolving threat picture.

Experimentation:

Distributed Electronic Effects Delivery (DEED) – An experimental venue (live, virtual and constructive) to assess emerging Electronic Warfare (EW) effects coordination and sensor technologies and catalyze the rapid creation of multi-point, collaborative delivery of EW services to warfighters.  This effort promotes innovative networked systems management capabilities to provide broad situational awareness and manage EW services delivery in a coordinated and collaborative manner.  All impacts on the ability to precisely deliver EW effects (environment, adversary spectrum activities, dynamic platform motion, etc.) while minimizing blue force side effects will be assessed.  Because this venue will employ many developmental and existing UAS, a goal is to include a component to allow assessment of the vulnerability of these UAS to EW effects.

Advanced Concepts Development/Demonstration:

Advanced Threat Countermeasures – This effort focuses on the investigation of innovative, low cost, near-term Countermeasures (CM) solutions that can be rapidly fielded to counter new classes of advanced missile seekers.  It builds on prior work with the Services (signature collections and analyses of CM delivery mechanisms) to begin the process of assessing potential CM solutions.

Software Programmable/Spectrum Diverse Electronic Attack (EA) Capability – Opportunities exist to adapt existing technology used for communication and other purposes into highly configurable EA capability.  This technology will help counter adversary movement into advanced military purpose digital electronic systems.  Beginning in FY 2014 JEAT will begin to adapt software configurable communications technology to be used as part of a distributed, networked, EA capability that can be readily adapted for installation in a wide variety of host platforms.

Innovative Technology Exploration:

Adaptive/Asymmetric Technology – This effort directly supports ASD(R&amp;E), EW and CM by performing analyses and studies of emerging asymmetric threats.  Past efforts under this JEAT project include the Aircraft Survivability Equipment Joint Analysis Team and the Helicopter Survivability Task Force, both of which resulted in significant strategic technology investments by the Department.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

These sensors typically provide the pilot with separate displays of radar warning and missile warning to guide the pilot in selecting automatic or manual countermeasures against radar, laser, or radio frequency guided threats.  These unfused sensors create a serial information stream which can induce an inadequate response to the threat.  Federated systems consume weight, space, and power which are at a premium in small platforms.  Additionally, there currently is no coordinated effort to develop integrated situational awareness or control CM that include off-board systems.</r2:Description>

In FY 2013 the efforts of this mostly government team will include novel techniques to detect and locate the signatures of terrorist activities using electronic means.  Trident Spectre provides a venue for various members of Special Forces, Conventional Forces and Intelligence Community to collaborate on and evaluate technologies and techniques related to “Tactical Intelligence” in a technical, operational, and safe environment.  Trident Spectre provides an opportunity for capability developers (scientists, engineers, designers) to interact directly with tactical operators, collectors and analysts; and a process that correctly and efficiently reviews potential Tactical Intelligence technologies and techniques that will enhance the operational capability of the DoD activities in OCO.  Primary payoff is improved connectivity and more efficient collection and dissemination of Tactical Intelligence.  Customers include United States Central Command, Special Operations Command (SOCOM), ASD(R&amp;E), DoD Conventional/Special Forces, and members of the Intelligence Community.  Products include an after action report and a transition plan moving management activities from ASD(R&amp;E).</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY 2014, the "Disruptive Demonstrations" project was inserted to support development and demonstration of time-sensitive capabilities that address Secretary/Department Strategic Vectors and Chairman’s Gap Assessment of capability shortfalls.  As a result, we anticipate less partner funding for those strategic investment areas and will have to rely on greater partner funding for other Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (JCTD) projects.  Overall, we envision fewer JCTD projects that will be longer in duration.

Today's operations require faster delivery of new capabilities.  Therefore, the JCTD Program works to accelerate project selection, encourage capability demonstration of less than two years where possible, but supports longer term projects (three years or more) when technical challenges warrant it.  This revised process includes:  streamlined project approval and initiation; clear one-year deliverables and decision points for projects greater than a year in duration; and annual reviews of ongoing JCTDs to assess deliverables and continuation of the project.  </r2:ProgramElementNote>
                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The JCTD Program directly addresses Joint, Coalition, and/or Interagency capability needs expressed by Combatant Commands (COCOMs).  Due to significant successes since inception of the program (initially the Advanced Capability Technology Demonstration (ACTD) Program), the JCTD Program is often viewed by COCOMs as a primary means to rapidly develop, assess, and transition time-sensitive capability solutions into operations.  Through partnering with other solution providers and resource sponsors, the JCTD Program typically leverages two dollars in partner funding for every one dollar in the JCTD budget.  Thus, the value and impact of JCTDs to the COCOMs is significantly greater than a traditional Research and Development (R&amp;D) program.

Key values demonstrated by the JCTD program are:
- The program has a long history of providing enduring capabilities:  to date, over 80 percent of completed JCTDs have successfully transitioned capabilities to warfighters.  70 percent of completed ACTD projects successfully transitioned their products.  See “Section D.  Acquisition Strategy” for transition discussion.
- The program delivers capabilities rapidly; projects execute quicker than the Department of Defense (DoD) Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution (PPBE) process.  The result is that 74 JCTD/ACTD projects delivered capabilities used in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and 57 projects delivered capabilities to Operation Enduring Freedom.  Most of those capabilities would not have been delivered – or would have been significantly delayed – without the JCTD program.  Recent examples are:  sensor capabilities for finding and interdicting tunnels delivered to Afghanistan to address a Joint Urgent Operational Needs Statement (JUONS) requirement and to interdict tunnels on the US-Mexico border; autonomous technologies for unmanned aerial resupply of forward operating bases; a sensor capability to provide situational awareness in the riverine environment; and a deployable, integrated system to provide essential services in the immediate aftermath of a crisis event, to include renewable-powered water desalination deployed to all the COCOMs.  
-The program enables Coalition cooperative development by leveraging partner nation expertise and resources; approximately one-third of JCTD projects involve some degree of coalition partner participation.  As a result of successful past collaborations, the program now enjoys routine interactions with the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, the Republic of Korea, and the Republic of Singapore.
- The program enables development and execution of interdepartmental cooperation projects, such as projects with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Department of State (DOS), and Department of Transportation (DOT).  Recent examples are interdepartmental collaborations for maritime awareness, air domain information sharing, tunnel detection and characterization, and Arctic awareness.
- The program enables rapid response to new DoD priorities before Service PPBE cycles can respond.  For example, the DoD has recently established priorities for Anti-Access/Area-Denial, Building Partner Capacity, understanding human terrain, and nuclear forensics.  The JCTD Program quickly responded to the new priorities and is providing initial capabilities that are transitioning to Service efforts.

MEASURABLE OUTCOMES:  Metrics include all JCTDs will have deliverables within 15 months (analyses, designs, models, etc.) to enable assessment for project continuation; 50 percent of JCTDs will provide an operationally-relevant prototype within 18 months; and 75 percent will complete final demonstration within 24 months of receiving funding.  JCTDs will spiral products and deliverables during the demonstration to meet COCOM needs.  Capabilities delivered and technologies transitioned are additional key metrics.

Transition Achievement:  The JCTD program has been achieving actual transition rates of over 80 percent, well in excess of the DoD Strategic Objective 3.5.2D, Performance Measure 3.5.1-2D, goal of 40 percent.  The JCTD Program defines transition as all or components of the demonstrated JCTD going to a new or existing Program of Record (POR), providing fieldable-prototypes (residual capabilities) sustained by non-JCTD funds in direct support of operations in theater, or commodity-type capabilities entered onto General Service Administration (GSA) schedule for procurement by DOD users.  13 of 16 completions in FY 2012 were successfully transitioned.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Therefore, the Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (JCTD) Program works to accelerate project selection, encourage capability demonstration of two years where possible, but supports longer term projects (three years or more) when technical challenges warrant it.  This revised process includes:  streamlined project approval and initiation; clear one-year deliverables and decision points for projects greater than a year in duration; and annual reviews of ongoing JCTDs to assess deliverables and continuation of the project.  </r2:ProjectNote>
                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The JCTD Program directly addresses Joint, Coalition, and/or Interagency capability needs expressed by Combatant Commands (COCOMs).  Due to significant successes since inception of the program (initially the Advanced Capability Technology Demonstration (ACTD) Program), the JCTD Program is often viewed by COCOMs as a primary means to rapidly develop, assess, and transition time-sensitive capability solutions into operations.  Through partnering with other solution providers and resource sponsors, the JCTD Program typically leverages two dollars in partner funding for every dollar in the JCTD budget.  Thus, the value and impact of JCTDs to the COCOMs is significantly greater than a traditional Research and Development (R&amp;D) program.

Key values demonstrated by the JCTD program are:
- The program has a long history of providing enduring capabilities:  to date, over 80 percent of completed JCTDs have successfully transitioned capabilities to warfighters. 70 percent of completed ACTD projects successfully transitioned their products.  See “Section D.  Acquisition Strategy” for transition discussion.
- The program delivers capabilities rapidly; projects execute quicker than the traditional Department of Defense (DoD) Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution (PPBE) process.  The result is that 74 JCTD/ACTD projects delivered capabilities used in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and 57 projects delivered capabilities to Operation Enduring Freedom.  Most of those capabilities would not have been delivered – or would have been significantly delayed – without the JCTD program.  Recent examples are:  sensor capabilities for finding and interdicting tunnels delivered to Afghanistan to address a Joint Urgent Operational Needs Statement (JUONS) requirement and to interdict tunnels on the US-Mexico border; autonomous technologies for unmanned aerial resupply of forward operating bases; a sensor capability to provide situational awareness in the riverine environment; and a deployable, integrated system to provide essential services in the immediate aftermath of a crisis event, to include renewable-powered water desalination deployed to all the COCOMs.  
- The program enables coalition cooperative development by leveraging partner nation expertise and resources; approximately one-third of JCTD projects involve some degree of coalition partner participation.  As a result of successful past collaborations, the program now enjoys routine interactions with the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, the Republic of Korea, and the Republic of Singapore.
- The program enables development and execution of interdepartmental cooperation projects, such as projects with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Department of State (DOS), and Department of Transportation (DOT).  Recent examples are interdepartmental collaborations for maritime awareness, air domain information sharing, tunnel detection and characterization, and Arctic awareness.
- The program enables rapid response to new DoD priorities before Service PPBE cycles can respond.  For example, the Department has recently established priorities for Anti-Access/Area-Denial, Building Partner Capacity, understanding human terrain, and nuclear forensics.  The JCTD Program quickly responded to the new priorities and is providing initial capabilities that are transitioning to Service efforts.

MEASURABLE OUTCOMES:  Metrics include:  all JCTDs will have deliverables within 15 months (analyses, designs, models, etc.) to enable assessment for project continuation; 50 percent of JCTDs will provide an operationally-relevant prototype within 18 months; and 75 percent will complete final demonstration within 24 months of receiving funding.  JCTDs will spiral products and deliverables during the demonstration to meet COCOM needs.  Capabilities delivered and technologies transitioned are additional key metrics. 

Transition Achievement:  The JCTD program has been achieving actual transition rates of over 80 percent, well in excess of the DoD Strategic Objective 3.5.2D, Performance Measure 3.5.1-2D, goal of 40 percent.  The JCTD Program defines transition as all or components of the demonstrated JCTD going to a new or existing Program of Record (POR), providing fieldable-prototypes (residual capabilities) sustained by non-JCTD funds in direct support of operations in theater, or commodity-type capabilities entered onto GSA schedule for procurement by Department users.  13 of 16 completions in FY 2012 were successfully transitioned.

The three programs are (1) Unified Combatant Commander (COCOM) Direct Support; (2) JCTD Pre-Transition; and (3) Program Integration Office for execution of select, classified projects.  (1) COCOM Direct Support:  The COCOMs are essential in specifying capability needs, project selection, validation, demonstration, assessment, and transition of JCTDs.  The JCTD Program provides direct support to COCOMs, enabling the COCOMs to provide an on-site JCTD manager, typically one to two full-time equivalents (FTEs).  (2) JCTD Pre-Transition:  In some cases, Service or Agency partner transition funding is not available for one to two years following the JCTD assessment phase due to the Service or Agency Program Objective Memorandum commitments.  In such cases, where there is a clear transition and the need to sustain the capability for a short time prior to availability of Service or Agency transition funds the JCTD Pre-Transition fund may be used to meet that need.  (3) Program Integration Office:  A limited number of classified projects that require enhanced security measures due to need-to-know and/or mission partner sensitivities are managed within the Program Integration Office.

Imagery tasking and delivery is controlled directly by the Combatant Commander to ensure sufficient timelines for near real-time situation awareness and decision-making in the field.  The cost of less than $1.500 million for a Kestrel Eye enables an affordable constellation for persistence, near continuous converge between 45 degrees North/South.   The primary outputs and efficiencies are:  (1) Finish one Block 1 “proof of concept” design, launch Block 1 Kestrel Eye and conduct on-orbit evaluation and upgrade Block 2 design with propulsion system and improved telescope pointing using a star tracker.  The JCTD will build and launch three Block 2 design Kestrel Eye satellites.</r2:Description>

This allowed the Department to rapidly execute the JCTDs needed in FY 2013 to meet the COCOMs most pressing needs as soon as FY 2013 funds became available.  COCOMs proposed projects addressing a range of capability gaps including:  project power despite anti-access/area denial challenges; defending the Homeland and providing support to civil authorities; conducting humanitarian, disaster relief, and other operations; counter terrorism; and irregular warfare.  Additional COCOM proposals were acted on throughout the year to address emerging needs as funds were identified.

FY 2014 JCTD projects will be identified under the JCTD selection process beginning with a Candidate Nomination Board in the spring of FY 2013, followed by a Candidate Decision Board (CDB) in the Summer of 2013.  This allows the Department to rapidly execute the JCTDs needed in FY 2014 to meet the COCOMs' most pressing needs as soon as FY 2014 funds become available.  Additional CDBs will be held throughout the year to address emerging COCOM needs.  JCTDs identified in these CDBs will be initiated as funds are identified.

The JCTD program sub-allocated $21.300 million to Army for this effort and was subsequently remunerated.  During the FY 2012 Continuing Resolution (CR) period (September to December 2011), Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) funds from the JCTD program were used for critical operations of the HPCMP Army program.  The HPCMP was devolved from OSD to Army as part of the FY 2011 Secretary of Defense efficiencies initiative.  Under Continuing Resolution rules, Army could not fund the HPCMP new start initiative and did not have the prior year budget authority for HPCMP.  Thus, OSD JCTD program funds were used for HPCMP.</r2:Description>

- The capabilities address a documented capability gap in an existing Program of Record, so that the existing Program can acquire, further develop, sustain, and provide the capability under existing program documentation.
- The capabilities address capability gaps that naturally fit with an existing Program of Record, but program documentation addressing the new capabilities does not exist.  In these cases, existing program documentation (such as the Capabilities Development Document or Capabilities Production Document) is revised to include the new capabilities from the JCTD, and the JCTD capabilities transition to the Program of Record.
- The capabilities address a current operational need without requiring Program of Record changes.  In these cases, the JCTD capabilities may transition directly to operational use, with sustainment (operations and maintenance) funding arranged through the gaining command.  
- The capabilities may be widely applicable commodity products, useful to many commands.  In these cases, the commodity products listed on General Services Administration schedule, and made available for purchase by any commands needing the capability, using procurement funds.

                                                <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Strategic Goals Supported in FY 2014:
- Project Selection Focus
- Spiral Technologies to Fielded Capabilities
- Time to Final Demonstration
- 70 Percent Transition Rate 
- Adequately Shared Funding and Visibility
- Independent Assessment Capability
- Successful Military Utility Assessment (MUA)

The majority of funding from this program element is forwarded to the Services/Defense Agencies that execute the individual JCTD projects.  The Director, JCTD Program, maintains and provides overall programmatic oversight for the JCTD program, to include the individual JCTD projects.  The JCTD performance metrics center on how fast relevant joint and/or transformational technologies can be demonstrated and provided to the joint warfighter.  These metrics are driven by the overall business process which includes six parts:  (1) selection focus; (2) ability to spin-off spiral technologies; (3) time necessary to complete a final demonstration; (4) adequately resourced projects with appropriate oversight; (5) capability to complete an independent assessment of the technology; and (6) the number of successful capabilities that are actually transitioned to the warfighter.  

MEASURABLE OUTCOMES:  Metrics include:  all JCTDs will deliver products within 12 months to enable assessment for project continuation; 50 percent of JCTDs will provide an operationally-relevant prototype within 12 months and 75 percent will complete final demonstration within 24 months of Implementation Directive signature.  JCTDs will spiral products and deliverables during the demonstration.  At least 75 percent of JCTD projects will transition products to Programs of Record (POR), sustained residual operations, or availability for procurement from the General Services Administration Schedule.

Transition Achievement:  The JCTD program has been achieving actual transition rates of over 80 percent, well in excess of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering) stated goal of 40 percent.  The JCTD Program defines transition as all or components of the demonstrated JCTD going to a new or existing POR, providing fieldable-prototypes (residual capabilities) sustained by non-JCTD funds in direct support of operations, or commodity-type capabilities entered onto GSA schedule for procurement by Department users.  13 of 16 completions in FY 2012 successfully transitioned.

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Networked Communications Capability Program (NCCP) seeks to accelerate the wireless mobile networking capability of Department of Defense’s (DoD) current and planned investments in response to national military strategy and ever growing needs.  Warfighter’s today rely more and more on communications networks to support and enable actions from targeting and shooting weapons to video-conferencing.  Though military basic infrastructure capabilities follow the mainstream commercial internet, for many reasons (security, mobility, and robustness), commercial telecommunications especially commercial wireless (tactical edge) communications are not well-matched with the requirements of today’s warfighter.  These trends will continue as the military data load becomes more diverse and heavy.  These tactical edge technology challenges cut across all warfare domains (space, air, ground, and sea).  In response to recognized technical problems today, as well as anticipated problems in the future, this research will focus on two key problems in networked technologies:  The need for "Joint interoperability" and  "expanded reach" (resilient and robust) where no communication infrastructure exists.  The main research objectives of this program are to:

– Perform Network Communications Analysis to establish the scientific foundations for tactical mobile networking with a specific emphasis on integrating heterogeneous Networks and Integrated NetOps for tactical networks.
– Complete the enhancements of joint integrated capability to predict performance of heterogeneous communication networks and expand the reach/connectivity and capacity. 
– Jointly manage and operate existing and planned diverse communications networks, services and applications.
– Create mature products for transition to programs of record (POR) or directly to field.
	- -  Wireless mobile network design, development &amp; operations, spectrum management, information assurance and information dissemination management software tools.
	- -  Joint Aerial Layer Networking (JALN), services and applications packages including hardware and software systems and integrated/joint network operations software tools and new information architectures.

This research provides the technical basis to standardize the implementation of military network communications capabilities in the areas of joint airborne network gateways and network communications analysis across the military services, Joint Staff, Office of the Secretary of Defense, and defense agencies.

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Tactical Mobile Networking - As studies have suggested, for instance, the National Research Council’s Network Science Report (2005) and Army Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET) JASON's Report (January 2006), the type of networking projected to meet military tactical requirements is not supported by network theory, network design, and analysis tools.  This research will define those technical parameters important to military tactical mobile networking environments, investigate the status of network design and analysis tools, and evaluate how modeling and simulation is conducted to support tactical mobile networking environments.  The role of network experimentation with respect to network modeling will be explored.  Further development and analysis will be conducted to improve the awareness of the condition of tactical mobile networking technologies.  Design tools, architectures, and technical approaches will be recommended to acquisition programs as a result of this research.  
  
Network Management Tools and Analysis - Network management in the commercial world is a highly organized, synchronized activity that has excellent tools to monitor activity and repair disrupted networks as needed.  These same tools are ill-matched for management in the wireless world, and specifically for military tactical mobile networking.  In addition, the military tactical mobile networking environment lacks the infrastructure (connectivity) and support (helpdesk) because resources (spectrum, people, and equipment) are scarce (not in harm's way).  As the complexity of networking grows and as network capabilities are introduced, improved network management is required.  For military operations, assured delivery may be needed for specific information and operations.  This requires management tools to be in place to ensure continued secure and robust operations, which is not achieved with commercial wireless technologies.  This research will assess network management tools in place for the military tactical mobile networking environment and develop technology and tools to address shortfalls with the goal to transition technology to operational systems.   
  
Spectrum Management Tools and Analysis - For wireless, tactical mobile networking, the management of the use of spectrum effects network operations.  The demand for spectrum is increasing due to the expanded use of sensors, imagery, and voice.  This demand increases the pressure on the limited shared radio frequency (RF) spectrum for military tactical networking.  The current Department of Defense (DoD) frequency planning and management infrastructure will have a limited ability to cope with this demand through operational planning, Coalition Joint Spectrum Management Planning Tool (CJSMPT) Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (JCTD), and the Global Electromagnetic Spectrum Information System (GEMSIS).  Advanced spectrum management concepts such as sense and adapt, spectrum sharing, and dynamic reallocation are under investigation but not yet mature support operations.  This research will evaluate opportunities for more efficient and effective use of the frequency spectrum within DoD.  Technology advances are expected to advance the concept of cognitive radio and cognitive antenna devices to sense and adapt operations based on spectrum policy and usage, the management of multi-band and multifunction apertures, and the use of spectrum efficient waveforms for use in military environments.  This research will develop the models and tools to demonstrate capabilities for operational planning and monitoring of spectrum as these technologies are introduced.  
  
Integrated Network Management Capability - Network management becomes more complex as more and different types of networking capability become available.  Integrated network management across heterogeneous systems, especially wireless systems, requires definition, design, and development.  Operationally, network management assumes all functions required to share networking resources and ensure proper operation for participants.  This research will define integrated network operations tools for all aspects of network resource management and to prioritize across operational spectrum management, security management, network management, and information management.  This research will also develop test beds especially to validate models and simulations used to develop and test network management tools, and conduct experimentation on approaches developed. 

Tactical Networking Evolution and Expansion - Fielded and about-to-be-fielded tactical networks can be vastly expanded and evolved from their current capabilities by developing and applying new techniques (or existing techniques developed in basic research) to the existing systems, providing modern capability to the warfighter without the large expense to the DoD of developing new systems.  This research will focus on developing and applying new DoD specific techniques to create leap-ahead approaches to Anti-Jam resistance of tactical networks, larger, more fully exploited networks, and expanded capabilities for signal/data processing and data compression in radios and across the networks.  This research will take advantage of new software defined radios about to be fielded by the Department, as well as focus on the existing legacy systems, using the successful approach we developed when fielding the Netted Iridium capability.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementNote>Change from FY 2013 to FY 2014 reflects a realignment of the program funds from the Data to Decisions Advanced Development PE 0603663D8Z to the new Applied Research for the Advancement of Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Priorities PE 0602251D8Z.  

The goals of this program will be shifted to the Department of Defense (DoD) Components under the direction of the Research and Engineering Executive Committee and will conform with the DoD Data to Decision Priority Steering Council roadmaps.  Historically, the Joint Data Management program was restructured to evolve into the revised Data to Decisions program to support the FY 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review mission:  Succeed in counterinsurgency, stability, and counterterrorism operations.  In addition, this program addresses a signed Secretary of Defense S&amp;T priority, Data to Decisions, which reduces the cycle time and manpower requirements for analysis and use of large data sets.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>As the DoD increases the capability and capacity to generate increasing amounts of data from numerous sensors in the battlespace, the issue of handling very large data sets has become more challenging.  This is in part due to Department of Defense response to a changing threat environment where there is an expansion of the types of sensors deployed, new types of information collected, and different features used to classify these new threats.  From a technical perspective, data creation speeds have outpaced the speed and ability to transport, store and process the data created. Science and Technology (S&amp;T) investigation into new and novel ways to manage and exploit this data is required to more efficiently use sensor assets and effectively use information in a timely fashion.

The OSD Data to Decisions program (PEs 0602663D8Z and 0603663D8Z) uniquely address three specific gap areas not addressed by Component S&amp;T:  minimal dedicated Data to Decisions research to support Joint and emerging mission areas; DoD needs a mechanism to increase responsiveness of Component Data to Decisions research and lower the time-to-solution across a broad DoD-wide user base; and limited investment in multi-disciplinary research investigations of Data to Decisions issues and solutions.  The OSD Data to Decisions program pulls together research efforts to address shortfalls within the context of Joint and emerging missions to ensure that the distinctive needs of these joint analysts and decision makers are addressed by DoD science and technology.  As an example, irregular warfare, non-state terrorism movements, and uncertain environmental patterns that trigger major weather disasters are producing a reality for military and government leaders where traditional physics-based sensors alone are insufficient to plan current and future actions in a region on interest or need.  Component Data to Decisions efforts focus on developing technology to overcome a particular challenge within a mission or advance a particular priority area of that Component, as a result the Research and Engineering Database has over 388 references to Decision Support programs all of which are designed to address a specific need over the course of several years.  However, there exists no other program in the DoD that focuses on technology development efforts to speed the delivery of the Component solutions and lessons learned to a DoD-wide user base.  The OSD Data to Decisions program provides the common platform (access to datasets, infrastructure, and metrics) to integrate and evaluate the technology development and research methods to support various missions driven by the challenge problems.  This ability to rapidly evaluate technology development and research methods will allow technology transfer for mission analysis not previously foreseen and lower the time-to solution across DoD by rigorously analyzing technical performance for more immediate use.  Traditional approaches within research seek to advance machine systems for a specific mission effect resulting in large complex data sets.  While necessary for sensor system improvements, potential Data to Decisions solutions require a coupling of automated data analysis with human analysts, operators and decision makers in order to reduce time and limit the number of people required.  Many research studies, workshop and analysis have stated that solutions to data issues are multi-disciplinary.  The OSD Data to Decisions program is in the unique position to reach across Components and research disciplines to blend promising research in new ways in response to Challenge Problem statements.  For Challenge Problems, contextual understanding will result from research combining human sciences with computer processing techniques to take advantage of a person’s cognitive ability to fuse and assimilate multiple sources and types of information for new insights.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The D2D program establishes the demonstration and experimentation environment to conduct independent evaluations of research efforts that have the most potential of minimizing the impact of the increasing amount of information available and required to support military operational decision-making.  The intent is to leverage existing research investments within defense S&amp;T and provide proper evaluations and assessments to facilitate technology transition.  The Applied Research program concentrates on the Development portion of this collaborative effort, focusing on the development of improved algorithms (relative to FY 2012 state of the art) to be demonstrated and validated in the 6.3 D2D program test bed.  The D2D Advanced Development (6.3) program uses a spiral development model with four-steps.  Each year Operational teams will choose a series of cross-service challenge problems dominated by a specific sensing modality.  Representative data for each of those problems will then be collected for testing against that problem.  A Development team will design algorithms and data management architectures using high-level languages and self-test on controlled data sets to address those challenge problems.  Independent assessment will occur with sequestered data sets, but each development tool will also be tested against new sensors not included in the self-testing to determine fragility and applicability.  A transition team will host the developed algorithms as services in a spiraling prototype system that will support rapid prototyping and transition.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Biometric technologies are revolutionizing critical military operations by providing the warfighter with the ability to verify an individual’s claimed identity; and, when combined with additional intelligence and/or forensic information, establish an unknown individual’s identity, which strips away his anonymity.  These emerging technologies provide Department of Defense (DoD) warfighters and commanders with an important capability that supports such missions as base access, force protection, maritime intercept and counter-piracy operations, counterintelligence screening, humanitarian assistance and displaced persons management.  Additionally, the biometrics and identity information collected during DoD missions are shared with the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of State, and the Department of Justice, to support homeland defense, law enforcement, and other national interests.  

In October 2006, the Deputy Secretary of Defense designated the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD(R&amp;E)) as Principal Staff Assistant (PSA) for biometrics.  In April 2011, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (USD(AT&amp;L)) was designated as the PSA for forensics.   The PSAs for biometrics and forensics have the responsibility to fully address and exercise control over all facets of the DoD’s biometrics and forensics programs, initiatives and technologies.  A central role of the Biometrics and Forensics Science &amp; Technology Program is to support each respective PSA in addressing the technology gaps that preclude our ability to quickly and accurately identify anonymous individuals who threaten our interests and provide the ability to attribute enemy activity to a specific individual. 

The Biometrics and Forensics Program develops an annual comprehensive science and technology (S&amp;T) plan and implements multiple projects to advance capabilities in both biometrics and forensics.  This S&amp;T plan includes a portfolio of emerging technologies that will support the evolving capabilities required by the commanders and warfighters in ongoing and future military operations.

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Biometric technologies are revolutionizing critical military operations by providing the warfighter with the ability to verify an individual’s claimed identity; and, when combined with additional intelligence and/or forensic information, establish an unknown individual’s identity, which strips away his anonymity.  These emerging technologies provide Department of Defense (DoD) warfighters and commanders with an important capability that supports such missions as base access, force protection, maritime intercept and counter-piracy operations, counterintelligence screening, humanitarian assistance and displaced persons management.  Additionally, the biometrics and identity information collected during DoD missions are shared with the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of State, and the Department of Justice, to support homeland defense, law enforcement, and other national interests.  

In October 2006, the Deputy Secretary of Defense designated the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD(R&amp;E)) as Principal Staff Assistant (PSA) for biometrics.  In April 2011, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (USD(AT&amp;L)) was designated as the PSA for forensics.   The PSAs for biometrics and forensics have the responsibility to fully address and exercise control over all facets of the DoD’s biometrics and forensics programs, initiatives and technologies.  A central role of the Biometrics and Forensics Science &amp; Technology Program is to support each respective PSA in addressing the technology gaps that preclude our ability to quickly and accurately identify anonymous individuals who threaten our interests and provide the ability to attribute enemy activity to a specific individual. 

The Biometrics and Forensics Program develops an annual comprehensive science and technology (S&amp;T) plan and implements multiple projects to advance capabilities in both biometrics and forensics.  This S&amp;T plan includes a portfolio of emerging technologies that will support the evolving capabilities required by the commanders and warfighters in ongoing and future military operations.

These projects are designed to advance immature technologies and deliver a prototype. 

In FY 2012, nine projects were completed with prototype or final product delivery.  Six projects were focused on biometrics and transitioned to the Army as the Executive Agent for Biometrics.  Three of the projects were focused on forensics and were transitioned to the Army as the Executive Agent for Forensics.  Close coordination between biometrics and forensics operational users and the respective S&amp;T communities helped ensure each delivered product was transitioned to operational use.  The Biometrics transition rate of 100 percent for FY 2012 exceeds the 40 percent benchmark established by DoD Strategic Objective 3.5 - 2D.

In addition, project performance metrics specific to each effort are identified in the project plan, and individual project success will be monitored through these metrics.  The metrics include items such as target dates from project work break down schedules, production measures, production goals, production numbers and demonstration goals and dates.

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Our military forces require resilient, reliable networks and computer systems to conduct effective operations.  However, the number and sophistication of threats in cyberspace are rapidly growing, making it urgent and critical to improve the cyber security of Department of Defense (DoD) networks to counter those threats and assure our missions.  This program focuses on innovative and sustained research in both cyber security and computer network operations to develop new concepts to harden key network and computer components to include: designing new resilient cyber infrastructures; increasing the military’s ability to fight and survive during cyber attacks; disrupting nation-state level attack planning and execution; measuring the state of cyber security for the U.S. government; increasing our understanding of cyber as a war-fighting domain; and providing modeling and simulation of cyberspace operations through exploring and exploiting new ideas in cyber warfare for agile cyber operations and mission assurance. 

The Cyber Advanced Technology Development program element is budgeted in the advanced technology development budget activity because it focuses on the maturation of successful applied research results, and their development, into demonstrable advanced cyber security capabilities.  The Cyber Advanced Technology Development program will build on the results of matured applied research from the Cyber Applied Research (0602668D8Z), and other programs, to develop technology demonstrations for potential transition into capabilities that support the full spectrum of computer network operations.  These approaches will include moving from cyber defense to cyber resilience by changing the defensive terrain of our existing digital infrastructure, identifying ways to raise the risk and lower the value of an attack from an advanced persistent cyber threat, and focusing on mission assurance metrics. 

This program focuses on integrating computer network defense (CND) and computer network operations (CNO), in addressing the advanced persistent threat (APT), filling DoD technology gaps as identified in the FY 2012 Cyber Priority Steering Council Science &amp; Technology Roadmap, as determined by assessments conducted by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research &amp; Engineering (OASD(R&amp;E)).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Efforts of the program will develop improved and demonstrable capabilities through the DoD science and technology (S&amp;T) organizations within and across the following technical areas:

INFORMATION ASSURANCE AND COMPUTER NETWORK DEFENSE (IA/CND):
Develop technologies to harden DoD network components; evolve from network defense to mission assurance; and enable systems to operate through cyber attacks in degraded and contested environments.

COMPUTER NETWORK OPERATIONS (CNO):
Disrupt adversary attack planning and execution; explore game-changing ideas over the full spectrum of CNO and new concepts in cyber warfare; increase collaboration between disparate research communities within CNO; and address identified gaps in DoD CNO S&amp;T to prepare for cyber conflict against advanced persistent threats.

Beginning in FY 2014, the program will expand research in cyber command and control to provide warfighters and commanders new situational awareness, course of action analysis, cyber operational agility and cyber mission control.  This research will include protection of tactical networks, weapons systems and platforms.  The six new technical thrust areas include:

FOUNDATIONS OF TRUST:
Develop approaches and methods to establish known degree of assurance that devices, networks, and cyber-dependent functions perform as expected, despite attack or error.  This technical area encompasses all aspects of the assessment, establishment, propagation, maintenance, and composition of trust relationships between devices, networks, and people. 

RESILIENT INFRASTRUCTURE:
Entails the ability to withstand cyber attacks, and to sustain or recover critical functions.  A resilient infrastructure has the ability to continue to perform its functions and provide its services to required levels during an attack.  The objective in this area is to develop integrated architectures that are optimized for their ability to absorb (cyber) shock, and recover in a timely fashion to a known secure state, even if this is at the expense of degraded performance.  Resilient Algorithms and Protocols cover ways to develop novel protocols and algorithms to increase the repertoire of resiliency mechanisms available to the infrastructure and architecture.  Research is needed to develop resiliency at lower levels with specific algorithms and protocols to support higher-level resiliency architectures.

AGILE OPERATIONS:
Explore new methods and technologies to dynamically reshape cyber systems as conditions/goals change, to escape harm, or to manipulate the adversary.  These capabilities present technology challenges in the areas of Autonomic Cyber Agility and Cyber Maneuver.  Cyber Maneuver is a new way to manage systems dynamically in a cyber situation.  It is a set of emerging methods for maintaining defensive or offensive advantage in cyber operations.  It entails developing mechanisms that enable goal-directed reshaping of cyber systems.  Cyber maneuver encompasses reallocation for repurposing a device or platform, reconfiguration for changing the way a system performs a task, and relocation for altering the operating location in a logical or physical topology.  Autonomic Cyber Agility covers several forms of agility.  As cyber infrastructures increase in scale and complexity, there is an urgent need for autonomous and agile mechanisms to reconfigure, heal, optimize, and protect defensive and offensive cyber mechanisms.  

ASSURING EFFECTIVE MISSIONS: 
Develop the ability to assess and control the cyber situation in the mission context.  While the focus in cyber research is often placed on individual technologies, how these technologies work toward an effective mission is critical for the DoD.  The objective of Assuring Effective Missions presents technology challenges in the areas of Cyber Mission Control and Effects at Scale.  Cyber Mission Control covers the ability to orchestrate cyber systems to achieve an overarching mission goal.  There is a critical need for tools that can map information technology assets to missions and use modeling and simulation, or other techniques, to perform dynamic analysis of asset criticality and course-of-action alternatives.  Inherent in Cyber Mission Control is the ability to automatically derive and fuse information about the characteristics of information technology systems in a manner that allows us to describe, analyze, observe, and control the operation of information technology components.  A key goal of this research area is to have tools that enable commanders to assess and direct different information technology maneuvers in conjunction with mission actions.  Effects at Scale encompass full spectrum challenges that intersect with cyber becoming a new full-fledged domain of warfare.

CYBER MODELING, SIMULATION, AND EXPERIMENTATION (MSE):
Develop modeling and simulation capabilities that are able to sufficiently simulate the cyber environment in which the DoD operates and enable a more robust assessment and validation of cyber technology development.  There are two technical challenges associated with cyber modeling, simulation, and experimentation; Cyber Modeling and Simulation and Cyber Measurement.  Cyber Modeling and Simulation seeks to develop tools and techniques that enable analytical modeling and multi-scale simulation of complex cyber systems.  Cyber Measurement develops cyber experimentation and test range technology to conduct controlled, repeatable experiments, providing the ability to track the progress of cyber research investments in a quantitative fashion.  This area will explore new analytical methodologies, models, and experimental data sets to establish metrics to measure a system’s state of security, apply the scientific method to establish the foundations of a framework in which cyber security research can be conducted, to test hypothesis with measurable and repeatable results, and the quantitative experimentation and assessment for new cyber technologies.  These new methodologies will enable the exploration modeling and simulation tools and techniques that can drive innovation in research and aid in integrated experimentation and transition to operations to simulate the cyber environment with sufficient fidelity, and to integrate cyber modeling and simulation with the traditional modeling and simulation related to the kinetic domain.   
 
EMBEDDED, MOBILE, AND TACTICAL ENVIRONMENTS (EMT):
Increase the overall emphasis on the Department’s cyber systems that rely on technology beyond wired networking and standard computing platforms.  The objective in the area of embedded and tactical systems is to develop tools and techniques that assure the secure operation of microprocessors within our weapons platforms and systems; enable security in real-time systems; and establish security in disadvantaged, intermittent, and low-bandwidth environments.  This research also seeks to expand and cultivate military-grade techniques for securing and operating with enterprise-style commodity mobile devices, such as smart phones, tablets, and their associated infrastructures.  With the constant evolution of these devices and their respective infrastructures it is of the utmost importance to provide a secure environment where these devices can be effectively utilized, monitored and tracked.  </r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The OSD HSCB Modeling Program is a vertically integrated effort to research, develop, and transition technologies, tools, and systems to programs of record and users in need.  The Program exists to optimize U.S. forces’ ability to perform population-centric sensing, understand behaviors driven by social and cultural variables, and select effective courses of action in the full range of military operations.  Program research will enhance population-centric intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities for understanding the increasingly complex global environment to address national strategic challenges such as instability, aggression, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and violent extremism.  In three integrated program elements (PEs), the Program will conduct applied research, mature and demonstrate advanced technology, and develop transitionable methods, technology, tools and prototypes.  Work under PE 0603670D8Z is focused on developing and demonstrating general-use, cross-domain tools in two areas: computational modeling; and sociocultural behavior data collection, management, and dissemination.  Research will result in more effective cultural understanding in existing intelligence, influence operations, and operations planning systems; modeling capabilities for forecasting reactions to U.S./coalition actions; demonstration of strategic decision making tools that highlight political, religious, cultural, and related factors; tools and technologies enabling more widespread and effective use of sociocultural behavior models in operations and mission rehearsal; and toolsets that can be used as strategic decision making tools to account for sociocultural factors.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The Program has emphasized development of tools to support forecasting of instability.  In addition to refining and extending those tools, the Program is researching and developing comparable models and tools for analysis and forecasting of other events of interest.  Work in this area also includes modeling to support analysis of alternative courses of action (COA).  This is a challenging objective that requires research, development and integration of constituent technologies. Integrate and demonstrate decision making support tools useful within programs of record and operational user analysis, planning and execution systems for political, religious, cultural and other factors.  Support specific operational planning tasks for selected government partners via limited technical demonstration in user settings.  In addition, working with operational partners HSCB Program models will be tested in realistic environments by representative users.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Defense-wide Manufacturing Science and Technology (DMS&amp;T), established within the Manufacturing Technology Program directed in Title 10 USC Section 2521, provides the Department with a comprehensive manufacturing program to achieve the strategic goals of focused technology, improved acquisition across the life cycles, and cost-effective logistics.  By designing for manufacturability early in development, anticipated results will have an impact on increasing reliability and decreasing the life cycle burden of weapon systems. The mission to anticipate and close gaps in defense manufacturing capabilities and drive significant system life cycle affordability benefits makes DMS&amp;T an increasingly important leveraging tool in the current budget environment.
			
DMS&amp;T will: 1) address manufacturing enterprise game-changing initiatives that are beyond the scope of any one Military Department or Defense Agency or platform and, 2) establish and mature cross-cutting manufacturing processes required for transitioning emerging technologies which impact the time lines, affordability, and productivity of acquisition programs and shorten the deployment cycle times.
			
The DMS&amp;T program is fundamental to a coordinated development process.  Concurrent development of manufacturing processes with the S&amp;T development enables the use of emerging technologies.  Key technical areas for investment for DMS&amp;T include Advanced Electronics and Optics Manufacturing, Advanced Materials Manufacturing, and Enterprise and Emerging Manufacturing.  Advanced Electronics and Optics addresses advanced manufacturing technologies for a wide range of applications such as sensors, radars, power generation, switches, and optics for defense applications.  Advanced Materials addresses advanced manufacturing technologies for a wide range of materials such as composites, metals, ceramics, nanomaterials, metamaterials, and low observables.  Enterprise and Emerging Manufacturing addresses advanced manufacturing technologies and enterprise business practices for defense applications.  Key focus areas include the industrial information infrastructure, advanced design/qualification/cost tools, supply network integration technologies and management practices, direct digital (or additive) manufacturing, machining; robotics, assembly, and joining.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The DMS&amp;T program has a two-pronged approach: 1) technology initiatives and 2) specific single projects.  Technology initiatives, in collaboration with the Joint Defense Manufacturing Technology Panel (JDMTP) and industry, identify and develop investment strategies to advance the manufacturing processes needed to support the specific technology.  Above-the-shop-floor investments focus on new manufacturing processes that have potential to significantly improve manufacturing efficiencies. Single specific projects address investment opportunities not associated with selected technology initiatives and enable the program to respond to urgent, compelling manufacturing needs and provide seed funding to more high risk-high payoff technologies.
 			
Data calls are launched through two methods to identify technology initiatives and single specific issues requiring investment.  One method is through the JDMTP.  The JDMTP is comprised of the ManTech Directors from the Services, Defense Logistics Agency, and Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD).  The call is distributed through the ManTech Directors to the four JDMTP sub panels: Metals Processing and Fabrication Subpanel, Composites Processing and Fabrication Subpanel, Electronics Processing and Fabrication Subpanel and Advanced Manufacturing Enterprise Subpanel. Potential candidates are evaluated by the JDMTP based on criteria set forth in the call and announcements and down-selected for further development prior to final selection.  The other method is through Broad Agency Announcements to industry.  Priority is given to investments that support affordability and producibility of critical enabling manufacturing technologies that cut across multiple platforms.  Investments also balance defense priorities in specialty materials, electronics, propulsion and power, and manufacturing processes including "above the shop floor" (lean and business technologies facilitating interoperable manufacturing).  Final projects are selected by the OSD ManTech Director, considering input from the JDMTP and Director of Manufacturing, and as approved by Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense, Manufacturing and Industrial Base Policy (MIBP).  Technology initiatives and projects are executed at the Component level.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The IBIF programs all addressed key defense-wide manufacturing science and technology issues, with the additional requirements of addressing surge and/or diminishing material source issues.  In addition, these programs all had a clear transition path with implementation on a current platform or one undergoing acquisition targeted to be within 2-3 years of project completion.  The following areas of investment were executed to enable a diverse suite of advanced manufacturing production improvements:

- Connecting American Manufacturing – created a national-level, integrated framework to enable rapid, high-density, multi-sector brokering between buyers and US suppliers
- Additive manufacturing initiative – created a large collaboration on additive manufacturing, which enabled innovative research, transition to multiple DoD platforms, and educational opportunities
- Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) for Electron Beam additive manufacturing – developed rapid and affordable NDE techniques for Ti and other metal parts manufactured using a directed energy additive technique 
- Read-out Integrated Circuit for Electro-optical distributed aperture system (EODAS) – redesigned, fabricated, tested, and laser hardened EODAS ROIC to use state-of-the-art foundry equipment and increase yield.  
- Slurry Dip Automation – developed an automated dipping and slurry management system for flare countermeasure products that effectively eliminated human operators from the dangerous process
- On-tool Inspection of Fiber Placement – developed non-destructive evaluation and quality inspection techniques within the fiber placement head for in-process, rapid inspection,  improving yield and process control
- Curved transparent armor – developed manufacturing technology of transparent armor, which enabled curved and thinner transparent structures and decreasing cost
- Transparent Ceramics – Sapphire – created an approach to determine the significant factors affecting the velocity of single crystal growth of large sheet sapphire production. 
- Quallion Lithium-ion 6T Vehicle Starter Battery – Developed a lithium-ion military vehicle starter battery that significantly improves power and energy density of the standard 6T lead acid battery.   Implemented semi-automated manufacturing processes to move this key component into high volume production and utilize Quallion Zero-Volt cells to reduce life cycle costs.
- Saft Lithium Ion Energy Storage – Developed lithium ion electrochemical solution integrated with appropriate packaging and systems engineering that provides a Starting / Lighting / Ignition battery for military 14 Volt systems.  This program will prime the pump of domestic lithium battery manufacture in large volumes.
- Multi Function Periscope – specified goals and requirements, and began design work to develop a periscope for armored vehicles that merges an external view with sensor and vehicle health data.

Multiple users benefitted from these programs including Air Force/Navy F-35 users, Army/Air Force flare users, and Special Operations Command.

                                                        <r2:Description>This effort applies an existing radar system already in production to satisfy a low-cost, open-architecture radar requirement for the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) program. This program will reduce the cost of the current radar system by $1M per ship set, and will fit into the existing TRS-3D top side and below decks available footprint. The open architecture configuration will allow upgrades for new technologies over the lifetime of the program as well as offer lower cost via the potential for open competition for the radar’s building blocks.  Radar manufacturing and support capability will be transferred from a foreign company to a domestic company and facility.  Transmit/Receive (T/R) module packaging cost will be reduced through near-hermetic, commercial Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuit (MMIC) packaging and automated Surface Mount Technology (SMT) assembly techniques, reducing touch labor costs.  Model Based Enterprise (MBE) concepts will be integrated to ensure supportability and technology refresh via an Intelligent Technical Data Package.  The commercial packaging effort for T/R module components as a part of this program will have a direct impact on the Volume Search Radar (VSR) on CVN-79 – creating a $1M/hull cost savings for the Navy.  This effort will provide the Navy with the first truly open architecture radar solution that will be able to accommodate different Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuit (MMIC) technologies, Line Replaceable Unit (LRU) technologies, processor, and power supplies from multiple vendors.  The system will use fiber optics to connect the above-deck equipment (antenna) with the below-deck equipment (signal processing and control) which will allow greater flexibility in location of below-deck equipment (allowing a lower center of gravity and thus improved ship stability).</r2:Description>

                                                        <r2:Description>Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems require precise timekeeping even if the Global Positioning System (GPS) is unavailable. The size, weight, power, and cost components of conventional atomic clocks are too high for tactical applications. Chip Scale Atomic Clock (CSAC) provides improved long-term frequency stability that gets integrated into long-term time accuracy. The focus of this project is leveraging Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) investments in the CSAC technology to reduce operational costs and transition beyond custom fabrication of the current CSAC.  Objectives include improving the existing batch manufacturing processes such as atomic cell filling, cell sealing, physics package assembly, and sub-system testing to reduce the “touch hours” required for CSAC assembly and testing. Development of a network of multiple vendors to foster competition and ensure a viable supply base is a complementary goal. Current manual assembly processes can produce CSAC in small quantities with low yield at high cost ($8,000/unit).  The DMS&amp;T funding enables producibility at an affordable cost ($100–$300/unit). Successful performance enables an environment of continued operation of critical C4ISR systems, regardless of the presence or absence of global positioning system (GPS). The ability to rapidly reacquire GPS military code in a hostile Electro Magnetic Interference (EMI) environment is an additional targeted benefit.</r2:Description>

The results will be reduced cost and assured availability of CZT substrates that will enable affordable, high performance ground and air IR sensor systems with rapid wide area search, long range ID, and dual band multispectral aided target detection capability against difficult targets while on-the-move.  Large, affordable CZT substrates from a domestic source will initially transition on FPAs for the 3rd Gen forward-looking infrared imaging systems (FLIR) Engine Engineering Manufacturing Development program, to be followed by multiple transitions to space, strategic, and tactical systems. </r2:Description>

                                                        <r2:Description>The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) has the requirement to minimize low and high powered laser effects on mission accomplishment.  Current F-35 Electro-Optical Targeting System (EOTS) and Electro-Optical Distributed Aperture System (EODAS) focal plane arrays (FPAs) suffer manufacturing yield and cost issues.  This effort will leverage prior and concurrent DoD investments in laser protection technology to make manufacturing improvements that incorporate laser protection technology into the FPA’s Read-Out Integrated Circuits (ROICs) while concurrently reducing ROIC defects (improving yield) and minimizing the total cost to F-35 to meet this requirement.  The goal is to increase the Transition Readiness Level/Manufacturing Readiness Level to TRL/MRL 6 (demonstrate/produce prototype system or subsystem in a relevant environment) and to transition laser-hardened FPAs in time for the F-35 Block 5 Upgrade.  These technologies are applicable not just for F-35, but to any Medium Wavelength Infrared detector, including those on tactical and reconnaissance sensor systems.</r2:Description>

                                                        <r2:Description>Advanced Electronics is a series of efforts addressing advanced manufacturing technologies for a wide range of applications such as sensors, radars, power generation, switches, and optics for defense applications.  These efforts provide significant productivity and efficiency gains in the defense manufacturing base.  These manufacturing technologies accelerate delivery of technical capabilities to impact current warfighting operations, and manufacturing technologies to reduce the cost, acquisition time and risk of our major defense acquisition programs.

Tin Whisker Mitigation project: One significant issue is the need to move toward lead-free electronics.  However, current methods to produce lead-free solder create further issues such as the formation of unwanted tin whisker structures, which can cause electronics to short out.  The Tin Whisker Mitigation project will demonstrate controlled grain structure in soldered joints and plated surfaces.  The objective is to show significantly reduced or completely prevented tin whisker growth, while maintaining the original performance characteristics of the test components.

Silicon Carbide (SiC) High Efficiency Power Switches: Another emerging manufacturing technology undergoing development is for Silicon Carbide High Efficiency Power Switches to enable a new class of power electronics that allows flexible new architectures at higher voltages, higher frequencies, less volume / weight, higher temperatures, higher efficiency (reduced fuel consumption), and better power quality for Program Executive Office Ground Combat Systems and the Air and Missile Defense Radar Radar Power Conversion Module.

Mini Short Wave Infrared (SWIR) Cameras and ManTech for SWIR Imagers: Thermoelectric Cooler (TEC)-less SWIR imagers are being developed that are smaller, use less power, have a lower cost than currently available SWIR imagers, and offer improved functionality over sensors presently in use.  These new SWIR imagers will be used by warfighters including SOF to see target designation lasers during day and night, to identify friend or foe at long range at night, and to operate with covert lasers.  Applications include several night vision and targeting system programs with the Army, Navy, Air Force, and SOCOM.

Manufacturability of Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers (VCSELs): One emerging manufacturing technology undergoing development focuses on the manufacturability of VCSELs. This effort will allow the enhanced use of high-power laser diode technologies by reducing their operational cost, increasing their reliability and yield, and improving their large array scalability without substantially increasing the processing and packaging requirements. Will apply a modern factory approach of a fab-less front-end with specialized in-house process steps, allowing more flexibility for DoD procurement cycles and leveraging installed, previously-invested capital. This project is expected to benefit numerous programs, including: PUMA, RAVEN, TigerShark, Anubis, Spectre-FINDER, Speckles, TigerMoth, WAAS, PAWS, IPODS, AngelFire, MAV-OBAT, nLoss, LOS-short, CLRF, JETS, IDNST, TLDS, Big Safari, OEF, OIF,  STINGER , and ARGUS.

Future efforts will focus on advances in fuel cells, radars, conformal sensors, and solder free electronics.

Effort addressed: 1) reduction of internal stresses that cause tin whisker formation; 2) strength of the solder joint to cause pad cratering; 3) crystal orientation and cross-sectional analysis of a variety of solder joints; and 4) improvement for electrochemical migration during Surface Insulation Resistance testing with marginal levels of contamination.</r2:Text>

Mini SWIR Cameras and ManTech for SWIR Imagers:   Develop robust 4” wafer processes to reduce breakage and increase yield.  Improve backside processing costs.

Manufacturability of VCSELs: Initiate hermetic design efforts, creating hermetic packaging for VCSEL arrays. Develop a “hermetic by design” VCSEL chip process technology by processing direct passivation schemes directly onto the wafer to extend the operating life and shelf-life. Begin to standardize the package at the sub-mount and heat-sink level. This is required for ease of insertion to replace edge-emitting products in use by the marketplace and will increase packaging throughput of high power arrays.

Even a 10% reduction in system weight would significantly increase warfighter acceptance, mobility, agility, and endurance.  This effort will leverage prior DoD investments to mature three complimentary manufacturing technologies that will reduce body armor weight by 10%-15% while improving ballistic performance and flexibility.  Cost will be reduced 5%-10% and cycle time will be reduced by 10X-20X.  The project will mature three manufacturing technologies for lighter weight armor from a capability to produce the technologies in a laboratory to a capability to produce them in an environment representative of a production facility.  The three technologies are: 1) Dissimilar Material Assembly Technology to integrate ceramic, polymer adhesives, composites, and other organic and inorganic constituents into a unified body armor system. 2) Co-consolidation processing, to reduce cost and cycle time for the production of composite material enabling 10% lighter armor while maintaining ballistic performance. 3) Multi-scale modification of ballistic ceramics and associated processes, which will include new additive processes and metallic substrates to improve ballistic integrity and manage adverse shock events due to ballistic impact.</r2:Description>

                                                        <r2:Description>This effort addresses limitations of conventional sintering processes.  Conventional sintering takes from hours to days in a sintering oven, and the beneficial characteristics of nano-structured materials are lost when the material is sintered.  FAST has the potential to dramatically reduce cycle time and manufacturing costs while maintaining the beneficial characteristics of nano-structured materials.  The FAST process passes a pulsed direct current through the part while it is pressed in a die, and the combination of rapid heating and compressive loading results in fine grained, fully dense materials in short processing times that are not possible with conventional sintering processes.  Many parts that are made with a powder press and sinter process are candidates for FAST, but this project will focus on ceramic body and vehicle armor, tungsten kinetic energy penetrators, infrared windows, heat sinks for electromagnetic propulsion cooling, and hypersonic and high temperature for enhanced performance jet propulsion.</r2:Description>

                                                        <r2:Description>Advanced Materials Manufacturing is a series of efforts addressing advanced manufacturing technologies for a wide range of materials such as composites, metals, ceramics, nanomaterials, metamaterials, and low observables.  These efforts will provide significant productivity and efficiency gains in the defense manufacturing base.  These manufacturing technologies will accelerate delivery of technical capabilities to impact current warfighting operations, and manufacturing technologies to reduce the cost, acquisition time and risk of our major defense acquisition programs.

Advanced materials manufacturing technologies undergoing development include materials for ballistic survivability and materials for rapid fabrication of structural components.

Cast Eglin Steel: An effort is underway to establish Cast Eglin steel chemistry specs to maximize strength and ductility for maximum protection and effectiveness for Hard and Deeply Buried Target (HDBT) targets. Will create a primary casting process for the single piece cast underbody protection system, and bomb bodies. Developing cast-in pockets, slopes, and curves in order to meet geometric and blast requirements.

Cold Spray Deposition: The objective for Cold Spray Deposition is to create a proven repair process and original equipment manufacturer applied corrosion/wear prevention treatment for magnesium gearbox housings and parts on numerous platforms. Inability to repair is causing significant readiness, sustainment, and safety issues (20% of the fleet is affected at any given time). Working with the original equipment manufacturer to transition the process to industry to treat new parts and to maintain, repair, and overhaul condemned gearboxes in storage.  

Net-Shaped Field Assisted Sintering Technology (FAST): FAST will set the processing limits and qualify the process for the production of two ultra high temperature materials components that require full density materials with nano tailored microstructures that are not achievable via other processes.  This technology addresses near net shaped, thin walled axial rocket nozzle inserts (flute shaped) made from W (Tungsten) and TaC alloys and sharp leading edges with attachment features made from Hf-based ceramics.  This effort will mature the manufacturing readiness of conventional FAST while reducing costs and providing faster delivery times.

Fastener Fill: The F-35 Fastener Fill project will address the challenges incurred in the manual fastener fill installation process, which can take as long as 2 minutes per fastener and provides no indication of installation quality other than feel.  With over 40,000 fasteners per aircraft for F-35, this is a significant manufacturing issue.  In addition, excess materials must be manually skived to meet flushness requirements. The project objective is to refine the contractor’s prototype Rapid Intelligent Fastener Fill System which is an automated combination melt, compress, and skive tool capable of installing fastener fill material in less than 15 seconds per fastener. 

Automated and Rapid Boot Installation Process: This process will reduce the labor-intensive nature of the installation procedures, which are not suitable for full-rate production and represent 40% of the cost in component finishing. A risk assessment analysis has identified the following areas to be targeted: (1) automation of the hand-cut/trimmed, multi-piece boot installations; (2) automation of additional trimming, bonding, and pasting activities currently performed manually; (3) improved quality of technician skill/training; and (4) reduction of the waste incurred in cutting/darting boots.</r2:Description>

Cold Spray: Project Kickoff June 5, 2012. Created a proven repair process developed by the US Army Research Laboratory and the original equipment manufacturer applied corrosion/wear prevention treatment for magnesium gearbox housings on numerous platforms. Inability to repair was causing significant readiness, sustainment, and safety issues.

Net-Shaped Field Assisted Sintering (FAST): The near net shape densification by Field FAST were explored using TaC-based composite powders. Two different vertical die designs were developed and tested to produce a near net shape, nozzle throat. The preliminary results showed that the near net shape consolidation by FAST was successful, resulting in close to ideally dense microstructures.

                                                        <r2:Description>Enterprise and Emerging Manufacturing is a series of efforts addressing advanced manufacturing technologies and enterprise business practices for defense applications.  Key focus areas include direct digital (or additive) manufacturing, advanced manufacturing enterprise, machining, robotics, assembly, and joining.  These manufacturing technologies and enterprise business practices will accelerate delivery of technical capabilities to impact current warfighting operations, and manufacturing technologies to reduce the cost, acquisition time and risk of our major defense acquisition programs.

With our adversaries forced to innovate rapidly to survive, it's become increasingly important for the U.S. military to improve its own agility and flexibility. The focus is to find a solution to overcome a burdensome acquisition cycle requiring a great amount of cost, time, security, and storage space. Through the use of secure satellite data links or a local parts database, warfighters can access CAD designs for replacement parts, allowing them to repair equipment without the need to establish supply chains or wait for shipments. It allows operators to modify a part's design based on its performance in the field.

Emerging manufacturing technologies undergoing development include:  Large-scale, challenge for advanced, interoperable machine tool applications, and methods for exchange of 3D official technical data throughout the supply chain and between government and contractors.

National Additive Manufacturing Innovation Institute (NAMII): Collaborative efforts with NAMII enable the production of finished parts directly from digital data such as 3D Computer-aided design (CAD) drawings. It provides almost limitless freedom to designers, allowing the use of very complicated geometries. It is as economical to produce single items as it is to produce thousands and thus undermines economies of scale. Using additive manufacturing would allow for rapid replacement of parts in the field and enable deployed units to remain mission-ready.  Through the use of secure satellite data links or a local parts database, warfighters near deployment locations could access CAD designs for replacement parts, allowing them to repair equipment without the need to establish supply chains or wait for shipments. It would allow operators to modify a part's design based on its performance in the field.  There is a strong need to fabricate timely and affordable aerospace structures in a production environment for rapid fielding of materials and systems.  An example of a system that could benefit is an air flow control actuator within an inlet duct.  This program involves design, fabrication, testing and performance analysis of various parts using additive manufacturing.  Complex designs, such as conformal lattice structures, may only be successfully manufactured using methods such as additive manufacturing.

MTConnect Challenge: The MTConnect Challenge focuses on developing manufacturing solutions (tools) using newly developed MTConnect interoperable protocol, for use on machining platform development. MTConnect is an open communication standard that provides the capability to pass data from machine tools to higher level systems for further processing using the XML based standard.  

Framework for Assessing Cost and Technology (FACT): Producibility analysis tools will be matured so that component performance, manufacturing processing techniques and cost can be simultaneously considered to achieve an optimum design solution.  Current producibility analysis tools do not reuse and connect existing design, manufacturing and cost models. Sustainment and Maintenance will be impacted by maturing advanced sustainability analyses operating within FACT to reduce sustainment costs associated with spare parts acquisition and weapon system maintenance.  The technology will enable correct selection of a manufacturing process to minimize cost given the estimated spare part lot sizes. Block Upgrades or Recapitalization using FACT will be critical for performing analyses associated with integrating new requirements into an existing platform to highlight the manufacturing and lifecycle costs associated with the necessary changes to the weapon system in order to meet new operational requirements.

                                    <r2:ProgramElementNote>The FY 2014 funding increase is directly related to the funding insertion of the new "Disruptive Technology Demonstrations" project.  Resulting from the guidelines provided by the Secretary of Defense in the Defense Strategic Guide (Sustaining Global Leadership: Priorities for 21st Century Defense), the reallocation of funds will support the identification and demonstration of disruptive solutions.  These resources will support specific time-sensitive capability needs that address Secretary/Department Strategic Vectors and Chairman’s Gap Assessment of capability shortfalls.  The funding increase to P795:  Emerging Capabilities Technology Development for FY 2014 supports Department-wide S&amp;T priorities and advanced developmental prototyping.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This funding develops emerging capabilities and advanced developmental prototypes in support of near and mid-term irregular warfare and stability operations.  The framework is guided by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering (ASD(R&amp;E)), the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense of Rapid Fielding (DASD RF), and the Rapid Reaction Technology Office (RRTO) science and technology objectives and focus areas.  With an emphasis on interagency and Service partnerships, initiatives are developed to pursue risk-reducing prototypes and demonstrations in order to produce capability options that anticipate and inform formal joint and interagency requirements and acquisition processes.  Individual projects generally span a two to three year period and are demonstrated and fielded in spirals within the project timeline.  During FY 2012 and FY 2013, RRTO continued to expand its maritime and irregular warfare portfolio as a complement to the existing maritime technology demonstrator and ground, and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) portfolios and in FY 2014 RRTO will continue these efforts and enhance its focus on developmental rapid prototyping.  This program element has evolved from exclusive support of force transformation activities to the activities described above, which is more closely aligned with departmental goals.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Program Element was a new start in FY 2012 and reflects a transition from 0605799D8Z to 0603699D8Z in FY 2012.

This funding develops emerging capabilities and advanced developmental prototypes in support of near and mid-term irregular warfare and stability operations. The framework is guided by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering (ASD(R&amp;E)), the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense of Rapid Fielding (DASD RF), and the Rapid Reaction Technology Office (RRTO) science and technology objectives and focus areas.  With an emphasis on interagency and Service partnerships, initiatives are developed to pursue risk-reducing prototypes and demonstrations in order to produce capability options that anticipate and inform formal joint and interagency requirements and acquisition processes.  Individual projects generally span a two to three year period and are demonstrated and fielded in spirals within the project timeline.  During FY 2012 and FY 2013, RRTO continued to expand its maritime and irregular warfare portfolio as a complement to its existing maritime technology demonstrator and ground, and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) portfolios and in FY 2014 RRTO will continue these efforts and enhance its focus on developmental rapid prototyping.  This program element has evolved from exclusive support of force transformation activities to the activities described above, which is more closely aligned with departmental goals.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                        <r2:Description>Overwatch is an overarching ground capability development effort which is leveraging technology and new concepts to fill ground combat and interagency capability gaps.  It contains multiple initiatives seeking to cultivate and leverage emerging technologies and concepts to counter the current and future challenges characteristic of the irregular warfare environment.  Projects are oriented toward increasing warfighter effectiveness on the battlefield and/or the development/enhancement of “whole of government” irregular warfare capabilities.
  
The capability development effort furthers interagency capabilities by pursuing concept experimentation/validation, interoperability enhancements, and command and control development.  Ground capabilities focus on command and control, force protection, situational awareness, and networked, cooperative engagement.  These solutions include completed operational assessments, equipment prototypes, or validated concepts which can be used to inform and drive formal procurement processes and/or policy decisions.

New start projects in FY 2012 were: the NexTech project to identify potentially game-changing, disruptive technologies for DoD, and provide a model for analyzing the potential implications of emerging technologies from technical, social, political, legal and ethical perspectives; the Advanced Countermeasure Prototype effort to develop a low-cost prototype counter-rocket-propelled grenade (RPG)/surface to air missile protective capability for rotary wing aircraft; the Spectral Management project to reduce equipment and uniform signatures across the infrared spectrum by producing prototype materials to mitigate this vulnerability; the Buoyant Body Armor project to develop lightweight, more flexible, buoyant body armor while providing a similar level of protection as the armor currently used; and the HA/DR-Test Center to stand up a technology experimentation center in the Philippines in support of U.S. Pacific Command (USPACOM)/U.S. Marine Corps Forces Pacific Command (MARFORPAC) in conjunction with the Armed Forces of the Philippines.

The EMTAS/AMPS systems completed a one year deployment to Afghanistan and received a $16.7M congressional reprogramming to support a USCENTCOM Joint Urgent Operational Needs Statement (JUONS) request for an additional twenty systems. The HFDS was demonstrated in various configurations, which resulted in its consideration for transition to the US Army, US Marine Corps and US Navy.  The Forward Operating Base Defense Integrated Protection Initiative deployed a suite of capabilities to two Forward Operating Bases in Afghanistan; the Army is analyzing the results.  QuickNETS deployed multiple times in support of exercises in U.S. Pacific Command (USPACOM) and U.S. Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM) areas of operation with great success and is working towards a transition into the Unclassified Information Sharing Enterprise Service (UIS) with the Department of Defense, Chief Information Officer (DoD CIO). In addition, an FY 2011 program — Gunslinger Package for Advanced Convoy Security (GunPACS) — transitioned to the US Marine Corps, which allocated funding to maintain the GunPACS capability deployed in theater.  The Marine Corps Requirements Oversight Council will determine whether to support the procurement of additional GunPACS systems in support of an Urgent Needs Statement from USMC users.

                                                        <r2:Description>The Maritime Irregular Warfare portfolio investigates and develops irregular warfare capability gaps in the maritime domain.  Projects explore the development of counter evolved non-state capabilities such as semi- and fully- submersible vehicles and swarms, countering unmanned swarms, maritime non-lethal weapons systems, and low cost littoral fire support, among other capabilities.  This expanded effort to address maritime capability gaps builds on and leverages the Stiletto dedicated maritime demonstration vessel.  Stiletto is a maritime demonstration platform designed to assist in the rapid transition of emerging technologies across the range of military operations to higher Technology Readiness Levels.  The 88-foot long boat is an experimental, all carbon fiber craft that was purposefully designed to rapidly acquire, integrate, and employ new capabilities to explore the military utility of emerging technologies and concepts of operation for special and expeditionary forces. The Stiletto program, managed in partnership with the Naval Surface Warfare Center’s Combatant Craft Division and the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division’s Warfare Innovation Cell, streamlines the experimentation process and helps facilitate the rapid demonstration, exploration, and risk reduction of emerging technologies and capabilities. </r2:Description>

                                                                <r2:Text>The Maritime Irregular Warfare portfolio initiated several new projects in FY 2012.  The Naval Underwater Threat Interrogation and Covert Assessment Systems (NAUTICAS) is a project to non-invasively identify contraband materials such as explosives or illegal drugs being transported by maritime vessels underway.  In FY 2012, NAUTICAS was selected as the centerpiece of a joint Navy/Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization (JIEDDO) effort to detect Home Made Explosives (HME) in maritime domains.  The Inflatable Catamaran (I-Cat) Structural Loads Testing and I-Cat Hull Construction and Design Improvement received the endorsement of the Commander for Naval Special Warfare (NSW), as well as significant contributions from U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) and the Office of Naval Research.  The Inflatable Catamaran projects are intended to demonstrate and test improvements to the Combat Rubber Raiding Craft (CRRC).  Concurrently with execution of this project, NSW designated the inflatable catamaran as one of a family of future craft known as Combatant Craft Light (CCL Mk 1), a program of record with an Initial Operating Capability in FY 2016.  The Common Maritime Technology Working Group (CMTWG) was formed in FY 2012 to unify the combatant/small craft community and developed a crosswalk of science and technology (S&amp;T) needs and requirements based on input from the US Navy, US Marine Corps, US Army, US Coast Guard, and Special Warfare community.   Priorities identified through the CMTWG were used to inform future Capability Demonstrations aboard Stiletto.  Stiletto doubled the number of demonstrations it performed in FY 2012 over the previous year by working more closely with operational commands through exercises like Trident Warrior and Trident Spectre.  Twenty-five separate technologies were demonstrated during Trident Spectre 2012 which was sponsored by the Naval Special Warfare Support Activity-2.  During Trident Warrior 2012 at Fort Eustis, VA, Stiletto served as a “control ship” for multiple unmanned autonomous vessels.  During FY 2012, Stiletto also demonstrated multiple radar systems, remote stabilized weapon systems, Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) capabilities, full motion video, and unmanned system launch and recovery.  In FY 2012, Stiletto revised its business model to create three Capability Demonstrations per year.  Each capability demonstration is guided by an individual lead organization or command and is focused on that organization’s articulated capability needs.  In order to preserve Stiletto’s outreach to non-traditional businesses by providing a low-cost, accessible demonstration venue, Stiletto continued to offer open technology demonstration periods throughout the year.</r2:Text>

In FY 2013, NAUTICAS will continue development with the Navy and JIEDDO, moving from the lab environment to real world, controlled environment, and testing within the Continental United States (CONUS).  The goal is to have a successful prototype system that leads to the development of an operationally deployable prototype.  Continuing in FY 2013, the Inflatable Catamaran project will improve the existing design and construction processes for the inflatable hull component of the CCL Mk 1 inflatable catamaran with an initial operating capability in FY 2016. The improved hull form will increase durability, reliability and maintainability.  The new design will provide significantly increased speed, range, payload, and improved riding, supporting missions such as Maritime Area Denial. The CMTWG will identify the lead organizations for Stiletto Capability Demonstrations and continue to analyze common small craft technology needs in FY 2013.  Potential new Maritime Irregular Warfare projects for FY 2013 include demonstration of the Spike Non-Line of Site (NLOS) system in cooperation with US Navy Director of Expeditionary Warfare and US Naval Air Systems Command; development of the Spar buoy deployable ocean sensor system with the US Navy Director of Expeditionary Warfare and other partners; and an effort to focus on emerging advanced undersea weapons and sensors.  The Maritime Irregular Warfare focus area will continue to support Stiletto’s maritime technology demonstrations.  Emerging capabilities will be demonstrated on Stiletto during three Capability Demonstrations in FY 2013, including participation in Trident Warrior and Trident Spectre, as well as three Technology Demonstration periods throughout the year.  Priority will be given to demonstrations that directly assist an acquisition program, with specific focus on technology transition.</r2:Text>

                                                        <r2:Description>In conjunction with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) - Ames Research Center, the United States Air Force (USAF) Research Laboratory, and U.S. Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM), the Department of Defense has developed a hybrid airship demonstration vehicle known as Pelican, which is a non-deployable technology demonstrator that integrates four independent technologies into a single, rigid aeroshell variable buoyancy (RAVB) air vehicle.  The project will demonstrate the technical maturity of a scalable vertical takeoff and landing airship.  Key technologies include a buoyancy management system to enable ballast-independent operations, composite lightweight rigid internal structure to reduce environmental restrictions, a responsive low-speed/hover control system with associated control algorithms, and a ground handling subsystem to enable operations on unimproved landing surfaces.  The program objectives are to mitigate long-term technical risks by integrating and demonstrating a suite of technologies with the potential to reduce operational constraints on future heavy-lift hybrid, buoyant-aircraft development programs.  

In FY 2011, the project was reduced to a four-year program by accelerating the funding needed to complete vehicle design, analysis, subsystem prototyping/testing, systems integration, construction and ground testing.  The project is scheduled to end in early Fiscal Year 2013, with a hangar demonstration of the four main project objectives.

                                                        <r2:Description>This portfolio examines and explores emerging technologies to complement the US Air Force (USAF), the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), DoD’s ISR Task Force and other interagency initiatives in Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR).   In addition, the portfolio addresses the National Space Strategy objectives to preserve and protect the space environment with a focus on developing applications for employment by the tactical user.  The flagship project for this portfolio is Thunderstorm, an enduring multi-Intelligence technology demonstration for the Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD), interagency partners, Combatant Commands (COCOMs), Services, academia, government laboratories and commercial vendors.  Thunderstorm demonstrations provide an opportunity to evaluate and assess the capabilities of new, emerging and transformational ISR technologies, and related information collection, processing, exploitation, and dissemination (PED) capabilities in mission-related, geographically, and operationally relevant environments prior to full-scale employment.  Thunderstorm demonstration objectives, performance measures, lessons learned, post-demonstration assessments and data evaluation serve to inform future DoD ISR concepts of operations and remote PED capabilities.</r2:Description>

                                                                <r2:Text>Funding supported the planning and execution of the Thunderstorm Spiral 5.0 technology demonstration.  Execution of this summer 2012 spiral in Customs and Border Protection’s Rio Grande Valley (RGV) Sector leveraged partnerships with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Customs and Border Protection (CBP), U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM), Joint Task Force-North (JTF-N), U.S. Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM) and the Joint Inter-Agency Task Force–South (JIATF-S).  The RGV Sector offered multi-intelligence demonstration opportunities against land, air, sea and littoral scenarios and the possibility to examine cross-domain tip/cue architectures.  These scenarios served to challenge ISR assets in multiple domains and highlighted the strengths and weaknesses in each.  The scenarios also demonstrated how technology, when used in conjunction with existing threat procedures, can mitigate an adversary’s ability to achieve tactical surprise and advantage. 

A classified project was started in partnership with the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) to develop the capability to transfer large data files from theater to the U.S. using a commercial-off-the-shelf Satellite Communications (SATCOM) High Data Rate Modem.  The project is reducing the time (from weeks to hours) to transfer large data files from theater to Contiguous United States (CONUS)-based analysts.

Both spirals will build on Spiral 5.0 lessons learned in the RGV Sector.  Spiral 13-1’s primary focus will be to further characterize and counter asymmetrical maritime threats and inform tactics, techniques, and procedures to detect and discriminate suspicious open water, littoral and maritime-to-land transition activity.  Execution of the spring 2013 spiral will leverage partnerships with CBP, JIATF-S, JTF-N, the USCG, NGA, NRO, USSOUTHCOM and USNORTHCOM. Spiral 13-2 will be executed in summer 2013.  This spiral builds upon Spiral 13-1 and places emphasis on the maritime-to-land transition activity and the ability for suspicious actors to quickly dissolve themselves into an urban or rural population.  This spiral incorporates National Technical Capabilities into the strategic framework.  Also in FY 2013, Thunderstorm Spiral 14-1 planning will begin.  This spiral will take place in the CBP Detroit Sector and will once again leverage DHS, USCG, CBP, NGA, USNORTHCOM and JTF-N support.  The winter 2014 spiral will focus on the transition of actors into a large urban/suburban populace.  

In the space arena, projects will be pursued that focus on increasing satellite utility, developing transformational satellite capabilities for the tactical user and efforts to improve space situational awareness.  With the high value and long lead time to replace space assets, the goal is to preserve and protect these capabilities.

The classified project initiated in partnership with the NRO to develop the capability to transfer large data files from theater to the U.S. via a commercial-off-the-shelf SATCOM High Data Rate Modem will conclude and transition to the NRO as the primary customer.  The project reduces the time (from weeks to hours) to transfer large data files from theater to CONUS-based analysts.

The May 2012 update by the Center for Naval Analyses (CNA) focused on assessing existing and needed technical capabilities to respond in a systemic, rapid, sustained, and measurable way to adversarial narratives being used to undermine US military and security efforts.  It also identified technologies to rapidly analyze and respond to those narratives in the information environment.  The final report identified gaps in seven areas to guide future project development: analytical tools, production, content delivery, research, planning, training, and evaluation tools.  The new analysis was distributed to stakeholders through DoD, COCOMs, DoS, academia, and private industry.  Four new projects were started in FY 2012 to support Information Operations and CVE needs in partnership with SO/LIC, the COCOMs, and the DoS’s Center for Strategic Counterterrorism Communications (CSCC).  NORTHCOM Influence Assessment Capability (NIAC) Education and Training (NET) Research Project One (NETp-1) applied a social science research based approach to develop assessors’ capabilities to tailor socio-political data collection, evaluation, and analysis to a given Theater Campaign Plan objective or effect under study.  CVE Messaging is an effort for the CSCC’s Digital Outreach Team, coordinated in support of SO/LIC and US Central Command (USCENTCOM) interests, to develop the capability to track and assess the spread and impact of al-Qa’ida (AQ) propaganda in mainstream online environments.  Further, it assessed the concurrent spread and impact of counter-messaging campaigns.  This project built on Sandia National Laboratory’s existing capabilities to track and assess the spread and impact of AQ propaganda in mainstream online environments, attributed counter-messaging by the CSCC Digital Outreach Team and assisted in guiding Geographic Combatant Command (GCC) influence and influence assessment efforts.  In FY 2012, some of the technical capabilities from the CVE Messaging project were transitioned to US Pacific Command, which will continue to fund the tools as part of its Information Operations efforts.  In addition, the Information Operations Assessment Foundation project was started with the Joint Information Operations Warfare Center to identify and adapt best practices in influence assessment for the DoD’s IO Assessment Framework.  A new project was also initiated with USCENTCOM and SO/LIC to develop mobile applications in support of CVE activities.</r2:Text>

NORTHCOM’s NETp-1 project will advance to its next spiral, incorporating Commander Joint Task Force (CTJF) – Horn of Africa (HOA), U.S. Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM), and the Joint Information Operations Warfare Center as transition partners.  DoS’s CVE Messaging Impact project will continue, with participation from USCENTCOM and contributions from the Countering Terrorism Technical Support Office (CTTSO).  The Information Operations Assessment Foundation will continue in support of SO/LIC and the Joint Staff to identify and adapt best practices from DoD as well as commercial marketing experience in influence assessment and will be used to form the DoD framework for Information Operations Assessment. Development of mobile applications in support of USCENTCOM will continue.

                                                        <r2:Description>The Department will drive innovation in aviation, space, maritime and ground combat systems in a fiscally constrained environment through advanced prototyping.  This portfolio will focus on cost-effective, limited duration projects to design, develop and deliver full-scale operational prototypes of cutting-edge land, sea, air and space systems.  These prototypes will be delivered to joint and Service users to evaluate operational capability under realistic conditions and often against current capabilities or anticipated threats.  Potential venues for prototype assessment include assets such as the Stiletto Maritime Demonstration Program and Thunderstorm ISR integration exercises.  Knowledge and experience gained through those demonstrations will help develop new warfighting concepts and inform requirements and technical feasibility of future acquisition programs.  These initial prototype efforts will help reduce the cost of future acquisition programs and stimulate efforts beyond traditional defense industrial base activities.  Development of advanced prototypes will involve partnerships with industry and academia and permit operational users to gain insight into future technology-enabled strategies and tactics.  Advanced developmental prototyping provides a mechanism to guard against technological surprise, preserve industrial base capabilities, impose asymmetric strategic costs on potential adversaries, and explore innovative, technology-enabled military capabilities.</r2:Description>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Disruptive Technology Demonstrations project is a technology initiative to address time-sensitive capability needs and anticipatory concerns while maintaining low cost, small footprint operations. These resources are a result of capability shortfalls identified in the Defense Strategic Guide (Sustaining Global Leadership: Priorities for 21st Century Defense). The program objectives are to identify, rapidly integrate, and demonstrate disruptive, anticipatory products suited to quick deployment that fall outside of individual Service developments.  Disruptive technology demonstrations will leverage low cost, commercial, and often low technology options that don’t conform to the typical DoD acquisition business model but have the potential to disrupt and change warfighting capabilities by avoiding or creating technological surprise. Disruptive technology demonstrations can be either stand-alone technology or concept demonstrations, or utilize one of the existing Architecture and Integration venues for rapid technology architecture and assessment such as the Joint Experimentation Range Complexes (JERCs).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Congress established the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) in 1990 (10 U.S.C. Section 2901-2904) to address Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of Energy (DOE) environmental concerns.  It is conducted as a DoD program, jointly planned and executed by the DoD, DOE, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), with strong participation by other Federal agencies, industry, and academia.  SERDP`s objective is to improve DoD mission readiness and environmental performance by providing new scientific knowledge and cost-effective technologies in the areas of Environmental Restoration, Munitions Response, Resource Conservation and Climate Change, and Weapons Systems and Platforms.  SERDP does this by addressing high priority DoD environmental technology requirements.  SERDP enhances military operations, improves military systems` effectiveness, enhances military training/readiness, sustains DoD’s training and test ranges and installation infrastructure, and helps ensure the safety and welfare of military personnel and their dependents by eliminating or reducing the generation of pollution and use of hazardous materials and reducing the cost of remedial actions and compliance with environmental laws and regulations.  As a secondary benefit, SERDP helps solve significant national and international environmental problems.  The keys to a growing list of SERDP technological successes are the ability to respond aggressively and proactively to priority defense environmental needs; the pursuit of world-class technical excellence; and an emphasis on constant technology transfer.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Congress established the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) in 1990 (10 U.S.C. Section 2901-2904) to address Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of Energy (DOE) environmental concerns.  It is conducted as a DoD program, jointly planned and executed by the DoD, DOE, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), with strong participation by other Federal agencies, industry, and academia.  SERDP`s objective is to improve DoD mission readiness and environmental performance by providing new scientific knowledge and cost-effective technologies in the areas of Environmental Restoration, Munitions Response, Resource Conservation and Climate Change, and Weapons Systems and Platforms.  SERDP does this by addressing high-priority DoD environmental technology requirements.  Technologies developed by SERDP enhance military operations, improve military systems’ effectiveness, enhance military training/readiness, sustain DoD’s training and test ranges and installation infrastructure, and help ensure the safety and welfare of military personnel and their dependents by eliminating or reducing the generation of pollution and use of hazardous materials and by reducing the cost of remedial actions and compliance with environmental laws and regulations.  As a secondary benefit, SERDP helps solve significant national and international environmental problems.  The keys to a growing list of SERDP technological successes are the ability to respond aggressively and proactively to priority defense environmental needs; the pursuit of world-class technical excellence; and an emphasis on constant technology transfer.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The level of resourcing for the Joint Warfighting Program (JWP) program reflects iterative reductions from efficiencies and budget reductions, which reduces the Department's ability to develop flexible responsive solutions to emerging war fighter needs. The OSD JWP account underwrites two related activities supporting development of the Department's joint warfighting capabilities.  In anticipation of constrained military budgets, there will be increased demand for JWP support as Combatant Commanders will be under pressure to refine their requests for supplementary capabilities to define their capability requirements, and identify potential solution options.  

The Joint Advanced Warfighting Program (JAWP) segment provides innovative and responsive analytic support on joint capability development serving the needs of joint capability clients.  It provides an independent source to examine potential remedies for mission capability gaps and can establish a framework for accelerated acquisition, subsequent field experiments, and capability demonstrations.  JAWP often represents the first effort to define alternative solutions across the range of Doctrine, Organization, Training, Material, Leadership and Personnel-Facilities.  JAWP resources sustain a small dedicated staff of civilian operation research analysts (currently hosted by the Institute for Defense Analysis – IDA).  Administered by the Joint Operations Support cell within OSD/AT&amp;L, the JAWP conducts an annual call for inputs from Combatant Command staffs elements that formulate Capability Gap assessments and technology based initiatives.  Project selection is undertaken in consultation with the OSD staffs serving AT&amp;L and Policy and with elements of the Joint Staff. 

The balance of JWP resources are dedicated to analytic support for joint capabilities and joint customers.  JWP provides a safety net for analytic support responding to emergent joint capability requirements and capability gaps.  Typical projects funded with JWP include translation of capability gap assessments into actionable military needs statements, identification of candidate solutions via experimentation, translation of solution concepts into field demonstrations, and remedy of joint capability gaps in partnership with Defense agents for doctrine changes and technology development.  JWP resources dedicated to direct support joint commands provides analytic expertise not normally allocated via formal staffing billets.  In this activity, JWP underwrites small grants to invigorate employment of experimentation and analysis, to formulate strategies to resolve joint capability gaps, and to stimulate participation in the Department enterprises for joint experimentation and joint capability development.  JWP resources also research and development of tools supporting joint commander analytic efforts.

                                    <r2:ProgramElementNote>The President's Budget Request for FY 2012 realigned the High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP) from the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), program element (PE) 0603755D8Z to the Department of the Army, PE 0603461A.  Due to Continuing Resolution Authority restrictions in early FY 2012, $23.000 million was executed from OSD PE 0603755D8Z.  The balance of the FY 2012 appropriated budget was executed from 0603461A.  FY 2013 and out-year funding for the HPCMP was and will continue to be requested under 0603461A.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Today, the Department of Defense (DoD) faces many challenges.  The High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP) provides cost effective tools the Department needs to address the most difficult defense problems. These tools include modern high performance computing hardware, parallel software, wide area networking services and the expertise to use them.  The HPCMP helps enables DoD personnel to:

-  Conduct basic research into areas such as materials, fuels, turbulence, proteins, electromagnetic fields, signal image relationships, structural response, blast effects, and combustion;  
-  Conduct applied research into areas such as aerodynamics applied to fighter and transport manned and unmanned aircraft, automated target recognition; hydrodynamics applied to new hull forms,  structural performance of new armor and penetrator concepts, and explosives performance;
-  Design elements of weapon systems such as the Hellfire missile, F-35, MRAP, C-17, the Javelin missile, and directed energy weapons systems;
-  Test and evaluate weapons system performance on systems such as F-16, F-22, F-35, C-17, FCS, AIM-9X, GBU-39 and Striker;
-  Immediately support urgent operations for efforts such as counter IED, hurricane Katrina related flood modeling, and the 2010 gulf oil spill migration modeling.

High Performance Computing has been identified as a key enabling technology essential to achieving the DoD's research development, test and evaluation (RDT&amp;E) objectives.  Validated requirements collected across the DoD reflect the needs of 4,400 scientists and engineers located at hundreds of locations (DoD Laboratories, Test Centers, academic institutions and commercial businesses).  The integrated HPCMP consists of DoD Supercomputing Resource Centers (DSRCs), the Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN), and Software Application Support.  DSRCs are responsible for as large a part of DoD`s RDT&amp;E computational workload as feasible.  DSRCs provide extensive capabilities to address user requirements for hardware, software, and programming environments.  Dedicated HPC project investments (DHPIs) augment the DSRCs to form the total HPCMP computational capability.  DHPIs address critical HPC requirements that cannot be met at DSRCs, such as real-time, and near real-time computing requirements, and leverage significant HPC and mission expertise located at these remote sites.  All elements of the HPCMP are interconnected with all S&amp;T and T&amp;E user sites via the Defense Research and Engineering Network.  DREN provides the flexible wide area network fabric needed by the RDT&amp;E community to support technology demonstrations and distributed test and evaluation events in addition to providing access to the supercomputing centers.  The Software Application Support component develops critical common DoD applications programs that run efficiently on advanced HPC systems, supports technology transition activities with academic and commercial institutions, trains users, and builds collaborative programming environments.  The Computational Research and Engineering Acquisition Tools and Environments (CREATE) produces supercomputer-based engineering design and test tools, improving the acquisition process for major weapons systems.

The High Performance Computing Modernization Program transferred from the Office Secretary of Defense to the Department of the Army in FY 2012.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Department of Defense (DoD) High Performance Computing (HPC) Modernization Program supports the needs of the warfighter for technological superiority and military dominance on the battlefield by providing advanced computational services to U.S. weapons system scientists and engineers.  By exploiting continuous advances in HPC technology, the defense research, development, test and evaluation (RDT&amp;E) community is able to resolve critical scientific and engineering problems more quickly and with more precision.  The results of these efforts feed directly into the acquisition process by improving weapons system designs through an increased fundamental understanding of materials, aerodynamics, chemistry, fuels, acoustics, signal image recognition, electromagnetics, and other areas of basic and applied research.  As such, HPC has been identified as a key enabling technology essential to achieving the objectives of the DoD's RDT&amp;E.

The program primarily provides supercomputing services through DoD Supercomputing Resource Centers (DSRCs).  Additionally, support for specialized programs is provided through dedicated HPC project investments (DHPIs). DHPIs support a one-time need and have no support tail within the HPC Modernization Program.  Centers and DHPIs directly support the DoD RDT&amp;E laboratories and test centers and are accessible to local and remote scientists and engineers via high-speed network access.  An integral part of the program is providing for the adaptation of broadband, widely used applications and algorithms to address RDT&amp;E requirements, along with continued training of users as new system designs and concepts evolve. The program pursues continuous interaction with the national HPC infrastructure, including academia, industry, and other government agencies to facilitate the sharing of knowledge, tools, and expertise.

Annually validated requirements, collected across the DoD reflect the needs of 4,400 scientists and engineers located at hundreds of locations (DoD Laboratories, Test Centers, academic institutions and commercial businesses), and to drive program decisions.  The integrated HPC program consists of DoD Supercomputing Resource Centers; the Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN); and Software Application Support. DSRCs are responsible for as large a fraction of DoD`s S&amp;T and T&amp;E computational workload as feasible.  DSRCs provide extensive capabilities to address user requirements for hardware, software, and programming environments. DHPIs augment the DSRCs to form the total HPC Modernization Program computational capability.  DHPIs address critical HPC requirements that cannot be met at DSRCs, such as real-time, and near real-time computing requirements, and leverage significant HPC and mission expertise located at these remote sites.  All elements of the HPC Modernization Program are interconnected with all S&amp;T and T&amp;E user sites via the DREN.  Additionally, the Software Application Support component develops critical common DoD applications programs that run efficiently on advanced HPC systems, supports technology transition activities with academic and commercial institutions, trains users, and builds collaborative programming environments.

True modernization of DoD`s HPC capability and fulfillment of the program's vision and goals requires an on-going program strategy that addresses all aspects of HPC.  While advancing the level of hardware performance is critical to success, the higher objective is to enable better scientific research, T&amp;E environments, and technology development for superior weapons, warfighting, and related support systems.  The Program goals are to (1) acquire, deploy, operate and maintain best-value supercomputers; (2) acquire, develop, deploy and support software applications and computational work environments that enable critical DoD research, development and test challenges to be analyzed and solved; (3) acquire, deploy, operate and maintain a communications network that enables effective access to supercomputers and to distributed S&amp;T/T&amp;E computing environments; (4) continuously educate the RDT&amp;E workforce with the knowledge needed to employ computational modeling effectively and efficiently; and (5) promote collaborative relationships among the DoD computational science community, the national computational science community and minority serving institutes.

The DREN provides wide area network (WAN) connectivity among the Department's S&amp;T and T&amp;E communities.  The DREN is implemented through an Intersite Services Contract awarded to MCI (WORLDCOM) during FY 2002.  A new DREN network services contract was awarded in FY 2011.  DREN currently provides services to sites throughout the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, and can be extended overseas where necessary.  A Secret DREN using common Secret systems high key with NSA certified Type-1 encryptors that can transport classified traffic at OC-3 (155 Mbps) has also been deployed.  The HPC Modernization Program employs state-of-the-art WAN security and strong host and user security creating a defense-in-depth security architecture.

The High Performance Computing Modernization Program transferred from the Office Secretary of Defense to the Department of the Army in FY 2012.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Funding for Advanced Technology Development in PE 0603781D8Z will decrease beginning in FY 2014 to reflect a pivot toward more fundamental research that will enable the DoD to address longer-term challenges in software technology and engineering.  When combined together, the two PEs represent a level of investment consistent with previous plans.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Software is key to meeting the DoD’s increasing demand for high-quality, affordable, and timely national defense systems.  Systemic software issues are significant contributors to poor program execution, and reliance on software-intensive mobile and net based products and systems has been increasing (e.g., Joint Tactical Radio System, DDG-1000, Joint Strike Fighter, F-22, and Army Modernization).  As stated in the 2010 National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences report entitled Critical Code, “It is dangerous to conclude that we are reaching a plateau in capability and technology for software producibility.”  The report notes that software is “…unconstrained by traditional physical engineering limitations…” and what we can accomplish is derived “…from [the] human intellectual capacity to conceptualize and understand systems….”  With growing global parity in software engineering, the DoD must maintain leadership to avoid strategic surprise.  The Software Engineering Institute (SEI) Program Element (PE) addresses the critical need to research, develop, and rapidly transition state-of-the-art software technology, tools, development environments, and best practices to improve the engineering, management, fielding, evolution, acquisition, and sustainment of software-intensive DoD systems.  The SEI PE’s program of work seeks to coordinate across the Department and the Services and leverages expertise in industry and academia to enable the development of joint capabilities.

Software is more pervasive than ever and computer programs are growing in size and complexity.  Designing, managing, and securing integrated, complex, and large-scale mission-critical systems are abilities that the DoD and Defense Industrial Base (DIB) have not yet mastered.  The P781 project within this PE funds research and development at the SEI Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC).  The SEI FFRDC is an institute which enables the exploitation of emerging software technology by bringing engineering, management, and security discipline to software acquisition, development, and evolution.  The SEI FFRDC focuses on software technology areas judged to be of the highest payoff in meeting defense needs.  To ensure that the DoD retains a differential advantage over potential adversaries, research funding at the SEI FFRDC will include a new Budget Activity 2 funding line beginning in FY 2014.  The reduction in P781 in this line beginning in FY 2014 is offset by the creation of the new line, the SEI Applied Research PE.  The creation of this new line represents a pivot toward more fundamental research that will enable the DoD to address longer-term challenges in software technology and engineering.  The SEI Applied Research PE will also increase the collaboration opportunities for the SEI FFRDC with academia and attract top research talent to the SEI.  

Private sector investment has created rapid advances in information technologies, but the pace of transition to DoD applications is often very slow or the commercial applications do not meet DoD unique needs, e.g., high assurance software or large-scale integrated systems.  The DoD needs to create opportunities to discover emerging technologies, to evaluate their potential to fit DoD needs, and where appropriate, conduct critical tests of the technologies under DoD conditions.  The P783 project within this PE funds the Software Producibility Initiative.  The Software Producibility Initiative works across the Services, industry, and academia to research and transition software science and tools that address the capacity to design, produce, assure, and evolve software-intensive systems in a predictable manner while effectively managing risk, cost, schedule, quality, and complexity.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The SEI maintains unique software research and program support capabilities in a space where the Defense Industrial Base (DIB) and academia cannot as readily address challenges.  The mission of the SEI is to provide DoD with technical leadership and innovation through research and development to advance the practice of software engineering and technology.  The Institute works across Government, industry, and academia to improve the state of software engineering from the technical, acquisition, and management perspectives.  The SEI engages in research and development of critical software technologies and tools, and collaborates with the larger software engineering research community. It facilitates rapid transition of software engineering technologies into practice, and evaluates emerging software engineering technologies to determine their potential for improving software-intensive DoD systems.  Since its inception, the SEI has helped to transform the fields of software engineering and acquisition, network security, real-time systems, software architectures, and software-engineering process management.

To enhance the SEI’s role as a Research and Development FFRDC, the Department has created a new PE: SEI Applied Research, 0602751D8Z, beginning in FY 2014.  The reduction in P781 in this PE beginning in FY 2014 is offset by the creation of the SEI Applied Research PE.

These shortcomings can frequently be traced to software development technologies which are not capable of addressing the scale and complexity of the software needed in today’s systems.  The Software Producibility Initiative seeks to conduct an integrated program of research from applied research through demonstration and evaluation to advance the state-of-the-art in the producibility of software for DoD systems, particularly those systems characterized by high complexity, need for robustness, information assurance, real-time performance, and physical distribution.  The Initiative maintains a portfolio of work relevant to the Warfighter and DoD needs by periodically evaluating technology development efforts, retiring those that are under performing, and starting new efforts based on risk-reward priority.  The Initiative demonstrates new underlying software technology and tools in various domains, e.g., Networks, Modeling and Simulation, Avionics, Signal Intelligence, where DoD can benefit and enhance the transition paths for the underlying technology.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Quick Reactions Special Projects (QRSP) Program supports five separate projects that provide rapid funding to expedite development and transition of new technologies to the warfighter.  These projects are:  1) Quick Reaction Fund (QRF); 2) Rapid Reaction Fund (RRF); 3) Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) Architecture and Integration (RAI) program; 4) Joint Rapid Acquisition Cell (JRAC) support; and 5) Strategic Multi-Layered Assessment (SMA) support.  QRSP provides the flexibility to respond to emergent Department of Defense (DoD) issues and address technology surprises and needs within the years of execution outside the two year budget cycle. 

The QRF Program objectives are to respond to emergent conventional warfare needs during the execution years that take advantage of breakthroughs in rapidly evolving technologies.  The QRF is executed by the Rapid Reaction Technology Office.  Examples of the types of projects that are envisioned include:  force protection projects to enhance anti-access and area denial capabilities, undersea offensive capabilities and broad electronic warfare capabilities.  The QRF focuses on maturing technologies critically needed for the Combatant Commands.  QRF projects are typically 12 months in duration and produce prototypes with new capabilities for demonstration and evaluation.
 
The RRF objectives are to leverage the DoD science and technology (S&amp;T) base and those of the other federal departments, and to provide feedback to the S&amp;T community to guide long term developmental strategies.  The RRF is executed by the Rapid Reaction Technology Office (RRTO).  RRTO works to anticipate adversaries’ exploitation of new technologies and advanced capabilities and develop counters to those capabilities.  Additionally, RTTO works to leverage technology developed outside of the DoD in the commercial sector, academia, international arenas, and small, non-traditional businesses to expose them to specific DoD needs areas as identified by Combatant Commanders, Military Service organizations, other Defense agencies and interagency organizations.  The typical length of an RTTO program falls within a 6 to 12 month range in order to more effectively aid the warfighter.  The RRF consistently exceeds the transition objective of 30 percent for demonstration programs (DoD Strategic Objective 4-3). 

The RDT&amp;E Architecture and Integration (RAI) program objectives are to enhance and expand rapid technology architecture and assessment capabilities in general; and, to enhance the Joint Experimentation Range Complex (JERC), Stiletto maritime test platform and the Thunderstorm ISR exercise series.  The JERC provides a venue to evaluate a wide range of new technologies in a dessert environment.  The requested funding will also support Stiletto, a maritime test vessel that routinely hosts numerous new technologies for evaluation in a maritime environment.  Thunderstorm, an ongoing Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) exercise series, is also supported by this budget line.  Thunderstorm brings emerging ISR technologies together in a common architecture for exercise and operational demonstration.   

The JRAC Program objectives focus on responding to Joint Urgent Operational Needs (JUONS) that have been submitted by Combatant Commanders and validated by the Joint Staff.  In addition, the JRAC’s objectives are to manage the delivery of capabilities as requested by the Combatant Command (COCOM) in a time frame acceptable to the COCOM.  Efforts, in most instances, are conducted outside of the processes described in the Defense Acquisition System in DoD Directive 5000.1 and utilize contingency and other rapid acquisition authorities.

The SMA cell program objective is to support all Combatant Commands (COCOMs), Joint Force Commanders, and other government agencies by assessing complex operational/technical challenges which require multi-agency and multi-disciplinary approaches.  With input from across the United States Government, academia, and the private sector, the SMA cell develops solution options to COCOM generated challenging problems and informs the command’s senior leadership.  Each SMA cell effort is initiated at the request of COCOM senior leadership. Priorities for SMA Cell programs are set by the Joint Staff Deputy for Operations.  Products are typically produced within six months and directly contribute to the decision-making process of the COCOM’s senior leaders.

The QSRP Program provides the flexibility to respond to emergent DoD issues and addresses technology surprises and needs that may arise outside the two year budget cycle.

The Quick Reaction Fund (QRF) Program provides the Services, Components, Combatant Commands (COCOMs), and force providers opportunities to capitalize on technologies that are at a relatively high Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and to rapidly field-test promising new operational prototypes that can have immediate impact on military operations.  QRF initiatives are limited to those that will deliver a military operational prototype application within twelve months of being funded. 

The QRF Program also focuses on projects that have the potential to address conventional, disruptive, catastrophic, and irregular threats.  More specifically, initiatives that address the following interest areas: Anti-Access and Area Denial; Base Protection; Electromagnetic Bandwidth and Spectrum Enhancement; Persistent Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR); Newly Emerging National Threats; Directed Energy Capabilities; Low-Cost Precision Engagement Capabilities; Operational Field Demonstrations; Unmanned and Robotics Systems; Over the Horizon-Radar Technologies; and Counter-Electronic Warfare Technologies. 

In FY 2013 and FY 2014, the QRF Program will continue to identify and fund new projects that respond to critical operational needs and new technology opportunities.  Current and future efforts that show significant effectiveness can be leveraged by additional investments in order to accelerate transition to operational forces.

                                                        <r2:Description>Project Matsu was an open source software project that uses data mining frameworks and related applications for processing very large amounts of hyper-spectral data, and other large Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) data sets.  Matsu utilized unique analytics to discover changes and other significant features in cubes of hyper-spectral data.  Quick detection of changes in hyper-spectral data improves situational awareness, which can protect the warfighter.  A typical architecture for processing hyper-spectral data today uses a file system to store the data, a relational database to store the metadata, and custom code to process the data.  The Matsu system is based upon open source software architecture that can efficiently process very large amounts of data.</r2:Description>

The effort investigated currently inventoried weapon systems to identify those most acceptable for modification into a Home on GPS Jammer capable system.  Key factors used to determine weapon feasibility included integration complexity/cost, weapon cost, weapon employment concept, weapon delivery platforms and capability delivered to the warfighter.  Follow-on work identified the mechanical and electrical interface integration requirements for the selected platform(s).  </r2:Description>

                                                        <r2:Description>The Department of Defense (DoD) has developed a Trusted Systems strategy which integrates Protection Planning for the development of capabilities, the use of proven mitigation techniques and tools, the ongoing refinement of risk management processes, and creation of needed technology. Current program protection and supply chain risk management efforts primarily target individual Major Defense Acquisition Programs of Record (POR). However, this approach currently lacks a strategic or operational mission focus to identify and assure critical DoD missions, which are comprised of acquisition programs, as well as legacy systems and infrastructure.

Globalization of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) markets creates unprecedented opportunities for sophisticated adversaries to defeat not only individual systems, but DoD capabilities through supply chain exploits or other malicious tampering. Defense Planning Guidance, Defense Science Board Reports, and recent deliberations on Nuclear Command, Control and Communications have all acknowledged the problem, and identified the requirement to protect critical missions from cyber and supply chain vulnerabilities.

This Quick Reaction Fund effort provides funding for the Department to pilot initial activities to develop methodologies to assess critical mission vulnerability to cyber or supply chain exploit, and assess the utility of available tools, processes and models in conducting such a cross cutting vulnerability assessment. This project will seek to demonstrate the application or expansion of current program protection and supply chain methodologies to a mission-level assessment, focusing on selected exemplar missions. This project will result in an identified mission vulnerability assessment method and available tools, as well as critical gaps in tools in order to inform future development and application of this type of assessment as a standard practice.</r2:Description>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Quick Reaction Special Projects (QSRP) Program supports five separate projects that provide rapid funding to expedite development and transition of new technologies to the warfighter.  The QSRP Program provides the flexibility to respond to emergent DoD issues and addresses technology surprises and needs that may arise outside the two-year budget cycle. 

The Rapid Reaction Fund (RRF) is fully executed through the Rapid Reaction Technology Office (RRTO).  The RRTO was established to provide rapid response to enhance operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and other theaters; and, to accelerate the transition of high-potential science and technology (S&amp;T) projects into operationally useful products in the execution years.  The RRTO leverages the Department of Defense (DoD) S&amp;T base and those of the other Federal Departments; stimulates interagency coordination and cooperation; accelerates the fielding of capabilities and concepts to counter emerging threats; and, provides feedback to the S&amp;T community to guide long term developmental strategies.  With projects supporting each Combatant Command and with a global perspective, the RRTO anticipates adversaries' exploitation of technology, including available and advanced commercial capabilities. 

In prior years, RRTO has explored methods and approaches of persistent surveillance stimulation for counter-insurgency; developed alternate power sources for sensors and systems; expanded human, social and cultural knowledge; increased small unit situational awareness; advanced the interface between law enforcement and military operations; developed biometrics and forensics capabilities; supported denied area operations; strategic multi-layer assessments; and, established an innovation outreach cell that is facilitating better interactions with small companies with emerging technologies that do not normally do business with the DoD.  

In FY 2013 and FY 2014, RRTO will continue to explore new and emerging capabilities to support irregular warfare operations while working to support the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition Technology &amp; Logistics) (USD (AT&amp;L)), the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering) (ASD(R&amp;E)) and the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense, Rapid Fielding (DASD RF) goals.  With project selection occurring during the execution year, the RRTO's potential focus areas for FY 2013 and FY 2014 Rapid Reaction Technology Office projects include:  Forward Operating Base (FOB) protection; persistent Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) architecture; ISR sensors; interface of law enforcement and military operations; biometrics and forensics S&amp;T; autonomous operations; data processing, exploitation and dissemination (PED); cyber security; exploitation of new and emerging cell phone technologies; support to border patrol initiatives; counter proliferation initiatives; capabilities to exploit denied areas; strategic communications and multi-layer assessments; and, non-traditional approaches to leverage innovative businesses.  

The typical length of a RRTO project falls within a 6 to 12 month range in order to more effectively respond to the Warfighter.

This effort was an assessment of regional stability in SA, and included identifying both direct drivers of interstate conflict, as well as, sources of internal instability that allow safe haven for violent extremist organizations and exacerbate interstate tensions.

The effort also provided a Sub-regional Risk Assessment comprised of U. S. Army Training and Doctrine Command and Private Industry, modeling efforts of crisis scenarios as well producing a background report of the confluence of Violent Extremist Organizations (VEO) and criminal networks all of which fed into the Department of Energy National labs’ vulnerability and risk assessments.  Finally the effort converged on developing approaches to countering instability.  The reports have helped inform the U.S. Central Command, U.S. Pacific Command, and U.S. Strategic Command decision making processes.  </r2:Text>

This follow on effort will examine the assessment of regional stability in SA and will identify both direct drivers of interstate conflict as well as sources of internal instability. Internal instability which allows for VEO safe havens that may spill-over into, and exacerbate interstate tensions.  The stability and instability factors in the assessment include:  (1) Ethnic divisions, recent anti-regime opposition movements, and other sources of internal social, economic and governing instability that may lead to state failures of various kinds; (2) The domestic and external factors driving regional actors – both state and non-state, (3) The contagion dynamics – including social media and shared narratives -- that transfer instability within and across state borders. This effort will assist Combatant Command (COCOM) planners in assessing strategic long-term and short-term regional stability.  It will also assist the planners in assessing sub-regional stability through various short-term excursions, a threat scenario, and a conflagration scenario.  This effort will also examine long-term decline and will propose a multi-generational Security Strategy Concept designed to avoid conflagration.  The payoff to the warfighter will be a detailed, classified multi-method assessment of regional conditions combined with unclassified (e.g., academic, Subject Matter Expert, etc.) input not generally found in U.S. Government work.</r2:Text>

The JERC provides a venue to evaluate a wide range of new technologies in a dessert environment.  The requested funding will also support Stiletto, a maritime test vessel that routinely hosts numerous new technologies for evaluation in a maritime environment.  Thunderstorm, an ongoing Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) exercise series, is also supported by this budget line.  Thunderstorm brings emerging ISR technologies together in a common architecture for exercise and operational demonstration.   

With the drawdown of operations in Afghanistan in FY2014, the requirements for many of the assessments supported by this budget line have been greatly reduced.  The remaining assessment requirements will be addressed by other Program Elements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                        <r2:Description>Stiletto is a maritime demonstration platform designed to assist in the rapid transition of emerging technologies across the range of military operations to higher Technology Readiness Levels.  The 88-foot long boat is an experimental, all carbon fiber craft that was purposefully designed to rapidly acquire, integrate, and employ new capabilities to explore the military utility of emerging technologies and concepts of operation for special and expeditionary forces.  The Stiletto program, managed in partnership with the Naval Surface Warfare Center’s Combatant Craft Division and the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division’s Warfare Innovation Cell, streamlines the experimentation process and helps facilitate the rapid demonstration, exploration, and risk reduction of emerging technologies and capabilities.  Stiletto’s simple application process for experimentation is intended to provide low cost access for industry, government, and academic organizations to install and prove their systems in a realistic maritime environment.  The demonstration process also encourages system developers to engage directly with the warfighter in the maritime environment to rapidly adapt technologies around warfighter needs.  The Stiletto vessel is home-ported in Norfolk, Virginia.

Both spirals will build on Spiral 5.0 lessons learned in the Rio Grand Valley Sector.  Spiral 13-1’s primary focus will be to further characterize and counter asymmetrical maritime threats and inform tactics, techniques, and procedures to detect and discriminate suspicious open water, littoral and maritime-to-land transition activity.  Execution of the spring 2013 spiral will leverage partnerships with Customs Border Protection (CBP), Joint Interagency Task Force-South (JIATF-S), Joint Task Force-Northern Command (JTF-N B), the United States Coast Guard (USCG), National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) and U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM). Emphasis will be placed on near real-time information dissemination and display.  Spiral 13-2 will be executed in summer 2013.  This spiral builds upon Spiral 13-1 and places emphasis on the maritime-to-land transition activity and the ability for suspicious actors to quickly dissolve themselves into an urban or rural population.</r2:Text>

This project consists of three components.  The first component is a research study into methods of conducting socio-cultural analysis including remote sensing techniques for collecting indicator variables of resilience and vulnerability within interrelated megacity and rural systems.  The second component will be a case analysis of the drivers of and buffers to political, social, economic and environmental instability in the Dhaka, Bangladesh population center.  The third component of the study will be an assessment and testing of novel ways to present and visualize megacity stability data.  This will benefit COCOM planners with forecasting socio-cultural trends affecting state, regional, or community level stability.  Also this effort will answer the need for quantitative stability assessment approaches to address key national security considerations including the potential for or resurgence of violent extremism; humanitarian crisis; reinforcement of outlier state behavior and consideration of partner and ally relations.  </r2:Text>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Joint Experimentation (JE) Program Element (PE) (0603828D8Z) provides funding for the Department’s Joint Experimentation program—the Department’s primary effort for exploring non-materiel solutions to cover joint capability gaps in lieu of materiel solutions requiring new acquisition programs.  Consistent with strategic guidance, the JE program targets DoD’s highest priority joint capability gaps.  
The intent of the JE program is to enable trained, ready and adaptable joint forces, and improve capabilities of the current and future joint force.  The JE program focuses on producing new conceptual approaches and proposed solutions to combatant command and Service defined problems through the development of actionable joint force improvement recommendations in the critical considerations of joint doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel, facilities, and policy (DOTMLPF-P).  
The JE program primarily benefits combatant commanders and Services, and provides collateral benefits to DoD Agencies and the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD).  JE routinely provides indirect benefit to interagency and multinational partners and international organizations with whom the US participates during coalition operations.  
The JE Program is carried out by the JCD&amp;E community, comprised of all combatant commands, the Services, the National Guard Bureau, the Joint Staff, OSD, and several DoD agencies.  The Joint Staff leads the JCD&amp;E community.  Other participants in JE activities include a broad range of interagency partners as well as multinational, academic, and private sector agencies.  The Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research &amp; Engineering (ASD(R&amp;E)) within OSD helps provides oversight to ensure alignment with strategic guidance.  
Flexibility is maintained in the JE Program to address emergent requirements identified by DoD leadership.  Joint experimentation is complementary to Service experimentation.  Where possible, the JCD&amp;E community leverages Service experimentation to address joint challenges.   Joint/Service experimentation is coordinated within the JCD&amp;E community to cover gaps and pursue efficiency, and the results are shared throughout the community.    
projects are categorized by functional joint capability areas (JCAs) which help enable already-established functional capability boards to rigorously vet JE recommendations among subject matter matters throughout the joint community before those recommendations are approved by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC).  For FY12, these categories include Battlespace Awareness, Logistics, Building Partnerships, Command and Control, Force Application, Net-Centric and Protection.

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>General Description:  The FY 2012 (FY12) JCD&amp;E program of work in addresses key mission areas identified in the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review and highlighted in the Defense Planning Guidance.  Each Joint Capability Area had unique areas of focus:  

Battlespace Awareness (BA):  The FY12 campaign Included capabilities and concepts required to succeed in preventing proliferation and countering weapons of mass destruction.   The scope of the work also includes experimentation to identify and evaluate enabling technologies that lengthen detection ranges and strengthen ISR and communications ties between special and general purpose forces.

Logistics (LOG): Joint Force Commanders require responsive, agile logistics support to project force, sustain operations and ensure freedom of action wherever the force engages and in whatever form the engagement takes.  The FY12 JCD&amp;E program of work in LOG addresses existing and projected mission critical capabilities and conceptual gaps required to project, sustain, and employ the joint force in all operations.  The scope of work includes experimentation to identify and evaluate enabling technologies and non-materiel solutions that create mechanisms to facilitate more rapid transfer of critical materiel.

Building Partnerships (BP):  The FY12 campaign addresses projected mission critical capabilities and concepts required to build security capacity of partner states. The scope of the work includes security and engagement activities per the Capstone Concept for Joint Operations (CCJO) and experimentation to identify and evaluate enabling technologies to enhance US capability to increase the security capacity of partner states.  Specific focus areas for FY12 include:
-Strengthen and institutionalize General Purpose Force capabilities in conducting security force assistance missions 
-Increase socio-cultural/ human terrain awareness of the force 
-Increase information sharing capacity between US and partner states and within partner states 
-Develop collaborative planning and assessment tools to support of security force operations 
-Improve effective and efficient methods to provision logistical support to partner states

Command and Control (C2): The FY 2012 (FY12) JCD&amp;E program of work in C2 includes projected mission critical capabilities and concepts required to effectively command and control the joint force. Specific focus areas for FY12 include experiments on secure, robust and reliable networks to provide responsive command and control in complex chaotic and degraded information environments to integrate and share information with a full range of partners

Force Application (FA): Joint Force Commanders (JFCs) require improved kinetic or non-kinetic capabilities to maneuver and engage adversaries from political, strategic, operational, and tactical perspectives.  The FY 2012 JCD&amp;E program of work in FA addresses projected mission critical capabilities and concepts required to deter and defeat aggression in anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) environments.  The scope of work includes experimentation to identify and evaluate enabling technologies that focus on electronic warfare, long range strike, and undersea superiority.

Net-Centric: Joint Force Commanders require a framework for full human and technical connectivity and interoperability that allows all DOD users and mission partners to understand and act on information with confidence, and protects information from those who should not have it.  The FY 2012 JCD&amp;E program of work in the Net-Centric JCA addresses projected mission critical capabilities and concepts required to deter and defeat aggression in anti-access and area denial (A2/AD) environments.  The scope includes experimentation to identify and evaluate enabling technologies that focus assuring access to space and use of space-based assets.

Protection (PR):  The FY 2012 JCD&amp;E Program of Work (PoW) in PR addresses key capabilities and concepts related to force protection in all domains. </r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The Capstone Concept for Joint Operations-Joint Force 2020 will be tempo setting.  It will underlie joint development campaign plans going forward into FY13 and beyond.  The Joint Concept for Cyberspace is DoD’s first document that links an increasing number of strategy documents on cyber operations to how the future joint force will need to operate in the cyberspace domain.  JE initiatives in FY12 led to measurable improvements in surveillance management procedures and also produced a more functional perspective in addressing the assessment of persistent surveillance.</r2:Description>

Concept Intent: Articulates Chairman’s vision of future joint operations in order to guide joint force development towards Joint Force 2020. It also provides a foundation for Chairman’s Cross-Functional team focused on development Joint Force 2020.

Accomplished in FY12: “CCJO – Joint Force 2020” published, providing a bridge from the new strategy to subordinate operating concepts and doctrine

Impact:  TBD
  
Joint Integrated Persistent Surveillance (JIPS)

Issue: The Joint Force Commander requires adequate capability to rapidly integrate and focus national to tactical collection assets to achieve persistent surveillance of a designated geographic area or a specific mission set

Accomplished in FY12: 
-Updated definition of persistent surveillance in JP 1-02
-Created online course on Integrated Persistent Surveillance via Joint Knowledge Online
-Provided substantial input to complementary Commander’s Handbook for ISR Operations (J2-led)
-Directly informed ISR management tool development (J2-led)
-Refined joint accreditation criteria for Service training via JNTC

Impact:
-Timing of persistent surveillance-derived decision support provided to commanders is improved by 22%
-Arrival-on-station timing of collection assets is improved by 15%
-Initial asset utilization is improved by 5%
-Established best practices for surveillance management that now integrate rather than deconflict multi-echelon planning and direction, thereby reducing redundancy and latency in both requirements and collection management
-Changed the focus of assessment of persistent surveillance to being effectiveness-centric (i.e. satisfaction of decision support requirements) from being performance-centric (i.e. hours flown)
-Over time, platform/sensor/analytical/bandwidth requirements will be reduced (fewer needing to be deployed, operated, serviced/fueled/maintained, and protected) to fulfill a given information requirement set

Assessing Deterrence Operations Experiment (ADOE)
Issue: The employment of Joint Operational Command Centers to conduct ballistic missile defense (BMD) contingency and crisis action planning requires improvement to reduce intra- and inter-theater capability gaps

Accomplished in FY12: 
-Developed a framework for ADO documenting gaps of “what  is done” and “what should be done” 
-Published a Joint Force Guide for ADO

Impact: TBD

Joint Concept for Cyberspace 

Issue: DoD is unable to achieve and sustain cyberspace superiority essential to support and enhance the current and future demands of joint operations at the time and place of the warfighter’s choosing, in order to assure mission accomplishment

Accomplished in FY12: 
-Published the Joint Concept for Cyberspace V1.0
-Established a list of required capabilities with a road map for cross-agency acquisition/development strategies 
-Proposed a concept of operations that can be exercised in select future exercises such as Valiant Shield, Trident Warrior and Northern Edge

Impact:  Published the bridge between DoD strategy and doctrine that determined future capabilities required for cyberspace superiority.

Mobile Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) Modular Sensor System (MSS) (MDA-MSS)

Issue: NORAD and USNORTHCOM, in coordination with US Southern Command and Joint Interagency Task Force South (JIATF-S), seeks to perform an experiment to demonstrate capabilities and emerging technologies to tackle current surveillance gaps and improve maritime awareness in the Caribbean.

Accomplished in FY12:
-Project initiated to produce baseline analysis of existing systems and operational methods, as well as new innovative technologies.

Impact:  TBD, but it is expected that an enhanced and integrated surveillance capability, to include a collective surface coastal radar network in the Caribbean AOR, will provide wide-area surveillance tracking of potential maritime threats, in order to protect U.S. and allied equities and citizens in the region.

These analyses will be acquisition-centered net analyses of the end-to-end blue (US and Allies) capabilities compared to specific red (potential adversary) capabilities focused on identifying the most promising technologies for application to A2/AD problems.   The analyses will address acquisition specific questions such as:  can a system be accelerated and/or can a group of capabilities be combined in different ways to improve the overall effectiveness of US systems?  This office is expected to work closely with the Joint Staff and the Military Departments and in particular with the Air Sea Battle Office.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>  The Test and Evaluation/Science and Technology (T&amp;E/S&amp;T) Program seeks out and develops test technologies to stay in pace with evolving weapons technologies.  This program is critical to ensure that the Department of Defense (DoD) has the ability to adequately test the advanced systems that will be fielded in the future.  To meet this objective, the T&amp;E/S&amp;T Program performs the following activities:
• Exploits new technologies and processes to meet important test and evaluation (T&amp;E) requirements.
• Expedites the transition of new technologies from the laboratory environment to the T&amp;E community.
• Leverages industry advances in equipment, modeling and simulation, and networking to support T&amp;E.
Additionally, the T&amp;E/S&amp;T Program examines emerging T&amp;E requirements resulting from Joint Service initiatives to identify T&amp;E technology needs and to develop a long-range roadmap for technology insertion.  The program leverages and employs applicable applied research efforts from the highly developed technology base in DoD laboratories and test centers, other government agencies, industry, and academia to accelerate development of new test capabilities.  This program provides travel funds for T&amp;E/S&amp;T program oversight, special studies, analyses, and strategic planning related to test capabilities and infrastructure.
  The DoD established seven strategic science and technology (S&amp;T) investment priorities: 1) Data to Decisions, 2) Engineered Resilient Systems, 3) Cyber Science and Technology, 4) Electronic Warfare/ Electronic Protection, 5) Counter Weapons of Mass Destruction, 6) Autonomy, and 7) Human Systems.  The T&amp;E/S&amp;T Program has been aligned and prioritized to prepare the T&amp;E community to test warfighting capabilities that emerge from these S&amp;T priority investments.
  The T&amp;E/S&amp;T Program is funded within the Advanced Technology Development Budget Activity because it develops and demonstrates high payoff technologies for current and future DoD test capabilities.

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>   High-speed/hypersonic weapons are being developed to ensure the continued military superiority and strike capability of the United States including freedom of movement and freedom of action in areas protected by anti-access/area denial defenses.  Current weapon system demonstrations and technology development programs include high-speed and hypersonic air-breathing missiles, maneuvering reentry and boost-glide weapons, hypersonic gun-launched projectiles, and air-breathing space access vehicles.  These systems require development of conventional and high-speed turbine, ramjet, scramjet, and combined cycle engines; high temperature materials; thermal protection systems (TPS); and thermal management systems.  
  The High Speed Systems Test (HSST) project addresses test technology needs including propulsion, aerodynamic and aerothermal testing, so the test community has the technology to support the required test scenarios for concepts under development in the science and technology (S&amp;T) community.  The technology developments within the HSST project align with the Department of Defense (DoD) S&amp;T priority investments.  As such, the HSST project is developing, validating and transitioning advanced test and evaluation (T&amp;E) technologies for ground test, open-air range flight test, and advanced computational tools, along with instrumentation and diagnostics systems for use in both ground tests and flight tests of high speed systems.
  The HSST project develops technologies to enable robust, accurate, and timely T&amp;E of these future weapon systems.  DoD acquisition regulations require weapon systems to undergo a thorough T&amp;E process to detect deficiencies early and to ensure system suitability and survivability.  However, the extreme environments in which these weapons operate preclude accurate determination of their performance and operability with today’s T&amp;E assets.  Current national test capabilities have deficiencies in data accuracy, flight condition replication and simulation, test methods, productivity, modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) fidelity, and range safety.
  The HSST mission is to address these national test capability gaps by providing test technology solutions that will enable high-speed and hypersonic weapon systems to be successfully developed through accurate, robust, and efficient T&amp;E.

  The two most significant technology shortfalls in current hypersonic aero propulsion ground test capabilities were clean air heat addition (i.e. non-vitiated air) and variable Mach number test capability.  Current production ground test facilities could only create the high temperature inlet conditions necessary for scramjet engine tests by burning fuel in the airflow prior to entering the engine.  As demonstrated by an HSST FY 2011 test, the resulting “vitiated air” had different gas properties than clean air and was not representative of what the vehicle would experience during flight.  This significantly affected the engine’s performance and operability in the test environment resulting in erroneous flight performance predictions.  Variable mach number capability was required to “fly the mission” and determine the critical transient operability effects throughout the flight envelope.  Component technologies, previously developed by the T&amp;E/S&amp;T program, began incorporation into a small-scale, clean air, true enthalpy, variable Mach number 5-8 aero propulsion test facility.  The completed facility would advance the component development to Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6, provide an on-going test asset to the DoD, and provide risk reduction for construction of a full-scale facility.  Significant progress was made this year in Phase I of the development including fabrication, installation, and integrated checkout of the advanced high-temperature refractory bricks, controls, and support systems for the Regenerative Storage Heater. Design efforts for subsequent phases were initiated.  These efforts included critical design of the air delivery system and preliminary design of a variable Mach number nozzle.
   Innovative test techniques were developed to assess the viability of accurately testing large scramjet engines in existing size-limited national test facilities. One effort evaluated a means of truncating the long inlet section of an engine while still accurately replicating the performance of a larger baseline inlet.  Another effort evaluated how to quantify and improve the accuracy of direct connect and semi-free jet test techniques by comparing them to a benchmark free jet test configuration.  Engine operability and performance test results for each of the test facility configurations werequantified and compared to establish the first known database of engine/test facility configuration scale effects on engine operation.  The aforementioned technology developments aimed to permit weapons system developers to maximize the use of existing infrastructure and better understand test results, thereby reducing flight test and acquisition risks.
  Scramjet engine tests were completed to determine the facility effects of test duration, test media, and freejet versus direct-connect test methodology upon scramjet engine performance and operability.  Testing utilized scramjet engine flowpaths of the same design tested in impulse and blowdown ground test facilities.  This study culminates in the most extensive examination of hypersonic aero propulsion test methods yet accomplished and will enable significant improvements in the quality of data provided to weapon system developers and computational fluid dynamics tool developers.
  Accurately predicting the ablation characteristics of a TPS was critical for developing maneuvering reentry and boost-glide vehicles.  A major aerothermal T&amp;E capability gap existed in the mid-altitude/mid-pressure flight regime which was representative of the flight corridor for these hypersonic vehicles.  Improved arc heater electrodes were developed and tested this year which allowed for longer duration, higher enthalpy testing, and more realistic environments for hypersonic TPS testing.  
  Key flight test technologies were developed for flight termination and flight maneuver optimization.  Hardware-in-the-loop testing and final design of a flight rated, autonomous flight termination system were completed.  An autonomous flight safety system was designed to assure destruction of an errant hypersonic vehicle under test if it leaves its designated safety corridor, thereby maximizing safety while reducing flight test costs.  The current phase of this effort was to complete maturation and transition of autonomous flight safety technology to TRL 6 and pave the way for a direct transition to operational use.  Prototype units were being designed and built for use by the Operationally Responsive Space office.  Transition coordination was also underway to include other developmental hypersonic vehicle systems.  Advanced parameter identification maneuvers were developed and programmed into the flight computer of the third X-51 flight.  These optimized test maneuvers were designed to collect far more stability and control data per flight than possible using traditional methods, thus reducing the number of flight tests and costs.
  Progress was also made in advanced high speed systems test instrumentation.  A flight-weight, laser-based, non-intrusive measurement system was flown on a Hypersonic International Flight Research Experimentation (HIFiRE) flight test, resulting in the first-ever in-flight scramjet combustion efficiency measurement.  An advanced system utilizing lasers operating in the mid-infrared spectrum and which significantly lowers gas property measurement uncertainty was transitioned to a DoD ground test center and a DoD research laboratory.  A miniaturized, temperature-compensated wind tunnel balance for supersonic store separation testing was constructed.  Design, fabrication and demonstration of non-intrusive laser hygrometer and optical mass flow measurement systems were completed.  Testing of a fiber optic heat flux gauge and a high temperature shear stress sensor were also successfully completed. 
  Advances were achieved in the development of a state-of-the-art validated computational fluid dynamics tool.  Improved M&amp;S tools were transitioned to the hypersonic community.  These tools could simulate the complex flows within scramjet engines and include physical modeling for turbulence, fuel-air combustion, and heat transfer.  The code was successfully used to model combustion phenomenon in a scramjet engine.
  A technology demonstration was performed to evaluate a technique for testing propulsion systems beyond Mach 8 using magnetohydrodynamics to accelerate flow ionized by electron beams.

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>  Weapon systems have become increasingly complex in recent years, resulting in the need for significantly more data to be passed among these systems, and between the systems and our test infrastructure.  A vast amount of data must be collected, transmitted, and analyzed, which requires a large amount of radio frequency (RF) spectrum resources.  However, the amount of RF spectrum designated to support test and evaluation (T&amp;E) is decreasing, most notably due to reallocation of spectrum for commercial use.  The combination of decreasing RF spectrum and increasing data requirements results in an urgent need to create test technologies that maximize the use of spectrum resources for Department of Defense (DoD) T&amp;E operations.
  The L and S frequency bands are the traditional spectrum allotted for military use.  The explosive need for spectrum in the commercial sector has resulted in reallocation of portions of these bands to industry.  To compensate, DoD is now authorized to use the C-Band spectrum which offers numerous benefits, including a three-fold increase in available bandwidth, but C-Band comes with technical challenges.  Most notably, our current test infrastructure for telemetry is not designed to accommodate C-Band.  Technologies are required to implement innovative techniques that efficiently facilitate our use of C-Band without a major overhaul to our national test infrastructure.  For instance, commercial telemetry transmitters operate in C-Band but do not have the form factor (size and weight) or rugged packaging to survive airborne test applications.
  Traditional telemetry applications employ streaming telemetry where data is moved one-way from the instrumented system under test to our test infrastructure.  Modern network based telemetry capabilities, like those being developed by the Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program (CTEIP) integrated Network Enhanced Telemetry (iNET) effort, enable more robust, efficient bidirectional transfer of data.  DoD’s strategy is to create technologies for streaming telemetry capability in C-Band while opening up legacy L- and S-Bands for networked telemetry.
  The Spectrum Efficient Technology (SET) project is developing test technologies that enable more efficient use of legacy telemetry bands and expansion into non-traditional areas of the RF and optical spectra at DoD test ranges.  The technology development efforts within the SET project have been prioritized to align with Department of Defense guidance on science and technology priority investments. As such, the SET project is focusing on growing data requirements of warfighting systems and the limited availability of spectrum for testing.  The SET project is structured to develop test technologies to advance range communications, networked telemetry capabilities, and enhanced management of spectrum at DoD test ranges.

Technology enabling the dynamic reconfiguration of transmitted test data over a telemetry network was further matured.  The SET project continued development of a networked data recorder to provide risk reduction in support of the CTEIP iNET development.  The research and development of advanced data protocols for test data transmission across the iNET network continued.  A networked telemetry transceiver using an advanced waveform was developed and tested as a risk reduction effort for iNET development.  The SET project matured and demonstrated radio network technology to rapidly change operating frequencies in the presence of non-cooperative interference, thus maintaining connectivity with no perceivable impact on telemetry network performance.  Spectrum and network management technology development continued, with a focus on capabilities that allowed for dynamic distribution of spectrum resources among test participants.  Technologies matured by SET provided risk reduction in support of spectrum management which was challenged by spectrum sell-off activities.  Development continued on advanced technologies to increase RF bandwidth efficiency.  A wideband power amplifier capable of efficiently operating with advanced waveforms within the traditional telemetry bands was matured and demonstrated.  The prototype amplifier increased overall efficiency in spectrum utilization.  Research continued to determine the ideal coding scheme for advanced waveforms such as Shaped Offset Quadrature Phase Shift Keying, a more spectrally efficient data transmission scheme for aeronautical telemetry.  Forward error correction schemes for use in aeronautical telemetry to increase data reliability in dynamic test environments were completed and demonstrated.  These forward error correction schemes were adopted by the Range Commanders Council Telemetry Group for inclusion in Inter-Range Instrumentation Group telemetry standards.  
  The SET project continued the development of a three dimensional channel model tool for modeling and simulation of telemetry channels in various environments.  This tool provided higher fidelity simulations for use in researching the effects of terrain and other factors on telemetry channels.  The SET project investigated techniques to expand telemetry operations into non-traditional spectrum bands by characterizing multipath effects in multiple range environments.  Additionally, SET compared the data link performance of legacy RF spectrum allocations to the recently allocated C-Band spectrum.  The results of this investigation were published and transitioned to the DoD test ranges. SET continued efforts to develop airborne phased array antenna technology that would enable flexible scheduling of the T&amp;E spectrum by incorporating both the traditional L/S bands and recently permitted C-Band frequencies.  Some of these technologies would reduce the technical risk associated with beam steering in the C-Band frequencies, reduce the amount of infrastructure modifications needed to implement a C-Band telemetry capability, and provide over-the-horizon data connectivity to test large-footprint weapons, such as long range missiles.

These efforts will determine the feasibility of some of the upper bands for use in telemetry.  Additional efforts on alternate data link technologies in the optical realm will be investigated.  If efforts in this area are successful, these technologies can provide augmentation to the RF telemetry bands.  The SET project will continue efforts to mature phased array technology for use on the ground as well as in airborne applications.  The high directionality of phased array antenna technologies on aircraft will enable the ability to leverage spectrum spatial reuse techniques for more effective spectrum scheduling.  The SET project will begin investigation of technologies that will provide autonomous self-forming telemetry networks to provide connectivity in flight line and other areas that currently suffer from limitations in communications coverage caused by buildings and terrain.  Efforts will complete in the development of a three dimensional channel model tool used in modeling and simulation of telemetry channels in various environments.
  Additionally, the SET project will complete work to mature technologies in optimization and management of the telemetry networks through spectrum management tools designed to optimize spectrum utilization.

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>  Readily available, infrared (IR) seeking, man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS) are difficult to detect and pose an imminent and lethal threat to military aircraft of all types.  Our ability to counter such threats is essential to owning the airspace in theater.  Therefore, the ability to test missile warning systems (MWS), hostile fire indicators, IR countermeasures (IRCM), and advanced threat sensors is critical to our national defense.  Additionally, a new generation of enemy radio frequency (RF) missile seekers is both currently fielded and in further development, requiring a correspondingly new generation of test technologies to test the latest countermeasures.  The test and evaluation (T&amp;E) community is required to test IRCM and RF countermeasure systems in a repeatable manner with ground-truth data before and after integration into warfighting systems.  Without new test technologies, the Department of Defense (DoD) will be unable to perform adequate T&amp;E of advanced warning and countermeasure systems.
  The technology development efforts within the EWT project have been prioritized to align with DoD guidance on science and technology priority investments.  As such, the EWT project is focusing on the test needs in both the electro-optic (EO), including IR, and the RF threat domains.  Additionally, development of core test technologies in this area can be leveraged to meet other EO and RF test requirements, such as in fire control systems, reconnaissance sensors, and missile seeker subsystems.
  The EWT project develops test technologies to stimulate IRCM and RF system sensors through the high-fidelity simulation of scenes viewed by the sensors.  Stimulation can be as simple as testing to see if a system under test responds to an image or as complex as simulating complex battle space phenomena to measure the response of a system under test in a more relevant, cluttered scenario.  Simulations and stimulations are used at open air ranges and in installed system test facilities (ISTF), and in hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) test beds.

The EWT risk reduction effort for JDIGS entered the final stages of testing a new superlattice light-emitting diode source that could provide two-color, high-temperature scenes with a frame rate fast enough to test new IRCM and MWS.
  The EWT project completed development of read-in integrated circuit technology, which supplies electrical energy to emitters that generate images in ISTF and HWIL test facilities.  This technology completed final testing and was integrated with scene projection cameras.  The EWT project made significant progress in the development of a hyperspectral imaging projector, which allowed characterization and testing of hyperspectral imaging cameras used for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance.
  The EWT project initiated an effort to develop a breadboard technology to produce high-fidelity electronic counter-countermeasures (ECCM) radar signal processing techniques that employ sophisticated waveforms with algorithms, such as adaptive filtering.  This test technology development was to address a need, identified by the Navy-led, CTEIP-sponsored Tri-Service Electronic Warfare Test Capabilities Study, to improve testing against modern surface-to-air missile threats.

Furthermore, EWT technology developments will focus on stimulating synthetic aperture radars with RF injection, including realistic background clutter.  Research will be conducted for testing wide area emitters.  Efforts to develop surrogate missiles for testing of MWS and IRCM systems will continue.
  To address the testing of systems operating in the mid-wave IR band, the EWT project will develop technologies to enable the full testing of mid-wave IR sensor/seekers by adding clutter models and scene generators to real-time stimulation technologies.  Furthermore, efforts to develop technology to test against ECCM techniques of modern surface-to-air missiles will continue.

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>  The Advanced Instrumentation Systems Technology (AIST) project addresses the test technology gaps resulting from emerging weapon systems that need to be tested at Department of Defense (DoD) open air ranges, undersea ranges, installed systems test facilities, hardware-in-the-loop laboratories, and measurement test facilities.  Instrumentation requirements for systems under test are increasing exponentially for new weapons systems.  Vehicle on-board and warfighter wearable instrumentation packages are required.  This instrumentation is for sensing and collecting critical performance data; determining accurate time, space, position information (TSPI)and attitude information; interfacing with command and control data links; monitoring and reporting system-wide communications; recording human operator performance; and storing and transmitting data.
  The technology development efforts within the AIST project have been prioritized to align with DoD guidance on science and technology (S&amp;T) priority investments, particularly in support of human systems, engineered resilient systems, and counter weapons of mass destruction.  The AIST project is focused on supporting technology developments for advanced TSPI instrumentation (especially with limited or no use of the Global Positioning System (GPS)), advanced sensors, advanced energy and power systems for instrumentation, non-intrusive instrumentation, mitigating range encroachment issues, and measuring warfighter cognitive performance.  
  The AIST project addresses requirements for miniaturized, non-intrusive instrumentation suites with increased survivability in harsh environments.  Such instrumentation is an urgent need because minimal space is available to add instrumentation to new or existing weapon systems subsequent to their development; furthermore, additional weight and power draw for instrumentation can adversely affect weapon system signature and performance.  Instrumentation for humans-in-the-loop, such as dismounted soldiers, must not adversely affect soldier performance, induce artificiality in the test environment, nor create operational burden.  New technologies can be exploited to integrate small, non-intrusive instrumentation into emerging platforms during design and development, and, in some cases, into existing platforms.  This class of instrumentation will provide critical system performance data during test and continuous assessment throughout a system’s lifecycle.  Technology developed under AIST can also benefit training and combat missions by enabling a continual feedback loop between the developer, training staff, operators and commanders.

Consequently, a continued major thrust for FY 2012 included the development of test technologies to support collection of TSPI for soldier systems (manned or unmanned), particularly in GPS-denied or degraded environments, such as in urban areas and tunnels.  Efforts to test systems that operate in a GPS-denied environment included technology that enabled networking of GPS-enabled components within the test environment, and then using the network to integrate GPS and other positional information across the connected nodes.  The nodes shared raw observables from GPS and inter-node ranges to locate each network node with high reliability.  Final testing resulted in sub-meter position accuracy in environments that may be encountered in urban operations.  A related technological approach employed a layered system of sensors leveraging collaborative navigation, existing radio frequency ranging technology, and a Doppler velocimeter to achieve more precise TSPI under GPS-impaired conditions.  System components had integrated and planning was underway for preliminary testing in a realistic environment.  Also, progress was made on a warfighter inertial tracking system for dismounted warfighters. This technology employed boot-mounted sensors to provide sub-meter geolocation over GPS-denied durations of greater than 2 hours; system performance and system component requirements were verified.
  To support testing of high-speed, high-acceleration systems, an ultra-high dynamics GPS receiver was developed.  The receiver performed significantly better than existing test instrumentation.  Position solutions were obtained at velocities up to 10 kilometers/second with time-to-first-fix under 0.5 seconds, which was important for testing air-to-air missile systems launched from under the wing or from a weapons bay, and for range safety.  Requirements were being gathered for future test and evaluation GPS TSPI activities and to guide the architecture for next generation solutions.
  A holographic optical memory system was designed for on-board test data recording and retrieval, extending the data storage capacity of current state-of-the-art holographic memory up to 16 terabytes.  Laboratory testing had demonstrated that an increased capacity beyond 16 terabytes was possible.  Attachment technology development continued with investigation of new adhesive formulations that employed an electrically releasing foil patch.  This technology allowed attachment of sensors to non-conductive, painted exterior surfaces of aircraft and other combat vehicles, significantly reducing the time to restore the system under test to its operational configuration.  Investigations in this area continued with the aim of producing a stable adhesive formulation with an extended shelf life.  To improve testing at DoD undersea range complexes, algorithms and methodologies were investigated to automate detection and classification of marine mammal vocalizations from ocean floor range sensors (e.g., hydrophones) with testing planned at the Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center.  This test technology allowed the Navy to conduct critical test and evaluation (T&amp;E) events without adversely impacting marine mammal populations.  Efforts continued to assess and leverage microsystems technology under development at universities, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and government laboratories.  These efforts were applicable to T&amp;E of modern war fighting systems; a final report was produced.

These systems involve operations in extreme conditions, over long distances, for long durations, and often with very small physical footprints (i.e. microsystems).  Furnishing adequate energy and power to instrument such systems for testing is a significant technological challenge.  Major thrusts for FY 2013 include continuing ongoing efforts in advanced sensors, TSPI instrumentation, and advanced data acquisition and transformation that require little power along with the development of advanced power sources for test instrumentation.  Additionally, AIST will pursue test technologies to assess warfighter cognition under various workloads.  The AIST project will complete its assessment of emerging microsystems technology and develop a roadmap for potentially leveraging microsystems technologies in instrumentation at DoD ranges.
  The AIST project will complete: the development and testing of classifiers to identify specific sea mammals (e.g., dolphins and whales) found at undersea ranges; the development and testing of magnetic field sensors for the harsh environment of electromagnetic rail gun firings; an attachment technology that is environmentally resistant (e.g., shelf life) and does not require any solvents to restore test articles to operational condition; efforts for collecting TSPI on dismounted soldiers and related soldier systems in GPS-denied or degraded environments such as those found in urban and subterranean operations.
  The AIST project will also complete application specific integrated circuit architectures with high dynamic, multi-frequency, anti-jamming capability to provide TSPI in GPS-denied and GPS-jammed environments.  </r2:Text>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>  The Department of Defense (DoD) is exploring the military utility, safety, and suitability of directed energy weapons.  A robust test capability to assess directed energy weapons is essential to understanding their effectiveness and limitations, including determining their effectiveness in performing counter improvised explosive device (C-IED) operations.  Such assessments will depend upon knowledge acquired through the test and evaluation (T&amp;E) of directed energy technologies and testing of operational concepts.  Directed energy weapon technologies, primarily consisting of high energy lasers (HEL) and high powered microwaves (HPM), are outpacing available test capabilities.  Traditional test techniques for evaluating conventional munitions (with flight times ranging from seconds to minutes) are not sufficient for the T&amp;E of directed energy weapons that place energy on target instantaneously.  Consequently, new test technology solutions are needed to ensure that adequate developmental, live-fire, and operational test capabilities are available when directed energy programs are ready to test.
  Directed energy system and component testing requires three principal assessments:  (1) energy or power on target; (2) the effects on the target; and (3) the propagation of the directed energy to the target through the atmosphere.  In addition, the vulnerabilities of DoD systems to directed energy threats are required to be characterized in accordance with Military Standard (MIL-STD)-464C.  Equally as important, current test capabilities do not provide the detailed data required to understand U.S. directed energy system performance and effects.
  The technology development efforts within the Directed Energy Test (DET) project have been prioritized to align with DoD guidance on science and technology priority investments.  As such, the DET project is developing the technologies necessary for quantitative assessment of United States HEL and HPM performance, as well as the vulnerability of DoD weapon systems to enemy directed energy threats.

                                                                <r2:Text>  To assess HEL energy on target, sensor array designs were developed to directly measure irradiance across laser spots on target materials.  Additional developments produced alternative sensor array designs to measure the temperature profiles on the back surface of a HEL-irradiated target so that inverse heat conduction algorithms could be applied to estimate the temperature on the front (HEL-heated) surface.  In this same HEL T&amp;E area, fabrication began on a hyperspectral sensor technology to remotely measure radiance from an HEL spot on the target.  
  In the area of HEL effects on target, an adaptive optics system was designed and fabrication of a prototype was started.  The test technology allowed improved remote imaging of an HEL spot on a remote target.  This test technology was designed to be readily adaptable to telescopes at various test facilities.  Regarding HEL atmospheric propagation, a multi-light detection and ranging system to measure important atmospheric profiles along a slant path adjacent to the HEL beam propagation path began development.  This technology simultaneously measured profiles for three parameters: optical turbulence, water vapor content, and aerosol attenuation.
  A test technology supporting both HPM energy on target and effects on target was transitioned to the testing community within Air Force Research Laboratory.  This technology measured the electric field arriving at eight locations on the target and the temperature rise resulting from those fields.  It was used for testing the Counter-electronics High Power Microwave Advanced Munitions Project Joint Concept Technology Demonstration.  Also, a family of HPM sensor technologies demonstrated measurement of energy inside large targets during HPM engagements.  The sensor technologies could be used singly or in combination to non-intrusively measure electric and magnetic field vectors at the same location within a target system.  
  Early testing of electric field sensors in support of electromagnetic rail gun T&amp;E identified a prime source for indicating rail wear, a key issue for rail gun systems.  To better support C-IED testing, the test technology development to measure soil electrical properties built a brass board sensor with three interchangeable heads to cover the required frequencies.  The brass board had been used in proving the concept to measure the soil electrical properties for portions of the test site within minutes versus days associated with legacy systems.  Results produced measurements similar to those of legacy technologies.  This soil properties measurement technology was transitioned to the testing community. 
  The technology to characterize terahertz beam quality in support of testing the proliferating number of Terahertz sensors and detectors, which were used for force protection and characterizing explosives or biological threats, was transitioned to the test community.

The performance of these matured technologies will direct the focus of future investments to optimize HEL measurement capabilities on test ranges.  New efforts will be initiated to address identified test technology shortfalls, including HEL test safety and HEL collateral effects.  This includes efforts to improve the understanding of HEL reflection hazards so that testing of HEL systems can be done safely without risk to observers and sensors.  In addition, test technologies will focus on the characterization of solid state laser effects on targets in support of weapons systems in development and demonstration by the Army, Navy, and Air Force.  Test technologies to support the measurement of laser lethality on rockets, artillery, mortars, and unmanned air vehicle targets will remain a key area of investment.  Furthermore, efforts to characterize beam propagation through the atmosphere will center on the maritime environment in support of emerging needs of the Navy.  Investment will be placed in laser safety software and hardware to allow testing at multiple test ranges without affecting aircraft and space-based sensors.  
  Initiatives to achieve very small, non-intrusive current and voltage sensors to measure HPM effects inside a target will be completed.  These technologies will be transitioned to at least two locations to demonstrate the flexibility of these approaches.  A small, minimally intrusive data acquisition device with a wide bandwidth to match that of the non-intrusive electric and magnetic field sensors will be investigated.
  A HPM test risk reduction effort will be performed to determine the best approach to construct a more durable pressurized – radio frequency transmitting dome that does not leak over time for a test capability that emulates wideband threats.  A new study will be initiated to investigate technologically-viable alternatives to provide the neutron radiation required for nuclear survivability testing.

Such HELs include solid state, fiber, and free electron laser systems.  Tunable over a wide range, free electron lasers present unique testing challenges for open air testing, including measuring laser energy on target, as well as characterizing the beam propagation and thermal blooming effects.  As development of electromagnetic rail guns and the free electron lasers advance, investments in test technologies supporting these weapon systems will be initiated.  
  In the HPM area, measuring the actual cause of HPM effects on electronics will be addressed by measurement of electrical currents within the wires and chips of the electronic targets.  To better support weapon research and design, a method will be sought to determine the time out of action for targets after an HPM attack.  In survivability testing, these sensors will support assessment of susceptibility with different HPM source power levels.  Additionally, the DET project will address technology for small, powerful HPM sources to allow testing of the susceptibility of U.S. equipment in a chamber environment.

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>  The Net-Centric Systems Test (NST) project is pursuing test technologies to emulate multi-Service, Joint, and coalition net-centric operations in a system of systems test and evaluation (T&amp;E) environment.  Additionally, the NST project develops technologies to analyze and evaluate the increasingly massive amounts of structured and unstructured data generated by complex net-centric tests.  The technology to conduct T&amp;E on net-centric systems is challenged by sensor platforms, command and control systems and weapon platforms that support the kill chain in a Joint operation.  These systems must be evaluated for their ability to provide an accurate, timely transfer of data (e.g., target tracks, weapons allocation, mission tasking and situational awareness), as the data passes among different systems of Service and coalition participants.  The NST technologies advance test automation (test planning, test execution, test control, and analysis) that enable the virtual integration of Department of Defense (DoD) weapon laboratories and open air ranges.  Using models and simulations along with hardware-in-the-loop laboratories, the effectiveness of Joint missions can be assessed in terms of system-of-systems interoperability and effectiveness in executing Joint mission operations, including testing of weapons and Command and Control systems accessing and providing information to the Global Information Grid.  The technology development efforts within the NST project have been prioritized to align with DoD guidance on science and technology priority investments, particularly in measuring “Data to Decision” techniques and warfighting capabilities.  Ultimately, the NST portfolio enables the T&amp;E community to “test like we fight” by replicating net-enabled, Joint mission operations within a T&amp;E environment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The NST project developed test planning technologies to address test integration and interoperability issues.  Ontologies were developed to formalize concepts pertaining to LVC test resources in a net-centric joint mission environment (JME).  The NST project developed knowledge bases that captured subject matter expertise on setup and execution of a test event and characteristics of test resources.  Machine reasoning capabilities were extended and integrated to automate test planning tasks.  The NST project continued development of a planning and visualization technology to support joint mission thread testing to better correlate test data to the effectiveness of mission operations.
  The NST project advanced technologies to support the execution of distributed tests with active network control, enhanced the dynamic management of the test infrastructure, and improved the integration of Service laboratories and test ranges.   These technologies were transitioned and integrated into the Test and Training Enabling Architecture (TENA) that was used by the Joint Mission Environment Test Capability (JMETC) and at test facilities and training ranges.  
  The NST project continued investigating in technologies to test military systems that employed Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA), including test technologies to help the tester understand what was happening inside and between SOAs during test events.  A SOA prototype test tool was developed and successfully demonstrated for the Joint Interoperability Test Command.  These test technologies allowed the tester to understand the environment, including but not limited to network hardware and software.  The NST project also developed technologies for the next generation of TENA middleware that supported a broad range of networks, including wireless networks, and provided native support for handheld and embedded computing platforms.  This technology successfully demonstrated TENA connectivity through wireless networks to several commercially-available smartphone devices.  Global Positioning System and accelerometer test data were successfully transmitted over commercial cellular carriers using an encrypted virtual private network. 
  The NST project transitioned test technologies to the Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program (CTEIP) Interoperability Test and Evaluation Capability (InterTEC) to support a planning and visualization web service technology used during the InterTEC Cyber Event.  This technology enabled testers to efficiently apply mission threads to test design.  In addition, these test technologies also transitioned to the NAVAIR Integrated Warfighting Capability.

Additionally, the NST project will continue the development of technologies to support the measurement and analysis of the net-centric test environment.  The analysis of Joint mission threads in near real-time will be assisted by the development of a test technology that will allow effective replication and characterization of Joint mission threads.
  The testing of SOA will be emphasized through the research and development of instrumentation and analysis tools utilizing embedded agent-based technologies.  Additional test technology development will be conducted in semantic interoperability and defining ontologies that formalize concepts pertaining to distributed test resources in a net-centric JME.
  The NST project will focus predictive smart dead-reckoning technology to address the challenge to adequately synchronize the distributed test environment.  This effort will provide the necessary distributed intelligence to manage time space position information (TSPI) updates in the net-centric test battlespace with a distributed LVC architecture.  The NST project will build upon previously developed NST technologies to solve the test challenges of producing accurate TSPI predictions under all network conditions, to include both unpredictable network latency and missing information.  Since the predictive smart dead-reckoning technology will be built on top of the policy-enabled agent, it will be able to provide fast response under complex test event conditions.

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>  Unmanned and Autonomous Systems (UAS) support every domain of warfare.  They operate in space, in air, on land, on the sea surface, undersea and in subterranean conditions to support a vast variety of missions.  The emergence of unmanned systems brings a host of revolutionary capabilities that will profoundly influence warfare.  The Unmanned and Autonomous Systems Test (UAST) project addresses current and emerging challenges associated with the test and evaluation (T&amp;E) of these critical warfighting capabilities.  The technology development efforts within the UAST project have been prioritized to align with Department of Defense (DoD) guidance on science and technology priority investments, particularly in assessing autonomy.  As such, the UAST project is developing test technologies to simulate, stimulate, instrument, measure, and assess autonomous systems’ ability to perceive its environment, process information, adapt to dynamic conditions, make decisions, and effectively act on those decisions in the context of mission execution.
  The UAST project will provide the test technologies to effectively measure performance and characterize risk, thereby increasing warfighter trust in autonomous systems.  Current DoD test capabilities and methodologies are insufficient to address the testing of increasingly autonomous units and teams of unmanned systems operating in unstructured, dynamic, battlespace environments.  Furthermore, advancements are being made in developing collaborating system-of-autonomous-systems, working in concert as a swarm or pack and in close proximity with humans.  New test technologies are needed to stress the collective set of autonomous systems under realistic conditions, predict emergent behavior of autonomous systems, emulate the complex environment, and assess mission performance of these highly coupled and intelligent systems.

                                                                <r2:Text>  The UAST project focused on predicting and assessing the autonomy functions of unmanned and autonomous systems through the initiation of new technology developments.  The complexity of operational unmanned and autonomous systems, with all possible interactions occurring between sensing, perception, reasoning, mapping, decision making and action, resulted in an almost infinite set of potential interactions and correspondingly, an almost infinite set of test conditions.  An effort was initiated to employ evolutionary/genetic algorithms in a software-in-the-loop environment to accurately predict the fault conditions of a complex, long-duration autonomous system.  Initially supporting testing of the Long Duration – Unmanned Underwater Vehicle, this test technology improved the ability to predict fault conditions and thereby enabled focused test strategies that dramatically improved the efficiency of testing.
  In the area of autonomous system performance assessment, a test technology was developed to enable automated stress testing of UAS software at the interfaces of the core components without requiring source code.  The approach was agnostic to the specific component interface.  This technology provided the tester with a perspective of system performance and a currently unavailable prediction of behavior.  Recent stress-testing of a representative ground-based UAS system identified vulnerability issues at the command interface layer of the system.  Additionally, in the area of autonomous system performance assessment, a virtual UAS test bed was designed that used environmental data from external sources (to include imagery from operational areas of interest) and injected that data into simulations of a given UAS to predict the behavior of the system in the operational environment.  An initial demonstration of this test technology facilitated efficient testing in an operationally representative environment and allowed for safe operations at “edge of the envelope” performance parameters.

The UAST project will further explore test technologies to meet the challenges of testing autonomy by leveraging advances made in the standardization of UAS architectures, functional components, and interfaces.
  The test technology to adapt evolutionary algorithms to predict fault conditions will be expanded to address evaluation functions for multiple missions of a long duration UAS.  The effort to stress test UAS software will explore technologies to integrate UAS models with software exception databases to allow for sharing of test data across multiple UAS platforms.  The UAS virtual test bed effort will complete its architecture and terrain modeling, develop perceptual boosting algorithms based on vehicle sensors, and integrate all sensor and simulation modules into a complete virtual test bed.  The complete prototype test bed will be verified through comparison of the outputs from the models inside the virtual proving ground with real data acquired during field tests. The UAST project will deliver a roadmap of potential test technology needs for testing autonomous systems at DoD ranges.

Additionally, the UAST project will focus on enhancing the test environment to assess unmanned threat systems.  The UAST project will develop instrumentation and analysis technologies to enable UAS testing that furnishes data to support the evaluation of overall mission performance in a Joint context.  The UAST project will initiate efforts to enable dynamic construction, control, measurement of complex systems-of-autonomous-systems and tactically meaningful counter-unmanned systems analysis.  Test requirements will expand to integrate multi-UAS test beds that support a simulation-based methodology to seamlessly integrate constructive simulation, UAS-in-the loop simulation, and live UAS tests.  The UAST project will deliver complementary tools to predict UAS behavior by monitoring how autonomous systems process data in response to environmental changes.  Simulated systems will replicate multiple platforms for the evaluation of multi-platform behaviors and detailed system/event logging.  Modeling and simulation techniques will be expanded to provide high fidelity representations of appropriate environmental complexity in order to stress the UAS and establish confidence in the safety and capabilities of future systems.</r2:Text>

Advancements in utilizing cyberspace are outpacing the technologies needed for test and evaluation (T&amp;E).  The Cyberspace Test Technology (CTT) project will develop advanced technologies and methodologies to test and evaluate DoD capabilities and information networks to defend and conduct full-spectrum military operations across cyberspace.  Current cyberspace T&amp;E capabilities are insufficient to support the continual experimental, contractor, developmental, operational, and live-fire testing requirements of warfighter systems operating in cyberspace.  Many of the test tools and infrastructure items required for systems in cyberspace will need advancement and maturation of various nascent test technologies.  The CTT project has been aligned with DoD guidance on science and technology (S&amp;T) priorities, specifically in the area of Cyber S&amp;T.  The CTT project will address test technology shortfalls in cyberspace testing, including planning cyberspace tests, creating representative cyberspace threats, and executing cyberspace tests.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The CTT project will investigate using integrated cross-domain solutions and gateways to create realistic cyberspace tests at multiple levels of security classifications.  The CTT project will also focus on threat cyberspace attack technologies required to assess information assurance vulnerabilities and to improve the agility of cyberspace test capabilities.  A CTT roadmap, which synchronizes with overall Department cyberspace plans, will be developed.</r2:Text>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element funds innovation that will improve the Department’s operational effectiveness via targeted operational energy science and technology investments.  It contains two projects this year.

P455 The Operational Energy Capability Improvement Fund (OECIF) incentivizes long term change in the science and technology portfolio of the Department to be more in line with the Department-wide Operational Energy Strategy and generally fosters innovation to improve operational energy performance.  This mission has two key aspects.  First, to develop and/or demonstrate and rapidly transition into the force operational energy technologies or practices that will improve the Department’s military capabilities and/or reduce its costs.  Second, to establish within the military Services sustainable institutional capacities that will continue to research, develop and adopt operational energy innovations.  OECIF funds serve as “seed money” to consolidate or start promising operational energy programs or directions to be sustained by the Services; accordingly, OECIF generally emphasizes supporting or establishing programs, rather than one-off projects.

P456 The Hybrid Energy Storage Module (HESM) project explores advanced technology development of hybrid energy storage associated with providing the capability to enhance fuel efficiency, maximize performance and reliability, and enable future high power weapons and sensors systems on legacy and next generation Army and USMC battlefield generators and vehicles, Air Force and Navy aircraft and Navy ships.  This project will demonstrate scalable energy storage systems with high power and energy densities, high rate capability that: reduce total logistics replenishment of fuel and material; increase platform and vehicle ability to sustain operations during engagement; and reduce maintenance and other events that interfere with mission capability.  Post the demonstration completion, this technology will be further sustained by the Services.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Consistent with the mission of this funding, these programs are being executed by the Services and PACOM.  An Army/Navy program to improve the efficiency of vapor compression cooling systems in forward areas began work on various component technologies and environmental data reduction and model development.  A complementary Navy/ARPA-E program to pursue high risk, high reward deployable cooling technologies determined the needed capabilities and began a process to select ARPA-E technologies to leverage.  An Army/Air Force program to develop energy efficient soft shelters/tents established technical baselines and thermal models of shelter systems, began to identify and mature technologies to reduce energy consumption and coordinated a variety of related technology, test and demonstration activities.  A Navy program to improve the energy efficiency of containerized living units (CLUs) began testing component technologies and investigating new shelter configurations/designs for a super-efficient CLU.  A PACOM/DOE program to evaluate an array of technologies to reduce energy loads in tropical environments, partly through a deployable testbed, conducted some initial tests and set up its outreach network, which is designed to reach a variety of organizations that offer promising technologies.

These five programs were complemented by several other efforts.  One such effort involves establishing a quantitative basis for energy use of expeditionary outposts in Afghanistan; this program instrumented and began collecting data on various equipment in the field.  Another is a joint program with the Strategic Environmental Research and Development program (SERDP) to develop practical, deployable waste to energy systems; that program awarded contracts to develop conceptual designs and test prototypes.  Finally, there is a program to develop modeling and simulation technology to assess operational energy effects in ground operations.

The Army/Air Force soft shelters/tent program will conduct first generation technical testing in relevant locales to validate reductions in energy consumption compared to the baseline and continue improving energy efficiency through thermal modeling, further technology maturation, and optimizing second generation, system-level designs.  The Navy CLU program will continue testing various component technologies as potential upgrades for existing CLUs and design and prototype a new super-efficient CLU.  The PACOM/DOE program will test additional technologies during several exercises and continue to build-up and improve its outreach network.  The data collection program in Afghanistan will finish collecting data and then analyze the results.  The waste to energy program with SERDP will complete the design of waste-to-energy systems and construct prototype systems. 

The key new initiative in FY 2013 will be the start up of broad efforts to improve DoD’s operational energy performance particularly by involving nontraditional innovators and small businesses in meeting DoD’s operational energy challenges.  These new programs will emphasize the use of innovative business methods, such as consortia, to establish standing forums for sustained interaction between DoD and a broad variety of non-government organizations.  Possible topics for these consortia or similar organizations include dismounted power, power supply networks for expeditionary outposts, and tactics, techniques and procedures for energy efficient operations.  These programs will be executed by the Services.

The Army/Navy cooling program will complete its integrated cooling systems and demonstrate them at key Army evaluations designed to promote transition.  The Navy/ARPA-E cooling program will complete the technology development programs under its sponsorship while pursuing transition opportunities.  The Army/Air Force soft shelters/tent program will conduct second generation technical testing in relevant locales to validate a 50 percent reduction in energy consumption compared to the baseline and transition technologies to appropriate programs.  The Navy CLU program will finalize the design and conduct a field test of the super-efficient CLU.  The PACOM/DOE program will test and refine additional load reduction technologies for tropical environments, validate the data collected in previous assessments, and look for additional DoD partners with similar or related challenges.  The waste to energy program with SERDP will evaluate the prototype systems using waste streams that simulate those encountered at expeditionary base camps.

FY 2014 new starts will focus on filling one or more of the operational energy technology gaps identified in a technology gap assessment completed by ASD(R&amp;E) at the end of FY 2012.  Consistent with the mission of this funding, these new programs will aim to fill some of the identified gaps by funding the startup of sustainable S&amp;T programs within the Services.  The five top priority gaps are: High Efficiency Energy Conversion; Energy Integrated Design and Simulation; High Efficiency Propulsion; Environmental Control Units; Flexible and Adaptive Power Distribution.

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program addresses developing an integrated and interconnected CWMD capabilities-based system that defines and enables a comprehensive, global awareness and readiness for CWMD steady-state and surge postures. The diverse and complex Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) – nuclear, biological and chemical threats – mission space requires an integrated approach towards capability development. Capability development must be based on a systems perspective that links strategic objectives with interrelated tasks and associated capabilities. The broad CWMD military strategic objectives and mission areas encompass many nontraditional capabilities for the Warfighter, and CWMD is not an isolated mission set unique to DoD – it is intertwined with counter-terrorism and homeland defense. Accordingly, developing an overall CWMD capability should and must leverage complementary capabilities through integration and synchronization. A global CWMD situational awareness capability will be established and deployed worldwide via current communications systems and common operating pictures in support of this mission.  This program will incorporate portfolio management tools and comprehensive analyses to enable a balanced and integrated CWMD systems portfolio, an optimized CWMD force structure, and the integration with and utilization of existing military assets to fill intelligence, sensor and reconnaissance gaps in CWMD.

This program also responds to the strategic needs outlined in the President's initiative, stated in his April 2009 speech in Prague; the US Combatant Commands integrated priorities and requirements; the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review; and the FY12-16 Defense Planning and Programming Guidance by providing improved timeliness and relevance through modernizing CWMD support to the Combatant Commands, Office of the Secretary of Defense, Joint Staff, Intelligence Community (IC), and other U.S. Government agencies as required. This program is designed to leverage existing DoD resources and proven approaches to achieve its goals and rapidly deliver a capability to the Warfighter. It will ensure sufficient funding is available for travel to support the requirements of this program element.

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program addresses developing an integrated and interconnected CWMD capabilities-based system that defines and enables a comprehensive, global awareness and readiness for CWMD steady-state and surge postures. The diverse and complex Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) – nuclear, biological and chemical threats – mission space requires an integrated approach towards capability development. Capability development must be based on a systems perspective that links strategic objectives with interrelated tasks and associated capabilities. The broad CWMD military strategic objectives and mission areas encompass many nontraditional capabilities for the Warfighter, and CWMD is not an isolated mission set unique to DoD – it is intertwined with counter-terrorism and homeland defense. Accordingly, developing an overall CWMD capability should and must leverage complementary capabilities through integration and synchronization. A global CWMD situational awareness capability will be established and deployed worldwide via current communications systems and common operating pictures in support of this mission.  This program will incorporate portfolio management tools and comprehensive analyses to enable a balanced and integrated CWMD systems portfolio, an optimized CWMD force structure, and the integration with and utilization of existing military assets to fill intelligence, sensor and reconnaissance gaps in CWMD.

This program also responds to the strategic needs outlined in the President's initiative, stated in his April 2009 speech in Prague; the US Combatant Commands integrated priorities and requirements; the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review; and the FY12-16 Defense Planning and Programming Guidance by providing improved timeliness and relevance through modernizing CWMD support to the Combatant Commands, Office of the Secretary of Defense, Joint Staff, Intelligence Community (IC), and other U.S. Government agencies as required. This program is designed to leverage existing DoD resources and proven approaches to achieve its goals and rapidly deliver a capability to the Warfighter. It will ensure sufficient funding is available for travel to support the requirements of this program element.

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) addresses the need to defend and deter against weapons of mass destruction (WMD) threats and to safeguard personnel; prevent unauthorized access to equipment, installations, material, and documents; and to safeguard the foregoing against espionage, sabotage, damage, and theft.  This program oversees advanced engineering development throughout DoD for an integrated and systemic RDT&amp;E approach for countering nuclear threats and nuclear and conventional physical security technology and systems.  The funding has been centralized in this Defense-wide PE since the early 1990s and represents a substantial portion of all DoD physical security RDT&amp;E funding.  Priorities for this PE RDT&amp;E efforts are driven by inputs from Quadrennial Defense Review guidance, Combatant Command and Service requirements, analysis reports such as “Protecting the Force:  Lessons from Fort Hood," January 2010, the Integrated Unit, Base, and Installation Protection Cost Benefits Analysis, Multi-national Work Plans established through the Nuclear Security Summit process, and DoD Directive 5210.41, Security Policy for Protecting Nuclear Weapons-directed requirements and associated security deviation reports.  

Under this integrated approach, funds are used to provide advanced component development and prototypes for the Department in seven capability areas:  (1) Detection and Assessment; (2) Access Controls; (3) Installation and Transport Security; (4) Storage and Safeguards; (5) Prevention; (6) Decision Support Systems; and (7) Analytical Support.  This program will evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment.  The projects under the Program Element either (a) lead to Programs of Record which can transition to Program Element 0604161D8Z for systems development and demonstration (SDD); (b) become technology insertions into existing programs; or (c) advance to being a certified Commercial/Government off-the-shelf product.  The PE initiatives are coordinated by the Physical Security Enterprise and Analysis Group.  This group is responsible for avoiding duplication of effort and when applicable ensure systems integration and promote interoperability and sustainability.  

This PE can fund travel to support the requirements of this program.

This appropriation will finance work, including manpower, performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant
arrangement with the government who conduct research (systematic study directed toward fuller scientific knowledge or understanding of the subject studied),
development (systematic use of the knowledge and understanding gained from research, for the production of useful materials, devices, systems, or methods, including the design and development of prototypes and processes) and test and evaluation efforts.

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Nuclear forensics is the thorough collection, analysis and evaluation of radiological and nuclear material in a pre-detonation state and post-detonation radiological or nuclear materials, devices and debris, as well as the immediate effects created by a nuclear detonation.  The ability to identify the source of nuclear material from radioactive debris is critical to our national defense and security. Swift and accurate forensic and attribution (identification) capabilities are vital to developing an appropriate national response to a nuclear event and preventing future attacks in a timely manner.

Nuclear Terrorism is one of the most significant and pressing threats identified by national leadership.  A credible nuclear forensics program is essential to preventing nuclear terrorism by deterring nations from sponsoring nuclear terrorism.  During the Deputy Management Advisory Group process shortfalls and resources to close these gaps were identified and supported by the Deputy Secretary of Defense.  The purpose of this program is to develop systems such as ground based Prompt Diagnostic sensors and Particulate Airborne Collection Systems to provide timely and accurate information to national leadership in the area of Nuclear Forensics. 

Per DoDI 2060.04 OSD AT&amp;L NCB is the program lead for the Department of Defense in Nuclear Forensics.  NCB represents DoD interests in all areas of nuclear forensics but focuses heavily on post-detonation applications due to Presidential guidance assigning the department the lead role in develop, providing, and maintaining post detonation Nuclear Forensics capability.  

This PE can fund travel to support the requirements of this program.

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>(U) This Program Element (PE) was established in response to Congressional guidance to consolidate DoD robotic programs on unmanned ground systems and related robotic technologies in order to increase the focus of the robotic programs on operational requirements. Technologies in the PE support the continued development of technologies beyond Budget Activity 3 (PE 0603711D8Z) for technology transition and transformation to close warfighter requirement capability gaps. By exercising its oversight role through a technology advisory board, senior military Council and Senior Steering Group (Flag level), Joint Ground Robotics (JGRE) applies this PE to enable coordination between the Services and places emphasis on interoperability and commonality among unmanned ground systems. This PE funds efforts to overcome technology barriers in thrust areas of unmanned ground system technologies to include Autonomous &amp; Tactical Behaviors, Collaborative Operations, Interoperability, Man-portable Unmanned Ground System Technologies, Manipulation Technologies, and Technology Transition/Transformation. This PE funds unmanned ground system technologies and supports the integration of technologies into representative models or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment and expedites technology transition from the laboratory to operational use. Emphasis is on proving component and subsystem maturity prior to integration in major and complex systems and may involve risk reduction initiatives. Within this PE, funded projects will continue the delivery of advanced technology directed at enhancing the warfighter's capabilities identified during new concept development, operational assessments and field feedback of current unmanned systems. The technologies are generally at TRL 4 or 5 with the intent to mature them through JGRE efforts to TRL 6.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Technologies selected are projected to provide a return on the investment through cost savings and improved efficiencies. The program responds to: (1) Congressional concern over the slow pace of remediation of environmentally polluted sites on military installations, (2) Congressional direction to conduct demonstrations specifically focused on emerging new technologies, and (3) the need to improve defense readiness by reducing the drain on the Department's operation and maintenance dollars caused by environmental restoration, waste management, and the cost of energy. Preference for demonstrations is given to technologies that have successfully completed all necessary research and development objectives, and address the highest priority DoD requirements. </r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Focused new investment topics for FY 2012 included: 1) Long Term Management of Contaminated Groundwater; 2) Bioavailability Technologies and Tools; 3) UXO Live Site Demonstrations; and 4) Natural Resource Management. Increased funding in FY 2012 is supporting new live site UXO demonstrations. This effort will transition innovative technologies that can reduce DoD's military munitions response liabilities by approximately 75% with an expected cost savings of $10 billion.

                                                        <r2:Description>Funds are programmed for investments in projects that respond to Congressional direction for the Department to increase energy efficiency, reduce installation energy intensity, increase the use of renewable energy, and improve energy security.  Emerging energy technologies offer DoD a cost effective opportunity to meet these requirements for reduced energy consumption and improved energy security on its installations while reducing energy and operational costs.</r2:Description>

Projects were competitively selected, funds were obligated to federal performers, contracts are in place, and work is underway.  The test bed program is validating and testing the operational cost and performance of innovative energy technologies in a real-world integrated building environment so as to reduce risk, overcome the barriers to deployment, and facilitate wide-scale deployment. The DoD test bed program exploits the Department's existing built infrastructure to test energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies in three areas: component technologies (i.e., HVAC, lighting, distributed energy generation); system approaches to building energy design, control, and management; and installation-level smart micro-grid technologies. It is a distributed test bed designed to evaluate energy technologies under the varied climatic conditions and building types DoD manages. The test beds key elements are: 1) competitive selection of new technologies, 2) systematic and consistent evaluation to determine performance, operational readiness and life cycle costs, and 3) development of guidance and design information for future deployment across installations. This process has been developed, piloted, and validated through previous Congressional funding.  Information on existing demonstrations can be found at WWW.SERDP-ESTCP.ORG.</r2:Text>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Humanitarian Demining Research and Development (HD R&amp;D) program element rapidly develops, demonstrates and validates new technologies for DoD-supported nations to detect and clear landmines and unexploded ordnance (UXO), and to contribute to U.S. military countermine R&amp;D.  The HD R&amp;D Program is the only U.S. organization conducting research and development for Humanitarian Mine Action (HMA) detection and mechanical clearance technologies.  HMA is a critical component of stability operations, which HD R&amp;D directly supports by speeding improvements to technologies used by U.S. forces in support of USG operations; reducing the post-conflict threat to host nation population and U.S. forces; reducing insurgent access to explosives (landmines and UXO); enhancing mine action capacity of non-governmental organizations and mine action centers in mine-affected countries; and providing engagement opportunities for DoD personnel in mine-affected countries.  

The HD R&amp;D Program adapts commercial-off-the-shelf equipment, integrates mature technologies, and leverages R&amp;D activity within DoD, particularly in the Army's Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD) Tactical Countermine mission area.  The program aims to improve existing technologies for: mine/UXO detection, technical survey/area reduction, mechanical mine/UXO clearance, vegetation clearance, mine neutralization, and post-clearance quality assurance (QA).  Evaluations of HD R&amp;D Program-developed technologies in actual minefields are conducted by host nation demining partners (foreign military, non-governmental organizations and mine action centers) and provide valuable data for U.S. military countermine R&amp;D and next generation HD technology developments while directly contributing to worldwide mine and UXO clearance.  Since 1995 the program has fielded technologies for 160 evaluations in 36 countries, including Iraq and Afghanistan.  The program’s technologies have cleared 18+ million sq meters of the world’s toughest minefields; found or destroyed 80,000+ mines and UXO; and provided 280,000 mine/UXO disposal charges with 33 tons of explosive recovered from stockpiles and abandoned munitions in PACOM.

Under the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict (OASD SO/LIC), the HD R&amp;D Program works closely with the U.S. combatant commands (COCOMS) and the Humanitarian Demining Training Center (HDTC) to support the Warfighter.  Areas of emphasis are identified and validated at a biennial Requirements Workshop held by OASD SO/LIC.  The Requirements Workshop involves representatives from Department of State (DoS), COCOMS and mine-affected nations.

Since 1995 the program has fielded technologies for 160 evaluations in 36 countries, including Iraq and Afghanistan.  The program’s technologies have cleared 18+ million sq meters of the world’s toughest minefields; found or destroyed 80,000+ mines and UXO; and provided 280,000 mine/UXO disposal charges with 33 tons of explosive recovered from stockpiles and abandoned munitions in PACOM.

Under the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict (OASD SO/LIC), the HD R&amp;D Program works closely with the U.S. combatant commands (COCOMS) and the Humanitarian Demining Training Center (HDTC) to support the Warfighter.  Areas of emphasis are identified and validated at a biennial Requirements Workshop held by OASD SO/LIC.  The Requirements Workshop involves representatives from Department of State (DoS), COCOMS and mine-affected nations.

                                                        <r2:Description>The Humanitarian Demining Research and Development (HD R&amp;D) program element rapidly develops, demonstrates and validates new technologies for DoD-supported nations to detect and clear landmines and unexploded ordnance (UXO), and to contribute to US military countermine R&amp;D.  The HD R&amp;D Program focuses on development of new technologies to improve the efficiency and safety of indigenous nation-conducted, post-conflict clearance of residual mines and UXO, which pose a serious threat to US forces conducting stability operations, and to the host nation’s population and economy.  

The HD R&amp;D Program adapts commercial-off-the-shelf equipment, integrates mature technologies, and leverages R&amp;D activity within DoD, particularly in the Army's Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD) Tactical Countermine mission area.  The program aims to improve existing technologies for: mine/UXO detection, technical survey/area reduction, mechanical mine/UXO clearance, vegetation clearance, mine neutralization, individual deminer protection, and post-clearance quality assurance (QA).  Evaluations of HD R&amp;D Program-developed technologies in actual minefields are conducted by host nation demining partners (foreign military, non-governmental organizations and mine action centers) and provide valuable data for US military countermine R&amp;D and next generation HD technology developments while directly contributing to world-wide mine and UXO clearance.  Since 1995 the program has fielded technologies for 139 evaluations in 36 countries, including Iraq and Afghanistan.  The program’s technologies have cleared 16+ million sq meters of the world’s toughest minefields; found or destroyed 80,000+ mines and UXO; and provided 267,000 mine/UXO disposal charges with 33 tons of explosive recovered from stockpiles and abandoned munitions in PACOM.

Under the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict (OASD SO/LIC), the HD R&amp;D Program works closely with the COCOMS and the Humanitarian Demining Training Center (HDTC) to support the Warfighter by developing and implementing mine/UXO detection and clearance technologies; speeding improvements to technologies used by U.S. forces in support of USG operations; reducing the threat to host nation population and US forces; reducing insurgent access to explosives (landmines and UXO); enhancing mine action capacity of non-governmental organizations and mine action centers in mine-affected countries; and providing engagement opportunities for DoD personnel in mine-affected countries.

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Current U.S. military strategy and the global security environment make coalition warfare and multinational operations fundamental features of the U.S. national security strategy.  Coalitions provide a broad base of technological, operational, and logistical support for military operations and ease the U.S. financial and manpower burdens associated with meeting military goals and objectives.  U.S. strategic guidance confirms that coalitions and relationships with international partners are high priorities for the nation and the Department of Defense.  

The Coalition Warfare Program (CWP) responds to this guidance while striving to deliver new and improved capabilities to the warfighter.  CWP provides seed funding to DoD organizations to conduct cooperative research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&amp;E) projects with foreign government partners.  It is the only Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) program dedicated to initiating cooperative RDT&amp;E projects with allied and partner nations.  CWP seed funding is leveraged against funding from other U.S. government sponsors and foreign partners.  In its twelve-year history, CWP has leveraged $3.1 of other U.S. funding for every $1 it has invested in cooperative projects and $4.4 of foreign partner funding for every $1 investment.  

CWP projects enable Project Teams to move a technology into the next stage of development or prepare for transition to operational forces.  These projects may also form the basis for future cooperation with our international partners.  CWP projects support DoD acquisition by helping program offices convert U.S.-only projects into coalition solutions for the U.S. warfighter, influencing coalition interoperability in major programs that will have far-reaching use by U.S. forces, addressing requirements of combined operations early in a program’s development cycle to avert risks to joint/coalition operations and avoid costs associated with adding requirements later in the acquisition process, enabling U.S. DoD access to leading-edge global technology, and providing significant cost savings to the DoD while maintaining a strong research and development base. </r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>(U) The purpose of this program is to develop a comprehensive capability to prevent and mitigate corrosion and its effects on Department of Defense (DoD) weapon systems and infrastructure.  Corrosion severely impacts system and facility reliability, readiness and safety, and consumes a disproportionate amount of material and labor hours for repair and treatment of corrosion damaged systems and facilities.  The cost of corrosion across the DoD has been estimated at over 23 billion each year. The impact and cost of corrosion are so pervasive that Congress enacted Public Law 107-314 Sec: 1067 [portions codified in 10 U.S.C. 2228]: Prevention and mitigation of corrosion of military infrastructure and equipment.  This legislation requires that DoD develop a long-term corrosion strategy to include establishment of a coordinated R&amp;D program with transition plans.  The legislation also requires that DoD designate a responsible official or organization to oversee a corrosion prevention and mitigation program.  The responsibilities of the Director, Corrosion Policy and Oversight and the Military Department Corrosion Prevention and Control Executives were further delineated in DODI 5000.67 "Prevention and Mitigation of Corrosion on Military Equipment and Infrastructure" of 01 February 2010.
 
(U) The Deputy Secretary of Defense designated the Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics) (PDUSD(AT&amp;L)) as the DoD Corrosion Executive in May 2003.  The DoD Corrosion Executive subsequently established a Corrosion Control and Oversight office to implement the program.  Subsequently, in accordance with Section 371 of the 2008 National Defense Authorization Act, the Under Secretary of Defense (USD(AT&amp;L)) designated a Director, Corrosion Policy and Oversight to perform the duties of the DoD Corrosion Executive with responsibilities as described in the 2008 NDAA legislation.  A major responsibility of the Director, Corrosion Policy and Oversight is to select high payoff research and development projects that promise to prevent or mitigate corrosion and significantly reduce the total cost of corrosion along with the adverse impact of corrosion effects on weapon system and infrastructure operational capability.  This office chartered a Corrosion Prevention and Control Integrated Product Team (CPCIPT) that has selected and funded Operation and Maintenance projects for each Fiscal Year (FY) commencing in FY 2005. However, the DoD CPCIPT has determined that the biggest payoff in corrosion prevention and mitigation will come from investing in up-front prevention technologies, materials, and processes to leverage downstream cost avoidance in corrosion maintenance and repair.  Likewise, development of improved predictive and prognostic techniques can eliminate unseen failure and reduce unnecessary maintenance and repair costs.  Thus, technology development, demonstration, and transition projects have been selected and funded since FY 2006.  In FY 2009, the Military Departments assigned corrosion executives and began submitting reports to Congress on inserting corrosion planning into the acquisition process. The FY 2011 NDAA added a requirement for the DoD to report the amount of funds requested in the preceding year budget for each planned project or activity, as compared to the funding required for each project or activity.  These funds provide a portion of the funds used to implement associated corrosion control projects and activities.
 
(U) The Corrosion Prevention Control Integrated Product Team membership consists of both the equipment and infrastructure corrosion control experts from the Services, the Joint Staff, the Coast Guard, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.  The Services are given project submission instructions, evaluation procedures and selection criteria.  The CPC project selection board, chaired by the Director, Corrosion Policy and Oversight, reviews the projects and makes recommendations to the USD(AT&amp;L) for final approval.

(U) The former DoD Corrosion Executive issued a policy letter that states: "Basic systems design, materials and processes selection, and intrinsic corrosion-prevention strategies establish the corrosion susceptibility of Defense material.  The early stages of acquisition provide our best opportunity to make effective trade-offs among the many competing design criteria. . ."  The Congress and former DoD Corrosion Executive made it clear that research and development into materials and methods to prevent or mitigate corrosion should receive high priority.  Since Congress has clearly established this program as one of its highest priorities, and has reiterated its expectations regarding funding levels and methods, our budget request is designed to reflect both fiscal realities of one or more on many proposed projects over the next five to ten years.
 
These projects address critical corrosion issues in both Department of Defense infrastructure as well as warfighting systems.  A number of low-risk, high-payoff technologies promise to vastly improve the service life and significantly reduce the maintenance costs of storage tanks and other mission support facilities essential to maintain support for the warfighter.  Each of the services has identified important projects that vastly increase operational readiness and reduce operations and maintenance costs.  All services are studying corrosion inhibitors that improve reliability and life of electrical and avionics equipment.  Likewise, an array of highly effective, rapid cure coatings that are easy to apply and can forestall corrosion for many years on aircraft and ships are being developed.  Other vital projects being considered include sealants, wash down systems, sensors and prognostic technologies that have joint service applications and potential to prevent and mitigate corrosion and its effects over a wide range of systems.  Funding for this program will provide a critically needed resource to trigger even larger investment and cost avoidance.

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>U) The purpose of this program is to develop a comprehensive capability to prevent and mitigate corrosion and its effects on Department of Defense (DoD) weapon systems and infrastructure.  Corrosion severely impacts system and facility reliability, readiness and safety, and consumes a disproportionate amount of material and labor hours for repair and treatment of corrosion damaged systems and facilities.  The cost of corrosion across the DoD has been estimated at over 23 billion each year. The impact and cost of corrosion are so pervasive that Congress enacted Public Law 107-314 Sec: 1067 [portions codified in 10 U.S.C. 2228]: Prevention and mitigation of corrosion of military infrastructure and equipment.  This legislation requires that DoD develop a long-term corrosion strategy to include establishment of a coordinated R&amp;D program with transition plans.  The legislation also requires that DoD designate a responsible official or organization to oversee a corrosion prevention and mitigation program.  The responsibilities of the Director, Corrosion Policy and Oversight and the Military Department Corrosion Prevention and Control Executives were further delineated in DODI 5000.67 "Prevention and Mitigation of Corrosion on Military Equipment and Infrastructure" of 01 February 2010.
 
(U) The Deputy Secretary of Defense designated the Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics) (PDUSD(AT&amp;L)) as the DoD Corrosion Executive in May 2003.  The DoD Corrosion Executive subsequently established a Corrosion Control and Oversight office to implement the program.  Subsequently, in accordance with Section 371 of the 2008 National Defense Authorization Act, the Under Secretary of Defense (USD(AT&amp;L)) designated a Director, Corrosion Policy and Oversight to perform the duties of the DoD Corrosion Executive with responsibilities as described in the 2008 NDAA legislation.  A major responsibility of the Director, Corrosion Policy and Oversight is to select high payoff research and development projects that promise to prevent or mitigate corrosion and significantly reduce the total cost of corrosion along with the adverse impact of corrosion effects on weapon system and infrastructure operational capability.  This office chartered a Corrosion Prevention and Control Integrated Product Team (CPCIPT) that has selected and funded Operation and Maintenance projects for each Fiscal Year (FY) commencing in FY 2005. However, the DoD CPCIPT has determined that the biggest payoff in corrosion prevention and mitigation will come from investing in up-front prevention technologies, materials, and processes to leverage downstream cost avoidance in corrosion maintenance and repair.  Likewise, development of improved predictive and prognostic techniques can eliminate unseen failure and reduce unnecessary maintenance and repair costs.  Thus, technology development, demonstration, and transition projects have been selected and funded since FY 2006.  In FY 2009, the Military Departments assigned corrosion executives and began submitting reports to Congress on inserting corrosion planning into the acquisition process. The FY 2011 NDAA added a requirement for the DoD to report the amount of funds requested in the preceding year budget for each planned project or activity, as compared to the funding required for each project or activity.  These funds provide a portion of the funds used to implement associated corrosion control projects and activities.
 
(U) The Corrosion Prevention Control Integrated Product Team membership consists of both the equipment and infrastructure corrosion control experts from the Services, the Joint Staff, the Coast Guard, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.  The Services are given project submission instructions, evaluation procedures and selection criteria.  The CPC project selection board, chaired by the Director, Corrosion Policy and Oversight, reviews the projects and makes recommendations to the USD(AT&amp;L) for final approval.

(U) The former DoD Corrosion Executive issued a policy letter that states: "Basic systems design, materials and processes selection, and intrinsic corrosion-prevention strategies establish the corrosion susceptibility of Defense material.  The early stages of acquisition provide our best opportunity to make effective trade-offs among the many competing design criteria. . ."  The Congress and former DoD Corrosion Executive made it clear that research and development into materials and methods to prevent or mitigate corrosion should receive high priority.  Since Congress has clearly established this program as one of its highest priorities, and has reiterated its expectations regarding funding levels and methods, our budget request is designed to reflect both fiscal realities of one or more on many proposed projects over the next five to ten years.
 
These projects address critical corrosion issues in both Department of Defense infrastructure as well as warfighting systems.  A number of low-risk, high-payoff technologies promise to vastly improve the service life and significantly reduce the maintenance costs of storage tanks and other mission support facilities essential to maintain support for the warfighter.  Each of the services has identified important projects that vastly increase operational readiness and reduce operations and maintenance costs.  All services are studying corrosion inhibitors that improve reliability and life of electrical and avionics equipment.  Likewise, an array of highly effective, rapid cure coatings that are easy to apply and can forestall corrosion for many years on aircraft and ships are being developed.  Other vital projects being considered include sealants, wash down systems, sensors and prognostic technologies that have joint service applications and potential to prevent and mitigate corrosion and its effects over a wide range of systems.  The FY 2012 budget request will provide a critically needed resource to trigger even larger investment and cost avoidance.

                                                <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>There is an annual Corrosion Prevention and Control Integrated Project Team (CPCIPT) call for proposed project plans in April.  Projects are submitted by the Services annually in June.  The project plan format is contained in the DoD Corrosion Prevention and Mitigation Strategic Plan.  Each project plan contains:   
1. Problem statement:  Description of the problem or situation, including background, history, issues, operational problems and support costs.   
2. Impact statement:  Details regarding why project is important including description of the operational and/or logistic impact if no action is taken.   
3. Technical description:  Definition of the corrosion prevention and control objective and description of the system affected by this project; applicable technologies and associated development; expected operations and logistics performance improvement characteristics; brief description of the user community and how it will apply to their mission; and current acquisition status.    
4. Risk analysis:  Description of the risk in managing/developing/prototyping/ testing/qualifying/manufacturing/completing the technical effort including assumptions that could affect project development or implementation.   
5. Proposed phases:  If project is complex and will be performed in phases, description of each phase objective.   
6. Expected deliverables and results or outcomes:  Description of products to be delivered such as type/number of hardware, technical orders/drawings, installation, training, etc.; and description of expected operations and/or logistics performance improvements.   
7. Program management:  Description of the overall approach and tasks to be taken to accomplish the project, including organization, coordination and acquisition approach.   
8. Cost/benefit analysis:  Definition of all resources necessary to accomplish project, description of resulting benefits, computation of Return-On-Investment (ROI), documentation of mission criticality, and description of joint applicability.   
9. Schedule:  Milestone chart showing all significant events through project completion.   
10. Implementation plan:  Explanation of how the project will be implemented when completed including a description of the transition approach, and plans to evaluate ROI during the first two years of implementation.   
   
The Corrosion Prevention and Control Integrated Project Team (CPCIPT) receives project plans and engages an evaluation panel to review proposed projects and make recommendations regarding project selection.  Projects are also evaluated using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to rank projects by relative efficiency.  DEA factors include project performance period, ratio of OSD funding to Service funding, return-on-investment (ROI), degree to which the proposed technology addresses high-cost corrosion problems, potential benefits, and joint service applicability.  DEA efficiency scores are provided to the evaluation team to assist in their prioritization of projects for funding.  In addition, evaluators consider the following in recommending final priorities:
1. Return on investment credibility: Degree to which there is evidence that the project will achieve an acceptable return on investment
2. Technology maturity:  Degree to which proposed technology has been developed or demonstrated and will satisfy project objectives 
3. Schedule confidence:  Degree to which the project is likely to be completed on time
4. Budget confidence:  Degree to which the project is likely to be completed within the proposed budget
5. Management support: Degree to which management actively supports this project and has committed program resources to both manage and support this project
The project priority ranking is finalized and sent to the CPCIPT lead for a final decision..  Upon acceptance and approval of the projects by the CPCIPT, the projects are briefed to the Corrosion Forum.  Funding is distributed between the Services based on funding priorities associated with the evaluation process results.     
   
Upon selection by CPCIPT of the highest priority projects and final funding approval, Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) transfers individual project funding to the appropriate funding sites that are provided by the Services.  After receiving the project funding, the Services are responsible for the funding and management of the projects.  OSD retains oversight and direction of the Corrosion Prevention and Control initiative through the CPCIPT.  Project oversight includes the review of quarterly status reports which address progress summary, performance goals and metrics and upcoming key events, as well as reports to periodic Corrosion Forums.   
   
The quarterly project report (PR) format has been defined and requires the following input:   
1. Statement of progress 
2. Outstanding issues 
3. Performance goals and metrics 
4. Upcoming events
5. Schedule status 
6. Current return on investment (ROI) status 
These project reports (PRs) are submitted to the CPCIPT.  The CPCIPT analyzes project status, progress and project statistics and informs the Service points of contact (POCs) of any project problems.  Projects are also required to report verbally at Corrosion Forums, as appropriate.   
   
Corrosion Prevention and Control (CPC) Program direction, control and oversight include the following activities to be performed by staff and support contractors:   
1. Plan and schedule Corrosion Forums and oversee Corrosion Forum activities and working Integrated Product Team (IPT) meetings.   
2. Oversee project performance including review of quarterly status reports which address progress summary, performance goals and metrics and upcoming key events, as well as reports to periodic Corrosion Forums.   
3. Perform Department of Defense (DoD) cost of corrosion study.   
4. Develop improved, standard DoD-wide specifications, standards and qualification processes.   
5. Develop corrosion training courses.   
6. Prepare and publish Corrosion Prevention and Control Planning Guidebook spirals.   
7. Prepare and publish annual Reports to Congress. 
8. Update short-term and long-term metrics.   
9. Develop corrosion control program management guide for selecting materials.   
10. Develop, implement, and update the DoD Corrosion Prevention and Mitigation Strategic Plan.   
11. Develop and maintain Roadmaps of IPT activities and accomplishments.   
12. Assist in the annual project plan implementation and evaluation process, including the assessment of return on investment associated with proposed projects. 
13. Respond to Congressional, Government Accountability Office and DoD inquiries regarding the CPC Program. 
14. Perform CPC Program communication and outreach to services, agencies and other organizations. 
15.  Develop and implement corrosion prevention and control policies applicable for acquisition and sustainment of both weapons systems and infrastructure.
16.  Perform reviews of major programs to ensure they are in compliance with corrosion prevention and control policy.
17.  Provide oversight of the corrosion programs of the Military Departments and Chair the DoD Corrosion Board of Directors (which includes the Corrosion Control and Prevention Executives from each of the Military Departments).
18.  Interact with industry, technical societies, trade associations, government personnel, and foreign allies to identify promising corrosion control technologies and assist in technology transition and insertion

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Strategic Capabilities Office (SCO) was created to identify, analyze, and accelerate capabilities to counter strategic adversaries and improve the United States posture for engaging future threats.  A distributed enterprise amongst Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD), Combatant Commands (COCOMs), and the Intelligence Community (IC), SCO uniquely blends technology and concepts of operations to develop a full spectrum of innovative capabilities.  Those meriting acceleration are worked as joint projects with the Services to speed transition time for rapid fielding.  SCO breaks up objectives from Commanders' intent into specific projects inside a strategic plan. 

As part of its mission, SCO examines alternative strategies, such as:  (1) explores multi-domain solutions (including cross-DoD/IC capabilities); (2) builds partnerships across national security divides; (3) analyzes cost effectiveness, risk, and performance; (4) develops prototypes to accelerate capabilities; and (5) increases the operational options available to senior leadership.

Under this new start program, SCO will develop new strategic capabilities that provides options for the Department of Defense’s (DoD) operational priorities.  New strategic capabilities will be composed of existing and advanced technologies and systems, with special emphasis on innovative and architecture-level concepts.  The PE supports development, studies, analysis, and demonstration of integrated concepts and prototypes, analysis in support of ongoing efforts to shape and counter emerging threats, cross-Service and cross-Defense/Intelligence concepts, and red-teaming.  Projects will focus on proving component and subsystem maturity prior to integration in major systems and may involve risk reduction initiatives.  Specific applications and plans are available at a higher classification level.    </r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                        <r2:Description>Existing Navy Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Railgun program leveraged into Land Based Rail Gun (LBRG) experiment.  It will demonstrate a cost effective land base defense solution using prototype ground-launched Railgun projectiles.  The experiment focus is on close-the-loop between sensor and the Railgun projectile.   Step-by-step development by the integration of critical Railgun weapon capabilities will be initiated.   LBRG will integrate the Railgun launcher, power, projectile and sensor to demonstrate capability with a series of seven flight tests.  It will also verify lethality modeling and simulation through experimentation.  The tests will  demonstrate projectile fly-out and control; sensor tracking of projectiles, communication from sensor to projectile, integrated guidance, navigation and control (GNC).  FY 2015 experiment culminates in a track and a command link event from a 20 Mega Joule (MJ) Railgun located at Wallops Island test range. </r2:Description>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The level of resourcing for the Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Common Development program reflects iterative reductions from efficiencies and budget reductions, which reduces the Department's ability to develop flexible responsive solutions to emerging war fighter needs. The Department of Defense (DOD) UAS Common Development is a joint effort to develop and demonstrate common standards, architectures, and technologies that address UAS-specific issues across all Military Services.  The intent is to increase interoperability and effectiveness by promoting cooperative development of solutions that are applicable across major classes of UAS.  This effort will initially focus on addressing DOD UAS integration into the National Airspace System (NAS) and demonstration of a common, interoperable ground station architecture and associated interface standards.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Global Hawk (GH) and the Triton, as well as other Group 3-5 UAS, need a sense-and-avoid (SAA) capability as an alternate means of compliance to Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 91.111 and Part 91.113, requirement to see-and-avoid other aircraft.  The Global Hawk was selected as the as the flagship platform for Airborne Sense and Avoid (ABSAA). The MQ-4C Triton, MQ-1B Predator, MQ-1C Gray Eagle, and MQ-9 Reaper have similar requirements for SAA capability; their SAA technology development will leverage the Common-ABSAA technology. Development of a Ground Based Sense-and-Avoid (GBSAA) system using existing technology can provide a near-term solution for improved airspace access, both for terminal operations (e.g., Beale AFB, GH transit to/from controlled airspace) and for operations/training within the GBSAA system's coverage area (e.g., Gray Eagle at El Mirage, Shadow operations at Cherry Point).
 
Provides joint funding to support development of standards, modeling and simulation tools, and technology to enable DoD UAS to routinely access the national and international airspace systems.

The ABSAA design includes an integrated suite of sensors, decision logic algorithms, data recording, pilot displays, and prognostics &amp; health management (P&amp;HM) necessary to manage collision risk to an acceptable level of safety across the expected range of operational scenarios and mission environments for Global Hawk and other Group 3-5 UAS. 
  
Standards Development - Updated MIL-HDBK-516 for UAS airworthiness (100% complete on criteria, 70% complete on standards, 35% complete on methods of compliance)for both fixed and rotary wing UAS.  Developed a proposed methodology for conducting a system safety assessment to calculate the accepted risk for operating UAS within the National Airspace System.  Through a series of workshops captured Services’ UAS airspace integration lessons learned. Coordinated performance requirements and safety guidelines within appropriate standards development organizations (SDOs). Developed UAS Airspace Integration (AI) Use Cases based upon the current AI CONOPs and operational assessments of current and planned UAS AI Terminal Area and Lateral Transit operations.  Developed an Operational Capability Tracking Tool for assessing progress of the airspace integration activities needed to support a predefined set of UAS operational capabilities. 

Modeling &amp; Simulation (M&amp;S) - Provided modeling, simulation and analysis (MS&amp;A) to the FY2012 requirements and standards efforts, as well as the safety analysis activities.  Completed development of a Common Intruder Database, with representative radar cross section models. Developed a deterministic tool for evaluating sense and avoid algorithms and CONOPS.

GBSAA – The Army completed development of system level requirements for their GBSAA system.  The GBSAA IPT used these requirements as a starting point and with Service participation focused on development and demonstration of a common set of requirements for a universal GBSAA solution.  The collaborative effort included a workshop to identify commonalities among the Services’ processes for Software Certification for Airworthiness.  The Army continued development of GBSAA technology and demonstrated their Phase 1 and 2 GBSAA systems in June 2012 utilizing the Army Test Bed at Dugway Proving Grounds.

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The OSD HSCB Modeling Program is a vertically integrated effort to research, develop, and transition technologies, tools, and systems to programs of record and users in need.  The Program exists to optimize U.S. forces’ ability to perform population-centric sensing, understand behaviors driven by social and cultural variables, and select effective courses of action in the full range of military operations.  Program research will enhance population-centric intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities for understanding the increasingly complex global environment to address national strategic challenges such as instability, aggression, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and violent extremism.  In three integrated program elements (PEs), the Program will conduct applied research, mature and demonstrate advanced technology, and develop transitionable methods, technology, tools, and prototypes.  Work under PE 0604670D8Z will create transition ready software tools that will help intelligence analysts, operations analysts, operations planners, wargamers, and others represent, understand, and forecast sociocultural behavior at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels.  This program focuses on maturing, hardening, and validating human, social, culture, and behavior modeling software for transition to meet the needs of the warfighter, integration into the architectures of existing programs of record, and/or maturing software via open architectures to allow broad systems integration.  The Program provides a development to product transition pathway for sociocultural models, tools, and capabilities to rapidly meet immediate and emerging warfighter needs.  The work supports the testing, validation, and transition of model-based technology into existing and developing systems in coordination with Program Executive Offices/Program Managers, Combatant Commanders, Joint and Service organizations, warfighters in need, and other transition customers.  The Program will mature sociocultural relevant data and tools to provide essential sociocultural understanding and forecasting capabilities at the strategic, operational and tactical levels.  </r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Program will create transition-ready software tools that will help intelligence analysts, operations analysts, operations planners, wargamers, and others represent, understand, and forecast sociocultural behavior at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels.  The Program focuses on maturing, hardening, and validating human, social, culture, and behavior modeling software for transition to meet the needs of the warfighter, integration into the architectures of existing programs of record, and/or maturing software via open architectures to allow broad systems integration.  The Program provides a development to product transition pathway for sociocultural models, tools, and capabilities to rapidly meet immediate and emerging warfighter needs.  The work supports the testing, validation, and transition of model-based technology into existing and developing systems in coordination with Program Executive Offices/Program Managers, Combatant Commanders, Joint and Service organizations, warfighters in need, and other transition customers.  The Program will mature sociocultural relevant data and tools to provide essential forecasting capabilities at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels. </r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Joint Systems Integration Command Program Element (JSIC PE) provides mission funding for the Joint System Integration Center (JSIC) to conduct interoperability assessments, and develop solutions/recommendations to improve integration of Service, Defense Agency, and coalition systems. JSIC promotes Service/Defense Agency C2 capability integration, and conducts technical, operational, and DOTMLPF assessments of Command and Control (C2) and Command, Control, Computer, Communication, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) capabilities.  JSIC serves as the technical analysis and operational assessment activity in support of the Joint Staff capability-driven requirements process, the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS).  JSIC also serves as a joint interoperability compliance activity for the milestone decision authorities/program managers in the Defense acquisition enterprise.

The FY 2005 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) directed the transfer for Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) funding for joint warfare experimentation and training programs from Navy accounts to new Defense Wide RDT&amp;E accounts beginning in FY 2007.  Joint Staff J8 is the executive agent for the JSIC PE and Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD (R&amp;E)) provides execution oversight.

JSIC provides Combatant Commands, at the joint force headquarters level, with a laboratory and assessment environment for the warfighter and capability developer.  This environment provides for assessment of current and near-term joint and coalition capabilities primarily at the operational and tactical levels. JSIC's Persistent Command and Control (C2) Environment accurately replicates an operational C2 environment. With this capability, JSIC assesses system of systems interoperability, operational capability, procedural compliance and technical suitability of emerging and existing systems and programs to confirm readiness for deployment.  Through JSIC's analysis and assessment, systems are evaluated for "value-added" prior to employment in joint and coalition environments typical of deployed theaters of operation.  

By establishing ground truth for interoperability and suggesting remedies for demonstrated shortfalls, JSIC is an enabler for interoperable joint and coalition solutions and provides a means to foster rapid, near-term insertion of C4ISR technology by promoting the ability to meet the DoD direction for spiral development and evolutionary acquisition.  JSIC's mission is to provide for the fielding of warfighter C2 systems through rapid systems integration, technical assessment, and operational evaluation using laboratory environments and field venues.  In the world of C2 and ISR interoperability, performance in the field is the bottom line. In terms of investment, JSIC is the "ounce of prevention" that precludes a "pound" of mission failure and loss of life due to interoperability failures in military operations.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                        <r2:Description>Primary Outcome (objective) for this effort is to provide objective based assessment of  Doctrine, Organizational, Training, Materiel, Leadership, Personnel, Facilities (DOTMLPF) solution sets supporting the Joint Task Force Commander.  JSIC will analyze COCOM near-term requirements using DOTMLPF criteria.  JSIC will identify current, emerging, or mature technologies to address materiel requirements.  Comprehensive assessments covering joint maturity, interoperability, warfighter utility, and operational effectiveness will be conducted on legacy and transformational projects.  JSIC will provide DOTMLPF recommendations on fielding strategies for Joint Staff endorsement.

The primary outputs and efficiencies realized are: 1) Increased number of recommended improvements that enhance the capability of Joint Task Force Headquarters (JTF HQ); 2) Increased number of verifiable capability solutions recommended for fielding to the Combatant Commander based on quantified capability improvements; 3) Increased empirical data to support benefit-cost ratio improvements of JTF HQ investment decisions to ensure JTF HQs command and control (C2) capabilities are interoperable from technical and operational standpoints; 4) Increased number of assessments conducted that identify current force JTF HQs C2 systems that are interoperable and supported, that inform and recommend solutions to integrate, modify, or retire current force systems; 5) Increased number of assessment based recommendations of technology solutions that address the military utility of proposed and existing Service solutions; and  6) Increased number of solutions deployed with recognized DOTMLPF impacts.

Program Management offices benefit because the JSIC program provides a venue for Military Utility Assessments (MUAs) of technologies before committing to implementation.  The potential savings associated with finding existing commercial technologies to provide gap filler solutions, and avoid the fielding of systems that are not interoperable or that fail to meet warfighter needs, are difficult to quantify.  Potentially life-threatening shortfalls are identified and fixed in advance of fielding.  Services benefit directly by reduced Program Manager costs and by fielding systems that are interoperable and meet warfighter needs.

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The JDAT mission is to employ scientific methods to research, investigate, test, assess, and evaluate current and emergent Joint command and control (C2) information systems and associated procedures. These activities measure capabilities and limitations, identify shortfalls and root cause, recommend and verify solutions, and validate joint capabilities. The resultant empirical outcomes influence Joint Capability development in areas such as Policy; Joint Doctrine; Tactics, Techniques and Procedures; integration of capabilities; and digital interoperability. JDAT provides decision-quality data and cogent solutions to customers and stakeholders responsible for improving Joint C2 information systems integration and interoperability to inform acquisition decisions and ensure that Services and Agencies field interdependent and interoperable systems.

The emphasis of JDAT assessment efforts is the evaluation of C2 Information Systems and Procedures to provide Services and Agencies findings and recommendations based on quantifiable data in order to improve Joint C2 integration and interoperability. JDAT collects and analyzes data and provides observations, findings, conclusions, and recommendations to identify policy; Joint doctrine; tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP); and material solutions and products that promote capability improvement. Evaluations range from small, single-focus events to large, multi-event/venue exercises.

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The JDAT mission is to employ scientific methods to research, investigate, test, assess, and evaluate current and emergent Joint command and control (C2) information systems and associated procedures. These activities measure capabilities and limitations, identify shortfalls and root cause, recommend and verify solutions, and validate joint capabilities. The resultant empirical outcomes influence Joint Capability development in areas such as Policy; Joint Doctrine; Tactics, Techniques and Procedures; integration of capabilities; and digital interoperability. JDAT provides decision-quality data and cogent solutions to customers and stakeholders responsible for improving Joint C2 information systems integration and interoperability to inform acquisition decisions and ensure that Services and Agencies field interdependent and interoperable systems.

The emphasis of JDAT assessment efforts is the evaluation of C2 Information Systems and Procedures to provide Services and Agencies findings and recommendations based on quantifiable data in order to improve Joint C2 integration and interoperability. JDAT collects and analyzes data and provides observations, findings, conclusions, and recommendations to identify policy; Joint doctrine; tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP); and material solutions and products that promote capability improvement. Evaluations range from small, single-focus events to large, multi-event/venue exercises.

DACP funds the test and evaluation of technologies and products with potential to improve performance, affordability, manufacturability, or operational capability of current acquisition programs at the subcomponent, component, or system level.
 
Since the program inception in FY 2003, Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD) has initiated 176 projects; 117 projects have been completed to date; 83 met Service or Agency testing requirements, and 61 led to procurements with technology currently in use by our warfighters in Iraq, Afghanistan, or at U.S. training facilities.  Given the program tests developed equipment, Service and United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) program managers report that the average Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) and Operations and Support (O&amp;S) non-recurring cost avoidance is at least 5-to-1.

The DACP provides the DoD an efficiency that is not generally recognized.  With centralized DACP funding in OSD, funding can be readily moved among the Services and USSOCOM to take advantage of emerging opportunities and fund joint projects.

DACP increases opportunities for domestic vendors to enter the DoD acquisition process.  Although business size is not an evaluation criterion, approximately 60 percent of the projects awarded are with technology providers at the small or mid-sized enterprise level.  DACP has the additional DoD/National Security benefit of expanding the industrial base for Defense acquisition.

The Wireless Aquatic Telemetry Exfiltration Radio Bottles (WATER Bottles) are released from a submerged UUV, float to the surface, and transmit critical sensor data via satellite communications to operator stations and surface ships.  This project combines two Small Business Innovation Research Phase III concepts (launching system and relay device), integrates them onto a MK 18 UUV, and tests the system in an operationally representative environment. Successfully implementing this capability will reduce the Navy’s Mine Warfare tactical timeline, expedite the delivery of mine detection data, allow the UUV to remain on task, and enable operators to locate disabled UUVs.</r2:Description>

The project challenges the Navy’s traditional deployment of software applications by adopting a widely accepted commercial application marketplace.  This marketplace will initially be hosted on aircraft carriers and will allow users on board any ship within a carrier strike group to discover and access the latest tactical widgets, applications, and services in a disconnected, intermittent or limited bandwidth communications environment. Successfully implementing the Tactical Cloud Market Place will provide the Navy a framework for rapid capability deployment at a significantly reduced cost.</r2:Description>

The title of this objective is "Maintain a strong technical foundation within the Department's Science and Technology program" and the metrics for this objective is to transition 40 percent of completing demonstration programs per year.  From program inception in 2003 until 2012, the Office of Secretary of Defense has initiated 176 projects; 117 projects have been completed to date; 74 met Service or Agency testing requirements and 61 led to procurements with technology currently in use by our war-fighters in Iraq, Afghanistan, or at U.S. training facilities.  The FY 2012 DACP projects have a transition rate of approximately 83 percent for completed projects, exceeding the objective of 40 percent.  In FY 2013, we anticipate the majority of our FY 2012 projects to complete successfully and transition to the war-fighter.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) addresses the need to defend and deter against weapons of mass destruction (WMD) threats and to safeguard personnel; prevent unauthorized access to equipment, installations, material, and documents; and to safeguard the foregoing against espionage, sabotage, damage, and theft.  This program oversees advanced engineering development throughout DoD for an integrated and systemic RDT&amp;E approach for countering nuclear threats and nuclear and conventional physical security technology and systems.  The funding has been centralized in this Defense-wide PE since the early 1990s and represents a substantial portion of all DoD physical security RDT&amp;E funding.  Priorities for this PE RDT&amp;E efforts are driven by inputs from Quadrennial Defense Review guidance, Combatant Command and Service requirements, analysis reports such as “Protecting the Force:  Lessons from Fort Hood,” January 2010, the Integrated Unit, Base, and Installation Protection Cost Benefits Analysis, Multi-national Work Plans established through the Nuclear Security Summit process, and DoD Directive 5210.41, Security Policy for Protecting Nuclear Weapons-directed requirements and associated security deviation reports.  

Under this integrated approach, funds are used to provide system development and demonstration for the Department in seven capability areas:  (1) Detection and Assessment; (2) Access Controls; (3) Installation and Transport Security; (4) Storage and Safeguards; (5) Prevention; (6) Decision Support Systems; and (7) Analytical Support. The program will develop systems that are producible, supportable, and affordable and to demonstrate system integration, interoperability, and utility prior to full-rate production.  The projects under the PE become technology insertions into existing programs or advance to being a certified Commercial/Government off-the-shelf product.  The PE initiatives are coordinated by the Physical Security Enterprise and Analysis Group.  This group is responsible for avoiding duplication of effort and when applicable ensure systems integration and promote interoperability and sustainability.  

This PE can fund travel to support the requirements of this program.

This appropriation will finance work, including manpower, performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant
arrangement with the government who conduct research (systematic study directed toward fuller scientific knowledge or understanding of the subject studied), 
development (systematic use of the knowledge and understanding gained from research, for the production of useful materials, devices, systems, or methods, including the design and development of prototypes and processes) and test and evaluation efforts.

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) addresses the need to defend and deter against weapons of mass destruction (WMD) threats and to safeguard personnel; prevent unauthorized access to equipment, installations, material, and documents; and to safeguard the foregoing against espionage, sabotage, damage, and theft.  This program oversees advanced engineering development throughout DoD for an integrated and systemic RDT&amp;E approach for countering nuclear threats and nuclear and conventional physical security technology and systems.  The funding has been centralized in this Defense-wide PE since the early 1990s and represents a substantial portion of all DoD physical security RDT&amp;E funding.  Priorities for this PE RDT&amp;E efforts are driven by inputs from Quadrennial Defense Review guidance, Combatant Command and Service requirements, analysis reports such as “Protecting the Force:  Lessons from Fort Hood,” January 2010, the Integrated Unit, Base, and Installation Protection Cost Benefits Analysis, Multi-national Work Plans established through the Nuclear Security Summit process, and DoD Directive 5210.41, Security Policy for Protecting Nuclear Weapons-directed requirements and associated security deviation reports.  

Under this integrated approach, funds are used to provide system development and demonstration for the Department in seven capability areas:  (1) Detection and Assessment; (2) Access Controls; (3) Installation and Transport Security; (4) Storage and Safeguards; (5) Prevention; (6) Decision Support Systems; and (7) Analytical Support. The program will develop systems that are producible, supportable, and affordable and to demonstrate system integration, interoperability, and utility prior to full-rate production.  The projects under the PE become technology insertions into existing programs or advance to being a certified Commercial/Government off-the-shelf product.  The PE initiatives are coordinated by the Physical Security Enterprise and Analysis Group.  This group is responsible for avoiding duplication of effort and when applicable ensure systems integration and promote interoperability and sustainability.  

This PE can fund travel to support the requirements of this program.

This appropriation will finance work, including manpower, performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant
arrangement with the government who conduct research (systematic study directed toward fuller scientific knowledge or understanding of the subject studied), 
development (systematic use of the knowledge and understanding gained from research, for the production of useful materials, devices, systems, or methods, including the design and development of prototypes and processes) and test and evaluation efforts.

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The level of resourcing for the Prompt Global Strike Capability Development program reflects iterative reductions from efficiencies and budget reductions, which reduces the Department's ability to develop flexible responsive solutions to emerging war fighter needs.  This Program Element (PE) was established to develop and demonstrate technologies and applications that advance conventional prompt global strike (CPGS) warfighting capabilities. The program uses a national team with coordination between the Services, Agencies and national research laboratories to pursue integrated portfolio objectives leading to the acquisition and operation of a CPGS system.  This program funds the design, development, and experimentation of boosters, payload delivery vehicles (PDVs), non-nuclear warheads, guidance systems, and mission planning and enabling capabilities. Program timing will be driven by the outcome of flight test events and DoD budgets.  To support these development activities, the program procures modeling and simulation capabilities, command and control interfaces, test range support, and launch system infrastructure.  Additionally, expert resources address strategic policy and treaty issues. Program emphasis is on demonstrating component and subsystem technology maturity with risk reduction initiatives.  In FY 2013 and FY 2014, funding for the individual service initiatives has and will be contingent upon their abilities to execute and achieve satisfactory progress towards project goals as determined by the CPGS portfolio manager.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) was established to develop and demonstrate technologies and applications that advance conventional prompt global strike (CPGS) warfighting capabilities. The program uses a national team with coordination between the Services, Agencies and national research laboratories to pursue integrated portfolio objectives leading to the acquisition and operation of a CPGS system.  This program funds the design, development, and experimentation of boosters, payload delivery vehicles (PDVs), non-nuclear warheads, guidance systems, and mission planning and enabling capabilities. Program timing will be driven by the outcome of flight test events and DoD budgets.  To support these development activities, the program procures modeling and simulation capabilities, command and control interfaces, test range support, and launch system infrastructure.  Additionally, expert resources address strategic policy and treaty issues. Program emphasis is on demonstrating component and subsystem technology maturity with risk reduction initiatives.  In FY 2013 and FY 2014, funding for the individual service initiatives has and will be contingent upon their abilities to execute and achieve satisfactory progress towards project goals as determined by the CPGS portfolio manager.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                        <r2:Description>This sub-project develops technologies and applications that could lead to a system with the following characteristics: effects on targets in a very short-period of time from execution order; non-ballistic flight over the majority of the flight path; positive control from launch to impact; adequate cross-range/ maneuverability to avoid overflight issues; controlled stage drop over Broad Ocean Area (BOA), and  provides for in-flight target updates.  The technologies developed will have cross-service and cross-concept applicability and will be developed through close coordination among DoD components. This activity will support both ground and flight tests, and provide all national data to the competitive acquisition program.

The objectives of this sub-project are to: 
- Assess boost-glide technologies in light of ground and flight test events and associated modeling and simulation.
-Analyze the military utility of multiple, 3-axis stabilized vehicles performance with respect to thermal protection materials, aerodynamics and control surfaces, navigation, guidance, control (NG&amp;C), boosters and weapons performance.
-Assess the feasibility of producing an affordable solution to fill the CPGS capability gap.
-Continue systems definition/engineering/development of integrated weaponized payload delivery vehicles and subsystems in order to identify and reduce risks and mature technologies for a global range competitive acquisition program.

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) was established to develop and demonstrate technologies and applications that advance conventional prompt global strike (CPGS) warfighting capabilities. The program uses a national team with coordination between the Services, Agencies and national research laboratories to pursue integrated portfolio objectives leading to the acquisition and operation of a CPGS system.  This program funds the design, development, and experimentation of boosters, payload delivery vehicles (PDVs), non-nuclear warheads, guidance systems, and mission planning and enabling capabilities. Program timing will be driven by the outcome of flight test events and DoD budgets.  To support these development activities, the program procures modeling and simulation capabilities, command and control interfaces, test range support, and launch system infrastructure.  Additionally, expert resources address strategic policy and treaty issues. Program emphasis is on demonstrating component and subsystem technology maturity with risk reduction initiatives.  In FY 2013 and FY 2014, funding for the individual service initiatives has and will be contingent upon their abilities to execute and achieve satisfactory progress towards project goals as determined by the CPGS portfolio manager.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

It will mature technologies that could lead to advanced systems with the following characteristics: effects on targets in a very short-period of time from execution order; non-ballistic flight over the majority of the flight path; positive control from launch to impact; adequate cross-range/maneuverability to avoid over flight issues; and controlled stage drop over BOA.  The technologies developed will have cross-service and cross-concept applicability and will be developed through close coordination among DoD components.  This activity will support both ground and flight tests, and provide all national data to the competitive acquisition program.</r2:Description>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) was established to develop and demonstrate technologies and applications that advance conventional prompt global strike (CPGS) warfighting capabilities. The program uses a national team with coordination between the Services, Agencies and national research laboratories to pursue integrated portfolio objectives leading to the acquisition and operation of a CPGS system.  This program funds the design, development, and experimentation of boosters, payload delivery vehicles (PDVs), non-nuclear warheads, guidance systems, and mission planning and enabling capabilities. Program timing will be driven by the outcome of flight test events and DoD budgets.  To support these development activities, the program procures modeling and simulation capabilities, command and control interfaces, test range support, and launch system infrastructure.  Additionally, expert resources address strategic policy and treaty issues. Program emphasis is on demonstrating component and subsystem technology maturity with risk reduction initiatives.  In FY 2013 and FY 2014, funding for the individual service initiatives has and will be contingent upon their abilities to execute and achieve satisfactory progress towards project goals as determined by the CPGS portfolio manager.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) was established to develop and demonstrate technologies and applications that advance conventional prompt global strike (CPGS) warfighting capabilities. The program uses a national team with coordination between the Services, Agencies and national research laboratories to pursue integrated portfolio objectives leading to the acquisition and operation of a CPGS system.  This program funds the design, development, and experimentation of boosters, payload delivery vehicles (PDVs), non-nuclear warheads, guidance systems, and mission planning and enabling capabilities. Program timing will be driven by the outcome of flight test events and DoD budgets.  To support these development activities, the program procures modeling and simulation capabilities, command and control interfaces, test range support, and launch system infrastructure.  Additionally, expert resources address strategic policy and treaty issues. Program emphasis is on demonstrating component and subsystem technology maturity with risk reduction initiatives.  In FY 2013 and FY 2014, funding for the individual service initiatives has and will be contingent upon their abilities to execute and achieve satisfactory progress towards project goals as determined by the CPGS portfolio manager.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>(U) This Program Element (PE) was established in response to Congressional guidance to consolidate DOD robotic programs on unmanned ground systems and related robotic technologies in order to increase focus of the Services' robotic programs on operational requirements.  Technologies in the PE support the continued development of technologies in Budget Activity 3 and 4 (PEs 0603711D8Z and 0603709D8Z) for technology transitions and transformations and closing war fighter requirement capability gaps. By exercising its oversight role through a technology advisory board, O-6 Council and Senior Steering Group (Flag level), Joint Ground Robotics applies this PE to enable coordination between the Services and places emphasis on interoperability and commonality among unmanned ground systems. This PE supports the effort to overcome technology barriers in thrust areas of unmanned ground system technologies to include Autonomous &amp; Tactical Behaviors, Manipulation Technologies, Collaborative Operations, Interoperability, Man-portable Unmanned Ground System Technologies, and Technology Transition/Transformation.  The purpose is to further the development and fielding of affordable and effective mobile ground robotic systems, develop and transition technologies necessary to meet evolving user requirements, and serve as a catalyst for insertion of robotic systems and technologies into the force structure.  Through application of funds against the thrust areas of unmanned ground system technologies, this PE supports the integration of technologies into representative models or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment and expedites technology transition from the laboratory to operational use. Emphasis is on proving component and subsystem maturity prior to integration in major and complex systems and may involve risk reduction initiatives. Within this PE, funded efforts will continue the delivery of advanced technology needs directed at enhancing the war fighters' capabilities identified during concept development, operational assessments and field feedback of current unmanned systems.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The level of resourcing for the Joint Tactical Information Distribution System (JTIDS) program reflects iterative reductions from efficiencies and budget reductions, which reduces the Department's ability to develop flexible responsive solutions to emerging war fighter needs. 

The Common Joint Tactical Information funding line responds to the Department's requirement for joint and combined network-enabled tactical data link (TDL) capabilities and for communications which meet net-centric standards to ensure interoperability and seamless integration with joint communication systems. It will be used to assess and promote competition across TDLs DoD-wide and to provide acquisition oversight of TDL-related activities such as CDL waveforms, Joint Aerial Layer Network (JALN) narrowband TDL gateways, Multifunction Advanced Data Link (MADL) and datalink roadmaps to guide future investments. This funding line provides resources for acquisition support and management oversight of critical command, control, communications (C3) and non-intelligence space capabilities as the Department migrates to netcentric operations. Funds will be used to provide technical, systems engineering and acquisition management oversight of programs, projects and activities to maximize the Department’s return on investment in information technology resources and to effect a comprehensive approach for assessing and procuring critical information systems from initial design, through development to capability delivery in support of improved weapons systems performance and military operations. Resources will be allocated for architecture design and development, portfolio management, enterprise-wide systems engineering and operational impact analyses related to C3 and non-intelligence space systems. They will also be used to provide expertise required for exercising technical direction over design, performance and cost parameters of key systems and their dependencies. The goal of this funding is to eliminate redundancy, reduce time to the field, evaluate projects and concepts for adherence to net-centric guidelines, minimize performance and operational risk of developing and fielding complex major systems which rely on networks and supporting applications, ensure program dependencies are documented and included in acquisition decisions and address interoperability requirements, gaps and best value technical solutions. Typical deliverables associated with the instantiation of net-centric capabilities for these mission areas include network and vulnerability assessments, migration plans, investment strategies, roadmaps and technical guidance documentation.  

This budget line was transferred from DoD Chief Information Officer management oversight to that of the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology and
Logistics) as part of the disestablishment of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Networks and Information Integration (ASD(NII)) and the associated transfer to
USD (AT&amp;L) of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Communications, Command and Control and Cyber (DASD C3 &amp; Cyber.) Transfer of this DASD to
USD(AT&amp;L) conveys the critical technical, systems engineering and program management oversight division of the former ASD(NII) to AT&amp;L where engineering and acquisition expertise is resident. It capitalizes on each organization’s performance and reduces technical and operational risk in the Department’s acquisition processes by incorporating recognized, solid experience in the application of best practices to the development and fielding of net-centric capabilities which support major systems and weapons deployment. </r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This budget line was transferred from DoD Chief Information Officer management oversight to that of the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology and Logistics) as part of the disestablishment of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Networks and Information Integration (ASD(NII)) and the associated transfer to USD (AT&amp;L) of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Communications, Command and Control and Cyber (DASD C3 &amp; Cyber.)  Transfer of this DASD to USD(AT&amp;L) conveys the critical technical, systems engineering and program management oversight division of the former ASD(NII) to AT&amp;L where engineering and acquisition expertise is resident. It capitalizes on each organization’s performance and reduces technical and operational risk in the Department’s acquisition processes by incorporating recognized, solid experience in the application of best practices to the development and fielding of net-centric capabilities which support major systems and weapons deployment. Reduced FY12 and outyear JTIDS funding resulted in the postponement of critical efforts to the FY13 and beyond time-frame.

The Common Joint Tactical Information funding line responds to the Department's requirement for joint and combined network-enabled tactical data link (TDL) capabilities and for communications which meet net-centric standards to ensure interoperability and seamless integration with joint communication systems. It will be used to assess and promote competition across TDLs DoD-wide and to provide acquisition oversight of TDL-related activities such as CDL waveforms, Joint Aerial Layer Network (JALN) narrowband TDL gateways, Multifunction Advanced Data Link (MADL) and datalink roadmaps to guide future investments. This funding line provides resources for acquisition support and management oversight of critical command, control, communications (C3) and non-intelligence space capabilities as the Department migrates to netcentric operations. Funds will be used to provide technical, systems engineering and acquisition management oversight of programs, projects and activities to maximize the Department’s return on investment in information technology resources and to effect a comprehensive approach for assessing and procuring critical information systems from initial design, through development to capability delivery in support of improved weapons systems performance and military operations. Resources will be allocated for architecture design and development, portfolio management, enterprise-wide systems engineering and operational impact analyses related to C3 and non-intelligence space systems. They will also be used to provide expertise required for exercising technical direction over design, performance and cost parameters of key systems and their dependencies. The goal of this funding is to eliminate redundancy, reduce time to the field, evaluate projects and concepts for adherence to net-centric guidelines, minimize performance and operational risk of developing and fielding complex major systems which rely on networks and supporting applications, ensure program dependencies are documented and included in acquisition decisions and address interoperability requirements, gaps and best value technical solutions. Typical deliverables associated with the instantiation of net-centric capabilities for these mission areas include network and vulnerability assessments, migration plans, investment strategies, roadmaps and technical guidance documentation.

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Exportability Features (DEF) Program is a result of a USD(AT&amp;L) sponsored legislative proposal for authorities to better prepare warfighting systems for non-US use. The program funds will be replenished through non-recurring cost recoupment in future Foreign Military Sales (FMS) cases, Cooperative Program MOUs, or direct commercial sales contracts for sale/transfer of DoD systems benefiting from exportability investments. This program funds activities to support identification of major defense acquisition programs for possible export, and the planning for design and incorporation of exportability features during research and development of these programs. Features include, but are not limited to, technology and engineering design activity such as capability differentials, anti-tamper, system assurance, and software assurance. Activities include the development of program protection strategies for the program; the design and incorporation of exportability features into the system; implementation of exportability requirements onto contracts; and research, development, test, and evaluation activities. 

Defense exportability features plays a critically important role in United States Government/DoD efforts to build partnership capacity.  Funds support building joint and coalition environments by enabling the export of DoD systems to a wide range of partner nations, resulting in improved security and interoperability.  In addition to the operational benefits, by providing these resources up front, then collecting ‘fair share’ non-recurring cost recoupment, the United States and partner nations will save significant resources by more efficiently designing and producing exportable U.S. systems. 

Funding is increased in FY14 to expand the number of systems included in the Defense Exportaiblity Pilot Program that are used to define and implement DEF ‘best practice’ program management, system engineering, and program protection measures in the DoD acquisition process. Failure to consider export variant designs early in the acquisition process results in increased costs, delayed delivery, and higher risk of  sensitive technology compromise due to ad-hoc sales late in production.  Early development of export variants including systems design approaches to integrate adequate domestic and exportable anti-tamper (AT) protection and differential capability (DC) requirements to lower production costs, increase quality and timely deliveries to allies and friends, and enhance US industry share of the global marketplace.

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Defense Exportability Features (DEF) Program is a result of a USD(AT&amp;L) sponsored legislative proposal for authorities to better prepare warfighting systems for non-US use. The program funds will be replenished through non-recurring cost recoupment in future Foreign Military Sales (FMS) cases, Cooperative Program MOUs, or direct commercial sales contracts for sale/transfer of DoD systems benefiting from exportability investments. This program funds activities to support identification of major defense acquisition programs for possible export, and the planning for design and incorporation of exportability features during research and development of these programs. Features include, but are not limited to, technology and engineering design activity such as capability differentials, anti-tamper, system assurance, and software assurance. Activities include the development of program protection strategies for the program; the design and incorporation of exportability features into the system; implementation of exportability requirements onto contracts; and research, development, test, and evaluation activities. 

Defense exportability features plays a critically important role in United States Government/DoD efforts to build partnership capacity.  Funds support building joint and coalition environments by enabling the export of DoD systems to a wide range of partner nations, resulting in improved security and interoperability.  In addition to the operational benefits, by providing these resources up front, then collecting ‘fair share’ non-recurring cost recoupment, the United States and partner nations will save significant resources by more efficiently designing and producing exportable U.S. systems.  Incorporation of defense exportability features in initial designs can help control costs throughout the product life cycle.  

Funding is increased in FY14 to expand the number of systems included in the Defense Exportaiblity Pilot Program that are used to define and implement DEF ‘best practice’ program management, system engineering, and program protection measures in the DoD acquisition process. Failure to consider export variant designs early in the acquisition process results in increased costs, delayed delivery, and higher risk of  sensitive technology compromise due to ad-hoc sales late in production.  Early development of export variants including systems design approaches to integrate adequate domestic and exportable anti-tamper (AT) protection and differential capability (DC) requirements to lower production costs, increase quality and timely deliveries to allies and friends, and enhance US industry share of the global marketplace.

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Department’s budget focuses on institutionalizing and financing our capabilities to fight the wars we are in today and the scenarios we are most likely to face in the years ahead, while at the same time mitigating risk and providing for contingency operatioins. It also includes a fundamental overhaul of the DoD’s approach to procurement, acquisition, and contracting.  As such, the complex details of budgeting and tracking of funds become increasingly critical to senior leader decision making and to provide accountability to the taxpayer.  Incorporating information technology toward current and emerging business processes manifesting into a state-of-the art system of systems will result in increasing efficiencies, timely diagnostics, and reducing lifecycle costs to maintain, sustain and repair.

Today, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense Comptroller OUSD(C) and the Cost Analysis and Program Evaluation (CAPE) uses various distinct automated systems (Comptroller Information System (CIS), PBD Wizard, Program Resource Collection Process (PRCP), Supplemental Resource Collection Process (SRCP), Budget Exhibits Generator and Standard Data Collection System (SDCS) to formulate, justify, and execute DoD budgets.  These six or more systems interact with at least several computer-based systems controlled by external organizations and agencies.  These systems manage very similar financial information, yet each uses its own scheme for representing information.  Much of the information managed by these systems is redundant.  Cross-system data representations and redundancies make it difficult to exchange and to reconcile information.  The capabilities provided by Comptroller systems, in some cases, fail to deliver services needed by its users, or fail to operate in ways that complement current and emerging business practices.  They fail to give executives information in a comprehensible form, making it difficult to draw conclusions.  Data disparities and functional redundancy make these systems more costly to keep than they need to be.

There is a critical need for the development of a state-of-the-art information technology system to modernize and replace multiple, antiquated legacy systems and processes used to formulate, justify, present and defend the entire Department of Defense Budget in the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) (OUSD(C)) to meet Title 10 and Title 31 mission and reporting requirements.  The Comptroller’s plan for mitigating the deficiencies and capability gaps associated with current systems is development of the Next Generation Resource Management System.  

This initiative exploits emerging technology, processes, trends, capabilities, and techniques to incorporate state-of-the-art information technology enabling the ability, agility, and level of fidelity to collect, process, administer and report resource management data and to automate business processes within a more robust analytical environment within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) OUSD(C). Funded efforts will improve the timeliness of resource management reviews and decisions for senior leaders and Congress.

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>A key part of DoD’s strategy to meet its energy goals is to develop an energy information management environment that will enable the Services and OSD to track energy production and usage across the real property portfolio.  Information on energy usage is critical for day-to-day management and accountability, troubleshooting building systems, and planning for capital investments.  These funds will support the development and procurement of an enterprise-wide energy data warehouse that will be integrated with existing and future real property systems.  AT&amp;L has already conducted a comprehensive requirements analysis for this prospective warehouse using funds provided through the now-disestablished Business Transformation Agency.  We have defined a standard set of energy information management requirements and are now assessing and planning which information management technologies (future and current) will best support them.  Funding is required to keep this project on track and ensure that the DoD-wide energy management data environment becomes a reality.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>A key part of DoD’s strategy to meet its energy goals is to develop an energy information management environment that will enable the Services and OSD to track energy production and usage across the real property portfolio.  Information on energy usage is critical for day-to-day management and accountability, troubleshooting building systems, and planning for capital investments.  These funds will support the development and procurement of an enterprise-wide energy data warehouse that will be integrated with existing and future real property systems.  AT&amp;L has already conducted a comprehensive requirements analysis for this prospective warehouse using funds provided through the now-disestablished Business Transformation Agency.  We have defined a standard set of energy information management requirements and are now assessing and planning which information management technologies (future and current) will best support them.  AT&amp;L funding is required to keep this project on track and ensure that the DoD-wide energy management data environment becomes a reality.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription> This funding supports Defense Planning Guidance (DPG) directing the Department of Defense (DoD) components to develop guidelines and procedures for a comprehensive readiness reporting system that evaluates readiness on the basis of the actual missions and capabilities assigned to the forces. The Defense Readiness Reporting System (DRRS) establishes a capabilities-based, adaptive, near real-time readiness information system for the DoD. This system is being designed to measure the readiness of military forces and supporting infrastructure to meet missions and goals assigned by the Secretary of Defense. DRRS also hosts information and applications used to support Joint Forces Command (JFCOM), Transportation Command (TRANSCOM), Special Operations Command (SOCOM) and Strategic Command (STRATCOM) in their roles as the Joint Force Providers.

The transformation of readiness reporting into a new comprehensive readiness system presents a number of significant challenges. First, there are thousands of new potential reporting entities to include in DRRS, such as Combatant Commands, Joint Task Forces, Services, Active and Reserve component units, installations, depots, ports, and major elements of the industrial base. These entities must not only define and implement reporting based on specific readiness metrics, but they must make their readiness status continuously available in near real time to DRRS. Second, the current National Military Strategy (NMS) makes substantially more complex demands on readiness reporting. Instead of basing readiness on traditional MTW-based scenarios, the NMS asks us to contemplate readiness for an entire range of operational forms, and to design DRRS to assess global readiness impact based on our integrated ability to project and sustain a mix of constructed forces in simultaneous engagements. Finally, Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) sourcing challenges mean that force managers need applications that will query the entire Department for suitable, available organizations to meet current needs. The need for these applications and the underlying data are a top priority for the DRRS project.

The realization of DRRS requires integrating a host of key technologies in order to achieve an information system that supports distributed, collaborative, and dynamic readiness reporting in addition to continuous tool-based assessment. The primary technical goal is the creation of a highly reliable and securely integrated readiness data environment to leverage and extend current readiness information systems. This system is based on intelligent agents, dynamic databases, semantic middleware, and publish/subscribe concepts; providing a logically uniform view into the multiple databases and information sources that feed DRRS. Crucially, through this type of advanced information environment, we dramatically expand the range of readiness queries that DRRS can be able to handle. This environment supports a suite of analysis tools that allow users to explore the consequences of readiness deficiencies in terms of the ability to generate forces and assess transportation feasibility as it pertains to specific scenarios. These tools and tool suites harness the power of the information environment to make possible the kind of quick-turnaround, excursion-driven readiness assessment that is at the heart of DRRS.

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This funding supports Defense Planning Guidance (DPG) directing the Department of Defense (DoD) components to develop guidelines and procedures for a comprehensive readiness reporting system that evaluates readiness on the basis of the actual missions and capabilities assigned to the forces. The Defense Readiness Reporting System (DRRS) establishes a capabilities-based, adaptive, near real-time readiness information system for the DoD. This system is
being designed to measure the readiness of military forces and supporting infrastructure to meet missions and goals assigned by the Secretary of Defense. DRRS also hosts information and applications used to support Joint Forces Command (JFCOM), Transportation Command (TRANSCOM), Special Operations Command (SOCOM) and Strategic Command (STRATCOM) in their roles as the Joint Force Providers. 

The transformation of readiness reporting into a new comprehensive readiness system presents a number of significant challenges. First, there are thousands of new potential reporting entities to include in DRRS, such as Active and Reserve component units, agencies, Combatant Commanders, installations, depots, ports, and major elements of the industrial base. These new entities must not only define and implement reporting based on specific readiness metrics, but they must make their readiness status continuously available in near real time to DRRS. Second, the current National Military Strategy makes substantially more complex demands on readiness reporting. Instead of basing readiness on traditional MTW-based scenarios, the NMS asks us to contemplate readiness for an entire range of operational forms, and to design DRRS to assess global readiness impact based on our integrated ability to project and sustain a mix of constructed forces in simultaneous engagements. Finally, OIF/OEF sourcing challenges mean that force managers need applications that will query the entire Department for suitable, available organizations to meet current needs. The need for these applications and the underlying data are a top priority for the DRRS project. 

The realization of DRRS will require integrating a host of key technologies in order to achieve an information system that will support massive-scale distributed, collaborative dynamic readiness reporting and continuous tool-based assessment. The primary technical goal is the creation of a high-reliability, secure integrated readiness data environment that will leverage and extend current readiness information systems. This system will be based on intelligent agents, dynamic databases, semantic middleware, and publish/subscribe concepts; and will provide a logically uniform view into the multiple databases and information sources that will feed DRRS. Crucially, through this type of advanced information environment, we will dramatically expand the range of readiness queries that DRRS will be able to handle. Coupled to this data environment will be a set of high-speed scenario-oriented tools that support ad hoc queries and drilldown, and an advanced workflow system that can assemble existing and new scenario and assessment tools into high-level task-specific query processes. These tools and tool suites will harness the power of the information environment to make possible the kind of quickturnaround, excursion-driven readiness assessment that is at the heart of DRRS.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The level of resourcing for the Joint System Architecture Development (JSAD) program reflects iterative reductions from efficiencies and budget reductions, which reduces the Department's ability to develop flexible responsive solutions to emerging war fighter needs. The Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) and acquisition reform initiatives call for top down, national security strategy-driven capabilities-based planning. Department of Defense (DoD) Instruction 5000.02 and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 3170.01 promulgate capabilities-based requirements and acquisition processes. The JSAD program enables collaborative efforts to achieve these goals. These efforts include providing support to conduct warfighting capability-based analysis; performing assessments of joint capability areas and joint integrating concepts; developing and supporting needed sets of system and system-related data; creating integrated roadmaps to support acquisition investment decisions; and performing assessments of major defense acquisition programs and major automated information systems in a capability area context.  Activities in the JSAD project are divided into three areas:  (1) capability-based analysis; (2) roadmaps; and (3) support tools and guidance. Capability-based analysis provides analysis of the different technology, functionality, and integration impacts of systems on warfighting capability.  Acquisition roadmaps guide systems development and associated investment plans.  JSAD support tools and guidance initiatives develop systems data, and tools, exploit modeling and simulation and architecture efforts to improve DoDs overall assessment capability.  These efforts guide the development and improve the testing and fielding of integrated systems of systems in order to achieve Joint mission capabilities.  The QDR also lays out the need for an institutional reorientation or shift in emphasis from organization-specific to enterprise-wide approaches. This means:  (1) horizontal integration within the Department and unity of effort through greater interagency collaboration; (2) engaging in a coordinated and portfolio-based approach to planning,  programming, budgeting and execution; and (3) significant reforms at the governance, management and execution levels.  To accomplish this direction, there needs to be a focused  goal and concerted emphasis on shifting from systems acquisition to capabilities-based portfolio management (or portfolio systems acquisition).  This  program enables collaborative efforts to implement the QDR direction outlined above in order to achieve portfolio systems acquisition goals.  The program is broken up into two focus areas (Portfolio Management and Reform Initiatives) and consolidates work previously performed under various other Program Elements.  </r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Departments 2005 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) laid out the need for an institutional reorientation or shift in emphasis from organization-specific to enterprise-wide approaches.  This meant:  (1) horizontal integration within the Department and unity of effort through greater interagency collaboration; (2) engaging in a coordinated and portfolio-based approach to planning, programming, budgeting and execution; and (3) significant reforms at the governance, management and execution levels.  The Department’s 2010 QDR report further addressed reforming how we buy, noting that the conventional acquisition process is too long and too cumbersome to fit the needs of the many systems that require continuous changes and upgrades—a challenge that will become only more pressing over time. The Department will improve how it matches requirements with mature technologies, maintains disciplined systems engineering approaches.   To accomplish this direction, there needed to be a focused goal and concerted emphasis on shifting from acquisition of individual systems to portfolio management (or portfolio systems acquisition).  This program enables collaborative efforts to implement the QDR direction outlined above and to achieve portfolio systems acquisition goals and to develop and implement acquisition reform initiatives.  The program is broken up into two focus areas (Portfolio Management and Reform Initiatives) and consolidates work previously performed under various other Program Elements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription> Since its inception in FY 1990, this program element has been used to fund the development of critically needed, high priority Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) capabilities for joint/multi-Service requirements.  The Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program (CTEIP) uses a corporate investment approach to combine Service, Defense, and other government agencies T&amp;E needs, maximize opportunities for joint efforts, and avoid unwarranted duplication of test capabilities.  CTEIP focuses investments on projects that will have high productivity returns on investment.  Projects under the CTEIP Program Element (PE) support two basic tasks: investments to improve the test capabilities base (Joint Improvement and Modernization (JIM) projects) and development of near-term solutions to test capability shortfalls in support of ongoing operational test programs (Resource Enhancement Project (REP)).
JIM projects address critically needed T&amp;E investments in the major functional areas of: air combat; armament and munitions; Command, Control Communication, Computer and Intelligence (C4I) and networks; common range instrumentation; electronic combat; land combat; sea combat; space combat; threat simulators; and test environments.  Examples of project subject matter include: highly accurate time-space-position information, network enhanced telemetry, miniaturized flight safety systems, realistic urban test environments, ground testing for manned and unmanned aerial platforms and satellites, and end-to-end testing of infrared countermeasure and electronic warfare systems.  CTEIP continues as the focal point for fostering common architectures throughout the test and training communities to enhance the sharing of resources and links between test and training ranges.
CTEIP has provided special focus to institutionalize the use of modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) as a practical test tool; to link ranges through internetting to enhance inter-range and inter-Service cooperation and resource sharing; and, to ensure development and acquisition of common instrumentation necessary for a more efficient test infrastructure.
Analyses of alternative solutions are conducted for each investment project to validate T&amp;E requirements, to define integrated support systems, and to determine overall cost effectiveness of the proposed test investments.  The use of Department of Defense (DoD)-wide processes for requirement validation, prioritization, and risk assessment ensures an effective test resource investment program.

The REP funds development of near-term solutions for critical ongoing operational tests supporting decisions on major, high priority defense acquisition programs.  These unanticipated operational test (OT) capability requirements arise from several sources such as a new threat system identified during OT planning, acquisition of foreign military assets that are critical in determining weapon system operational effectiveness, short timelines between system design maturity and scheduled OT, and emerging technologies and test requirements resulting from operational concept changes mandated by Congress or Director, Operational Test &amp; Evaluation (DOT&amp;E), or system-of-systems testing.  Funding these activities under the CTEIP provides the opportunity to coordinate and integrate these near-term test requirements with the total DoD test and evaluation investment planning, and ensures their availability and legacy for other programs that may have similar testing requirements.
This Research Category 6.4 PE includes special studies, analyses, and strategic planning related to test capabilities and infrastructure, and supports the development and application of proven technologies to provide major test and evaluation capabilities required to meet DoD component weapon system test requirements.

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>     Since its inception in FY 1990, this program element has been used to fund the development of critically needed, high priority Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) capabilities for joint/multi-Service requirements.  The Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program (CTEIP) uses a corporate investment approach to combine Service, Defense, and other government agencies T&amp;E needs, maximize opportunities for joint efforts, and avoid unwarranted duplication of test capabilities.  CTEIP focuses investments on projects that will have high productivity returns on investment.  Projects under the CTEIP Program Element (PE) support two basic tasks: investments to improve the test capabilities base (Joint Improvement and Modernization (JIM) projects) and development of near-term solutions to test capability shortfalls in support of ongoing operational test programs (Resource Enhancement Project (REP)).

    The JIM funds critically needed T&amp;E investments in the major functional areas of: air combat; armament and munitions; Command, Control Communication, Computer and Intelligence (C4I) and networks; common range instrumentation; electronic combat; land combat; sea combat; space combat; target systems; and test environments.  Examples of project subject matter include: highly accurate time-space-position information, network enhanced telemetry, miniaturized flight safety systems, realistic urban test environments, ground testing for hypersonic systems and satellites, and end-to-end testing of infrared countermeasure systems.  CTEIP continues as the focal point for fostering common architectures throughout the test and training communities to enhance the sharing of resources and links between test and training ranges.

   CTEIP has provided special focus to institutionalize the use of modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) as a practical test tool; to link ranges through internetting to enhance inter-range and inter-Service cooperation and resource sharing; and, to ensure development and acquisition of common instrumentation necessary for a more efficient test infrastructure.

   Analyses of alternative solutions are conducted for each investment project to validate T&amp;E requirements, to define integrated support systems, and to determine overall cost effectiveness of the proposed test investments.  The use of Department of Defense (DoD)-wide criteria for requirement validation, prioritization, and risk assessment ensures an effective test resource investment program.
The REP funds development of near-term solutions for critical ongoing operational tests supporting decisions on major, high priority defense acquisition programs.  These unanticipated operational test (OT) capability requirements arise from several sources such as a new threat system identified during OT planning, acquisition of foreign military assets that are critical in determining weapon system operational effectiveness, short timelines between system design maturity and scheduled OT, and emerging technologies and test requirements resulting from operational concept changes mandated by Congress or Director, Operational Test &amp; Evaluation (DOT&amp;E), or system-of-systems testing.  Funding these activities under the CTEIP provides the opportunity to coordinate and integrate these near-term test requirements with the total DoD test and evaluation investment planning, and ensures their availability and legacy for other programs that may have similar testing requirements.

   This Research Category 6.4 PE includes special studies, analyses, and strategic planning related to test capabilities and infrastructure, and supports the development and application of proven technologies to provide major test and evaluation capabilities required to meet DoD component weapon system test requirements.

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Joint Mission Environment Test Capability (JMETC) program was established for the purpose of implementing the Department’s strategy to move to an enterprise-centric, distributed test capability that results in acquisition systems fielded with enhanced joint capabilities, reduced program costs, and improved acquisition timelines.  The JMETC program implements the infrastructure capabilities defined in the DoD’s “Testing in a Joint Environment Roadmap” to provide acquisition program managers a robust nation-wide capability to “test like we fight.”  JMETC provides a persistent, distributed test and evaluation (T&amp;E) capability that otherwise would not be readily available to Service/Component acquisition programs.  This program is funded within the RDT&amp;E Management Support Budget Activity because it is intended to provide test capability in support of RDT&amp;E programs. 
 
       JMETC creates a common corporate capability to link live systems with virtual and constructive representations in order to generate a realistic joint mission test environment for the system(s) being tested.  To support the DoD guidance on cyber defense and attack operations, the JMETC environment includes a distributed cyberspace interoperability testing capability for systems under test.  JMETC is a widely applicable, persistent, service provider for the Department’s acquisition and net-centric programs.  Key JMETC products include readily available connectivity over existing networks, standardized data transport solutions, tools and utilities for planning and conducting distributed integrations, DoD corporate distributed testing expertise, and a reuse repository.  This common integration capability, through the use of the Test and Training Enabling Architecture (TENA), provides compatibility between JMETC and the Joint National Training Capability (JNTC), streamlining reuse of technical resources across the test and training communities.  In turn, this integration capability enables combined test and training exercises.
 
       By linking distributed facilities, JMETC allows acquisition programs to efficiently evaluate their warfighting capability in a realistic joint mission environment.  This enables a customer-defined joint mission test environment for systems engineering and testing, extensible to training and experimentation, in a timely and cost effective manner.
 
       JMETC’s institutional funding builds, maintains, and operates the JMETC infrastructure and pays for persistent availability of national connectivity for testing; data communications middleware; identification and development of interface standards; common software tools and components; and a reuse repository.  It also funds JMETC program management, facilities, equipment, operating costs, and special studies and analysis related to distributed test capabilities and infrastructure.  Key attributes of the JMETC include:  persistency; interoperability; reuse; various combinations of distributed capabilities (reconfigurable infrastructure to meet customer requirements to include distributed cyber testing); modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) linkage; Live-Virtual-Constructive (LVC) test resource integration; and distributed test support to satisfy both Service and Joint needs.  System engineering, training, and experimentation all benefit from a corporate JMETC developed for T&amp;E.
       
The Test Resource Management Center (TRMC) is the Department’s lead for the JMETC program and oversees both its development and its operations.

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program is a key source of funding for the Office of the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Staff to manage studies, analysis, management, and technical support efforts strategically to improve and support policy development, decision making, management and administration of DoD programs and activities. Studies and analysis will examine current and alternative policies, plans, operations, strategies and budgets, and are essential for managing and responding to the ever-changing complex international, political, technological, economic, military, and acquisition environments in which national security planning decisions are made.  The need for independent analysis has become particularly acute with the evolution of requirements for planning the reconstitution of forces affected by operations, and there is a strong need to incorporate the effects of operational analysis in force planning assessments. With the persistently complex security, threat, and economic environment, the need for objective analysis and forward looking planning for the mid and long-term is vital.

In FY 2014 the budget request for the Global Theater Security Cooperation Management Information Systems (TSCMIS) program will be transferred to the Defense Security Cooperation Agency.  TSCMIS is an existing program that will be executed by the Joint Staff separately from the Technical Studies, Support, and Analysis program. The Global Theater Security Cooperation Management Information Systems program responds to OSD's Guidance for Employment of the Force so that Combatant Commanders, Military Department Chiefs, CSA Directors, and applicable Defense Agency and Field Activity Directors are able to use a tracking mechanism to account for their steady-state activities that is accessible to other DoD components. Together these tracking mechanisms will provide a global view of all steady-state activities conducted by DoD components. The intent of this program is to encourage further development of tracking mechanisms in order to achieve full visibility of Defense Department activities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program is a key source of funding for the Office of the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Staff for studies, analysis, management, and technical support efforts to improve and support policy development, decision making, management and administration of DoD programs and activities. Studies and analysis will examine current and alternative policies, plans, operations, strategies and budgets, and are essential for managing and responding to the ever-changing complex international, political, technological, economic, military, and acquisition environments in which national security planning decisions are made.  The need for independent analysis has become particularly acute with the evolution of requirements for planning the reconstitution of forces affected by operations, and there is a strong need to incorporate the effects of operational analysis in force planning assessments. With the persistently complex security, threat, and economic environment, the need for objective analysis and forward looking planning for the mid and long-term is vital.

Beginning in FY 2010 this program element includes funding for the Global Theater Security Cooperation Management Information Systems (TSCMIS) Program, which is a separate program from the OSD Technical Studies, Support &amp; Analysis program.  TSCMIS is an existing program which provides a global view of all steady-state activities conducted by DoD components and enables that information to be accessible by other DoD components.  Proposed enhancements to TSCMIS will enable all of the Services and Combatant Commands to access information in this system and will allow the incorporation of data provided by other interagency partners.    The budget request for the TSCMIS program will be transferred to the Defense Security Cooperation Agency beginning in FY 2014.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This program conducts over one-hundred actions per fiscal year to support a wide variety of national security goals of the Department and is designed to encourage a collaborative research approach among the components of OSD and the Joint Staff.  The research and study projects supported by this program are closely integrated with the strategic goals of the Department of Defense.  The focus of studies varies across a wide spectrum including weapons systems cost analysis, strengthening and leveraging alliances, human resource and military personnel management, examination of innovative technologies, application of technology to operational doctrine, and many other issues of emerging importance.  Most of the actions are long to intermediate-range in outlook, and the program allows organizational leaders to plan and guide their research toward meeting their highest-priority goals and other high-level guidance such as executive branch performance management objectives, the Quadrennial Defense Review, and the National Security Strategy of the United States of America.

In following the program efficiencies guidance of the Secretary of Defense, the scope and detail of studies and analyses will be abridged in order to focus upon issues of the highest strategic importance to the Department of Defense while continuing to make every effort to support requirements from legislative direction.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>(1) Export Control Program:
The Militarily Critical Technologies Program (MCTP) provides the technical reference guidance in support of development and implementation of Department of Defense (DoD) technology security policies on international transfers of defense related goods, services, and technologies.  The export control program provides an ongoing assessment and analysis of global goods and technologies.  Determines significant advances in the development, production, and use of military capabilities by potential adversaries.  Determines goods and technologies being developed worldwide with potential to significantly enhance or degrade U.S. military capabilities in the future.  Identified in the Export Administration Act of 1979 and extended by Presidential Executive Order to review militarily critical goods and technologies and to consider worldwide technology capabilities.  The Militarily Critical Technologies List (MCTL) is a congressionally mandated source document for identification of leading edge and current technologies monitored worldwide for national security, nonproliferation control of weapons of mass destruction, and advanced conventional weapons.

Specific activities include:
- Develop and publish in electronic form (including Internet version) restricted editions of the MCTL document that describe the military and proliferation significance of various technologies.
- Monitor and assess dual-use and military technologies worldwide.
- Assist in the development of proposals for negotiation in various multilateral export control regimes.
- Limited worldwide technology capability assessments for the MCTL and other U.S. international critical technologies efforts.
- Identification and determination of technical parameters for proposals for international control of weapons of mass destruction.
- Identification of foreign technologies of interest to the DoD and opportunities for international cooperative research and development.

(2) The DoD Damage Assessment Management Office (DAMO) Program:
The Defense Industrial Base (DIB) secures critical DoD programs and technology by protecting DoD unclassified information resident on and transiting DIB unclassified networks.  This project further establishes the DoD DAMO to coordinate the conduct of assessments involving the loss of DoD information requiring controls resulting from the unauthorized access and/or exfiltration of technical data maintained on unclassified DIB networks.  The DAMO identifies and categorizes the impact of the loss of acquisition information contained on the affected systems, organizes, and coordinates the assessment reports with all affected components and DIB members, and establishes a process to appropriately share collected information with all affected parties.  The DAMO establishes policy and procedures for conducting damage assessments applicable to all DoD components and in concert with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation (DFAR) procedures pertaining to contracts with the DIB.

Specific activities include:
- Provide technical expertise and analyses in assessing the impact of data lost as a result of the unauthorized access and/or exfiltration. 
- Develop a damage assessment ontology and data repository in order to provide analysis to identify trends in the targeting and compromise of defense program information.

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Foreign Comparative Testing (FCT) Program supports the warfighter by leveraging mature technologies and equipment from allied nations and coalition partners to satisfy U.S. defense requirements, thereby accelerating the U.S. acquisition process and lowering development costs.  Authorized by Title 10, U.S. Code, Section 2350a (g), the FCT Program is managed by the Office of Secretary of Defense (Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (DASD) Rapid Fielding), Comparative Technology Office (CTO).  FCT projects are nominated by the Services and U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) each year.  Evaluation processes for project selection include a detailed review to confirm the proposed item addresses valid requirements, a thorough market survey, and development of a viable acquisition strategy. </r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Foreign Comparative Testing (FCT) Program supports the warfighter by leveraging mature technologies and equipment from allied nations and coalition partners to satisfy U.S. defense requirements, thereby accelerating the U.S. acquisition process and lowering development costs.  Authorized by Title 10, U.S. Code, Section 2350a(g), the FCT Program is managed by the Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD), Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (DASD) Rapid Fielding (RF), Comparative Technology Office (CTO). FCT projects are nominated by the Services and U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) each year.   Evaluation processes for project selection include a detailed review to confirm the proposed item addresses valid requirements, a thorough market survey, and development of a viable acquisition strategy.  

Since the program's inception in 1980, OSD has initiated 671 projects; 601 projects have been completed to date.  Of the 312 evaluations that met the sponsors' requirements, 243 led to procurements worth approximately $11.000 billion in FY 2011 constant year dollars.  With an OSD investment of about $1.170 billion, the FCT Program realized an estimated research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&amp;E) cost avoidance of $7.800 billion in FY 2011 constant year dollars.

The FCT Program is a catalyst for teaming or other business relationships between foreign and U.S. industries.  Many successful FCT projects result in the licensed production of the qualified foreign item in the U.S. Other nations recognize the long-term value of such practices for competing in the U.S. defense market and the resultant strengthening of the "two-way street" in Defense procurement.  The result often means the creation of jobs and contributions to local economies throughout the U. S.  To date, companies across 33 states benefited from FCT projects.

This system will incorporate active and electronic noise reduction, spatial separation of multiple radio channels from multiple sources, and 3D threat audio cueing from on-board threat detection systems.  The A-10 and the F-16 do not have active or electronic noise reduction capability.  The primary output is a 3D audio capability that automatically sorts and presents information spatially in real time to the pilot.  The 3D audio integration increases situational awareness, allows pilots to respond quicker by reducing information overload, and provides significant noise reduction.</r2:Description>

                                                        <r2:Description>Test improved aluminum armor alloys against current fielded aluminum alloys on armored vehicles for incorporation into military vehicle specifications.  Possible candidates are the Ground Combat Vehicle (GVC), the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV), the Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV), and foreign military sales M2 Bradley systems.  This project will evaluate aluminum alloys AA7017-T6, AA2139-T8, and AA2195-BT.  The project will also evaluate the weld-ability of the alloys for verification of improved ballistics and structural performance versus current armors.  In addition to improved mechanical properties, preliminary data indicates these alloys also display improved resistance to stress corrosion cracking.  The improved ballistics and resistance to stress corrosion cracking (SCC) make AA7017 a promising replacement for current corrosion prone aluminum alloys while maintaining good weld ability.  The AA2195 and AA2139 alloys deliver increased protection levels beyond the current armor alloys, but are only approved for use as bolt-on or appliqué supplemental armors.  Further verifications are needed to achieve full weldable status.</r2:Description>

                                                        <r2:Description>Evaluate a module for autonomous mission planning that integrates with the existing Common Operator Interface Navy (COIN) tool to permit adaptive mission execution with unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs). In addition to demonstrating new behaviors and algorithms, including automated target recognition (ATR), the tool will be adapted to provide an open and modular interface for third-party autonomy algorithms, supporting application of ongoing Navy efforts or competition of future capabilities.  The effort aims to increase UUV mission capabilities through autonomy and provide an interface for application of existing Navy adaptive behaviors to improve fielding efforts.  This is expected to be reflected in system performance as a 33 percent decrease in mine countermeasures (MCM) total mission time and a 33 percent decrease in human-caused pre-programming errors without degradation of system key performance parameters.  Based on reported present capabilities and open integration model, the effort is also estimated to avoid RDT&amp;E and Operations and Support costs worth over $2.000 million.</r2:Description>

                                                        <r2:Description>Test a handling system which offers the potential for increased towed array and handling system reliability while improving maintainability.  Compared to the current system, the system under evaluation is more modular in design with improved simplicity which should directly lower overall maintenance cost to the Navy.  The test article will be subjected to structure-borne noise, temperature, vibration, and shock testing.  Additionally, there will be a land-based test to verify the required parameters and validate the design of the system and a shipboard installation and evaluation of the pre-production unit to verify the at-sea operation of the system.  If successful, the handling system can be readily back-fitted to the handling systems that are currently installed on in-service submarines (OHIO, VIRGINIA, and LOS ANGELES) and can be used in new submarine design.  The primary outputs and efficiencies produced by this project are 1) reduced damage and degradation to the arrays; 2) avoidance of RDT&amp;E and Operations and Support costs worth $96.160 million; and 3) avoidance of Manufacturing and Procurement costs worth $1.430 million.</r2:Description>

The DASD(SE) develops policies and guidance for (1) the use of systems engineering principles and best practices; (2) the use of systems and software engineering planning and contracting approaches to enhance reliability, availability, and maintainability on major defense acquisition programs (MDAPs); (3) the systems engineering plans (SEPs) for MDAPs including software, and systems engineering considerations in support of lifecycle management and sustainability; and (4) the inclusion of provisions relating to systems engineering and reliability in requests for proposals.  The DASD(SE) reviews and approves the SEP for each MDAP and monitors and reviews the systems engineering and development planning activities of MDAPs and other defense acquisition programs as directed by the Secretary of Defense or the USD(AT&amp;L).  Based on the Director’s continuous program engagement, the DASD(SE) advises and makes recommendations to the Secretary of Defense and the USD(AT&amp;L) regarding systems engineering, development planning and the execution of these activities.  As a member of the Defense Acquisition Board, the DASD(SE) provides independent assessments of defense acquisition program’s systems engineering, development planning, technical execution, and risk.  The DASD(SE) also provides input on the inclusion of systems engineering requirements as part of the Joint Requirements Oversight Council's process for joint military requirements, to include developing specific inputs relating to each capabilities development document.

The DASD(SE) issues guidance to, and consults with, the Services and Agencies with respect to systems engineering in the Department and provides advocacy, oversight, and guidance to elements of the acquisition workforce responsible for systems engineering, development planning, and lifecycle management and sustainability functions and developing policies and guidance for the integration of specialty engineering functions.  The DASD(SE) integrates systems engineering with Mission Assurance in the acquisition system.  The DASD(SE) periodically reviews the organizations and capabilities of the military departments with respect to systems engineering, development planning, and lifecycle management and sustainability, and identifies needed changes or improvements to such organizations and capabilities. 

The DASD(SE) prepares and submits an annual report to Congress on systems engineering activities and effectiveness.

This PE includes efforts by the office of the DASD(SE) in implementing the Department’s Trusted Defense System Strategy.  Specifically, the PE will develop and mature the critical sub discipline of systems engineering - system security engineering and the Comprehensive Program Protection Planning process that implements a risk-based approach to protection of critical technology, components and information in acquisition programs.  This includes study and maturation of policy, guidance and SSE discipline fundamentals such as engineering methods, tools and best practices.  These activities will be promulgated in defense acquisition as a fundamental element of DASD(SE) systems engineering and technical reviews.  </r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Department of Defense (DoD) must address cyber security and supply chain risks to DoD networks, weapons systems and information stored and processed on both DoD and Defense Industrial Base (DIB) unclassified networks that support DoD programs.  Increased reliance on the internet as a vehicle for sharing information, globalization of the supply chain, and advanced persistent threats (APTs) that can evade commercially available security tools and defeat generic security best practices, drive the need for better and smarter program protection planning and execution.  The President's Cyber Initiative has moved to counter these threats and mitigate the risks.  The Acquisition Cyber Security Initiative links high level policies and practical expertise to specific acquisition practices, systems engineering activities, and risk reduction activities.  Through this initiative the Department will pilot activities with the DIB to reduce risks in sharing and storing critical program information, better understand and mitigate supply chain risks, improve program protection planning, and improve and streamline program protection engineering.  The Department has developed a Trusted Systems strategy which integrates Protection Planning for the development of capabilities, the use of proven mitigation techniques and tools, the ongoing refinement of risk management processes, and creation of needed technology.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

As a UARC, the SERC is a strategic resource to further systems research and increase its impact on the Department’s ability to meet its mission.  Greatly improved systems engineering is essential to the president’s strategy for the Department to field systems that are agile, affordably sustainable, flexible, and ready for a full range of contingencies in the face of declining budgets and a shrinking workforce.  The SERC consists of a network of eighteen research universities from across the US that work collaboratively to bring the best talent in the nation to bear on DoD’s systems engineering research problems. 

In prior years, DASD/SE has resourced the SERC at $1.000 million per year from P142. 

The additional funding, beginning in FY 2014, will increase the Department’s engagement with SERC, supporting additional research on topics of strategic importance to DoD.  

This new project code, established within the Systems Engineering Program Element:  (1) provides core funding for the SERC; (2) provides adequate stable resources for the SERC research agenda; and (3) enables the SERC to take full advantage of the university collaborators, enabling them to address DoD needs much more effectively.

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The purpose of the Nuclear Matters program is to sustain the U.S. nuclear deterrent posture, counter nuclear threats, and to develop nuclear and conventional physical security equipment. The funds for this program are used to support research, development, test and evaluation efforts as well as studies and analyses for nuclear weapons security; use control; nuclear weapons stockpile safety, survivability and performance; countering nuclear threats and office management.  Funds are also used to develop and implement plans for stockpile transformation; infrastructure analyses and assessments; DoD-NNSA Nuclear Weapons Council activities, as mandated by Title 10 USC, section 179; radiological and nuclear emergency response efforts; and management of international programs of nuclear cooperation, particularly with respect to enhancing international nuclear safety and security and office management.  Nuclear Matters is also responsible for policy development and implementation for personnel reliability; nuclear weapons, nuclear command and control, and special nuclear materials security; use control; nuclear weapons transportation; physical security equipment; countering nuclear threats; and nuclear and radiological incident response.

This Program Element can fund travel to support the requirements of this program.

This appropriation will finance work, including manpower, performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant arrangement with the government who conduct research (systematic study directed toward fuller scientific knowledge or understanding of the subject studied), development (systematic use of the knowledge and understanding gained from research, for the production of useful materials, devices, systems, or methods, including the design and development of prototypes and processes) and test and evaluation efforts.

CISA is the DoD program that provides architectures in compliance with the Clinger-Cohen Act, OMB Circular A-130, E-Gov Act and other related higher level guidance from the Federal CIO Council and the Federal Enterprise Architecture Program Management Office, which mandates the development and use of architectures as validation for IT investment decisions.  The CISA program supports the development of architectural standard tools and systems. Develop and maintain key GIG policy and guidance documents that drive the acquisition, transition to and operation of a net-centric GIG; the implementation of policy/guidance through a set of critical supporting activities such as IT standards management, and DoD transition to Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6); Real Time Service and IP convergence and enforcing policy through key enterprise governance mechanisms.  Review and assess Command and Control, Computers, Communications and Intelligence Support Plans / Information Support Plans for the DoD CIO, identifying interoperability, supportability, net-centric and integration issues.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>DARS is the Department’s enterprise registry, catalog and navigation map for enterprise architecture.  It serves as the Department’s primary catalog of architecture data holdings and provides users the ability to register holdings metadata and search, retrieve, and use DoD architecture data in federated architecture data repositories across DoD.  DARS provides a key component of the Department’s net-centric data management capability by federating enterprise architecture data across the Department.  It enables alignment of program architecture components with the Federal Enterprise Architecture Business Reference Model - consistent with OMB directives for exhibit 300s - via the DoD Business Reference Model.  DARS implements a federated search capability and metadata catalog that will interoperate with the Department’s Net-Centric Enterprise Discovery Service and enterprise content metadata catalog.  Architecture metadata is searchable using the DARS federated discovery web service.  The discovery search results provide links to architecture data that is retrievable based on user roles and access permissions.  Implementations are accessible on both the NIPRNET (unclassified) and SIPRNET (Collateral Classified).  Key features of the DARS program focus on: (1) Making architecture data visible, accessible, trusted, understandable, and interoperable (2) enabling reuse of validated architecture data to build “composite” integrated architectures; (3) enabling architecture analysis; and, (4) integrating architecture data into the DoD mainstream decision-making processes.  The Department of the Air Force, Army, and Navy CIO’s are collaborating in the development of DARS federation web services via the Federated Joint Architecture Working Group under the auspices of the DoD Enterprise Architecture Summit to ensure DoD-wide access to and usability of all components of the composite DoD enterprise architecture model.  </r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This functionality has conducted a number of testing exercises, called Phantom Signal testing, during FY12.  These testing exercises have included tests on national and nuclear platforms and at critical facilities.  Tests are focused both on root cause analysis as well as modernization verification and systems validation.
- Developed policy and a supporting implementation strategy for Senior Leader Secure Communications Modernization.  The policy was originally established as a DTM, but is currently being staffed through the 106 process in order to become a DoDI with DepSecDef signature.  This policy and supporting strategy outlines a number of milestones and activities across mobile, fixed and airborne operating environments for communications modernization for Presidential and Tier I/II senior principal leadership.
- Helped establish an NLCC-focused Secure Communications Assessment Network (SeCAN) Testbed for the testing of legacy systems and validation of modernization paths.  This testbed leverages UARC research and development talents and integrates across multiple government organizations (to include DoD CIO, DISA, NSA, EOP, WHMO, WHCA, and others) in order to develop and provide a validated path towards organizational implementation of secure (fixed and mobile) communication solutions.
- Provided systems engineering and integration support to the NSA Fishbowl Commercial Solutions For Classified (CSFC) project.  Ensured Senior Leader requirements were collected and being represented in the end, fixed and wireless, solution.
- Conducted an assessment of Senior Leader Wideband Airborne Communication systems.  Developed potential courses of action in order to support focus team decision making on near-, mid- and long-term solutions for SLC3S-A fixed-wing platforms.
- Provided oversight, advisory and analysis on Maritime Information Systems and associated threats.
- Led and facilitated the Department’s National and Nuclear Cryptographic Modernization Program.  Developed implementation plans, planned and coordinated supporting conferences and conducted broad organizational (to include interagency) collaboration.
- Provided oversight, and collaborated with DISA and the Joint Staff, in standing-up and managing the Defense Red Switch Network Reduction Program.

It provides the Defense Intelligence Enterprise with independent civilian personnel authorities necessary to hire, develop, reward, and retain the diverse, versatile and highly qualified workforce necessary to perform the Defense intelligence mission and brings for the first time, the entire Defense Intelligence Enterprise under one personnel framework.

These funds are used to develop modifications to the Performance Appraisal Application (PAA) in the Defense Civilian Personnel Data System and to the classified Global Force Management (GFM) Defense Intelligence Organizational Server.  PAA is a performance management tool used by the Military Services Intelligence Components, Defense Security Service and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence.  GFM tracks both civilian and military positions; assoicated grades and skill levels; and hierarchial organizational relationships.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The purpose of Phase I is to determine, insofar as possible, the scientific technical and commercial merit, and feasibility of ideas submitted under the SBIR/STTR Program. Phase II awards are made to firms that have been awarded a Phase I contract on the basis of the results of their Phase I effort and the scientific, technical, and commercial merit of the Phase II proposal. Phase II is the principal research or research and development effort and is expected to produce a well-defined deliverable prototype. Phase III SBIR/STTR efforts derive from, extend or conclude Phase I or Phase II efforts, and are not funded with SBIR/STTR funds. Under Phase III, companies participating in the SBIR/STTR Program are expected to obtain funding from the private sector and/or non-SBIR/STTR government sources to develop the prototype into a viable product or non-R&amp;D service for sale in military and/or private sector markets.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementNote>The Critical Technology Assessments project transfers from the USD (A&amp;T) Critical Technology Support program element (PE) 0605110D8Z to the Defense Technology Analysis PE 0605798D8Z in FY 2014.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD(R&amp;E)) is the principal staff advisor to the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology &amp; Logistics (USD(AT&amp;L)) and the Secretary and Deputy Secretary of Defense for research and engineering (R&amp;E) matters.  In this capacity, the ASD(R&amp;E) has the responsibility to conduct analyses and studies; develop policies; provide technical leadership, oversight and advice; make recommendations; and issue guidance for DoD R&amp;E programs.  Additionally, the ASD(R&amp;E) provides technical support to the USD(AT&amp;L) on R&amp;E aspects of programs subject to review by the Defense Acquisition Board, to include assessments of technology maturity consistent with DoD acquisition policy.  The mission of the DoD R&amp;E program is to create, demonstrate, prototype, and apply technology that enables affordable and decisive military superiority.  Pursuing the R&amp;E mission requires attention to:  (1) identification and development of new technological opportunities; (2) insertion of new technologies into warfighting systems and operations; and (3) management and evaluation of the effectiveness of technology programs.  This program element provides mission support to the Office of the ASD(R&amp;E) (OASD(R&amp;E)) covering a wide range of studies and analysis in support of the R&amp;E program and it impacts the Department's decision to fund RDT&amp;E efforts.  

The program element provides funding for the Defense Laboratory Office within the OASD(R&amp;E)).  The Defense Laboratory Office advocates and invests in the DoD laboratory system in three areas:  (1) facilities and infrastructure; (2) quality of workforce; and (3) global insight of critical or strategic technologies important to the Department and the Nation.

The program element provides engineering, scientific, and analytical support to the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research in its responsibility for direction, overall quality, and content of the science and technology (S&amp;T) program and ensures that the technology being developed is affordable and minimizes system development risk.  The Defense Technology Analysis program conducts assessments and analysis to ensure maximum utilization of research and development funds to accomplish the overall objectives of the S&amp;T program.  Funds are required for technical, analytical and management support, equipment and supplies, travel, and publications.

The DoD's key expertise for reviewing and guiding R&amp;E programs resides in the OASD(R&amp;E).  The OASD(R&amp;E) staff augment their responsibilities through their connections to technology experts in various fields throughout academia, industry, and government.  The Defense Support Teams project supports the directed responsibilities by building teams of technology experts to conduct program technical assessments.  The teams analyze the key engineering problem areas and offer adjustments in the development and test plan; alternate technical approaches; or new technologies that could enable successful development.  The teams provide unbiased reviews and gather advice from the Nation's leading technical experts.

The program element provides funding for Critical Technology Assessments within OASD(R&amp;E).  Critical Technology Assessments provide the technical reference guidance in support of development and implementation of DoD technology security policies on international transfers of defense related goods, services, and technologies.  The program provides an ongoing assessment and analysis of global goods and technologies; determines significant advances in the development, production, and use of military capabilities by potential adversaries; and determines goods and technologies being developed worldwide with potential to significantly enhance or degrade U.S. military capabilities in the future.  </r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The export control program provides an ongoing assessment and analysis of global goods and technologies.  Determines significant advances in the development, production, and use of military capabilities by potential adversaries.  Determines goods and technologies being developed worldwide with potential to significantly enhance or degrade U.S. military capabilities in the future.  Identified in the Export Administration Act of 1979 and extended by Presidential Executive Order to review militarily critical goods and technologies and to consider worldwide technology capabilities.  The Militarily Critical Technologies List (MCTL) is a congressionally mandated source document for identification of leading edge and current technologies monitored worldwide for national security, nonproliferation control of weapons of mass destruction, and advanced conventional weapons.

Specific activities include:
- Monitor and assess dual-use and military technologies worldwide.
- Assist in the development of proposals for negotiation in various multilateral export control regimes.
- Provide limited worldwide technology capability assessments for the MCTL and other U.S. international critical technologies efforts.
- Identify and determine technical parameters for proposals for international control of weapons of mass destruction.
- Identify foreign technologies of interest to the DoD and opportunities for international cooperative research and development.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

It also provides for the assessment of DT&amp;E capabilities of the Military Departments and DoD Components, oversees the T&amp;E career field of the defense acquisition workforce, develops policy and guidance for the conduct of DT&amp;E within DoD, and produces the annual DT&amp;E report to Congress. Specific activities include the following:

- Work with MDAP/MAIS/SI Program Managers to develop a comprehensive DT&amp;E strategy that supports acquisition decision milestones. Ensure that the test strategy is documented in the Test and Evaluation Master Plans (TEMPs). The Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (DASD) DT&amp;E also approves or disapproves the developmental test and evaluation plans in the TEMPs.
- Coordinate with the Director of Systems Engineering to ensure that the DT&amp;E activities of the DoD are fully integrated into, and consistent with, the systems engineering and development planning processes of the Department.
- Provide formal DT&amp;E Assessments prior to major milestone decisions to inform the Acquisition decision-makers  on the readiness of programs to proceed into Engineering and Manufacturing Development (MS B), Production and Deployment (MS C), and Operations and Sustainment (FRP) with the goal of reducing discovery of performance issues late in the acquisition cycle.
- Develop policy and guidance to ensure efficient and effective DT&amp;E across DoD, including policy and guidance for developmental testing of interoperability and information assurance in coordination with the Joint Staff and DoD CIO.
- Provide DT&amp;E assessments in support of Nunn-McCurdy certification review teams, and the Director, Performance Assessment and Root Cause Analysis (PARCA).
- Review the organizations and capabilities of the military departments with respect to developmental test and evaluation and identify needed changes or improvements to such organizations and capabilities, and provide input regarding needed changes or improvements for the test and evaluation strategic plan developed by Test Resource Management Center (TRMC).
-As the T&amp;E Functional Leader, establish, oversee, and maintain the education, training and experience requirements including competencies and certification standards to enhance T&amp;E acquisition workforce. Monitor and facilitate Defense Acquisition University (DAU) updates of T&amp;E courses to ensure the curriculum supports the certification standards and provides the appropriate education and training.

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program supports the Office of the Director, Cost Assessment &amp; Program Evaluation (CAPE).  It funds assessments that help to resolve budget and programmatic issues across the full range of the Department’s activities.  Projects that support this effort help to inform the leadership on program alternatives, capability concept development, design and cost, the appropriate balance of capabilities across the force, and also to identify how well the Department’s expenditures are meeting its goals, and how well the force can implement the Defense strategy.

This program provides for analytical research across a spectrum of  issues and concerns.  The research agenda is focused on near to long-term problems identified by the Secretary of Defense, and addresses difficult and complex questions linked to program alternatives for current and future capabilities and forces in order to enhance the senior leadership's deliberations and decision-making.

This program provides the scientific and technical engineering services needed for research studies in the development of models and simulations and the evaluation of current analytical tools and scientific methods used to evaluate and assess weapons systems and warfighting capabilities for warfighting environments and scenarios, and related force structure.  Deliverables from this program will include reports, briefings, and analyses designed to illuminate critical issues facing the Department.  Outcomes include recommendations for new modeling techniques, programmatic alternatives, and scenario development.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Develop and test promising aviation safety technologies.  This funding supports Secretary Gates’ direction to achieve a 75% reduction in accidents and supports the Defense Safety Oversight Council's (DSOC) pursuit of aviation safety technologies, as endorsed in the Secretary’s May 30, 2007 memorandum, “Zero Preventable Mishaps.”  In FY 09, there were 29 Class A aviation accidents with 18 destroyed aircraft and 28 fatalities. Mid-air collisions are currently the #2 cause of fatalities in fighter/attack aircraft.

The DSOC used a data-driven approach to identify and evaluate the most effective hardware and software technologies to be implemented to reduce preventable aviation mishaps. The DSOC task force surveyed existing programs and provided an assessment of the viability and advisability of future resource investments. These investments will fund hardware and software technology to prevent helicopters and fighter aircraft mishaps.

Specifically, this effort will develop and flight test an Automatic Air Collision Avoidance System (AACAS) suitable for use in the dynamic, fighter air-to-air training environment.  This effort completes the design and flight test of an automatic air collision avoidance system in an F-16 test-bed, with applicability to all modern fighters and potentially UASs.

From FY 06 to FY 10 a team of automatic collision avoidance experts from AFRL, NASA, and Lockheed-Martin Aeronautics developed and flight tested the Automatic Ground Collision Avoidance System (AGCAS).  Following a highly successful flight test, this system is now undergoing operational integration in the F-16, F-22, and F-35 and is projected to prevent over 150 Class A mishaps over the lifespan of these aircraft, saving the Department over $10B in replacement costs.  In FY 10 this same team began design work on the AACAS.   Design efforts are on track with simulation testing scheduled for early FY 11. Collision avoidance was recommended for funding in FY 2010.  In FY 11 continuation of algorithm development and begin simulator testing.   In FY12, completion of simulator and flight testing.  </r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The Guidance for the Development of the Force (GDF) directs DoD Components to pursue accident reduction and prevention initiatives that emphasize safety in the workplace and hold leaders accountable for their safety programs. In FY 2008, there were 89 Class A aviation accidents with 61 destroyed aircraft and 32 fatalities.  The aviation accidents cost the Department over $2.9 billion with indirect costs approximately four times that amount.  

The DSOC used a data-driven approach to identify and evaluate the most effective hardware and software technologies to be implemented to reduce preventable aviation mishaps.  The DSOC task force surveyed existing programs and provided an assessment of the viability and advisability of future resource investments.  These investments will fund hardware and software technology to prevent helicopters and fighter aircraft mishaps.  

Automatic Collision Avoidance Technologies (ACAT) has been developed by the Air Force to prevent the most prevalent causes of fighter/attack mishap fatalities and destroyed aircraft. An Automatic Ground Collision Avoidance (Auto-GCAS) component of ACAT has matured and is ready for fleet integration. FY 2010-FY 2012 money was used to leverage the successes of ACAT by furthering  the development of Auto-ACAS, while retaining scarce technical expertise and flight test resources currently in use.  As an unintended side benefit, Auto-ACAS may also hold a key to Unoccupied Aerial Vehicle access to the National Airspace.

The Secretary stated that we can not and should not tolerate the injuries, costs, and capability losses from preventable accidents.

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Operations Security (OPSEC) Initiative (DOSI) is an effort to revitalize DoD OPSEC capability and capacity across the Department to enable combatant commands (COCOMs), Services and Defense agencies with the capability and capacity to effectively plan, integrate, execute and assess OPSEC, particularly in concert with Military Deception (MILDEC) and other information-related capabilities used against adversaries or potential adversaries during military operations.  The DOSI provides oversight, guidance and program management support for Defense OPSEC education, training, exercises, career force management, operational and programmatic assessment, capability development, intelligence, planning, analysis and operational employment in Defense military operations.  RDT&amp;E funds support the development, establishment and integration of OPSEC capabilities, next generation technologies, and Department activities. The objectives of the OPSEC Initiative are to:

1. Establish governance structures, processes and procedures for development and oversight of infrastructure, policy, authorities, and warfighter advocacy across the Joint community and the defense support agencies and for OPSEC intelligence integration that will focus on the incorporation of special intelligence requirements; intelligence and threat repository support; Open Source Intelligence, Human Intelligence, Counterintelligence and Signals Intelligence support; and intelligence support to Military Deception in Support of OPSEC (DISO).
2. Develop a concept for integrating OPSEC into critical plans, operations and activities that will clearly articulate OPSEC requirements and the means for fulfilling them.
3. Establish an OPSEC force structure to meet the Department’s requirements by evaluating existing force structures, focusing on billets, personnel identifications and tracking, allocation, and operational employment.
4. Create an integrated OPSEC education, training and exercise program that can be incorporated with MILDEC and other information-related capabilities and that focuses on exercise support and formal education curricula review and development.
5. Develop a Technology and Tools Research, Testing, and Development Program to identify emerging physical, technical, and administrative technologies and tools.

The DOSI provides oversight, guidance and program management support for Defense OPSEC education, training, exercises, career force management, operational and programmatic assessment, capability development, intelligence, planning, analysis and operational employment in Defense military operations.  RDT&amp;E funds support the development, establishment and integration of OPSEC capabilities, next generation technologies, and Department activities. The objectives of the Defense Operations Security (OPSEC) Initiative are to:

1. Establish governance structures, processes and procedures for development and oversight of infrastructure, policy, authorities, and warfighter advocacy across the Joint community and the defense support agencies and for OPSEC intelligence integration that will focus on the incorporation of special intelligence requirements; intelligence and threat repository support; Open Source Intelligence, Human Intelligence, Counterintelligence and Signals Intelligence support; and intelligence support to Military Deception in Support of OPSEC (DISO).
2. Develop a concept for integrating OPSEC into critical plans, operations and activities that will clearly articulate OPSEC requirements and the means for fulfilling them.
3. Establish an OPSEC force structure to meet the Department’s requirements by evaluating existing force structures, focusing on billets, personnel identifications and tracking, allocation, and operational employment.
4. Create an integrated OPSEC education, training and exercise program that can be incorporated with MILDEC and other information-related capabilities and that focuses on exercise support and formal education curricula review and development.
5. Develop a Technology and Tools Research, Testing, and Development Program to identify emerging physical, technical, and administrative technologies and tools.
6. Fully integrate OPSEC and MILDEC so that they synchronize efficiently and effectively.
7. Incorporate OPSEC and MILDEC as an integrated whole with other information-related capabilities such as Military Information Support Operations (MISO), Electronic Warfare (EW), Computer Network Operations (CNO), Intelligence, Counterintelligence (CI), Security, Special Technical Operations (STO) and Public Affairs (PA).
8. Establish assessment programs to assess friendly and adversary measures and countermeasures based on observable actions, indicators, or information that can provide a basis for identifying such control measures as Action Controls, Countermeasures, and Counter Analysis and for assessing revised policy, doctrine, force structure, training and governance processes to identify corrective actions.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program was part of the Defense Department’s coordinated effort to integrate Information Operations (IO), Cyber, and Intelligence Operations Integrations (IOI) test and evaluation capabilities to assess IO, Cyber, and IOI technologies and tactics in a representative operational environment against realistic targets.  The Defensewide IO Program Review revalidated a suite of automated data analysis and decision support software tools to facilitate joint-IO.  The advent of critical Cyberspace Operations mandate Cyber Technologies be assessed in a like environment.  In addition, joint warfighter requirements were driving the integration of intelligence and operations capabilities/capacities.  This program enabled users to accomplish Joint Intelligence Preparation of the Operational Environment (JIPOE), develop effective IO, Cyber, and operational strategies and candidate campaign targets, plan missions, and monitor and assess execution of operations.  The objectives of this program were to create a flexible, seamless and persistent environment enabling Combatant Commanders to achieve the same level of confidence and expertise in employing IO and Cyber capabilities that they have in kinetic weapons; to lead the development of joint IOI capabilities and capacity that facilitate operational and intelligence planning activities by the Services and COCOMs; and to transform IO, Cyber, and IOI activities to support  joint IO training, education, and exercises.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The National Military Strategy of the United States stressed the importance of integrating Information Operations (IO) capabilities for the success of Joint Operations and Decision Superiority.   The Defense-Wide IO Program Review revalidated a requirement for an integrated range supporting “exercises, testing, and development of IO capabilities.”  Further direction by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) identified the need for an “integrated IO test and evaluation capability to assess IO technologies and tactics in a representative operational environment against realistic targets.” The 2006 National Security Strategy identified "Strengthening Alliances to Defeat Global Terrorism and Work to Prevent Attacks Against Us and Our Friends", which involves significant Information Operations (IO) and Cyber operations as a goal.  Through the Defense Planning Guidance (DPG) and the Integrated Priority Lists, COCOMs repeatedly stated the need to expand IO/Cyber training and education for the developing cadre of IO/Cyber professionals and provide an environment for analysis, testing, training, combat assessments, and measures of effectiveness for more reliable IO/Cyber capabilities.  The Deputy Secretary of Defense Memorandum on the IO Range had established the requirement for creating a cooperative IO range among the Military Services.  

The IO Range provided a secure, flexible, and seamless environment for the Military Services and Joint warfighters to test, train, develop tactics, and exercise selected IO/Cyber capabilities.  The basis of the functional structure of the IO Range was the integration of existing ranges, laboratories, information warfare centers, and other Government facilities that currently support IO/Cyber test, training, exercise, and experimentation events.  Capabilities at the selected sites were securely connected and integrated into the IO Range.  A key feature of this concept was a persistent, secure connection that linked the sites together, allowing the exchange of data and the visualization of effects as we employed capabilities.  Creation of a “virtual range” based on persistent connections significantly reduced the amount of lead-time required to set up each new warfighter event.  The IO Range was a full spectrum IO/Cyber Range supporting: operations security (OPSEC), computer network operations (CNO), electronic warfare (EW), military information support operations (MISO), and military deception (MILDEC).  This environment enabled warfighters to visualize non-kinetic weapons effects, understand the intricate and interactive effects generated by kinetic and non-kinetic weapons and achieve the same level of confidence and expertise in employing IO/Cyber capabilities as they have with kinetic capabilities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

- Moved toward full spectrum IO and Cyber and evolved with the addition of a more robust set of targets.  
- Implemented IO and Cyber capabilities at field sites.  This effort supported progress toward reaching full capability in which more than 90 persistent IO Range sites were connected and integrated for IO Range use.</r2:Text>

The PE permits accelerating domain support processes through rapid proof of concept development and early implementation.  
RAI-NC provides funding for Net Centric initiatives that directly support and facilitate the transformation of the DoD enterprise.  This effort is consistent with the Department’s strategic goals to:  enable net-centric operations and warfare, reduce costs; improve efficiency; increase effectiveness by improving the efficiency and effectiveness of process redesign; business systems modernization; strategic sourcing; infrastructure reductions; and optimal-sized inventories.  The scope of Rapid Acquisition Incentives – Net Centricity encompasses defense policies, processes, people, technologies, and systems that guide, perform, or support aspects of warfighter support processes within the Department.  Successful implementation will result in more reliable, accurate, and timely net-centric management information upon which managers can make more effective business decisions in a timely manner for the Department.  Successful initiatives with supporting business cases demonstrating the achieved goals and outcomes and mission area support will be allowed to enter full deployment.

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>These programs support readiness of the joint force by creating a Joint Training Environment to replicate the complex and ever changing operational environment.   These investments support the Secretary of Defense’s (SECDEF) Combatant Commanders Exercise Engagement and Training Transformation (CE2T2) initiative to enable and enhance Joint Warfighting readiness by training as we intend to fight. The elements associated with this coordinated effort consist of:

- Joint National Training Capability (JNTC)
- Joint Simulation Systems (JSS)
- Joint Knowledge Development &amp; Distribution Capability (JKDDC)
- U.S. Forces Korea Training &amp; Exercise Support (USFK)
- Air Force JNTC
- Navy JNTC

JNTC:  The Joint National Training Capability (JNTC) program adds joint/integrated context to existing Service and Combatant Commander (COCOM) training programs. This is accomplished through integrated live, virtual, and constructive training environment and prepares units, and commanders for operations in joint/integrated operational environments. JNTC can train against a general or mission focused threat; test doctrine, tactics, techniques, procedures, Joint Operational Concepts, and equipment. As the integrating environment, JNTC provides training to the full complement of defense, inter-agency and multi-national audiences. Active and reserve forces train in a realistic joint context with other Services and joint/integrated battle staffs. Battle staffs from joint, component, and tactical headquarters train and rehearse using real-world command and control systems, with tactical forces represented through simulation support.

JSS:  The Joint Simulation System provides the joint models and simulation enabling trained, capable, and interoperable Joint Forces.  
This effort provides warfighters with the joint simulation to keep pace with operational environment supporting the Joint Force 2020 and ensure the Joint Training Environment reacts to strategic guidance such as training in anti-access anti-denial environments.    

JKDDC:  Joint Knowledge Online (JKO) is the DOD unique and authoritative source for online joint training.  They are tasked to develop a Joint Individual Training Toolkit of web-enabled individual and small group training products and services.  Products and services are developed in response to OSD(P&amp;R) CE2T2 Program Goals &amp; Objectives guidance, CJCS High Interest Training Items, Joint Staff J7 training priorities, and JKDDC Joint Knowledge Online (JKO) Stakeholder (CCMDs, Services, and Combat Support Agencies) prioritized training requirements.  JKDDC JKO supports a career-long joint learning continuum, joint professional military education and tailored common training standards to Service members for tasks that are jointly executed, resulting in trained, capable, and interoperable joint forces.  JKDDC JKO technology initiatives principally include Small Group Scenario Trainer (SGST) desk top modeling &amp; simulation based training, OSD requested virtual worlds prototype, and mobile “pilot” courseware training devices.  These capabilities facilitate the training and preparation of tens of thousands of military and civilian personnel deploying to CCMD theaters of operation prior to serving in their assigned Combined/Joint Task Force (C/JTF) billets. Specifically, C/JTF ‘battle staffs’ will be adequately trained, as individuals and the staffs collectively, based on SGST development and implementation throughout the joint training enterprise. JKO mobile “pilot” courseware training device development facilitates the global distribution of web-based joint training content on portable, hand-held platforms for joint warriors.  The future virtual worlds learning environment will provide training and learning to promote adaptability and agility in the workforce with the capability to tailor and adapt instructional material to fit the learner's strengths and weaknesses, learning style, and level of proficiency.
      
USFK:  This program provides to Joint Training Environment to support the 2015 stand-up of KORCOM as a sub-unified command under PACOM.  This program is developing a Jointly Accredited and Supported Modeling &amp; Simulation federation of constructive simulations capable of satisfying all joint exercise training requirements in the Korean Theater of Operations.  This simulation system is also interoperable with the Republic of Korea developed Korean Simulation System.  This solution will be capable of interoperating in a common battle space that realistically represents the operating environment to all levels of training audiences, tactical to strategic, in Korean theater exercises.  While supporting USFK’s specific requirements, this solution will contain enhancements that will benefit all users of the JLVC.

Air Force JNTC:  Supports the SECDEF's Transformation in Training/Joint National Training Capability (JNTC).  Develops capabilities that integrate live, virtual, and constructive elements into a seamless joint training environment.  Using a scientific and phased approach and focusing on modeling air and space capabilities, researches new technologies and methods that provide a crucial technology-based foundation supporting all JNTC operations.

Navy JNTC:  Supports SECDEF Transformation of DoD training and Joint National Training Capability. These funds enable Navy in developing unique maritime capabilities that integrate live, virtual, and constructive elements into a seamless joint training environment. Navy continues to develop and integrated joint training technologies that play a crucial role in its ability to address current and future joint operational training requirements. Navy program activities include conducting research, development, test and evaluation and cross-service architecture certification on all T2 capable systems, developing cross-domain architectures for US and Coalition Forces as well as ensure sister service modeling/simulation and instrumentation efforts follow a common unified standard.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>OSD P&amp;R established the JNTC to improve readiness of the force by developing a robust Joint training environment that represents the complexities of the operational environment through the seamless integration of Live, Virtual, and Constructive (LVC) elements.  JNTC creates Joint warfighting conditions through a networked collection of interoperable training sites, ranges, and nodes that synthesize personnel, doctrine, and technology to deliver and achieve “Joint Context” for CCMD and Service training requirements.  JNTC provides RDT&amp;E within an LVC distributed test-bed supporting the advancement of training technologies in the context of a Joint integrated battle space.  The test bed operates as a continuous training RDT&amp;E environment, providing the foundation for a distributed and deployable Mission Rehearsal System, integrating live Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance feeding the Common Operational Picture.  These funds provide critical Joint/Coalition Service members and interagency partners enhanced training to allow requisite enhancements to existing training systems, capabilities, and technologies. These enhancements improve training efficiencies and provide an integrated LVC environment.  This capability minimizes the necessity for conducting large-scale live exercises to achieve the SECDEF’s Combatant Commanders Exercise Engagement and Training and Transformation (CE2T2) vision.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The current modeling and simulation federation supporting joint and coalition training is unsustainable and unable to keep pace with the rapidly changing joint operational environment training requirements of the future. In order comply with Department of Defense guidance on cloud computing and meet warfighter training needs, the Joint Live Virtual Constructive modeling and simulation federation must be re-engineered to be adaptive, agile, and affordable.
•  Began collaborative planning efforts with the Services and Defense Information Systems Agency to create a future adaptive and agile Joint Training Enterprise Architecture enabling an affordable joint training environment that emulates the complexity, uncertainty, and dynamic nature of the Joint Force 2020 operating environment.
•  Demonstrated a second use case for extension of the Combined Enterprise Regional Information Exchange System International Security Assistance Force Training Federation into Australia. 
•  Completed redesign and implementation of the Australia, Canada, Great Britain, and United States Training Enclave, and operationalized this enclave for training.
•  Demonstrated proof of concept for Navy requirements in Joint Staff J7/Navy/Air Force Cross Domain Solution Pilot Program, a consolidation of requirements necessary to achieve an enterprise and eliminate artificial boundaries between disparate organizations with similar requirements. Redirected focus to Air Force requirements.
•  Continued Joint Training Enterprise Network Test Bed systems certification, product evaluation, problem replication and troubleshooting, to be conducted off the production network.  The test bed significantly mitigates risk to the operational network, permitting simultaneous test &amp; evaluation without impact to training events, and permits fielding capabilities at a much quicker rate than waiting for windows of availability on the production network.
• Transitioned Joint Training Enterprise Network 2.0 technology upgrade to operational use to replace old network sites with new technology (version 2.0) and increasing the capacity, throughput, efficiency, and security of the network.
• Completed the installation of a new Joint Exercise Control Group capability in Pentagon to provide initial Interagency integration home station support for participation of Joint and Combatant Command collective training events.
• Completed planning phase of the Virtual Collective Training Environment project. This project will capitalize on emerging capabilities in Department of Defense's Virtual World Framework and 21st century Web technologies to deliver an initial capability release (prototype) of a three-dimensional Virtualized Collective Training Environment that supports the ability to exercise command and control systems and tactical voice radio systems in a Cloud enabled virtual environment supporting Joint, Service, Combatant Command, and experimentation/test communities. The prototype is an initial subset of emulated real world command and control systems embedded in a virtual world environment that mirrors the capabilities and facilities of a live Joint Operations Center.  This virtual Joint Operations Center will be a prototype for future capabilities integrated into the next generation joint training environment.
• Completed communication technologies research and development initiative to facilitate the distribution of mixed reality training around the globe. This facilitates home-station operations vice having to relocate operators to remote locations.  The technologies ensure warfighter’s pre-deployment training closely replicates real-world operations.
•  Continued development of the Joint After Action Review Resource Library to improve stability and usability to enhance near-real time and post event Live-Virtual-Constructive assessment of Joint Warfighter’s performance.

To comply with DOD IT enterprise direction, deliver a future modeling and simulation training environment reliant on cloud-enabled modular services with an initial capability in fiscal year 2016, and operational capability in fiscal year 2019.

Conduct Joint Live Virtual Constructive 2020 Integration Event #1.

•  Research and define the future joint training enterprise communications and information services construct of the Joint Training Enterprise Architecture and develop a Systems Engineering Plan supporting the architecture development effort. The goal is to align the joint training enterprise with Department of Defense Joint Information Enterprise project to comply with Department guidance and provide agile and adaptive Joint training capabilities supporting warfighter requirements while reducing overall operating and sustainment costs.
•  Continue planning, research, and development of a prototype cloud computing and virtualization environment supporting the Joint Training Enterprise Architecture.
In coordination with the Services and Combatant Commands, develop a Joint Training Enterprise Architecture concept of operations document to describe how the future Joint Training Environment will support Joint Force Development in 2020.
• Develop modular mix and match integration of simulation activity and Master Scenario Event List events to simplify and reduce manpower through automation within the Joint Live, Virtual, and Constructive modeling and simulation federation.
• Continue to enhance Joint Logistics modeling within the Joint Live Virtual Constructive modeling and simulation federation to increase realism of logistics planning and execution in training by providing simulated in transit visibility of logistics
• Demonstrate Joint Training Enterprise Network capability from the Pentagon in a scheduled Joint, Service, or Combatant Command event that has interagency involvement. This proof of concept demonstration allows interagency organizations to participate from the Pentagon rather than from a down range location.  
• Virtual Collective Training Environment will complete Phase 2, Proof of Concept.  The primary objectives of this phase are to refine the requirements established in Phase 1, develop and deliver additional architectural products, perform the bulk of the project’s systems engineering and software development, and conduct a proof of concept demonstration.  This demonstration investigates Virtual World Framework capabilities, assesses these capabilities against mission requirements, and conducts a comparative analysis.  The fundamental questions to be answered are how well virtual world technologies satisfy collective joint training requirements; how these technologies can be quickly adapted to meet new training requirements; and what the overall cost is to employ these technologies compared to current practices within collective joint training.
•  Continue Joint Training Enterprise Network Test Bed systems certification, product evaluation, network problem replication and troubleshooting, to be conducted off the production network.  The test bed significantly mitigates risk to the operational network, permits simultaneous test and evaluation without impact to exercise events, and permits fielding capabilities at a much quicker rate than waiting for windows of availability on the production network. 
• Expand the visibility, accessibility and reuse of modeling and simulation data by developing an initial operating capability that provides consumers the ability to search for and down load Order Of Battle data from different sources.
• Evaluate the potential of standard web-based services combined with Virtual World type technologies to support Joint Training using emulated command and control systems.
• Research services in the area of system-of-system interoperability in joint training and experimentation including command and control, sensor and robotic to simulation interoperability.
• Evaluation and development of methods supporting initialization, orchestration and composition of Live, Virtual, and Constructive systems using Coalition Battle Management Services.</r2:Text>

•  Continue to build the Joint Training Enterprise Architecture decomposing modeling and simulation, networking and Information Technology applications into a cloud-enabled modular service supporting Combatant Command and Service Joint training requirements. 
• Virtual Collective Training Environment will complete development of the prototype system:  Phase 3 will focus on development and delivery of a prototype Virtual Worlds Framework capability (Capability Release 1).  In anticipation that Joint Staff J7’s proposal for the Modeling and Simulation Coordination Office High Level Task is approved, Capability Release 1 will be realized through the Command and Control Systems in Virtual Environments initiative.  Command and Control Systems in Virtual Environments will integrate the Virtual Worlds Framework into the emerging next generation joint training environment to create an adaptive virtual environment that enables joint force development for Commanders, staffs, units, and personnel.  Command and Control Systems in Virtual Environments will employ cloud-enabled modular simulation services that will provide joint warfighters the ability to rapidly access and compose M&amp;S capabilities to meet specific joint requirements, and then deliver that capability how, when and where required. 
• Based on discovery identified with the initial cloud capabilities research, continue development on next phase of cloud-enabled modular services in support of delivering modeling and simulation services supporting Joint Force Development and Joint Live Virtual Constructive 2020 modeling and simulation capability. This effort will contribute to the long range modeling and simulation development and training strategy.
• Based on discovery identified with the initial data strategy on reuse of modeling and simulation data by developing and initial operating capability that provides consumers the ability to search for and down load Order Of Battle data from different sources; expand development into geospatial services.
• Based on discovery identified with research on web-based services using Virtual World type technologies to support Joint Training using emulated command and control systems, expand research to support additional Joint Training use cases.

They are tasked to develop a Joint Individual Training Toolkit of web-enabled individual and small group training products and services.  Products and services are developed in response to OSD(P&amp;R) CE2T2 Program Goals &amp; Objectives guidance, CJCS High Interest Training Items, Joint Staff J7 training priorities, and JKDDC Joint Knowledge Online (JKO) Stakeholder (CCMDs, Services, and Combat Support Agencies) prioritized training requirements.  JKDDC JKO supports a career-long joint learning continuum, joint professional military education and tailored common training standards to Service members for tasks that are jointly executed, resulting in trained, capable, and interoperable joint forces.  JKDDC JKO technology initiatives principally include Small Group Scenario Trainer (SGST) desk top modeling &amp; simulation based training, OSD requested virtual worlds training prototype, and mobile “pilot” courseware training devices.  These capabilities facilitate the training and preparation of tens of thousands of military and civilian personnel deploying to CCMD theaters of operation prior to serving in their assigned Combined/Joint Task Force (C/JTF) billets. Specifically, C/JTF ‘battle staffs’ will be adequately trained, as individuals and the staffs collectively, based on SGST development and implementation throughout the joint training enterprise. JKO mobile “pilot” courseware training device development facilitates the global distribution of web-based joint training content on portable, hand-held platforms for joint warriors.  The future virtual worlds learning environment will provide training and learning to promote adaptability and agility in the workforce with the capability to tailor and adapt instructional material to fit the learner's strengths and weaknesses, learning style, and level of proficiency.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Based on the FY11 success with VCAT South America training utility in the SOUTCHCOM AOR, SOUTHCOM required an enhanced training product focusing on 5 expanded mission scenarios, in the Andean Ridge geographic region, integrating Defense Language Institute (DLI) approved language training content, while simultaneously demonstrating an improved capability to deliver training via an innovative training technique on JKO.
•  Continued to operationalize JKO training simulation by developing SGST version 3, a small group training capability focused on improving the training readiness of individuals and small joint headquarters staffs.  Version 2 enhanced joint warrior provided recommendations from version 1, and targeted development of six additional SGST scenario use cases for representative JTF staffs, all designed to complement existing Combatant Command mission rehearsal exercises in preparation for deployment to their respective theaters of operation.  Version 3 increased training audience participant size to 40 concurrent players (vice current 8-10).  Additionally, users are now able to create their training scenarios more efficiently with minimal resources.  Thousands of joint, interagency, intergovernmental and multinational participants will be better trained as individuals and collectively as small teams prior to and during deployment in CCMD environments.
•  Developed mobile “pilot” training device capabilities based on JKO high payoff courseware. Completed courses include Cross Culture Competency Trainer, Virtual Cultural Awareness Trainer + Language Afghanistan, US Army’s Headstart2 Language Training, US Forces Korea Theater Specific Training, US SOUTHCOM’s Human Rights Awareness, &amp; Operational Swahili training products.  These joint training courses will be playable from the JKO web-based desktop and from iOS and Android operating systems based portable, hand-help devices (phones and tablets).</r2:Text>

Joint Staff J-7, in collaboration with USFK and appropriate Republic of Korea agencies, integrate Warfighters’ Simulation (WARSIM) into the JLVC Training Federation in order to field a functioning JLVC federation to USFK.  This new training environment will support the extensive ground order of battle required to accurately simulate operations on the Korean Peninsula.  It also maximizes existing JLVC training standards and investments, and fully leverages Service training capabilities and roadmaps.  This solution will provide the initial effort to link coalition training architectures into the JLVC as well.  It will also promotes the Joint Training Environment vision and goals and implement selected pieces of recommendations identified in the LVC report, the Flagship Study.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This ensures the Joint Force Trainer capabilities development effort synchronizes with warfighter requirements.  Performance metrics include, but are not limited to; time, money, realism, and fidelity as defined below:

•  Time – Will the effort enable the Joint Force Trainer to prepare and execute training more timely than current capabilities allow?
•  Cost – Will the effort enable the Joint Force Trainer to prepare and execute training at a more effective and efficient cost than current capabilities allow?
•  Realism – Will the effort enable the Joint Force Trainer to create a training environment that is closer to the real world environment than current capabilities allow?
•  Fidelity – Will the effort enable the Joint Force Trainer to create more detailed capabilities in the training environment than current capabilities allow?

The Performance Improvement and Information Management Board is the strategic forum where the outcomes of performance relative to our external customers, stakeholders, and strategic stewardship of resources are the focus of discussion.  Performance against the targets will be assessed and reported monthly, briefed quarterly to the FMB/CAMB, and rolled up into the JCW Joint Training End-of-Fiscal Year Performance Report to ensure transparency and accountability.

This ensures the Joint Force Trainer capabilities development effort synchronizes with warfighter requirements.  Performance metrics include, but are not limited to; time, money, realism, and fidelity as defined below:

•  Navy will produce one JSAF software release to include documentation; will design and implement upgrades to JSAF consistent with approved requirements and CRs and document the effects of JSAF capabilities (robustness) and stability.  Will design, implement, test, and integrate JSAF enhancements in accordance with requirements.

•  Navy will produce one Navy Training Federation Object Model (FOM) (NTF) release to include applicable documentation updates for the Guidance, Rational, and Interoperability Manual (GRIM) and Federation Agreement document (FAD). Will implement JSAF capability enhancements to support evolving joint and Coalition training requirements.

•  Navy will deliver a JSAF/JNTC-JLVC FOM interoperability Guide.

•  Navy will facilitate integration by providing dedicated support to the effort, improving the quality of participation and documentation of Navy efforts in the JNTC.  Refine and mature the Navy Training Federation Object Model (NTF), it is improving interoperability and integration with other services and the Joint community.  Provides a standardized FOM for integration across the Navy training simulations.

•  Navy’s current Joint Live-Virtual-Constructive (JLVC) and other federation simulation distribution is accomplished by tying simulation data to multicast groups. This is neither a scalable solution nor is it an effective one as federates are not able to publish and subscribe with fine enough precision. The Simulation Aware Software Router will address this shortcoming, and additionally provide a flexible solution for federating heterogeneous networks and on-the-wire protocols without forcing all federates onto a single, uniform, lowest common denominator solution for each training event.  Ultimately, a simulation aware router will allow simulation users to optimize the network for both simulation scalable traffic and for voice and Command, Control, Communications, (Computers), Intelligence (C4I) traffic.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense-wide Industrial Base Analysis and Sustainment (IBAS) program element provides the Department with a comprehensive ability to achieve the strategic goal of strengthening the industrial base in support of DoD supply chain and defense manufacturing requirements. This program maintains or improves the health of essential parts of the defense industry to avoid reconstitution costs for capability after a Defense procurement hiatus on major investment programs or critical supply chain products where affordable and innovative mechanisms are available to work with the producers in the interim.

A stated purpose of the program is to provide for sustainment of the industrial base through a break in production.  Criteria for project selection will include factors such as 1) identifiable path of preservation, transformation or innovation between an existing capability and a capability with a very high probability of being needed in the short to medium term (&lt; 5 years); 2) loss of the capability is likely in the absence of the proposed project; 3) analysis showing that the project results in a lower overall cost to the department than if capability is developed from scratch when needed; and 4) preference is given to projects supporting multiple programs or services with no clearly identifiable principle beneficiary.

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>OSD Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (AT&amp;L) investments under this program are informed by the Department's industrial assessment tools to include the Sector by Sector, Tier by Tier (S2T2) repository of defense industrial base information maintained by Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (Manufacturing and Industrial Base Policy) (DASD(MIBP)).  These tools collaboratively identify elements of the industrial base where current acquisition programs will not invest enough in production and/or research to support the minimum sustaining rate that would keep critical suppliers viable.  While industrial base risks identified through these assessment tools are to be mitigated primarily through direct engagement with military departments, agencies, and industry, exceptional cases will require defense-wide intervention via investment accounts, often in collaboration with multiple Services and agencies, to ensure adequate industrial capability to support future defense needs.

This funding is a key tool for addressing supply chain risks and diminishing manufacturing sources.  Investments are prioritized though a careful analysis at every tier of the supply chain according to a numerical scale of risk-area's fragility and criticality.  Criticality examines characteristics that make a specific product or service difficult to replace if disrupted; fragility examines characteristics that make small deviations in the status quo likely to have substantial effects on an industry / supplier.  These concepts underpin AT&amp;L’s core mission and inform critical investment, budgetary, and programmatic decision-making.

Projects will have impact across all industrial base sectors: aircraft; Command, Control, Communications and Computers (C4); missiles; ground vehicles; radar &amp; Electronic Warfare (EW) and others.  Projects will be improvements of existing capabilities with a very high probability of success.

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program addresses developing an integrated and interconnected Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) capabilities-based system that defines and enables a comprehensive, global awareness and readiness for CWMD steady-state and surge postures. The diverse and complex Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) – nuclear, biological and chemical threats – mission space requires an integrated approach towards capability development. Capability development must be based on a systems perspective that links strategic objectives with interrelated tasks and associated capabilities. The broad CWMD military strategic objectives and mission areas encompass many nontraditional capabilities for the Warfighter, and CWMD is not an isolated mission set unique to DoD – it is intertwined with counter-terrorism and homeland defense. Accordingly, developing an overall CWMD capability should and must leverage complementary capabilities through integration and synchronization. A global CWMD situational awareness capability will be established and deployed worldwide via current communications systems and common operating pictures in support of this mission.  This program will incorporate portfolio management tools and comprehensive analyses to enable a balanced and integrated CWMD systems portfolio, an optimized CWMD force structure, and the integration with and utilization of existing military assets to fill intelligence, sensor and reconnaissance gaps in CWMD.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Training, Materiel, Leadership and Education, Personnel and Facilities (DOTMLPF) capability elements into a coherent package for employment by joint commanders.
The JI&amp;I Program provide resources for a wide range of efforts to define, refine, and deploy integrated joint capabilities. JI&amp;I-funded endeavors aim to improve US and
coalition capabilities to conduct coordinated operations. Necessarily, JI&amp;I-funded projects most frequently address Command &amp; Control (C2) and Command, Control,
Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) - the capstone capabilities for integrating disparate elements of military force for joint and coalition operations. The JI&amp;I Program supports tasks and projects associated with integration &amp; interoperability of the C2 Portfolio including coordination of C2 operational architectures, standards, and policies. Likewise, JI&amp;I partially funds integration and decision support activities associated with DOD executive level C4 management and oversight.

The JI&amp;I Program delivers outcomes conforming to joint integration missions:
̶ In concert with the separately funded Joint Systems Integration Command (JSIC) and Joint Fires Integration Interoperability Team (JFIIT), JI&amp;I resources investigate
joint C2/C4ISR shortfalls and ascertain characteristics of DOTMLPF remedies to meet mission requirements. The remedies are then pursued through partnerships with Component force development authorities and acquisition sponsors.
̶ Consistent with the role as operational sponsor for joint C2, JI&amp;I underwrites Joint Combat Capability Developer (JCCD) activities compiling operational requirements
for C2/C4ISR capability development and integrated testing.
̶ Delivers assessment and recommendations for improvement of interoperable Combat Identification (CID) and Situational Awareness (SA) capabilities among United
States forces, interagency organizations, and allied/coalition forces.
̶ Establishes joint data standards and cross domain solutions to facilitate future system interoperability and integration. Joint Integration and Interoperability Program
(JI&amp;I) funds efforts to identify critical characteristics of joint military capabilities and synchronize Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership and Education,
Personnel and Facilities (DOTMLPF) capability elements into a coherent package for employment by joint commanders.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Critical Infrastructure Program (DCIP) is a Department of Defense (DoD) risk management program that seeks to ensure the availability of networked assets critical to DoD missions, to include DoD and non-DoD, domestic and foreign infrastructures essential to planning, mobilizing, deploying, executing, and sustaining United States military operations on a global basis.  Through identifying Defense Critical Assets, assessing them to determine vulnerabilities, incorporating specific threat and hazard information and analysis, and visually displaying relevant infrastructure data and analysis, DoD will be positioned to make risk management decisions to ensure the appropriate infrastructure is available, when needed, to support DoD missions.

Specifically, Combatant Commands (COCOMs) are responsible for identifying the mission capability requirements and coordinating with the Military Departments, Defense Agencies, DoD Field Activities, and Defense Sector Lead Agents to identify and assess Defense Critical Assets. As asset owners and capability providers, the Secretaries of the Military Departments and the Directors of Defense Agencies and DoD Field Activities, coordinate with the COCOMs to identify and prioritize the assets required to support mission-essential functions. Asset owners will also assess identified Defense Critical Assets to identify vulnerabilities and apply appropriate remediation and mitigation measures. The Defense Sector Lead Agents are responsible for identifying the specific functions, systems, assets (DoD and non-DoD owned), and interdependencies within the Defense Sector infrastructure networks supporting the identified critical missions.

Each Defense Sector Lead Agent, as identified in DoDD 3020.40, represents one of ten (10) functional areas that provide support to the Combatant Commanders and asset owners. These functional areas are as follows:  defense industrial base (DIB); financial services; global information grid (GIG); health affairs; intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR); logistics; personnel; public works; space; and transportation.  

In addition, DCIP manages specific analytic efforts in the identification and maintenance of specific inter- and intra-dependencies DpD has on the foundational commercial infrastructure networks supporting the identified critical missions.  Specific analytic efforts are focused within six (6) commercial infrastructure areas:  energy (electric power, natural gas); chemicals; transportation; telecommunications; water; and petroleum, oil, lubricants (POL).

                                                        <r2:Remarks>The Defense Critical Infrastructure Program (DCIP) is a Department of Defense (DoD) risk management program that seeks to ensure the availability of networked
assets critical to DoD missions, to include DoD and non-DoD, domestic and foreign infrastructures essential to planning, mobilizing, deploying, executing, and
sustaining United States military operations on a global basis. Through identifying Defense Critical Assets, assessing them to determine vulnerabilities, incorporating
specific threat and hazard information and analysis, and visually displaying relevant infrastructure data and analysis, DoD will be positioned to make risk management
decisions to ensure the appropriate infrastructure is available, when needed, to support DoD missions.  Specifically, Combatant Commands (COCOMs) are responsible for identifying the mission capability requirements and coordinating with the Military Departments,
Defense Agencies, DoD Field Activities, and Defense Sector Lead Agents to identify and assess Defense Critical Assets. As asset owners and capability providers,
the Secretaries of the Military Departments and the Directors of Defense Agencies and DoD Field Activities, coordinate with the COCOMs to identify and prioritize the
assets required to support mission-essential functions. Asset owners will also assess identified Defense Critical Assets to identify vulnerabilities and apply appropriate
remediation and mitigation measures. The Defense Sector Lead Agents are responsible for identifying the specific functions, systems, assets (DoD and non-DoD
owned), and interdependencies within the Defense Sector infrastructure networks supporting the identified critical missions.
Each Defense Sector Lead Agent, as identified in DoDD 3020.40, represents one of ten (10) functional areas that provide support to the Combatant Commanders
and asset owners. These functional areas are as follows: defense industrial base (DIB); financial services; global information grid (GIG); health affairs; intelligence,
surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR); logistics; personnel; public works; space; and transportation.
In addition, DCIP manages specific analytic efforts in the identification and maintenance of specific inter- and intra-dependencies DpD has on the foundational
commercial infrastructure networks supporting the identified critical missions. Specific analytic efforts are focused within six (6) commercial infrastructure areas:
energy (electric power, natural gas); chemicals; transportation; telecommunications; water; and petroleum, oil, lubricants (POL).</r2:Remarks>

The LTC Program will provide rigorously analyzed competitive strategy recommendations to these senior DoD leaders, and will require the support of organizations and experts outside of government to deliver the highest quality analysis, concepts and recommendations.  Funding for the LTC program will be used to: bring outside experts into Task Force working groups and strategy review teams; contract studies; support wargaming and workshops; conduct analytical studies of key developments and dynamics, and their impact on the future security environment and U.S. military capabilities in that environment; and explore new approaches to addressing key analytical requirements.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>As a Department efficiency the ASD(NII) was disestablished on January 11, 2012.  Starting in FY2013 the funding in PE 0604771D8Z JTIDS associated with communications and information networks architecture, strategy and policy; and frequency spectrum analysis and management was transferred to this PE (PE 0305199D8Z Net Centricity) and aligned under the office of the DoD Chief Information Officer (DoD CIO).

Funds will be used to provide technical, systems engineering and capability management oversight of programs, projects and activities to maximize the Department’s return on investment in information technology resources and affect a comprehensive approach for assessing and procuring critical information systems from initial design, through development to capability delivery in support of improved systems performance and military operations. Emphasis is placed on the information transport, information assurance, net and spectrum management, command and control (C2) applications and services, information sharing capabilities, and enterprise services activities focused on the development, integration, testing and technical assessment of capabilities and applications in joint and coalition warfighter support environments.  Resources support collaborative efforts to demonstrate the interoperability and performance requirements of command, control, communication, computing network, and Information Infrastructure (C4&amp;II) capabilities and programs.  This program is funded under Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development.  

     This project provides the resources necessary to implement net centric processes and authoritative analytic methods that provide the capability to synchronize interdependent capabilities across all layers (ground, air, space) of the joint information environment architecture, to forecast and achieve a balance in supply and demand for network capacity, and field effective capabilities more rapidly and efficiently as an enabler for C4&amp;II capabilities applications and services.  Resources are required to transform current networks into an operationally unified and architecturally diverse joint information environment that will provide end-to-end communications transport layer, computing networks, and mission application capabilities that are optimized and integrated with all other joint capability areas with a focus on the tactical edge faced with disconnected, intermittent, and latency (DIL) environments.  There will be technical assessments, modeling and simulation, and analysis of the Joint space communications layer, Joint aerial network layer, contested communications on the move, Position Navigation and Timing (PNT), and C2 mission application capabilities.  These funds develop the capability for the warfighter to manage and deconflict radio frequencies through ground, air, and space communication networks.  The funds will be used to develop and synchronize information assurance capabilities with other joint information environment capabilities to provide secure access to information and services (e.g. Cryptographic Modernization Management plan).  
     In addition, funding will continue to be used to support the Defense Information System's Agency's (DISA) and Services' interoperable improvement efforts and processes in the development of common standards and protocols.  This effort includes initiating the Joint Interoperability Enhancement Process (IEP) that allows operators, engineers, and program managers to verify capabilities and identify issues in a design with Joint /Allied units prior to system fielding, or with fielded systems to identify required systems changes for systems upgrade planning.  DISA and the Joint Forces Combatant Command lead the effort to transform the current standards and interoperability management tools to a common set of Joint network-enabled standards to ensure adherence to the Global Information Grid (GIG) enterprise-wide technical baseline and for implementation of future Tactical Data Link (TDL) capabilities. These joint standards, protocols, and processes will be used for implementation and testing to ensure the TDL capabilities are synchronized with the development and integration timelines of other planned network-enabled Global Information Grid (GIG) initiatives.  The threats to the networking waveforms and the Joint NC migration will also be looked at in cooperation with the Intelligence agencies.

     In addition, funding will continue to be used to support the Defense Information System's Agency's (DISA) and Services' interoperable improvement efforts and processes in the development of common standards and protocols.  This effort includes initiating the Joint Interoperability Enhancement Process (IEP) that allows operators, engineers, and program managers to verify capabilities and identify issues in a design with Joint /Allied units prior to system fielding, or with fielded systems to identify required systems changes for systems upgrade planning.  DISA and the Joint Forces Combatant Command lead the effort to transform the current standards and interoperability management tools to a common set of Joint network-enabled standards to ensure adherence to the Global Information Grid (GIG) enterprise-wide technical baseline and for implementation of future Tactical Data Link (TDL) capabilities. These joint standards, protocols, and processes will be used for implementation and testing to ensure the TDL capabilities are synchronized with the development and integration timelines of other planned network-enabled Global Information Grid (GIG) initiatives.  The threats to the networking waveforms and the Joint NC migration will also be looked at in cooperation with the Intelligence agencies.

Research and Development will provide increased intelligence information sharing capabilities in support of US and coalition forces utilizing the US BICES and NATO virtual networks within the Afghanistan theater and provide increased database information via Distributed Common Ground System - Army (DCGS-A).  Provides an increase in intelligence disciplines (Imagery Intelligence (IMINT), Signal Intelligence (SIGINT), and potential Human Intelligence (HUMINT)) in support of US and Allied/Coalition forces that currently is very limited to the warfighter.  Increased intelligence advanced analytics tools will be migrated from Joint Intelligence Operations Center (JIOC)-IT and DI2E developments and will significantly increase the timeliness of intelligence and bring US BICES/NATO Special Operations Forces Headquarters (NSHQ) /NATO Intelligence Fusion Center (NIFC) capabilities into the current technology baselines.  Develops and provides a federated TNE that incorporates the Asian Pacific Intelligence Information Network (APIIN) being developed to support the National Defense Strategy as we move out of Afghanistan and into the Pacific.  Provides multi-level security intelligence bi-laterals and multi-laterals to meet Combatant Commander Integrated Priority Lists.  Develops the Coalition Partner Network for CENTCOM, the Coalition Information Exchange Network (CIEN) for SOUTHCOM, and the Coalition Partner Network for EUCOM and AFRICOM.   Develops the US BICES connections with these bi-lateral and multi-lateral federated TNEs that make up the US BICES - Extended (US BICES-X) Enterprise Network in support of Commander SOCOM requirements for conventional and coalition operations as the US migrates into other Combatant Command regions. </r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                                                <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Assessment  and Analysis -  Can it easily be adapted or adjusted to meet the current or projected capabilities gap for Allied or Coalition Intelligence Information Sharing and for the Intelligence integration into the Future Mission Network.  
Realism – Allows exploration of new environments and capabilities through participation in exercise environments that utilize bi-lateral and multi-lateral intelligence enterprise solutions such as US BICES-X.
Advancement -  Increases the current capabilities for the sharing of intelligence information and determines if it actually adds functionality in support of Combatant Commanders requirements through exercises such as Unified Vision, Enterprise Challange, and the MAJIIC (multi-sensor aerospace ground joint intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance interoperability coalition) exercises. 
Utility -  Can it be integrated into the existing national or multinational architectures in a timely and cost effective manner and does it increase the discovery and dissemination of intelligence information to the Allies or Coalition forces.
