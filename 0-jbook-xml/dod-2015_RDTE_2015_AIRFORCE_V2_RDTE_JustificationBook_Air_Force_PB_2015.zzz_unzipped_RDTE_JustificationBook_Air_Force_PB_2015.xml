In FY 2015, Project Number 643479 (Advanced Sensor Exploitation), Project Number 643480 (Automated Imagery Exploitation), Project Number 643481 (Knowledge Based Tech for Intelligence), and Project Number 643482 (Science &amp; Tech Intelligence Methodology), transferred to Project Number 64536A, IET, in order to increase management efficiency, reduce administrative actions, and minimize effort duplication.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Intelligence Advanced Development (IAD) develops and demonstrates technology required to support warfighter needs for timely all source intelligence information. IAD supports global awareness, consistent battlespace knowledge, precision information, and the execution of time critical missions. IAD projects provide better on-time information to the warfighter using new and existing data sources, streamlining data analysis, reducing footprint required, and extending life of sensors in place and enhancing performance.  The Air Force Research Lab, Rome Research Site, Information and Intelligence Exploitation Division (AFRL/RIE), develops prototype applications for evaluation in a realistic operating environment.  The programs are oriented toward specific shortfalls and deficiencies as documented by the Major Commands (MAJCOMS), unified commands, and intelligence organizations in their mission and functional area plans. This PE expedites technology transition from the laboratory to operational users via rapid prototyping, focusing on technology insertion correcting AF intelligence deficiencies at the tactical and operational levels. This PE bridges the technology transition from Advanced Technology Demonstrations (ATDs) and Integrated Technology Thrust Programs (ITTPs) to current/new systems, and also supports associated Defense Technology Objectives (DTOs). IAD may also reallocate existing resources to support out-of-cycle new/updated warfighter requirements. 

Requirements for this PE are identified and prioritized by the Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Agency (AFISRA). Development of new/improved capabilities to meet these requirements is managed by AFRL/RIE. Prototype products, usually in the form of software, are provided to the users for operational environment evaluation. 

This Program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The project objectives are to develop, demonstrate and evaluate a near-real-time all source correlation/fusion capability by applying state-of-the-art data processing techniques for the receipt, correlation, templating, and analysis of battlefield information.  Prototypes will be developed in an open systems architecture environment allowing for the greatest efficiency in terms of integrating or interfacing with other systems.  There are Air Force, DoD, and Coalition requirements to correlate various sources of intelligence information [Communications Intelligence (COMINT), Electronic Intelligence (ELINT), Imagery Intelligence (IMINT) and Measurement and Signature Intelligence - (MASINT)] within seconds/minutes vs. hours/days with current manual and semi-automated methods.  The project includes development of data correlation and predictive intelligence algorithms as well as target analysis and prioritization, air order of battle update, and tactical analysis techniques.  This computerized approach will speed up the correlation of data from diverse sources of intelligence information, including COMINT, ELINT, IMINT and MASINT, providing faster situational awareness and threat assessment, and replacing manual systems with automated capabilities.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project demonstrates and validates the capability to more accurately and quickly interpret digital imagery and video by developing/evaluating computer-assisted techniques to manipulate and overlay imagery, cartographic data, signals intelligence (SIGINT), and on-line intelligence data.  The result of this effort will provide the operator precise target locations and identifications, precise target reference scenes, and more accurate damage assessments, which were developed for easy supportability on low-cost, commercially-available computer workstations.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project improves global awareness, dynamic planning, and execution by providing information repositories and inference engines (computer program) to exploit collected data for nine major commands and Air Force intelligence organizations.  Development of analytical aids is based on artificial intelligence techniques.  Increased timeliness, efficiency and effectiveness will provide enhanced warning time and accuracy, allowing national/military authorities a greater range of options to avert, diminish or control a crisis.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>In FY 2015, Project Number 64536A, Intelligence Exploitation Tools (IET), transferred from PE 0603260F [Intelligence Advanced Development (IAD)], Project Number 643479 (Advanced Sensor Exploitation), Project Number 643480 (Automated Imagery Exploitation), Project Number 643481 (Knowledge Based Tech for Intelligence), and Project Number 643482 (Science &amp; Tech Intelligence Methodology), in order to increase management efficiency, reduce administrative actions, and minimize activity duplication.

In FY2015, Project Number 64536A, Intelligence Exploitation Tools (IET), includes four new start efforts:  Private Assistant for Individual Relegation (PAIR), Feature and Pattern Recognition and Parsing to Text- Foreign Audio Video Operations (FAVOR) II, Increased SIGINT On-Board Analysis (ISOBA), and Global Architecture for Mission Reporting and Analysis (GAMRA).</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Intelligence Exploitation Tools (IET) prototyping encompasses several areas of intelligence exploitation including the advancement of all source correlation and fusion prototypes for the intelligence analyst, thus enhancing the overall situational awareness for Air Force, DoD, and Coalition groups which have requirements to correlate various sources of intelligence information, including COMINT, ELINT, IMINT, GEOINT, MASINT, MOVINT and others, in a timely manner. 

This project also addresses the accurate and timely interpretation of digital imagery and video by developing and evaluating techniques to manipulate and overlay imagery, cartographic data, SIGINT, and digital intelligence data. Analytical cross domain tools, which provide enhanced warning and accuracy and allow national and military authorities a greater range of options to avert, diminish or control a crisis, are also developed in this project. 

In addition, methods to improve analysis of current and future foreign weapon systems, thus preventing technological surprise to our warfighters, are explored in this project.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Requirements for new/improved techniques for operational employment of simulation models are identified and prioritized by the Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Agency (AFISRA), formerly the Air Intelligence Agency. Development of the new/improved capabilities to meet these requirements is managed by AF Research Laboratory (Rome Research Site). Prototype products (usually software), once evaluated by the users, are transitioned from the laboratory to operational community in spirals. All major contracts within this project are awarded after full and open competition.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

In FY2015, Project Number 64537A, IAC, includes a new start effort:  Activity Based Intelligence Indications &amp; Warning.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Intelligence Analysis Capabilities (IAC) provides continuing development and upgrades of threat analysis capabilities to produce integrated, predictive air and space intelligence to enable military operations, force modernization decisions, and policy making.  Products from IAC allow the Intelligence Analyst to accelerate and increase the accuracy of threat estimates and system descriptions to deployed operational forces.  IAC tools and algorithms provide NASIC and the 453rd EWS with the ability to produce accurate, predictive, relevant, and timely intelligence that supports client processes, operational planning, and mission execution.  IAC develops new and upgraded analysis, modeling and simulation tools focused on intelligence production supporting AF operational and developmental all source analysis functions. 

Each of the development projects within the IAC program portfolio transition technologies to the operational communities through the incremental release of upgraded versions over a period of years as development projects progress towards the final configuration. IAC may reallocate existing resources to support out-of-cycle new/updated warfighter requirements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Integrated Base Defense Security Systems (IBDSS) develops, demonstrates, and tests Physical Security Equipment (PSE) systems to include Force Protection.  This program supports the protection of tactical, fixed, and nuclear weapons systems, AF personnel and AF facilities.  The PSE program is organized to provide PSE RDT&amp;E for Air Force specific needs but as a complement to and in conjunction with the PSE RDT&amp;E programs funded by the DOD Physical Security Enterprise and Analysis Group (PSEAG).  As such this program will develop, demonstrate, and test PSE in the same manner and to the same standards and architecture as PSEAG funded projects to ensure interoperability with PSEAG developed PSE.  In development of PSE, this RDT&amp;E program includes spectrum planning for radio frequency (RF), communication security (cyber), and information assurance requirements.  This Program Element also includes funding for Force Protection (FP) Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (FP COTS) market research, evaluation and testing.  The FP COTS testing applies to all available technologies (delay, denial, detection, assessment, communication display, access control and power) which are considered effective for AF physical security use.  This program supports the maintenance and test support at Site C-3 and the Cold Weather Test Site (CWTS), as annotated in DoD Directive 3200.11, listing the 46th Test Wing as a Major Range and Test facility, conducting developmental and operational testing as the primary mission.

This program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Integrated Base Defense Security Systems (IBDSS) develops, demonstrates, and tests Physical Security Equipment (PSE) systems to include Force Protection.  This program supports the protection of tactical, fixed, and nuclear weapons systems, AF personnel and AF facilities.  The PSE program is organized to provide PSE RDT&amp;E for Air Force specific needs but as a complement to and in conjunction with the PSE RDT&amp;E programs funded by the DOD Physical Security Enterprise and Analysis Group (PSEAG).  As such this program will develop, demonstrate, and test PSE in the same manner and to the same standards and architecture as PSEAG funded projects to ensure interoperability with PSEAG developed PSE.  In development of PSE, this RDT&amp;E program includes spectrum planning for radio frequency (RF), communication security (cyber), and information assurance requirements.  This Program Element also includes funding for Force Protection (FP) Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (FP COTS) market research, evaluation and testing.  The FP COTS testing applies to all available technologies (delay, denial, detection, assessment, communication display, access control and power) which are considered effective for AF physical security use.  This program supports the maintenance and test support at Site C-3 and the Cold Weather Test Site (CWTS), as annotated in DoD Directive 3200.11, listing the 46th Test Wing as a Major Range and Test facility, conducting developmental and operational testing as the primary mission.

This program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY2014, Project 644050, Advanced MILSATCOM, and Project 64A030, Evolved AEHF MILSATCOM, efforts transferred to PE 0605431F, Advanced EHF MILSATCOM (Space), Project 657103, Advanced MILSATCOM, and Project 657104, Evolved AEHF MILSATCOM, in order to transition to Budget Activity 5.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Develop and acquire Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM) satellites, mission control segment and cryptography for survivable, anti-jam, worldwide, secure communications for the strategic and tactical warfighters.  AEHF satellites will replenish the existing EHF system (Milstar) providing much higher capacity and data rate (5x increase over Milstar II) capabilities.  AEHF is a cooperative program that includes International Partners (Canada, the United Kingdom, and the Kingdom of the Netherlands).    

Space Vehicle-1 (SV-1) launched on 14 August 2010.  SV-1 experienced a propulsion anomaly and was raised to its geostationary orbit using alternative orbit raising techniques.  SV-1 completed on-orbit test and transitioned to operations in March 2012.  SV-2 launched on 4 May 2012, successfully completed on-orbit testing in October 2012, and is under operational control as of 7 Nov 2012.
 
With SV-1 and SV-2 launched, the AEHF program has nearly completed its development phase and is now addressing obsolescence, production continuity, supplier stability and industrial base issues.  AEHF SV 5-6 are being procured using the Department of Defense (DoD) Efficient Space Procurement (ESP) concept.  The ESP concept is a procurement approach which seeks stable production and efficient sub-contractor product management through the block buy of two space vehicles at one time (as described in Advanced EHF MILSATCOM P-40 Exhibit).  

In addition, the ESP concept includes use of RDT&amp;E funding for a MILSATCOM Space Modernization Initiative (SMI) to fund engineering activities to reduce future production costs through manufacturing and producibility enhancements, improve capabilities through insertion of new technologies, and replace obsolete parts, crypto and materials.  The SMI efforts will provide opportunities for competition to develop potential technology upgrades at the component and system level for future satellites of the current or any follow-on system.  SMI efforts will include obsolescence management and mitigation, technology maturation, new components' qualification, subsystem and component prototyping, architecture and system concept studies (to include hosted payloads), and pathfinder efforts to address MILSATCOM capability gaps identified in the Joint Space Communications Layer (JSCL) Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) and the "Resilient Basis for SATCOM in Joint Operations" study.  The Protected Satellite Communications Services (PSCS) Analysis of Alternatives (AoA), using FY13 SMI funds, was initiated in Sep 2013.  The purpose of the PSCS AoA is to evaluate space and control segment architectures, along with the associated user segment, to address the required protected satellite communications capabilities in the nuclear, contested, and benign operating environments.

In FY14, due to a change in Budget Activity from 4 to 5, funds transfer to PE 0605431F, Projects 657103 and 657104. 

This program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes, because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Develop and acquire Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM) satellites, mission control segment and cryptography for survivable, anti-jam, worldwide, secure communications for the strategic and tactical warfighters.  AEHF satellites will replenish the existing EHF system (Milstar) providing much higher capacity and data rate (5x increase over Milstar II) capabilities.  

AEHF is a cooperative program that includes International Partners (Canada, the United Kingdom, and the Kingdom of the Netherlands).   
 
Space Vehicle-1 (SV-1) launched on 14 August 2010.  SV-1 experienced a propulsion anomaly and was raised to its geostationary orbit using alternative orbit raising techniques.  SV-1 completed on-orbit test and transitioned to operations in March 2012.  SV-2 launched on 4 May 2012, successfully completed on-orbit testing in October 2012, and is under operational control as of 7 Nov 2012.

In FY14, due to a change in Budget Activity from 4 to 5, funds transfer to PE 0605431F, Project 657103.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>In FY2014, Project 64A030, Evolved AEHF MILSATCOM, efforts transferred to PE 0605431F, Advanced EHF MILSATCOM (Space), Project 657104, Evolved AEHF MILSATCOM, in order to transition to Budget Activity 5.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project funds a MILSATCOM Space Modernization Initiative (SMI) which includes engineering activities that assess promising new components and systems to confirm their suitability (capable, affordable, and producible) for the MILSATCOM mission across the payload, terminal and network segments.  SMI is a near-term investment plan to invest in more affordable alternatives to evolve current MILSATCOM technologies, concepts, and capabilities to reduce obsolescence risks and improve affordability, resiliency, and responsiveness of replenishment programs, and identifies relevant commercial opportunities for potential hosted payload developments to demonstrate proof of concept for operations and future distributed architectures.  In addition, SMI begins acquisition capabilities supporting concept definitions and demos for protected tactical communications services, anti-jam enhanced theater antennas, and increased military wideband coverage and capacity.  

In FY14, due to a change in Budget Activity from 4 to 5, funds transfer to PE 0605431F, Project 657104.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Results of the RBS Study, briefed to the Defense Space Council (DSC), revealed that current protected satellite communications services did not meet all of the JSCL ICD requirements, to include the North Polar region. With capability gaps identified, lack of a post Enhanced Polar System (EPS) plan, and a need to determine how best to provision for protected MILSATCOM beyond the sixth AEHF satellite, the DSC recommended this Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) effort.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY2014, Project 644052, Polar Satellite Communications, efforts transferred to PE 0605432F, Polar MILSATCOM (Space), Project 657105, Polar Satellite Communications, in order to transition to Budget Activity 5.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element acquires the Polar Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM) system that provides protected communications (anti-jam and low probability of intercept and detection) for users in the north polar region.  

Through FY05, Polar Satellite Communications funded three low data rate (LDR) Milstar payloads on three classified host satellites as an expedited, interim solution for protected connectivity requirements in the north polar region (i.e., Interim Polar System (IPS)).  Two satellites with hosted payloads are required to provide the necessary 24-hour coverage.  The third payload went into operations in November 2008 to sustain the 24-hour coverage.  

In FY06, the DoD began funding the next generation Polar Satellite Communications capability with two more polar payloads via the same host vehicle type (i.e., Enhanced Polar System (EPS)).  The host spacecraft and the polar communications payloads required design modifications that replaced obsolete components and took advantage of the more capable Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) technology including the eXtended Data Rate (XDR) waveform.  The EPS Capability Development Document (CDD), approved by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council in September 2006, is based on a two-payload, hosted XDR program with operational availability in CY15 and CY17.  The EPS system is comprised of four segments: Payload, Ground Control, Gateway, and Terminal (acquired by each Service's Terminal Program Office).  

In FY11, the EPS CDD was updated to provide a stand-alone ground capability that was no longer fully integrated with AEHF.  The restructured program will deliver "IPS-like" capability with the XDR waveform, and a connection to the defense network.  The ground Control and Planning Segment (CAPS) contract was awarded late November 2012.  The program office conducted a CAPS Preliminary Design Review (PDR) in June FY13 and a Gateway Segment Critical Design Review September FY13.  An EPS system-level PDR was held 27-28 August 2013. 

In FY14, due to a change in Budget Activity from 4 to 5, funds transfer to PE 0605432F, Project 657105.

The Polar MILSATCOM program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Through FY05, Polar Satellite Communications funded three low data rate (LDR) Milstar payloads on three classified host satellites as an expedited, interim solution for protected connectivity requirements in the north polar region (i.e., Interim Polar System (IPS)).  Two satellites with hosted payloads are required to provide the necessary 24-hour coverage.  The third payload went into operations in November 2008 to sustain the 24-hour coverage.  

In FY06, the DoD began funding the next generation Polar Satellite Communications capability with two more polar payloads via the same host vehicle type (i.e., Enhanced Polar System (EPS)).  The host spacecraft and the polar communications payloads required design modifications that replaced obsolete components and took advantage of the more capable Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) technology including the eXtended Data Rate (XDR) waveform.  The EPS Capability Development Document (CDD), approved by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council in September 2006, is based on a two-payload, hosted XDR program with operational availability in CY15 and CY17.  The EPS system is comprised of four segments: Payload, Ground Control, Gateway, and Terminal (acquired by each Service's Terminal Program Office).  

In FY11, the EPS CDD was updated to provide a stand-alone ground capability that was no longer fully integrated with AEHF.  The restructured program will deliver "IPS-like" capability with the XDR waveform, and a connection to the defense network.  The ground Control and Planning Segment (CAPS) contract was awarded late November 2012.  The program office conducted a CAPS Preliminary Design Review (PDR) in June FY13 and a Gateway Segment Critical Design Review September FY13.  An EPS system-level PDR was held 27-28 August 2013. 

In FY14, due to a change in Budget Activity from 4 to 5, funds transfer to PE 0605432F, Project 657105.

The Polar MILSATCOM program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>Beginning in FY15 the Space Range (64A007) content and funding was transferred to PE 0606116F, Space Test and Training Range Development.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program supports a range of activities including technology planning, development, demonstrations and prototyping, as well as modeling, simulations and exercises to support development of tactics and procedures in the Space Control mission area.  The types of Space Control activities accomplished are Space Situational Awareness (SSA), Defensive Counterspace (DCS), Offensive Counterspace (OCS) and Command and Control (C2) and Battle Management.  For use in the Space Control mission area, SSA includes monitoring, detecting, identifying, tracking, assessing, verifying, categorizing, and characterizing, objects and events in space and includes terrestrial based space capabilities.  DCS includes defensive activities to protect U.S. and friendly space-systems assets, resources, and operations from enemy attempts to negate or interfere and prevention activities that limit or eliminate an adversary's ability to use U.S. space systems and services for purposes hostile to U.S. national security interests.  OCS activities disrupt, deny, degrade or destroy space systems, or the information and the technology they provide, which may be used for purposes hostile to U.S. national security interests.  Command &amp; Control efforts include identifying technology solutions to enable fusion of data for use in multi-level security environments, and near-real-time data delivery and decision support to war fighter needs.  This program supports the development of Rapid Reaction Capabilities in response to immediate warfighter needs, including Urgent Operational Needs (UONs) and Joint Urgent Operational Needs (JUONs), in the Space Control mission area.  

Funding also supports the development of the technology and infrastructure for space control elements in a live signal environment of the Space Test and Training Range (STTR).  This includes development and demonstration of first-ever test assets, special test equipment, capabilities and systems required to test, validate, and verify performance of integrated space control systems.  Additionally, this program supports the development of test range assets required to support developmental and operational test, exercises, training, and tactics development for space control systems in the face of an emerging threat.  A collaborative command &amp; control capability will be integrated into several range systems to provide real time communications during test event scenarios to enable operators to be better prepared prior to deploying into the AOR.

These projects are in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>Beginning in FY 2015, all Space Range content and funding is transferred to PE 0606116F, Space Test and Training Range Development</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports the development of Space Test and Training Range (STTR) capabilities required to support developmental and operational test, training, exercises and tactics development for Space Control systems and related architecture.  This includes development, demonstration and delivery of test assets, special test equipment, capabilities and systems required to test, validate, and verify performance of integrated space control systems.  The objective of the STTR is to provide a safe, secure, controllable and repeatable environment for the testing and training of Space Control mission systems and operators that is both realistic and relevant.  Additionally, this program supports the development of test range assets required to support developmental and operational test, exercises, training, and tactics development for Air Force and Joint-service space control systems/units.  Included are both the fixed node Space Range Operation Center (SROC) at Schriever AFB and a deployable capability to support complex Joint and AF exercises.  A space range Family of Systems (FoS) called Big Top is being developed to accomplish the STTR mission.  The Big Top objective is integration into a Distributed Mission Architecture, tying into both the Information Operations (IO) and Air ranges for increased realism and complexity.  This technology will allow for the first-ever use of a realistic signal environment to increase the realism and efficiency of space control squadron training.
Satellite bandwidth is leased in this program for use in support of live testing and training events.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Combat Identification (CID) Technology program element analyzes, develops, demonstrates and evaluates promising target identification technologies to facilitate platform transition decisions prior to Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD).  The Joint Capability Document (JCD) for CID BFT (Blue Force Tracking), operational documents, lessons learned, and NATO requirements state the need for positive CID.  High confidence CID increases combat effectiveness, prevents fratricide, and reduces collateral damage.  It also enables combatant commanders to effectively command and control their forces in all weather, day or night.  This program element focuses on the cooperative and non-cooperative technologies that have the capability to positively identify surface and air targets in both air-to-surface and air-to-air engagements.  

In order to rapidly make available promising CID technologies for platform EMD decisions, the program element funds design studies, engineering analysis, and other efforts associated with demonstration of prototype CID related technologies and subsystems on platforms.  It also supports the development, testing, and implementation of international standards (to include NATO standardization agreements) to ensure joint, Allied, and coalition interoperability.  

Non-cooperative CID employs a number of sensing technologies and signal processing techniques.  The observations may be compared to a database of known objects to identify surface or air threats from air platforms.  These technologies include: (1) Laser Vision, an Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR) imaging system that significantly increases ID ranges and includes exploiting synergies between non-cooperative and cooperative identification systems (radio, millimeter wave, infrared, and laser).

Cooperative CID employs technologies required to rapidly identify friendly platforms.  The program develops, integrates and evaluates technologies that provide AF platforms with a means of positively identifing an air or ground platform as a friendly, via active or passive cooperative ID capabilities.  Development funded by this program element ensures availability of Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B) as well as Mode 5 IFF (Identification Friend or Foe) upgrade path for implementing ground and air platforms across the Air Force fleet.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning. 

This program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Non-cooperative Combat Identification (CID) employs a number of sensing technologies and signal processing techniques.  The observations may be compared to a database of known objects to identify surface or air threats from air platforms.  These technologies include: (1) Laser Vision, an electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) imaging system that significantly increases identification ranges and includes exploiting synergies between non-cooperative and cooperative ID systems (radio, millimeter wave, infrared, and laser). The Laser Vision Program is working on performance improvements, laser vibrometry development, 3-dimensional laser detection and ranging, laser radar, synthetic aperture laser (SAL) radar, hyper spectral phenomenology exploitation, aided/automatic target recognition, image fusion and studies to support decisions on future EO/IR technologies; (2) Radar Vision, an air-to-ground radar imaging technique to identify stationary and moving targets using their radar signatures; including passive techniques and electronic warfare identification technologies; (3) Hydra Vision, a balanced (robust) amalgamation of sensor data from multiple sources to provide warfighters with higher confidence CID results on surface or air targets potentially including fusion with intelligence sources,  identification of non-traditional targets, fusion to counter camouflage, concealment and deception (CCD), and multi-phenomenology features for sustainable databases; (4) Compact ATR (Aided Target Recognition) and Sustainable Environments (CASE), a CID approach that focuses on tailoring algorithms to utilize smaller, more efficient databases that are faster and less expensive to generate and maintain; and (5) X-Patch, a validated set of prediction codes and analysis tools that predicts realistic far-field radar signatures from 3-D (3 dimensional) target models in order to predict 1D and/or 2D data.  X-Patch is vital for development of radar signatures of potential high-threat weapons systems; it is a critical capability of database production centers which support Joint Sensors Signature Database (JSSD) pathfinders. 

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Cooperative Combat Identification (CID) employs technologies required to rapidly identify friendly platforms.  The program develops, integrates and evaluates technologies that provide AF platforms with a means of positively identifying an air or ground platform as a friendly, via active or passive cooperative identification capabilities.  Development funded by this project ensures availability of a Mode 5 upgrade path for implementing ground and air platforms across the Air Force fleet.  

Within the air-to-air domain, programs funded to meet this intent include: 

Mode 5 Technology Insertion Program (TIP): This project funds preliminary RDT&amp;E for Mark XIIA, the next generation Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) standard for the DoD and NATO.  Mark XIIA represents a substantial enhancement to the Mark XII IFF system.  It is expected to achieve Joint Initial Operational Capability in 2014.  The "A" denotes the addition of Mode 5 (an encrypted challenge-and-reply mode) to the other Mark XII system modes (Modes 1, 2, 3/A, C, S, and 4).  The Mode 5 secure IFF program is a DoD-wide, Navy-led development and acquisition program. The Mode 5 TIP specifically addresses implemention for air platforms by integrating Mode 5 into APX-119, APX-114, APX-113 and the UPX-40 transponder systems.  

Within the air-to-ground domain, development funded by this project ensures development, integration, test and evaluation of friendly identification systems focused on reducing air-to-ground fratricide.  CID efforts include investigation of radio based identification technologies; including the exploitation of state of the art digital radios and software defined radios and integration of cooperative and non-cooperative technologies for improved target recognition which could be incorporated into targeting pods or directly into the cockpit.  
 
Fund Air Traffic Control Radar Beacon Systems Identification Friend or Foe Mark XIIA System (AIMS)Program Office test engineers.  The DoD International AIMS PO has system level interoperability testing and certification responsibilities for the present Mark XII system, development and integration of Mark XIIA (Mode 5) and transition to Mark XIIA Mode S systems.  AIMS PO will continue to test and certify IFF equipment for the services now as long as IFF is used for combat identification.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Each of the selected activities and projects are required to have a concluded international agreement (IA), prior to funds being released, that implements the provisions of Title 10 U.S. Code, Section 2350a.  This legislation (Title 10 U.S. Code, Section 2350) authorizes funds to significantly improve U.S. and allied conventional defense capabilities by leveraging the best defense technologies, eliminating costly duplication of R&amp;D efforts, accelerating the availability of defense systems, and promoting US and allied interoperability or commonality.  These funds will not be used for government civilian salaries, permanent construction, or spent overseas.  This PE funds the implementation of Air Force ICR&amp;D agreements in (1) Basic Research (2) Applied Research (3) Advanced Technology Development (4) Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (5) System Development and Demonstration and (6) RDT&amp;E Management Support.

This program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or protytype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>These funds will be used to initiate air, space, and cyber international cooperative research, and development (ICR&amp;D) agreements with North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) member states, major non-NATO allies and friendly foreign countries.  Each of the selected activities and projects are required to have a concluded international agreement (IA), prior to funds being released, that implements the provisions of Title 10 U.S. Code, Section 2350a.  This legislation (Title 10 U.S. Code, Section 2350) authorizes funds to significantly improve U.S. and allied conventional defense capabilities by leveraging the best defense technologies, eliminating costly duplication of R&amp;D efforts, accelerating the availability of defense systems, and promoting US and allied interoperability or commonality.  These funds will not be used for government civilian salaries, permanent construction, or spent overseas.  This PE funds the implementation of Air Force ICR&amp;D agreements in (1) Basic Research (2) Applied Research (3) Advanced Technology Development (4) Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (5) System Development and Demonstration and (6) RDT&amp;E Management Support.

This program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or protytype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>A principal goal of the NATO Cooperative R&amp;D program is to effectively utilize the aggregate resources invested by the US and our allies in air, space, and cyber R&amp;D.  This program element provides the critical funding incentive needed to pursue air, space and cyber related International Cooperative Research Development and Acquisition (ICRD&amp;A) agreements and helps to (a) leverage USAF and allied resources through cost sharing and economies of scale; (b) exploit the best US and allied technologies for equipping coalition forces; (c) demonstrate areas of commonality or interoperability with our allies; and (d) accelerate the availability of defense technology and systems. Candidate projects are reviewed against USAF goals, DoD objectives, and warfighter needs prior to being approved.  An international agreement defining project objectives, responsibilities and costs is required prior to release of funds.  To obtain these funds and ensure service commitment, projects are selected from existing or new RDT&amp;E programs funded in the Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP).  Project offices must show matching funds and contributions from associated program elements and equitable allied funding.  As appropriate, funding responsibility for out-year requirements and follow-on efforts are transferred to the project office and associated program elements.  Any new contracts are awarded after full and open competition.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>A principal goal of the International Space Cooperative R&amp;D program is to effectively utilize the aggregate resources invested by the US and our allies in space-related R&amp;D.  This program element provides the critical funding incentive needed to pursue space-related International Cooperative Research Development and Acquisition (ICRD&amp;A) agreements and helps to (a) leverage USAF and allied resources through cost sharing and economies of scale; (b) exploit the best US and allied technologies for equipping coalition forces; (c) demonstrate areas of commonality or interoperability with our allies; and (d) accelerate the availability of defense technology and systems. Candidate projects are reviewed against USAF goals, DoD objectives, and warfighter needs prior to being approved.  An international agreement defining project objectives, responsibilities and costs is required prior to release of funds.  To obtain these funds and ensure service commitment, projects are selected from existing or new space-related RDT&amp;E programs funded in the Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP).  Project offices must show matching funds and contributions from associated program elements and equitable allied funding.  As appropriate, funding responsibility for out-year requirements and follow-on efforts are transferred to the project office and associated program elements.  Most contracts are awarded after full and open competition.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element funds the DoD/Air Force component of the Space Security and Defense Program (SSDP).  The SSDP is a Joint Department of Defense (DoD) and Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) organization established to function as the center of excellence for options and strategies (materiel, non-materiel, cross-Title, cross-domain) leading to a more resilient and enduring National Security Space (NSS) Enterprise.  Formerly known as the Space Protection Program (SPP), the SSDP was chartered by the DoD and ODNI to expand the existing authorities and roles/responsibilities of the SPP; effectively integrating and unifying space protection efforts on a National level to better meet the evolving threat to our NSS systems and capabilities.  

The SSDP Operates under the authority of the Deputy Secretary of Defense (DEPSECDEF) and Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence (PDDNI) to lead and collaborate on space protection vulnerability, susceptibility, and mitigation assessments of NSS services for the purpose of identifying and introducing protection recommendations into existing requirements, budgeting, acquisition, and operational development processes.  This unique mission provides an ongoing and crucial core protection competency that advances specific projects/activities (including cyber) to deliver comprehensive, economical and actionable solutions for both programmatic and operational domains.  

The SSDP scope spans multiple space missions and stakeholders including the DoD, Intelligence Community (IC), civil, commercial, and international space entities that support NSS missions in both peacetime and throughout all phases of conflict.  The program works within existing processes spanning requirements, budgeting, acquisition, and operational development to carry-out its protection mission.  It is focused on being responsive to NSS stakeholders in providing technical and operational assessments of emergent threat concepts, and developing near- and far-term plans to address strategies, threats, and vulnerabilities.  In the context of its projects and activities, the SSDP employs a cooperative, objective, and enterprise-level approach to implement the capabilities, plans and options to deter, defend against, and if necessary, defeat efforts to interfere with or attack U.S. or allied space systems in an increasingly constrained and hostile environment.  

SSDP projects/activities center on identifying solutions to current space protection needs with a common sense approach to balancing near-term results with long-term acquisition, architecture, and strategic objectives.  Given the ever-changing elements of the space protection landscape, the SSDP is designed to remain flexible and responsive to fluctuating NSS priorities and objectives.  Protection projects/activities in one year are typically dependent upon or advised by the results/findings or progress made on tasks in the preceding FY, and must remain responsive to annual DEPSECDEF and PDDNI - approved SSDP Work Plans that take such variability into consideration.  As such, SSDP FY15 projects/activities will be structured to address the priorities and objectives of the SSDP Work Plan and meet the National space survivability and protection needs as directed by the DEPSECDEF and the PDDNI.  In order to ensure resiliency in a contested space environment, FY15 efforts will leverage available resources to support NSS survivability requirements and address protection issues, options, and strategies in the priority articulated in the annual SSDP Work Plan.  SSDP will translate resilience, protection, endurance, and survivability into protection strategy/policy and threat mitigation projects and/or activities in specific mission areas to inform/impact budget and program formulation, influence the development of system or segment requirements, provide technical parameters to systems and capabilities, improve Concept of Operations (CONOPS) / Tatics, Techniques and Procedures (TTP) for operational systems, shape and inform protection-related policies, and identify areas for additional collection and/or analysis by the IC to feed threat mitigation efforts.

The FY15 President Budget request represents the resources required to operate and execute a synchronized and effective space protection effort for the Nation; fulfilling a unique, objective and independent role that considers comprehensive, enterprise-level, space and non-space, material and non-material solutions across NSS systems and architectures.  The FY15 request preserves the skill-set, knowledge base and multi-organizational construct required to remain ahead of the threat and to evolve programmatic direction and operational CONOPS across multiple orbital regimes in a way that minimizes duplication and inefficiency.  This essentially enables the SSDP to deliver the research, analysis, studies, tools and capabilities necessary to identify, prioritize, develop, and implement the most effective and economical solutions to preserve NSS capabilities. 

This program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Program Element funds the DoD/Air Force component of the Space Security and Defense Program (SSDP).  The SSDP is a Joint Department of Defense (DoD) and Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) organization established to function as the center of excellence for options and strategies (materiel, non-materiel, cross-Title, cross-domain) leading to a more resilient and enduring National Security Space (NSS) Enterprise.  Formerly known as the Space Protection Program (SPP), the SSDP was chartered by the DoD and ODNI to expand the existing authorities and roles/responsibilities of the SPP; effectively integrating and unifying space protection efforts on a National level to better meet the evolving threat to our NSS systems and capabilities.  

The SSDP Operates under the authority of the Deputy Secretary of Defense (DEPSECDEF) and Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence (PDDNI) to lead and collaborate on space protection vulnerability, susceptibility, and mitigation assessments of NSS services for the purpose of identifying and introducing protection recommendations into existing requirements, budgeting, acquisition, and operational development processes.  This unique mission provides an ongoing and crucial core protection competency that advances specific projects/activities (including cyber) to deliver comprehensive, economical and actionable solutions for both programmatic and operational domains.  

The SSDP scope spans multiple space missions and stakeholders including the DoD, Intelligence Community (IC), civil, commercial, and international space entities that support NSS missions in both peacetime and throughout all phases of conflict.  The program works within existing processes spanning requirements, budgeting, acquisition, and operational development to carry-out its protection mission.  It is focused on being responsive to NSS stakeholders in providing technical and operational assessments of emergent threat concepts, and developing near- and far-term plans to address strategies, threats, and vulnerabilities.  In the context of its projects and activities, the SSDP employs a cooperative, objective, and enterprise-level approach to implement the capabilities, plans and options to deter, defend against, and if necessary, defeat efforts to interfere with or attack U.S. or allied space systems in an increasingly constrained and hostile environment.  

SSDP projects/activities center on identifying solutions to current space protection needs with a common sense approach to balancing near-term results with long-term acquisition, architecture, and strategic objectives.  Given the ever-changing elements of the space protection landscape, the SSDP is designed to remain flexible and responsive to fluctuating NSS priorities and objectives.  Protection projects/activities in one year are typically dependent upon or advised by the results/findings or progress made on tasks in the preceding FY, and must remain responsive to annual DEPSECDEF and PDDNI - approved SSDP Work Plans that take such variability into consideration.  As such, SSDP FY15 projects/activities will be structured to address the priorities and objectives of the SSDP Work Plan and meet the National space survivability and protection needs as directed by the DEPSECDEF and the PDDNI.  In order to ensure resiliency in a contested space environment, FY15 efforts will leverage available resources to support NSS survivability requirements and address protection issues, options, and strategies in the priority articulated in the annual SSDP Work Plan.  SSDP will translate resilience, protection, endurance, and survivability into protection strategy/policy and threat mitigation projects and/or activities in specific mission areas to inform/impact budget and program formulation, influence the development of system or segment requirements, provide technical parameters to systems and capabilities, improve Concept of Operations (CONOPS) / Tatics, Techniques and Procedures (TTP) for operational systems, shape and inform protection-related policies, and identify areas for additional collection and/or analysis by the IC to feed threat mitigation efforts.

The FY15 President Budget request represents the resources required to operate and execute a synchronized and effective space protection effort for the Nation; fulfilling a unique, objective and independent role that considers comprehensive, enterprise-level, space and non-space, material and non-material solutions across NSS systems and architectures.  The FY15 request preserves the skill-set, knowledge base and multi-organizational construct required to remain ahead of the threat and to evolve programmatic direction and operational CONOPS across multiple orbital regimes in a way that minimizes duplication and inefficiency.  This essentially enables the SSDP to deliver the research, analysis, studies, tools and capabilities necessary to identify, prioritize, develop, and implement the most effective and economical solutions to preserve NSS capabilities. 

This program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY 2014, Project Number 644778, Integrated Broadcast Service, efforts transferred to PE 0305179F, Integrated Broadcast Service, Project Number 674779, Integrated Broadcast Service, in order to realign funds in support of transition to sustainment.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Integrated Broadcast Service (IBS) fulfills the warfighter's requirements for worldwide threat warning and situational awareness information with timely production and simultaneous dissemination of Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) derived combat information.  It also provides target tracking data to support threat avoidance, targeting, force protection, and situational awareness.   This information is continually refined in near real time by strategic, operational and tactical sensors.  

This PE funds/have previously funded IBS system development as described below:
- A Common Interactive Broadcast (CIB) on UHF satellite channel using a Common Message Format (CMF) and a MIL-STD Demand Assigned Multiple Access (DAMA) compliant waveform and Line of Sight (LOS) using the Wideband Networking Waveform (WNW) and Joint Tactical Terminal (JTT). 

- IBS-Network Services (IBS-NS) includes two Global IBS Network Servers (GINS) and four Theater Interface Nodes (TINs) to support the geographic Combatant Commanders, all built to validated warfighter requirements. 
 -- Two GINS receive data from each theater and integrate this data into a worldwide picture available to all network/broadcast users. 
 -- Four regional TINs, allow local and out-of-theater users (not directly receiving the broadcast) to receive the CIB information broadcast.  Additionally, the TIN will receive and inject data into the CIB for producers without access to the theater CIB. 

- An XML-based Common Message Format (CMF) Data Element Dictionary (DED) that defines IBS messages for broadcast of  IBS information over available communications paths including the CIB and other Global Information Grid (GIG) networks. 

- A Modular Advanced TRanslation Interchange with XML (MATRIX) Reformatter that provides a modular, platform-independent, multi-use translator to support migration with legacy radios and provide a long term solution for IBS Full Operational Capability (FOC) radio users.  

Funds development of evolving suite of interoperable planning and decision support capabilities comprised of software, hardware and communication products.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program ensures a responsive design and development engineering infrastructure to address emerging issues and technology insertion within the current Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM), future strategic systems/capability, and other common strategic mission areas, where appropriate, to develop enhanced multi-use capabilities.  Efforts identify methods to reduce life cycle costs, improve nuclear safety and surety, and ensure strategic missile viability.  On-going demonstration and validation projects include guidance applications, propulsion applications and Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD), and FY15 restarts funding for reentry vehicles, development of enhanced command/control capabilities and long range planning efforts.  

BA4 - This program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Long Range Planning (LRP) effort identifies and analyzes  potential modifications to current and future Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) Weapon Systems required to meet objectives relative to long term sustainment, technology insertion, battlespace awareness, employment, and force structure. The studies will focus on system supportability, operability, reliability, innovation and maintainability. Options/concepts generated by these studies are evaluated for feasibility, system impacts, and cost. The LRP also lays the groundwork for analysis supporting future weapon systems development and deployment. Pre-milestone activities may be conducted for current or future ICBM weapon systems to include entry criteria for milestone activities.

BA4 - This program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Competitive contracts with cost plus award fee options were awarded in February 2001 to two teams to demonstrate capabilities for the concept demonstration phase.  A downselect to a single team was awarded in March 2002 to develop the system for the development phase.  The initial CCS-C contract was extended through 2012 to provide launch readiness support to ongoing WGS and AEHF satellite development.  A follow-on competitive FPIF contract began performance in January 2013 to sustain and provide post-production development for the current CCS-C system for telemetry, tracking and commanding (TT&amp;C) of current and future MILSATCOM satellites.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Funds will be used to target R&amp;D activities that demonstrate and prototype alternative weapon system manufacturing, remanufacturing, and maintenance materials and processes that reduce or eliminate hazardous chemicals, materials and waste streams through cost-effective programs and practices, while improving energy efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  Upon proof of the new process or materials, the resulting product can be transitioned to depot maintenance processes, which results in reduced maintenance costs, reduced depot flow time, and increases asset availability. Specifically, funds target pollution prevention technologies that reduce or eliminate chromium, cadmium, and nickel, as well as reduce or eliminate Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAPS), Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), and Class I and II Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS), global warmers and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and to increase the use of renewable and alternative fuels.

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY 2013, PE 0604283F includes Congressional funding added for the Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) Recapitilization (Recap).  This program is in Budget Activity 04, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P).  Efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes, or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment.  

In FY 2014, Project 646002, Three-Dimensional Expeditionary Long-Range Radar (3DELRR), efforts were transferred to PE 0207455F, Three-Dimensional Expeditionary Long-Range Radar, Project 646002, in order to provide this program its own Program Element.

In FY 2015, Project 645363, MP-RTIP efforts were transferred to PE 0307581F, NextGen JSTARS, Project 650003, JSTARS Recapitalization, in order to consolidate efforts and continue development of the JSTARs Recap.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>JSTARS Recap will provide a unique blend of Battle Management Command and Control (BMC2) and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) that enables the central tenant of Air Forces doctrine "Centralized Control and Decentralized Execution". Air Battle Managers onboard the JSTARS use its wide area ground surveillance radar to build situational awareness and identify targets which are passed to strike assets or crossed cued with ISR platforms. The capability to perform this dual mission at the tactical edge both reduces the time to execute the kill chain and improves ISR collections across the range of military options.

This program element enhances the warfighter's ability to achieve the joint vision of combat operations. It develops advanced battle management aids and information fusion technologies to enable rapid decisions by automating tracking and addressing time-critical targets. Concept exploration, program definition/risk reduction efforts, and studies support continuous improvements in development of BMC2 capabilities, network centric operational capabilities, and interoperability with joint service, allied, and coalition systems.

Activities also include studies and analyses to support both current program planning/execution and future program planning.

JSTARS Recap:

The JSTARS Recap program was initiated to satisfy the JSTARS Mission Area capability gaps and life-cycle affordability challenges as defined in the Synthetic Aperture Radar/Moving Target Indicator (SAR/MTI); JSTARS Mission Area Analysis of Alternative (AoA) and the SAR/MTI, BMC2 Initial Capabilities Document (ICD). The JSTARS Recap program consists of multiple efforts for the development and integration of all sub-systems necessary to satisfy the requirements documented in the ICD, AOA and, upon completion, the Capability Development Document (CDD). The efforts include, but are not limited to: BMC2 System and Sensor Systems; as well as related OSA development or refinement activities to improve AF weapon system life-cycle affordability. These efforts are detailed below.

1. BMC2 System - The BMC2 System development effort builds upon a broad body of work in OSA by evaluating and applying lessons learned from system designs across many areas such as Air Operations Centers (AOC), AWACS Block 40/45, and the Open Mission Systems (OMS) Working Group. The BMC2 System will provide an on-board BMC2 solution that meets the Joint/Air Force Requirements as defined in the AoA, ICD, and CDD, using an evolutionary approach, made possible by an OSA design that firmly defines interfaces and messaging standards, thereby enabling rapid technology insertion based on mission need and funds availability. The BMC2 System development effort will also inform the AF OSA concept and frameworks with regard to applicability and efficacy of on-board BMC2 mission systems.

2. Sensor Systems - The Sensor Systems development effort intends to leverage the government owned, platform-independent, radar OSA enterprise specification to develop a modern radar that meets the Joint/Air Force Requirements as defined in the AoA, ICD, and CDD. JSTARS Recap is the first planned Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP) to leverage this body of work. JSTARS Recap also takes into considerations lessons learned from the Dismount Detection Radar (DDR) Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) program, which was a pathfinder for OSA radar in a small, pod configured for surface surveillance missions. The JSTARS Recap Sensor Systems development effort will not only satisfy the requirements of the JSTARS Recap, but also intends to provide critical feedback to an OSA radar concept and framework with regard to applicability and efficacy in a wide area surface surveillance mission. Other sensor systems may include, but are not limited to, Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR) and multi/hyper-spectral.



Beginning in FY 2012, PE 0604283F funds the development of the Three-Dimensional Expeditionary Long-Range Radar (3DELRR) which will replace the current legacy AN/TPS-75 radar.  3DELRR will be the principal United States Air Force (USAF) long-range, ground-based sensor for detecting, identifying, tracking, and reporting aerial targets for the Joint Force Air Component Commander (JFACC) through the Theater Air Control System (TACS).  3DELRR will respond to the operational need to detect and report highly maneuverable, small radar cross section targets to enable battlefield awareness while at the same time mitigating the reliability, maintainability, and sustainability issues plaguing the AN/TPS-75 radar system.  The 3DELRR will provide air controllers with a precise, real-time air picture of sufficient quality to conduct control of individual aircraft under a wide range of environmental and operational conditions.  It will replace the aging USAF AN/TPS-75 radar system as the AN/TPS-75 is incapable of detecting some current and emerging threats.  In addition, as the AN/TPS-75 is reaching the end of its service life, it is more difficult and costly to maintain.  The United States Marine Corps (USMC) is considering 3DELRR as a potential replacement for the AN/TPS-59, at the end of its service life, to support the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) Commander through the Marine Air Command and Control System (MACCS).  

3DELRR will address system sustainability, transportability and operational availability shortfalls while providing long-range surveillance, detection, and tracking of Air Breathing Targets (ABTs) and, potentially, Theater Ballistic Missiles (TBMs).  This capability will support the USAF contribution to the primary roles of the Airspace Control Authority (ACA) and the Area Air Defense Commander (AADC) and enhance the USAF contributions to the Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) mission area. This new radar will provide the USAF Control and Reporting Center (CRC) and, if purchased by the USMC, the Tactical Air Operations Center (TAOC), with real-time data to display air activity.  

The Pre-Engineering &amp; Manufacturing Development (Pre-EMD) efforts of the 3DELRR Program began in FY 2012 and continued through FY 2013.  Acquisition activities included, but were not limited to: full and open source selection to award up to three competing contracts; requirements refinement; completion of the preliminary design development; continued software and hardware subsystem-level development; modeling and simulation to support the system development; implementation of mitigation techniques to combat existing and emerging system threats (including cyber warfare), test planning, and implementation of the program protection plan. A Preliminary Design Review (PDR) and Capability Demonstration C Event were conducted during this timeframe to ensure success in the development of a preliminary system design.  Activities also included studies and analyses to support both current program planning and execution, and future program planning, as well as Milestone (MS) B documentation and preparation for a MS B review.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

This program is in Budget Activity 04, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P). Efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes, or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment.

In FY 2015, Project 645363, MP-RTIP efforts were transferred to PE 0307581F, NextGen JSTARS, Project 650003, JSTARS Recapitalization, in order to consolidate efforts and continue development of the JSTARs Recap.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) Recapitalization (Recap) will provide a unique blend of Battle Management Command and Control (BMC2) and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) that enables the central tenant of Air Forces doctrine "Centralized Control and Decentralized Execution". Air Battle Managers onboard the JSTARS use its wide area ground surveillance radar to build situational awareness and identify targets which are passed to strike assets or crossed cued with ISR platforms. The capability to perform this dual mission at the tactical edge both reduces the time to execute the kill chain and improves ISR collections across the range of military options.

This program element enhances the warfighter's ability to achieve the joint vision of combat operations. It develops advanced battle management aids and information fusion technologies to enable rapid decisions by automating tracking and addressing time-critical targets. Concept exploration, program definition/risk reduction efforts, and studies support continuous improvements in development of BMC2 capabilities, network centric operational capabilities, and interoperability with joint service, allied, and coalition systems.

                            <r2:ProjectNote>In FY 2014, Project 646002, Three-Dimensional Expeditionary Long-Range Radar (3DELRR), efforts were transferred to PE 06027455F, Battle Management Command and Control (BMC2) Sensor Development, Project 646002, in order to provide this program its own Program Element.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Beginning in FY12, PE 0604283F funds the development of the Three-Dimensional Expeditionary Long-Range Radar (3DELRR) which will replace the current legacy AN/TPS-75 radar.  3DELRR will be the principal United States Air Force (USAF) long-range, ground-based sensor for detecting, identifying, tracking, and reporting aerial targets for the Joint Force Air Component Commander (JFACC) through the Theater Air Control System (TACS).  3DELRR will respond to the operational need to detect and report highly maneuverable, small radar cross section targets to enable battlefield awareness while at the same time mitigating the reliability, maintainability, and sustainability issues plaguing the AN/TPS-75 radar system.  The 3DELRR will provide air controllers with a precise, real-time air picture of sufficient quality to conduct control of individual aircraft under a wide range of environmental and operational conditions.  It will replace the aging USAF AN/TPS-75 radar system as the AN/TPS-75 is incapable of detecting some current and emerging threats.  In addition, as the AN/TPS-75 is reaching the end of its service life, it is more difficult and costly to maintain.  The United States Marine Corps (USMC) is considering 3DELRR as a potential replacement for the AN/TPS-59, at the end of its service life, to support the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) Commander through the Marine Air Command and Control System (MACCS).  

3DELRR will address system sustainability, transportability and operational availability shortfalls while providing long-range surveillance, detection, and tracking of Air Breathing Targets (ABTs) and, potentially, Theater Ballistic Missiles (TBMs).  This capability will support the USAF contribution to the primary roles of the Airspace Control Authority (ACA) and the Area Air Defense Commander (AADC) and enhance the USAF contributions to the Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) mission area. This new radar will provide the USAF Control and Reporting Center (CRC) and, if purchased by the USMC, the Tactical Air Operations Center (TAOC), with real-time data to display air activity.  

The Pre-Engineering &amp; Manufacturing Development (Pre-EMD) efforts of the 3DELRR Program began in FY12 and continued through FY13.  Acquisition activities included, but were not limited to: full and open source selection to award up to three competing contracts; requirements refinement; completion of the preliminary design development; continued software and hardware subsystem-level development; modeling and simulation to support the system development; implementation of mitigation techniques to combat existing and emerging system threats (including cyber warfare), test planning, and implementation of the program protection plan. A Preliminary Design Review (PDR) and Capability Demonstration C Event were conducted during this timeframe to ensure success in the development of a preliminary system design.  Activities also included studies and analyses to support both current program planning and execution, and future program planning, as well as Milestone (MS) B documentation and preparation for a MS B review.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>Note:  In FY 2012, the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) transferred this program to the Air Force.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Technology Transfer was titled Defense Technology Transfer and Defense Technology Link (TechLink) in previous OSD budgets.  This program was devolved from OSD to achieve efficiencies in program management.

The three-fold mission of Technology Transfer is:
(1) integrate advanced commercial-sector technologies into Department of Defense (DoD) systems, particularly from non-traditional defense contractors;
(2) convey DoD-developed technologies to industry to make these technologies available for military acquisition; and
(3) establish collaborative Research and Development (R&amp;D) projects with the private sector for cost-sharing of new dual-use technology development.

This program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Technology Transfer was titled Defense Technology Transfer and Defense Technology Link (TechLink) in previous OSD budgets.  This program was devolved from OSD to achieve efficiencies in program management.

The three-fold mission of Technology Transfer is:
(1) integrate advanced commercial-sector technologies into Department of Defense (DoD) systems, particularly from non-traditional defense contractors;
(2) convey DoD-developed technologies to industry to make these technologies available for military acquisition; and
(3) establish collaborative Research and Development (R&amp;D) projects with the private sector for cost-sharing of new dual-use technology development.

This program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Direct Strike Penetrator Systems project includes the development of a Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) known as Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) and analysis efforts for the follow-on Hard Target Munitions (HTM) program. The Hard and Deeply Buried Target Defeat System (HDBTDS) development activity is based on the Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) for HDBTDS, 1 Aug 2005, and the MOP development is based on the 2007 Urgent Operational Need (UON) document (resubmitted in 2009).  The Direct Strike Penetrator System is an advanced precision guided penetrator munition that will provide the Air Force with an improved capability using air-to-surface conventional munitions to attack Hard &amp; Deeply Buried Targets (HDBT), such as bunker and tunnel facilities.  This system holds HDBTs at risk using fewer weapons and reducing the number of missions necessary to defeat targets, resulting in an increase to overall mission survivability.  The Direct Strike Penetrator provides a critical global strike capability not currently met by inventory conventional weapons. It will hold at risk those highest priority assets essential to the enemy's warfighting ability, which are heavily defended and protected.  The Direct Strike Penetrator Systems project is also conducting a HTM analysis-of-alternative (AoA) to determine the best weapons and/or development efforts for addressing the Hard and Deeply Buried Targets (HDBT) mission area.  At the completion of the AoA, the Air Force will add funds to start the development, production, modification activities for the HDBT attack weapons identified in the AoA as the most effective and affordable weapons.  The AoA will include the performance, operational suitability, and cost of alternative hard target defeat systems.  HTM is a pre-MDAP program.

This program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) because effort is necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in high fidelity and realistic operating environment.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Direct Strike Penetrator Systems project includes the development of a Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) known as Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) and analysis efforts for the follow-on Hard Target Munitions (HTM) program. The Hard and Deeply Buried Target Defeat System (HDBTDS) development activity is based on the Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) for HDBTDS, 1 Aug 2005, and the MOP development is based on the 2007 Urgent Operational Need (UON) document (resubmitted in 2009).  The Direct Strike Penetrator System is an advanced precision guided penetrator munition that will provide the Air Force with an improved capability using air-to-surface conventional munitions to attack Hard &amp; Deeply Buried Targets (HDBT), such as bunker and tunnel facilities.  This system holds HDBTs at risk using fewer weapons and reducing the number of missions necessary to defeat targets, resulting in an increase to overall mission survivability.  The Direct Strike Penetrator provides a critical global strike capability not currently met by inventory conventional weapons. It will hold at risk those highest priority assets essential to the enemy's warfighting ability, which are heavily defended and protected.  The Direct Strike Penetrator Systems project is also conducting a HTM analysis-of-alternative (AoA) to determine the best weapons and/or development efforts for addressing the Hard and Deeply Buried Targets (HDBT) mission area.  At the completion of the AoA, the Air Force will add funds to start the development, production, modification activities for the HDBT attack weapons identified in the AoA as the most effective and affordable weapons.  The AoA will include the performance, operational suitability, and cost of alternative hard target defeat systems.  HTM is a pre-MDAP program.

This program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) because effort is necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in high fidelity and realistic operating environment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Requirements Analysis and Maturation (RAM) program funds early systems engineering and pre-acquisition planning and analysis activities. These activities include requirements analysis, capability decomposition and trade space characterization, concept development (system of systems, air, space, and cyber), cost analysis, modeling and simulation of representative or prototype systems, and costs associated with these activities to include analytical tools and travel. Outcomes of these
activities are fiscally and technologically informed requirements, mature concepts that are technically feasible, and areas for science and technology (S&amp;T) investment to reduce technology risks. These activities provide the analytic basis for cost and capability trades to inform weapon systems requirements and acquisition milestones, decision points, and phases; for example, the Materiel Development Decision (MDD). A number of Department of Defense (DoD), Government Accountability Office(GAO), and independent industry studies point to a need for more disciplined, early phase systems engineering and pre-systems acquisition planning to produce decision-quality acquisition information that previously did not surface until after the initiation of a program. Early-phase systems engineering and technical planning activities funded by this program provide the foundation for informed investment decisions leading to successful acquisition programs. Specific efforts are determined each year based upon the highest Air Force priorities. This effort is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment.


For FY 2014 and out Space and Non-Space RAM program activities were combined into a single Development Planning project, 45349

In FY 2015 and out, 645349, Development Planning, efforts were transferred to PE 0606017F, Requirements Analysis and Maturation, 666157, Development Planning, due to an internal DoD budget activity realignment.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>In FY 2015, the Weather System Follow-on (WSF) Project 644289, is a New Start.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>WSF is the Department of Defense's (DoD) follow-on system to the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) and other DoD environmental monitoring satellites.

WSF will be comprised of a group of systems to provide timely, reliable, and high quality space-based remote sensing capabilities that will make global environmental observations of atmospheric, terrestrial, oceanographic, solar-geophysical and other requirements validated by the Joint Staff.  

The Space-Based Environmental Monitoring (SBEM) Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) concluded that all except one of the JROC endorsed Category A capability gaps demonstrated military utility.  Some of these capability gaps may materialize immediately; therefore, the earliest possible launch is critical to mitigate potential gaps in meeting DoD's space-based weather requirements.  The planned deployment for an operational weather satellite to fully meet validated requirements is in the early 2020s.

DoD established WSF as a Pre-Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP).  Based on the SBEM AoA results, WSF's primary thrusts will be to enable:  
1)  DoD use of data collected by civil, international and other DoD space systems. 
2) Timely weather collection over broad oceans in support of maneuver forces. 
3) Space weather capabilities to characterize operational orbits, space situational awareness, and the ionosphere. 
Secondary investments may be supported to address weather gaps identified  in the SBEM AoA and validated by the Joint Staff. 

This program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY 2014, Project Number 644945, AOC Inc. 10.2, efforts were transferred from PE 0207410F, AOC WS, Project Number 675117, in order to improve transparency of ACAT 1 Acquisition programs.  In FY15, Project number 644945, AOC Inc. 10.2, efforts were transferred to PE 0605458F Project Number 654945 in order to properly classify the effort as in the Engineering and Manufacturing Development phase.

AOC Increment 10.2 received a Milestone B decision 11 October 2013. Beginning in FY 2015, PE 0604458F Air &amp; Space Ops Center, project number 644945, AOC Increment 10.2 development efforts are transferred to PE 0605458F, Air &amp; Space Ops Center 10.2, project number 654945, AOC 10.2 Development, in order to align post Milestone B development efforts with funding in RDT&amp;E Budget Activity 05, System Development &amp; Demonstration (SDD).

AOC 10.2 is PRCP Program Number (PNO) N42.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Air Operations Center Weapon System (AOC WS), AN/USQ-163 Falconer, the senior element of the Theater Air Control System (TACS), is the weapon system the Commander, Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR) provides the Combined/Joint Force Air Component Commander (C/JFACC) for planning, executing, and assessing theater-wide air and space operations.  The C/JFACC provides air, space and cyber support to the Combined/Joint Forces Commander (C/JFC) by coordinating, deconflicting and assessing the progress of various weapon systems to advance the C/JFC's campaign.  The AOC WS develops operations strategy and planning documents.  The weapon system also disseminates tasking orders; executes day-to-day peacetime and combat air, space and cyber operations; and provides rapid reaction to immediate situations by exercising positive control of friendly forces.

The AOC WS Increment 10.2 program keeps the AOC interoperable, certified, supportable, and compliant through the integration, testing and fielding of new capabilities and sustainment upgrades to the AOC WS baseline.  The program supports mission requirements at Geographic and Functional AOCs, as well as Support and Manpower Augmentation units. To keep the AOC current and interoperable with the COCOMs, cyber requirements, and fifth generation weapon system/weapons, the AOC WS program plans to evolve the AOC through the integration and test of progressively improving capabilities.  These activities ensure a system of systems engineering perspective for the AOC WS, and include weapon system standardization activities as defined by AOC WS requirements documents.  The Modernization contractor, which was awarded the Modernization contract on 25 October 2011, conducted AOC 10.2 pre-Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) activities, including a Systems Requirements Review (SRR), an Interim Design Review (IDR), and a delta-Preliminary Design Review (delta-PDR). In accordance with AOC 10.2 Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) direction (23 June 2010), the AOC 10.2 Modernization program conducted prototyping and Limited Early Install (LEI) activities through an iterative build methodology prior to Milestone B (MS B) to reduce integration risk and improve user feedback in the acquisition process. AOC 10.2 EMD activities include the design (i.e., Critical Design Review), development, integration of 3rd party capabilities, testing (Contractor in-plant system testing, Developmental Test and Evaluation, Operational Test and Evaluation, Operational Assessment, Test Readiness Review, etc.) of the AOC 10.2 baseline, as well as build-up and fielding of the Help Desk (HD), Formal Training Unit (FTU), and Combined Air Operations Center-eXperimental (CAOC-X) suite.

Activities also include studies and analysis to support current program planning and execution, as well as future program planning. 

This program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) for FY14 because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Air Operations Center Weapon System (AOC WS), AN/USQ-163 Falconer, the senior element of the Theater Air Control System (TACS), is the weapon system the Commander, Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR) provides the Combined/Joint Force Air Component Commander (C/JFACC) for planning, executing, and assessing theater-wide air and space operations.  The C/JFACC provides air, space and cyber support to the Combined/Joint Forces Commander (C/JFC) by coordinating, deconflicting and assessing the progress of various weapon systems to advance the C/JFC's campaign.  The AOC WS develops operations strategy and planning documents.  The weapon system also disseminates tasking orders; executes day-to-day peacetime and combat air, space and cyber operations; and provides rapid reaction to immediate situations by exercising positive control of friendly forces.

The AOC WS Increment 10.2 program keeps the AOC interoperable, certified, supportable, and compliant through the integration, testing and fielding of new capabilities and sustainment upgrades to the AOC WS baseline.  The program supports mission requirements at Geographic and Functional AOCs, as well as Support and Manpower Augmentation units. To keep the AOC current and interoperable with the COCOMs, cyber requirements, and fifth generation weapon system/weapons, the AOC WS program plans to evolve the AOC through the integration and test of progressively improving capabilities.  These activities ensure a system of systems engineering perspective for the AOC WS, and include weapon system standardization activities as defined by AOC WS requirements documents.

JDAM accuracy expands the drill down CONOPS used by the GBU-31 (2000 lb class warhead) to a 5000 lb concept, holding harder and deeper targets at risk. This is an objective requirement of the 2001 JDAM ORD. The 5000 lb weapon expands USG capability using JDAM proven performance, identical CONOPS as existing JDAM inventory, and compatibility with aircraft Operational Flight Profile (OFP). This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY 2015, 645312, Hard Target Void Sensing Fuze, efforts were transferred to PE 0605214F, Ground Attack Weapons Fuze Development, 655313, Hard Target Void Sensing Fuze, in order to properly align the funds in the correct Budget Activity, BA05, which supports Engineering, Manufacturing, and Development (EMD).</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Hard Target Void Sensing Fuze (HTVSF) is an advanced system designed to provide fuzing and void sensing functions for legacy penetrator weapons to destroy hardened targets protected by multiple layers of soil and/or reinforced concrete.  The HTVSF will also provide in-flight cockpit programmability, safing and arming, multi-function (time delay and void sensing) and multi-delay arming.  Program Element funding currently supports the Engineering, Manufacturing, and Development (EMD) effort for HTVSF.  The program was created to include the whole spectrum of fuze development.  

This program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>In FY 2015, 645312, Hard Target Void Sensing Fuze, efforts were transferred to PE 0605214F, Ground Attack Weapons Fuze Development, 655313, Hard Target Void Sensing Fuze, in order to properly align the funds in the correct Budget Activity, BA05, which supports Engineering, Manufacturing, and Development (EMD).</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Hard Target Void Sensing Fuze (HTVSF) is an advanced system designed to provide fuzing and void sensing functions for legacy penetrator weapons to destroy hardened targets protected by multiple layers of soil and/or reinforced concrete.  The HTVSF will also provide in-flight cockpit programmability, safing and arming, multi-function (time delay and void sensing) and multi-delay arming.  Program Element funding currently supports the Engineering, Manufacturing, and Development (EMD) effort for HTVSF.  The program was created to include the whole spectrum of fuze development.  

This program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The successful integration of space-based capabilities into the core of U.S. national security operations has resulted in dramatically increased demand for and dependence upon space capabilities. As a result, U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) identified three needs: 1) to rapidly augment existing space capabilities when needed to expand operational capability; 2) to rapidly reconstitute/replenish critical space capabilities to preserve "continuity of operations" capability; 3) to rapidly exploit and infuse space technological or operational innovations to increase U.S. advantage.  Operationally Responsive Space projects were optimized for prioritized theater use and/or surge, augmentation and replenishment of traditional space capabilities.  The ORS Concept of Operations (CONOPS) drives the need for satellites featuring high degrees of modularity, standard interface vehicles, and the use of plug and play payloads and buses.

The Air Force will continue to maintain ORS-1, launched 29 Jun 2011 to respond to U.S. Central Command's (USCENTCOM's) urgent need, validated by USSTRATCOM, to provide  intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) for theater warfighters.  The additional ORS Office efforts of maturing enabling elements will be descoped and the knowledge base will be transitioned as appropriate to other space programs including Global Positioning System, Advanced EHF Milsatcom, Space Based Infrared System, Space Control Technology, and the rest of the space architecture.

ORS projects provide a broad range of capabilities directly supporting warfighter needs. Potential missions include communications, data exfiltration; blue/friendly-force situational awareness; maritime domain awareness; positioning, navigation, and timing; weather; and battlefield ISR.  The highest priorities of the ORS Office are the completion of the Modular Space Vehicle (MSV) Bus development, launch of the ORS-3 Enabler and ORS-4 Super Strypi missions, development of the $60M next generation ORS mission, and the low cost manufacturing initiative.  The remaining priorities for the ORS office are to satisfy the high priority needs for augmentation and reconstitution, such as Missile Warning, Wideband Protected Communication, Narrowband Communication, Space Situational Awareness, and Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR) imagery.

The capabilities planned for Modular Payload mission kits were selected to systematically mature the ORS enabling elements to fully meet the USSTRATCOM specified responsiveness timelines and the 2007 NDAA cost targets. This includes the development of a modular open system architecture employing plug and play standards, such as a Rapid Response Space Works, a modular space vehicle (MSV) and integration with the Multi-Mission Satellite Operations Center (MMSOC).

ORS is working with the University of Hawaii's (U of H) Hawaii Space Flight Laboratory and Sandia National Laboratory on the Super Strypi small launch vehicle to orbit the U of H's HiakaSat environmental monitoring satellite. 

This program is in Budget Activity 04, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes, because the efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes, and prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic environment.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The successful integration of space-based capabilities into the core of U.S. national security operations has resulted in dramatically increased demand for and dependence upon space capabilities. As a result, U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) identified three needs: 1) to rapidly augment existing space capabilities when needed to expand operational capability; 2) to rapidly reconstitute/replenish critical space capabilities to preserve "continuity of operations" capability; 3) to rapidly exploit and infuse space technological or operational innovations to increase U.S. advantage.  Operationally Responsive Space projects were optimized for prioritized theater use and/or surge, augmentation and replenishment of traditional space capabilities.  The ORS Concept of Operations (CONOPS) drives the need for satellites featuring high degrees of modularity, standard interface vehicles, and the use of plug and play payloads and buses.

The Air Force will continue to maintain ORS-1, launched 29 Jun 2011 to respond to U.S. Central Command's (USCENTCOM's) urgent need, validated by USSTRATCOM, to provide  intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) for theater warfighters.  The additional ORS Office efforts of maturing enabling elements will be descoped and the knowledge base will be transitioned as appropriate to other space programs including Global Positioning System, Advanced EHF Milsatcom, Space Based Infrared System, Space Control Technology, and the rest of the space architecture.

ORS projects provide a broad range of capabilities directly supporting warfighter needs. Potential missions include communications, data exfiltration; blue/friendly-force situational awareness; maritime domain awareness; positioning, navigation, and timing; weather; and battlefield ISR.  The highest priorities of the ORS Office are the completion of the Modular Space Vehicle (MSV) Bus development, launch of the ORS-3 Enabler and ORS-4 Super Strypi missions, development of the $60M next generation ORS mission, and the low cost manufacturing initiative.  The remaining priorities for the ORS office are to satisfy the high priority needs for augmentation and reconstitution, such as Missile Warning, Wideband Protected Communication, Narrowband Communication, Space Situational Awareness, and Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR) imagery.

The capabilities planned for Modular Payload mission kits were selected to systematically mature the ORS enabling elements to fully meet the USSTRATCOM specified responsiveness timelines and the 2007 NDAA cost targets. This includes the development of a modular open system architecture employing plug and play standards, such as a Rapid Response Space Works, a modular space vehicle (MSV) and integration with the Multi-Mission Satellite Operations Center (MMSOC).

ORS is working with the University of Hawaii's (U of H) Hawaii Space Flight Laboratory and Sandia National Laboratory on the Super Strypi small launch vehicle to orbit the U of H's HiakaSat environmental monitoring satellite. 

This program is in Budget Activity 04, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes, because the efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes, and prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic environment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

It addresses the gap that exists between when a technology is first demonstrated and when it can be successfully acquired as an operational capability.  TTP bridges that gap by funding promising system and subsystem concepts for technology integration and demonstration to continue beyond the laboratory.  It allows acquisition program managers (the developers and providers) and warfighters (the end users) to integrate, prototype, and demonstrate candidate technologies and assess them in an operational environment.  As a result, the warfighters can assess the capability first-hand and accurately fund the follow-on acquisition program during the next budgeting cycle.  TTP includes research and development funds for the following transition activities: prototyping of promising, high-priority concepts and technologies in an operational environment to lower acquisition risk by raising the technology readiness level; performing pre-acquisition systems engineering to facilitate transition from a demonstration program into acquisition programs of record; assessing interface requirements of candidate concepts, technologies, and demonstration projects to better understand true engineering costs resulting from insertion of new technologies into the Air Force architecture; and capturing data through information technology tools and databases to help formulate strategies and gather proposals for development that have the potential to perform Department of Defense (DoD) missions.  The program provides funding to mature adaptive turbine engine technologies for next generation propulsion systems.  The program will leverage adaptive turbine engine science and technology demonstrations to develop a multi-platform common adaptive engine built around a commercially derived core.

                    <r2:SummaryExplanation>FY13 reductions in Other Adjustments was due to Sequestration. 

FY13 Congressional Directed Reduction was a transfer to Operationally Responsive Space.

In FY13, Congressional Adds ($37M for Alternative Energy Research and $20M for Coal-to-Liquid fuel only for lower emission research) were tech adjusted from the Support Systems Development Program, 0708012F, to TTP to better align research efforts. 

In FY14, Congressional Add of $25M was appropriated to Tech Transition PE for Alternate Energy Research.  Congressional Add of $10M for Alternate Energy Research was tech adjusted from the Support Systems Development Program, 0708012F, to TTP to better align research efforts.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Navigation Warfare (NAVWAR) is deliberate defensive and offensive action to assure and prevent positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) information through coordinated employment of space, cyberspace, and electronic warfare (EW) operations.  The term NAVWAR is sometimes equated with "PNT Superiority".  The Joint Navigation Warfare Center (JNWC) was established by DEPSECDEF Memo, 17 November 2004, as the DoD Center of Excellence, tasked to integrate and coordinate NAVWAR PNT capabilities across electronic spectrum, cyberspace, and space operations.  NAVWAR leverages various techniques and technologies from these mission areas to negate or prevent hostile use of PNT information and protect unimpeded use of PNT information by U.S., Allied, and Coalition Forces while not unduly disrupting peaceful use outside an area of operation. The JNWC develops and maintains the Department's premier collection of NAVWAR knowledge, and provides subject matter expertise support to warfighters, Department decision makers, the Federal Interagency (the Department of Homeland Security and other civil agencies concerned with the Critical National Infrastructure), and the Coalition.  NAVWAR expertise is developed in part by execution of PNT Operational Field Assessments (POFAs), modeling and simulation, analysis, and exercise and training support. In recent years, the Global Positioning System (GPS) has become one of the most critical enablers of modern advanced technology warfare. In an era where everything from advanced weapons systems and networks to basic goods and services are tracked, guided or disciplined by PNT systems such as GPS, NAVWAR is an ever increasing capability of interest and concern, especially if PNT systems are interrupted or lost. Likewise, as Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) proliferate, it becomes necessary to consider not only denying adversary use of GPS but also negating adversary use of alternate GNSS systems for PNT.  Recent revisions to National Defense Strategy and Defense Planning Guidance require Combatant Commands to account for denied / degraded PNT environments in deliberate planning. Projecting force in the Asia-Pacific Region and other theaters of operation requires an understanding  of how evolving global asymmetric anti-access / area denial (A2/AD) threats may affect joint warfighting functions.  JNWC-conducted POFAs are a key element in evaluating Coalition NAVWAR capabilities and vulnerabilities and adversary capabilities and vulnerabilities, both crucial to executing PNT superiority mission sets in potentially denied / degraded PNT environments.  JNWC helps develop defensive and offensive PNT capabilities by focusing on four Joint Mission Essential Tasks (JMETS):

1. Enable Defensive PNT Operations: enable operations that will protect blue force PNT capabilities.
2. Enable Offensive PNT Operations: enable PNT superiority capabilities that can take advantage of GNSS vulnerabilities. 
3. Establish and Maintain PNT Situational Awareness (SA): assess current and projected blue force and red force PNT related capabilities.
4. Develop and Execute NAVWAR Operational Assessments and Analysis for Future NAVWAR Operations and conduct field assessments to evaluate blue force and red force capabilities and vulnerabilities.

The JNWC executes its assigned mission responsibilities through three lines of operation (LOO):

1. Create Knowledge for PNT Superiority: PNT operational field assessments, studies and analysis, assessment and dissemination of PNT related intelligence, and managing the PNT Superiority data repository
2. Operationalize PNT Superiority: Joint Force and Contingency Operations support to Combatant Commands, Services, and other customers through outreach; creating and demonstrating operational capability for PNT Superiority in the near term
3. Institutionalize PNT Superiority: Acquisition, policy, doctrine, and coalition support; creating  the environment for robust PNT Superiority capability in the future

RDT&amp;E funds, reinstated beginning in FY14, will be used primarily to support JMET #4, Develop and Execute NAVWAR Operational Assessments and Analysis for Future NAVWAR Operations and LOO #1, Create NAVWAR Knowledge. GYPSY POFAs are large, often integrated Coalition, assessments conducted to address Combatant Command OPLAN and CONPLAN related PNT capabilities and vulnerabilities in their anticipated theater threat environment.  FORTUNE POFAs are smaller PNT capability and vulnerability assessments used as future GYPSY risk reduction events or as stand-alone PNT capability assessments.

This program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Projecting force in the Asia-Pacific Region and other theaters of operation requires an understanding  of how evolving global asymmetric anti-access / area denial (A2/AD) threats may affect joint warfighting functions.  JNWC-conducted POFAs are a key element in evaluating Coalition NAVWAR capabilities and vulnerabilities and adversary capabilities and vulnerabilities, both crucial to executing PNT superiority mission sets in potentially denied / degraded PNT environments.  JNWC helps develop defensive and offensive PNT capabilities by focusing on four Joint Mission Essential Tasks (JMETS):

1. Enable Defensive PNT Operations: enable operations that will protect blue force PNT capabilities.
2. Enable Offensive PNT Operations: enable PNT superiority capabilities that can take advantage of GNSS vulnerabilities. 
3. Establish and Maintain PNT Situational Awareness (SA): assess current and projected blue force and red force PNT related capabilities.
4. Develop and Execute NAVWAR Operational Assessments and Analysis for Future NAVWAR Operations and conduct field assessments to evaluate blue force and red force capabilities and vulnerabilities.

The JNWC executes its assigned mission responsibilities through three lines of operation (LOO):

1. Create Knowledge for PNT Superiority: PNT operational field assessments, studies and analysis, assessment and dissemination of PNT related intelligence, and managing the PNT Superiority data repository
2. Operationalize PNT Superiority: Joint Force and Contingency Operations support to Combatant Commands, Services, and other customers through outreach; creating and demonstrating operational capability for PNT Superiority in the near term
3. Institutionalize PNT Superiority: Acquisition, policy, doctrine, and coalition support; creating  the environment for robust PNT Superiority capability in the future

RDT&amp;E funds, reinstated beginning in FY14, will be used primarily to support JMET #4, Develop and Execute NAVWAR Operational Assessments and Analysis for Future NAVWAR Operations and LOO #1, Create NAVWAR Knowledge. GYPSY POFAs are large, often integrated Coalition, assessments conducted to address Combatant Command OPLAN and CONPLAN related PNT capabilities and vulnerabilities in their anticipated theater threat environment.  FORTUNE POFAs are smaller PNT capability and vulnerability assessments used as future GYPSY risk reduction events or as stand-alone PNT capability assessments.

This program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY 2014, Project 646002, Three Dimensional Expeditionary Long Range Radar (3DELRR), efforts were transferred from PE 0604283F, Battle Management Command and Control (BMC2) Sensor Development, Project 646002, in order to provide this program its own Program Element.

Totals include funding for PRCP Program Number (PNO) 393, 3DELRR.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Beginning in FY 2014, PE 0207455F funds the development of the Three-Dimensional Expeditionary Long-Range Radar (3DELRR) which will replace the current legacy AN/TPS-75 radar.  3DELRR will be the principal United States Air Force (USAF) long-range, ground-based sensor for detecting, identifying, tracking, and reporting aerial targets for the Joint Force Air Component Commander (JFACC) through the Theater Air Control System (TACS).  3DELRR will respond to the operational need to detect and report highly maneuverable, small radar cross section targets to enable battlefield awareness while at the same time mitigating the reliability, maintainability, and sustainability issues plaguing the AN/TPS-75 radar system.  3DELRR will provide air controllers with a precise, real-time air picture of sufficient quality to conduct control of individual aircraft under a wide range of environmental and operational conditions.  It will replace the aging USAF AN/TPS-75 radar system as the AN/TPS-75 is incapable of detecting some current and emerging threats.  In addition, as the AN/TPS-75 is reaching the end of its service life, it is more difficult and costly to maintain.  The United States Marine Corps (USMC) is considering 3DELRR as a potential replacement for the AN/TPS-59, at the end of its service life, to support the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) Commander through the Marine Air Command and Control System (MACCS).  

3DELRR will address system sustainability, transportability and operational availability shortfalls while providing long-range surveillance, detection, and tracking of Air Breathing Targets (ABTs) and, potentially, Theater Ballistic Missiles (TBMs).  This capability will support the USAF contribution to the primary roles of the Airspace Control Authority (ACA) and the Area Air Defense Commander (AADC) and enhance the USAF contributions to the Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) mission area. 3DELRR will contribute to the USAF critical role in the United States Government/DOD efforts to build partnership capacity via the Defense Exportability Features (DEF) pilot program.  3DELRR will provide the USAF Control and Reporting Center (CRC) and, if purchased by the USMC, the Composite Tracking Network (CTN), with real-time data to display air activity.  

FY 2014 completes the Pre-EMD period of the TD phase.  The EMD phase of the 3DELRR program begins after a MS-B decision in FY 2014.  Acquisition activities for the EMD phase within the FY 2014 timeframe include, but are not limited to; MS-B preparation, MS-B decision, EMD contract award, Integrated Baseline Review (IBR), Critical Design Review (CDR), test planning/preparation and fabrication/test of system components. A CDR is conducted during this timeframe to ensure the program has properly matured the system design and is postured for successful development of three Production Representative Units (PRUs). Activities also include studies and analyses to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.

This program is in Budget Activity 04, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment. Transition to Budget Activity 05 occurs after MS-B decision approval to enter the EMD Phase.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>In FY 2014, Project 646002, Three-Dimensional Expeditionary Long-Range Radar (3DELRR), efforts were transferred from PE 0604283F, Battle Management Command and Control (BMC2) Sensor Development, Project 646002, in order to provide this program its own Program Element.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Beginning in FY 2014, PE 0207455F funds the development of the Three-Dimensional Expeditionary Long-Range Radar (3DELRR) which will replace the current legacy AN/TPS-75 radar.  3DELRR will be the principal United States Air Force (USAF) long-range, ground-based sensor for detecting, identifying, tracking, and reporting aerial targets for the Joint Force Air Component Commander (JFACC) through the Theater Air Control System (TACS).  3DELRR will respond to the operational need to detect and report highly maneuverable, small radar cross section targets to enable battlefield awareness while at the same time mitigating the reliability, maintainability, and sustainability issues plaguing the AN/TPS-75 radar system.  3DELRR will provide air controllers with a precise, real-time air picture of sufficient quality to conduct control of individual aircraft under a wide range of environmental and operational conditions.  It will replace the aging USAF AN/TPS-75 radar system as the AN/TPS-75 is incapable of detecting some current and emerging threats.  In addition, as the AN/TPS-75 is reaching the end of its service life, it is more difficult and costly to maintain.  The United States Marine Corps (USMC) is considering 3DELRR as a potential replacement for the AN/TPS-59, at the end of its service life, to support the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) Commander through the Marine Air Command and Control System (MACCS).  

3DELRR will address system sustainability, transportability and operational availability shortfalls while providing long-range surveillance, detection, and tracking of Air Breathing Targets (ABTs) and, potentially, Theater Ballistic Missiles (TBMs).  This capability will support the USAF contribution to the primary roles of the Airspace Control Authority (ACA) and the Area Air Defense Commander (AADC) and enhance the USAF contributions to the Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) mission area. 3DELRR will contribute to the USAF critical role in the United States Government/DoD efforts to build partnership capacity via the Defense Exportability Features (DEF) pilot program.  3DELRR will provide the USAF Control and Reporting Center (CRC) and, if purchased by the USMC, the Composite Tracking Network (CTN), with real-time data to display air activity.  

FY 2014 completes the Pre-EMD period of the TD phase.  The EMD phase of the 3DELRR program begins after a MS-B decision in FY 2014.  Acquisition activities for the EMD phase within the FY 2014 timeframe include, but are not limited to; MS-B preparation, MS-B decision, EMD contract award, Integrated Baseline Review (IBR), Critical Design Review (CDR), test planning/preparation and fabrication/test of system components. A CDR is conducted during this timeframe to ensure the program has properly matured the system design and is postured for successful development of three Production Representative Units (PRUs). Activities also include studies and analyses to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.

This program is in Budget Activity 04, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment. Transition to Budget Activity 05 occurs after MS-B decision approval to enter the EMD Phase.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a space-based radio Positioning, Navigation, and Time (PNT) distribution system. GPS User Equipment (UE) consists of standardized receivers, antennas, antenna electronics, etc., grouped together in sets to derive navigation and time information transmitted from GPS satellites. These receiver sets are used by DoD. RDT&amp;E funds UE development, integration, test, and analysis for new PNT receiver capabilities in Navigation Warfare (Navwar) across all military platforms using GPS services.

The MGUE Increment 1 program is responsible for the development of standard modernized receiver form factors for the service-nominated lead platforms identified in the draft MGUE Capability Development Document (CDD). This new family of modernized GPS receivers will deliver significantly improved capability to counter current and emerging PNT threats and enable military operations in a Navwar environment where current legacy receiver performance would be compromised. MGUE Increment 1 received a Milestone A decision in April 2012 and is in the Technology Development acquisition phase.  The program received approval in Dec 2013 from the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics to begin planning towards an alternate acquisition strategy to accelerate the program and provide units faster to military end users.

This program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P), because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a space-based radio Positioning, Navigation, and Time (PNT) distribution system. GPS User Equipment (UE) consists of standardized receivers, antennas, antenna electronics, etc., grouped together in sets to derive navigation and time information transmitted from GPS satellites. These receiver sets are used by DoD. RDT&amp;E funds UE development, integration, test, and analysis for new PNT receiver capabilities in Navigation Warfare (Navwar) across all military platforms using GPS services.

The MGUE Increment 1 program is responsible for the development of standard modernized receiver form factors for the service-nominated lead platforms identified in the draft MGUE Capability Development Document (CDD). This new family of modernized GPS receivers will deliver significantly improved capability to counter current and emerging PNT threats and enable military operations in a Navwar environment where current legacy receiver performance would be compromised. MGUE Increment 1 received a Milestone A decision in April 2012 and is in the Technology Development acquisition phase.  The program received approval in Dec 2013 from the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics to begin planning towards an alternate acquisition strategy to accelerate the program and provide units faster to military end users.

This program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P), because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The MGUE program has developed a comprehensive acquisition strategy to provide modernized GPS capabilities to US and Allied forces by: (a) establishing time certain and low risk development; (b) bounding requirements to leverage mature technology to the maximum extent possible; (c) focusing on the development of form factors based on well-defined standards to support lead platform integration; (d) introducing the CGM to support long-term vision and modernized capabilities for non- lead platform and unique applications providing a secure, common-core GPS capability to a broader range of military applications; and (e) implementing a proactive, collaborative MGUE platform integration activity to mitigate risk and reduce cost for Enterprise modernization.

The MGUE program awarded three sole source contracts for the Increment 1 Technology Development Phase effort in September 2012. This effort will span contract award to PDR, including MGUE Increment 1 requirements and preliminary design development. There will be a down-select of up to two contractors for the next phase of the program providing aviation, ground, and CGM form factors for integration into Service Lead Platforms.  MGUE Increment 2 is in the Materiel Solutions Analysis phase.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Global Broadcast Service provides the DoD with an efficient, high data rate broadcast capability from distributed information sources to dispersed warfighters who receive the broadcast directly on small, inexpensive user terminals.  This Program Element funds the broadcast transmit activities associated with the GBS architecture.  The GBS broadcast receive segment in PE 33601F consists of  Service-funded terminals, known as Receive Suites, which receive the broadcast and then disseminate information to local users.   Service Receive Suites and the integration into service networks are funded in other Program Elements.  GBS broadcast data includes video (especially from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles), imagery, logistics, weather data, maps and operational orders.  The GBS space segment includes transponders on operational Navy satellites, currently Ultra High Frequency Follow-On (UFO) 8 and UFO 10, augmentation by commercial leased Ku-band transponders, and now the Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) System.  

The GBS broadcast segment consists of Satellite Broadcast Managers (SBMs) for the broadcast build and Primary Injection Points (PIPs) for the broadcast uplink, and the Transportable Satellite Broadcast Managers (TSBMs) for the broadcast build-in theatre. The SBMs and PIPs, together known as Transmit Suites, are located at Navy facilities. The Theatre Injection Point (TIP) is a ground mobile satellite terminal suite transportable via two heavy High Mobility Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWV) consisting of the TSBM and the Army Phoenix terminal.   

The broadcast creation transitioned to existing Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Defense Enterprise Computing Centers (DECCs).  The DECC will utilize a new hardware and software architecture to resolve impending Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) obsolescence, Information Assurance compliance and sustainment issues. The DECC transition contract was awarded on 15 May 09. This effort was designated as an ACAT III program and funding was realigned (i.e., a separate project was created) to delineate between the current ACAT I GBS program and the ACAT III SBM Transition program.  

This effort continues SBM transition/upgrade to the DISA DECCs, as well as systems transmission security, test, information assurance, program office support and Operational Requirements Document (ORD) III studies. RDT&amp;E Funding for this effort ended in FY13.  No funding in FY15 is requested.

Funding is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration, since program is fielding pre-production equipment.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The GBS broadcast receive segment in PE 33601F consists of  Service-funded terminals, known as Receive Suites, which receive the broadcast and then disseminate information to local users.   Service Receive Suites and the integration into service networks are funded in other Program Elements.  GBS broadcast data includes video (especially from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles), imagery, logistics, weather data, maps and operational orders.  The GBS space segment includes transponders on operational Navy satellites, currently Ultra High Frequency Follow-On (UFO) 8 and UFO 10, augmentation by commercial leased Ku-band transponders, and now the Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) System.  

The GBS broadcast segment consists of Satellite Broadcast Managers (SBMs) for the broadcast build and Primary Injection Points (PIPs) for the broadcast uplink, and the Transportable Satellite Broadcast Managers (TSBMs) for the broadcast build-in theatre. The SBMs and PIPs, together known as Transmit Suites, are located at Navy facilities. The Theatre Injection Point (TIP) is a ground mobile satellite terminal suite transportable via two heavy High Mobility Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWV) consisting of the TSBM and the Army Phoenix terminal.   

The broadcast creation transitioned to existing Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Defense Enterprise Computing Centers (DECCs).  The DECC will utilize a new hardware and software architecture to resolve impending Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) obsolescence, Information Assurance compliance and sustainment issues. The DECC transition contract was awarded on 15 May 09. This effort was designated as an ACAT III program and funding was realigned (i.e., a separate project was created) to delineate between the current ACAT I GBS program and the ACAT III SBM Transition program.  

This effort continues SBM transition/upgrade to the DISA DECCs, as well as systems transmission security, test, information assurance, program office support and Operational Requirements Document (ORD) III studies. RDT&amp;E Funding for this effort ended in FY13.  No funding in FY15 is requested.

Funding is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration, since program is fielding pre-production equipment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Supports Air Education and Training Command's (AETC) implementation of Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training (SUPT) and the Department of Defense initiative for joint pilot training.  The Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) is a joint USAF/USN venture to replace the Services' fleets of primary trainer aircraft (T-37 and T-34 respectively) and their associated Ground Based Training Systems (GBTS) with the T-6 and its GBTS.  The Air Force is the Executive Service.  The T-38 Avionics Upgrade Program (AUP) is an integrated modernization of the T-38A and AT-38B cockpits to support mission ready fighter and bomber training.  The Advanced Trainer Replacement, T-X, will replace AETC's T-38C aircraft and associated GBTS currently used in the fighter/bomber advanced SUPT track as well as in the Introduction to Fighter Fundamentals (IFF) program. The T-38 was first introduced in 1961. 

BA5 - This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production.

The Air Force recognizes that these funds should be in BA 7 and is working to transfer these funds in the next President's Budget submission.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) is a joint USAF/USN venture to replace the Services' fleets of primary trainer aircraft (T-37 and T-34, respectively) and associated Ground Based Training Systems (GBTS).  Additionally the US Army will be purchasing four T-6 Army Variant aircraft to replace the T-34 aircraft for the Army Test and Evaluation Command.  The T-6 aircraft and GBTS are used to train entry-level student aviators in the fundamentals of flying so they can transition into advanced training tracks leading to qualification as military pilots, combat systems officers, and naval flight officers.  The program includes the purchase of aircraft, simulators, and other associated ground-based training devices, Training Integration Management System (TIMS), instructional courseware, and logistics support to include Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS) and development activities related to DMSMS.

FY2013, FY2015 and FY2016 include funding to upgrade software and threat libraries for the T25 Simulator for Electronic Combat Technology (SECT).  The T25 SECT primary training mission is to train undergraduate Combat Systems Officers (CSO) in all fundamental aspects of Electronic Combat (EC), including the operation and application of a wide variety of representative EC equipment in Threat Penetration, Electronic Counter Measures (ECM), Electronic Surveillance Measurement (ESM), and Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) or electronic attack (EA) type operations.  Although in the same project, SECT is unrelated to the JPATS program.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The T-38C Avionics Upgrade Program (AUP) installed a "Glass Cockpit" into the T-38 jet trainer and re-designated the upgraded aircraft from the T-38A/B to the T-38C model.  The AUP modification, which utilized a Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS)/Non-Developmental Item (NDI) approach to acquire kits, is currently in sustainment phase under the T-38C Avionics Post Production Support acquisition program.  The avionics system requires regular block upgrades to keep the system current and airworthy.  Block upgrades incorporate software and/or hardware improvements to comply with new requirements mandated by Department of Defense, Federal Aviation Administration or National Airspace System (DoD/FAA/NAS) and to address flight safety issues.  The block upgrades support the T-38C aircraft and Aircrew Training Devices (ATD).  This effort also includes development of the aircraft Mission Planning System (MPS) support to obtain Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS) currency and certification for T-38C flight operations.  The JMPS requirements are levied from outside the T-38 program office and may or may not correlate with block upgrade requirements.  Additionally, engineering services, studies, analysis and support are required to determine the feasibility of integrating changes into the system and making informed business decisions related to Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS) and other lifecycle related concerns. FY2015 also includes an avionics obsolesence remediation effort to qualify updated instruments in the T-38C.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program consolidates Air Force funding and management of common Electronic Warfare (EW) systems from Materiel Solutions Analysis through Engineering and Manufacturing Development and transition to operational capability.  EW is an integral warfighting effect supporting AF Global Strike, Global Persistent Attack and Global Mobility operations as well as Joint-Coalition operations.  EW systems influence, deceive, disrupt, degrade, deny, and destroy threats to air operations throughout the electromagnetic spectrum. This PE supports Electronic Support (ES), Electronic Protection (EP), and Electronic Attack (EA).  ES programs support the collection, analysis, and dissemination of information related to the detection, geo-location, characterization, and identification of threats to air operations.  EP Programs preserve the electromagnetic spectrum for use by friendly forces.  EA programs provide self-protection through active and passive measures that deceive threats to air operations using kinetic and non-kinetic means to defeat threats that rely on the electromagnetic spectrum (Radio Frequency (RF), Electro-Optical (EO), Infrared (IR)).  

This program is in budget activity 5 - System Development and Demonstration of common EW systems to meet user requirements.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Advanced Infrared Countermeasure (AIRCM) project contains related aircraft self-protection efforts aimed at increasing aircraft survivability against the increasing threat of sophisticated infrared-guided surface-to-air and air-to-air missiles.  These missiles may employ sophisticated next-generation electro-optics or dual-mode IR and radio frequency seekers.  AIRCM will provide advanced IR expendable countermeasures and/or IRCM techniques that will be functionally compatible with existing dispenser systems and employed across multiple USAF weapons systems.  This also explicitly includes any and all flare and decoy development and testing that may be demanded or needed in current operations supporting the war on terrorism regardless of aircraft platform.  Similar activities that are supplementary to this effort may be accomplished ad hoc using platform specific funding or through other testing activities such as joint services or NATO test groups.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Tactical Data Networks Enterprise (TDNE) contributes to the development, delivery and deployment of the next generation aerial layer network through a portfolio of legacy and advanced waveforms and airborne network management/development efforts that advance interoperability and connectivity.  This will be accomplished via fielded and future ground and gateway investments while addressing warfighter urgent demands through the establishment of Quick Reaction Capabilities (QRC).  The TDNE conceptualizes, acquires and fields aerial layer networking capabilities supporting legacy, current, in-development, future and proposed systems across all domains of information exchange enabling strike, mobility, special operations, command and control (C2), intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR), air, surface, subsurface and space operations.  These capabilities ensure a robust and agile extension of the global information domain out to the tactical edge in support of increasing air domain awareness.

Funding will provide for the study (acquisitions current and proposed), analysis, enhancement, development, integration, demonstration, test, and evaluation of Tactical Data Links (TDLs) as a subset of the broader aerial layer networks.  TDLs are used in both peace time and combat environments to exchange information such as character-oriented and fixed-formatted messages, data, radar tracks, target information, platform status, imagery, free-text messaging and command assignments.  TDLs provide interoperability, local and global connectivity, and situational awareness to the user when operating under rapidly changing operational conditions.  TDLs increase mission effectiveness by providing enhanced air domain situational awareness, positive combat identification of aircraft in the network, fusion/correlation of on- and off-board sensor data, digital sharing of machine to machine target and threat information, thereby, enabling time critical targeting and other mission assignment tasking. TDLs are used by all service theater command and control (C2) elements, weapons platforms, and sensors. TDLs include, but are not limited to: Link 16, Link 11, Situational Awareness Data Link (SADL), Variable Message Format (VMF), Intra-Flight Data Link (IFDL), and other Advanced TDL Link technologies, such as Tactical Targeting Network Technology (TTNT) and Multifunction Advanced Data Link (MADL). 

Funding also supports Family of Gateways study (acquisitions current and proposed), analysis, enhancement, development, integration, demonstration, test, and evaluation efforts that will allow joint combat forces to exchange information quickly and accurately by bridging discrete airborne, terrestrial, maritime, and space-based C4ISR networks producing operational effects not possible within individual networks (i.e. Battlefield Airborne Communication Node (BACN).  Gateway functions include enabling interoperability between data formats, protocols, and communication mediums.  Additionally, gateway functions extend connectivity range, consolidate data from multiple networks into high capacity links for transmission to key C4ISR nodes, route information between disadvantaged users, and fuse/correlate data from multiple sources to improve accuracy.  Gateway functions also provide application hosting, shared data storage, on-demand information access, smart data forwarding, and system monitoring/network management.  Funding will also support quick reaction response capability requests by the warfighter and support activities (including ramp-up) associated with the Joint Aerial Layer Network (JALN) Enterprise Analysis of Alternatives and its follow-on activities as directed by the JALN Council, in line with applicability of existing TDL performance, upgrade plans, engineering analysis, cost analysis of system designs and TDN Performance Improvements.  This includes studies and planning for a gateway node with the JALN Enterprise.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Funding will provide for the study, analysis, enhancement, development, integration, demonstration, costing, test, and evaluation of Tactical Data Links (TDL) as a subset of the broader aerial layer network.  TDLs are used in both peacetime and combat environments to exchange information such as character-oriented and fixed-formatted messages, data, radar tracks, target information, platform status, imagery, free-text messaging and command assignments.  TDLs provide interoperability, local and global connectivity, and situational awareness to the user when operating under rapidly changing operational conditions.  TDLs increase mission effectiveness by providing enhanced air domain situational awareness, positive combat identification of aircraft in the network, fusion/correlation of on- and off-board sensor data, digital sharing of machine to machine target and threat information and, thereby, enabling time critical targeting and other mission assignment tasking. TDLs are used by all service theater command and control (C2) elements, weapons platforms, and sensors.  

The number of Air Force platforms hosting TDLs has expanded from C2 aircraft (E-3, E-8, E-11A, EQ-4B, or other JALN analyzed platforms, etc.) to the fighter, bomber, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR), tanker, airlift and other tactical fleets (F-15, F-16, F-22A, Rivet Joint, B-1, B-2, B-52, etc.), as well as to precision guided munitions. Utilization of TDLs in a joint environment requires the integration of terminals into host platforms and interoperability of TDL networks across all deployed joint and coalition platforms.  TDLs have become the primary means of tactical, battlefield communications.

Efforts in this project include waveform and integration activities. 

Waveform:
Waveform activities include, but are not limited to, enabling and supporting Joint Interoperability of Tactical Command and Control Systems (JINTACCS), interoperable System Management and Requirements Transformation (iSMART), Coalition Interoperability, and Link 16 Enhancements.  Funding will provide training, logistics development, certification of individual TDL implementations to joint/allied standards, establishment of service-wide network management procedures/operations, and system wide enhancements/testing.

Integration:
Integration activities include, but are not limited to, Data Link Test Facility (DTF), Air Force Participating Test Unit (AFPTU), Joint Airborne Network Tactical Edge (JAN-TE), Network Centric Capability Assessment (NCCA), Tactical Edge Network C2 (TEN C2), integration analysis of the Joint Warfighting Integrated NetOps (JWIN) Joint Concept Technology Demonstration (JCTD), Cursor on Target (CoT), Tactical Communications Suite (TCS), and analysis of integration on platforms of existing TDN systems, system-of-systems analysis.  Funding will ensure continued enhanced interoperability of Air Force and joint assets through efforts such as early systems engineering and use of the POET (Political, Operational, Economic and Technical) process for program requirements analysis and architectural design development/coordination of all TDN standards and management capabilities, configuration management, platform/system interoperability assessments, development of government reference architectures, and interoperability certification testing.

Activities also include studies and analysis (engineering and cost) to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning efforts for Tactical Data Networks, including development of joint concepts for C2 of JALN, JALN AoA follow-on analysis, JALN gateway planning, and the Joint Tactical Air Picture (JTAP).

This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD), it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Funding supports Family of Gateways study (acquisitions current and proposed), analysis, enhancement, development, integration, costing, demonstration, test, and evaluation efforts that will allow joint combat forces to exchange information quickly and accurately by bridging discrete airborne, terrestrial, maritime, and space-based C4ISR networks producing operational effects not possible within individual networks.  Gateway functions include enabling interoperability between data formats, protocols, and communication mediums.  Additionally, gateway functions extend the connectivity range, consolidate data from multiple networks into high capacity links for transmission to key C2ISR nodes, route information between disadvantaged users, and fuse/correlate data from multiple sources to improve accuracy.  Gateway functions also provide application hosting, shared data storage, on-demand information access, smart data forwarding, and system monitoring/network management.  Funding in this project will also support requests by the warfighter such as the Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN), 5th to 4th and 5th to 5th Generation efforts, and the STRATCOM Distributed Nuclear Command and Control (DNC2) capabilities.  Additionally, funding will support activities associated with the Joint Aerial Layer Network (JALN) Enterprise Analysis of Alternatives and follow-on recommendation, in line with applicability of existing TDL performance, upgrade plans and engineering analysis of system designs and TDN Performance Improvements.  

Efforts in this project include waveform, ground, and quick reaction capability activities.

Waveforms:
Waveform activities include, but are not limited to Common Link Integration Processing (CLIP), Situational Awareness Data Link (SADL), and 5th to 4th Generation efforts. CLIP is a software-only, platform-independent middleware application that provides gateway services between diverse message sets and waveforms. CLIP will initially be fielded on the B-1 and B-52 platforms.  SADL integrates US Air Force close air support aircraft with the networked battlefield via the US Army's Enhanced Position Location Reporting System (EPLRS).  The 5th to 4th Generation gateway facilitates sharing of 5th Generation aircraft track data with 4th Generation aircraft as well as C2 nodes.

Ground:
Ground activities include, but are not limited to the Joint Air Defense System Integrator (JADSI), Pocket J, Link 16 Alaska (LAK), Tactical Edge Network C2 (TEN C2), and Joint Range Extension (JRE)/JRE Transparant Multi-Platform Gateway Equipment Package(JTEP).  Funding will support enhancements to the interoperability and capabilities of fielded gateways through processing capability upgrades, operating system updates, display/graphical user interface upgrades, incorporation of additional messaging standards and protocols, and completion of gateway architecture fielding.

Quick Reaction Capability:
Quick reaction capability activities include, but are not limited to, BACN and Beyond Line of Sight Command and Control (BLOS C2).  Funding will support AF rapid acquisition requirements for communications bridging of waveforms through gateway technology.  

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning efforts for Family of Gateways.

This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD), it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Integrated Base Defense Security Systems (IBDSS) develops, demonstrates, and tests Physical Security Equipment (PSE) systems to include Force Protection.  This program supports the protection of tactical, fixed, and nuclear weapons systems, AF personnel and AF facilities.  The PSE program is organized to provide PSE RDT&amp;E for Air Force specific needs but as a complement to and in conjunction with the PSE RDT&amp;E programs funded by the DOD Physical Security Enterprise and Analysis Group (PSEAG).  As such this program will develop, demonstrate, and test PSE in the same manner and to the same standards and architecture as PSEAG funded projects to ensure interoperability with PSEAG developed PSE.   In development of PSE, this RDT&amp;E program includes spectrum planning for radio frequency (RF), communication security (cyber), and information assurance requirements.  This Program Element also includes funding for Force Protection Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (FP COTS) market research, evaluation and testing.  The FP COTS testing applies to all available technologies (delay, denial, detection, assessment, communication display, access control and power) which are considered effective for AF physical security use.  This program supports the maintenance and test support at Site C-3 and the Cold Weather Test Site (CWTS), as annotated in DoD Directive 3200.11, listing the 46th Test Wing (TW) as a Major Range and Test facility, conducting developmental and operational testing as the primary mission.

This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full rate production.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Integrated Base Defense Security Systems (IBDSS) develops, demonstrates, and tests Physical Security Equipment (PSE) systems to include Force Protection.  This program supports the protection of tactical, fixed, and nuclear weapons systems, AF personnel and AF facilities.  The PSE program is organized to provide PSE RDT&amp;E for Air Force specific needs but as a complement to and in conjunction with the PSE RDT&amp;E programs funded by the DOD Physical Security Enterprise and Analysis Group (PSEAG).  As such this program will develop, demonstrate, and test PSE in the same manner and to the same standards and architecture as PSEAG funded projects to ensure interoperability with PSEAG developed PSE.   In development of PSE, this RDT&amp;E program includes spectrum planning for radio frequency (RF), communication security (cyber), and information assurance requirements.  This Program Element also includes funding for Force Protection Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (FP COTS) market research, evaluation and testing.  The FP COTS testing applies to all available technologies (delay, denial, detection, assessment, communication display, access control and power) which are considered effective for AF physical security use.  This program supports the maintenance and test support at Site C-3 and the Cold Weather Test Site (CWTS), as annotated in DoD Directive 3200.11, listing the 46th Test Wing (TW) as a Major Range and Test facility, conducting developmental and operational testing as the primary mission.

This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full rate production.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

SDB II addresses the following warfighter requirements: attack moving and stationary targets, adverse weather operations, multiple kills per pass, multiple ordnance carriage, precision munitions capability, reduced munitions footprint, increased weapons effectiveness, minimized potential for collateral damage, reduced susceptibility of munitions to countermeasures and provides a network enabled weapon capability via Link-16 and Ultra High Frequency (UHF) Weapon Data Link. The threshold aircraft for the AF is the F-15E, and the threshold aircraft for the DoN are the F-35B and F-35C. Objective aircraft include the F-22, F-16, F-35A, B-2, A-10, MQ-9, B-1, B-52, and the F/A-18 E/F. The AC-130 is being considered as an additional objective platform. SDB II will be compatible with the BRU-61 miniature munitions carriage, the CNU-660/E carriage system, the Common Munitions Bit and Reprogramming Equipment (CMBRE), and the Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS). The SDB II program will develop and field a single weapon storage container (USAF) and a dual weapon container (DoN).

SDB II completed a 42-month competitive Risk Reduction phase in October 2009. Milestone B approval to enter the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase was received on 29 July 2010 and the subsequent Acquisition Program Baseline was signed on 08 October 2010. A Fixed Price Incentive Firm EMD contract was awarded on 09 August 2010. SDB II is a key component of the Air Force's Global Strike Task Force CONOPs and Global Precision Attack Core Function.

This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting Engineering and Manufacturing Development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Small Diameter Bomb Increment II (SDB II) is a joint interest United States Air Force (USAF) and Department of Navy (DoN) ACAT ID program, with the Air Force (AF) as the lead service. SDB II provides the warfighter the capability to attack mobile targets from stand-off, through weather. SDB II addresses the following warfighter requirements: attack moving and stationary targets, adverse weather operations, multiple kills per pass, multiple ordnance carriage, precision munitions capability, reduced munitions footprint, increased weapons effectiveness, minimized potential for collateral damage, reduced susceptibility of munitions to countermeasures and provides a network enabled weapon capability via Link-16 and Ultra High Frequency (UHF) Weapon Data Link. The threshold aircraft for the AF is the F-15E, and the threshold aircraft for the DoN are the F-35B and F-35C. Objective aircraft include the F-22, F-16, F-35A, B-2, A-10, MQ-9, B-1, B-52, and the F/A-18 E/F. The AC-130 is being considered as an additional objective platform. SDB II will be compatible with the BRU-61 miniature munitions carriage, the CNU-660/E carriage system, the Common Munitions Bit and Reprogramming Equipment (CMBRE), and the Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS). The SDB II program will develop and field a single weapon storage container (USAF) and a dual weapon container (DoN).

SDB II completed a 42-month competitive Risk Reduction phase in October 2009. Milestone B approval to enter the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase was received on 29 July 2010 and the subsequent Acquisition Program Baseline was signed on 08 October 2010. A Fixed Price Incentive Firm EMD contract was awarded on 09 August 2010. SDB II is a key component of the Air Force's Global Strike Task Force CONOPs and Global Precision Attack Core Function.

This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting Engineering and Manufacturing Development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The SDB II Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract was awarded using competitive procedures. At the completion of the 42-month Risk Reduction phase in October 2009, one contractor was selected in April 2010 and awarded the EMD contract in August 2010. The EMD contract is a Fixed-Price Incentive Firm (FPIF) contract with priced production options for the first five production lots. SDB II production Lots 1-3 are FPIF. Production Lots 4-5 are fixed price not-to-exceed pricing with an economic price adjustment clause for labor and materials. The Government is buying the SDB II based on the contractor System Performance Specification (SPS) which has been approved by the Government. The contractor is accountable for system performance as defined in the SPS and a system warranty as defined in the EMD contract. Accordingly, the contractor is accountable to the Government for the design of the weapon system, as well as the planning and execution of the Development Test &amp; Evaluation (DT&amp;E) program to verify system performance. The Government formally arranges and funds the use of Government flight test support for DT&amp;E.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program conducts critical planning, technology and capability insertion, and system acquisition of Air Force space control systems and associated command and control systems to meet current and future military space control needs in the face of an emerging threat.  This funding supports the acquisition process including concept development, risk reduction, design, integration, test, and demonstration.  Space control systems include both offensive counterspace (OCS) and defensive counterspace (DCS) systems.  OCS systems include the means to disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy an adversary's space systems, or the information they provide, which may be used for purposes hostile to U.S. national security interests.  DCS systems include both active and passive measures to protect U.S. and friendly space related capabilities (satellites, communications links, and supporting ground systems) from enemy attack or interference.  This includes development efforts to prevent adversarial ability to use U.S. space systems and services for purposes hostile to U.S. national security interests.   Counterspace Command and Control (C2) includes command and control and mission planning capabilities required for the fielding and employment of counterspace systems.  This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration, because it is conducting demonstration, engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated counterspace and space control requirements.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The RAIDRS project performs attack detection, geolocation, reporting, characterization and mission impact assessment for US owned, operated or used space systems.  RAIDRS capabilities support the National Security Strategy of the United States.  RAIDRS is focused on detecting, characterizing, geolocating and reporting satellite communications (SATCOM) radio frequency interference (RFI) using currently existing Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) and Government-Off-the-Shelf (GOTS) technology.  The event information provided by RAIDRS will allow operators to identify possible interference against space capabilities and enable rapid employment of protective responses.  This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration, because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements in preparation for deployment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This effort supports the development of command and control and mission planning capabilities in support of the fielding and employment of  Counterspace Systems.  It provides for the integration and development of collaborative tools to link deployable counterspace systems with Joint Warfighting C2 systems and to enable integrated planning and execution of the counterspace mission.  Developed capabilities will be integrated into current and future command and control systems.  This program will leverage the Joint Execution and Tasking System for Space (JETSS) effort in the development of C2 for future space control and counterspace mission capabilities.  Requirements for this program are derived from AFSPC prioritized AF IMT 1067 IAW AFSPCI 63-104. The activity to modify and prepare JETSS technology/capability for transition in the JMS program is planned to occur during Spiral 5.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Space Situational Awareness (SSA) is knowledge of all aspects of space related to operations as described in the approved SSA Initial Capabilities Document (ICD).  As the foundation for space control, SSA encompasses intelligence on adversary space operations; surveillance of all space objects and activities; detailed reconnaissance of specific space assets; monitoring space environmental conditions; monitoring cooperative space assets; and conducting integrated command, control, communications, processing, analysis, dissemination, and archiving activities.  This Program Element (PE) develops new Air Force sensors, and improved information capabilities for integration across the SSA network; it also includes developmental planning and technology forecasting for future blocks and emerging needs.

A companion program element, 0305940F, Space Situational Awareness Operations, fields, upgrades, operates, and sustains existing sensors and information integration capabilities within the SSA network.  An additional companion program element, 0305614F, JSpOC Mission System, processes surveillance of all space objects and activities, maintains detailed reconnaissance of space assets, fuses space data, maintains awareness of cooperative space assets, and allows JFCC-Space to conduct integrated C2 of space forces. 

Development activities are necessary to deploy new advanced sensors capable of searching for, tracking, and identifying the expanding number of debris objects on orbit as well as the increasing number of satellites launched by other nations, of which many are smaller and more capable than previous spacecraft.  These activities are also required to better integrate the disparate elements of SSA in order to enable rapid and responsive space operations. 

The efforts in PE 0604425 are in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration, because they are conducting development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Space-Based Space Surveillance (SBSS) Block 10 satellite was launched on 25 September 2010 and is currently operational.  

The SBSS Follow-On program will develop and deliver a system that continues providing space object surveillance from space post SBSS Block 10 End-of-Life.  The Follow-On program is based upon the current SSA Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) architectural requirements focused on protecting High Value Assets (HVAs) in Geosynchronous orbit (GEO).  
It will provide the capability to search, detect, and track objects primarily in deep space GEO from a space-based sensor.  Surveillance from space augments existing ground sensors with timely 24-hour, above the weather collection of GEO sallite metric data only possible with a space based sensor and then communicates its findings to the Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Space Fence effort will develop a system of ground-based sensors to improve upon the former Air Force Space Surveillance System (AFSSS), a Very High Frequency (VHF) radar operational from 1961 to 2013.  The Space Fence will provide a more accurate and timely detection capability of smaller orbiting objects, primarily in low-earth orbit (LEO).  The system will use higher frequency S-band radars at globally dispersed sites.  As a result, it will greatly expand the uncued detection and tracking capacity of the Space Surveillance Network, from around 20,000 to up to 100,000+ objects, while working in concert with other network sensors.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Lockheed Martin and Raytheon successfully completed contracts for development through a Preliminary Design Review.  In FY 2013, a full and open competition was conducted and  Milestone B for Increment 1 was held and is pending 2366b ceertification and ADM approval.  A single EMD, Production and Deployment contract will be awarded in FY 2014.  The contract will take a single contractor through Critical Deisgn Review, fabrication, integration, test, production and deployment, with up to two years of Interim Contractor Support (ICS).  The program will utilize a two increment approach.  Increment 1/Initial Operational Capability (IOC) will consist of successful operations at the first radar site located in the Kwajalein Atoll and the Space Operations Center (SOC) at a CONUS location.  Increment 2 will include completion of the second radar at a location which is to be determined pending negotiations with the proposed host nation.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Net-centric Sensors and Data Sources (N-CSDS) efforts migrate the Space Surveillance Network, non-traditional SSA sensors and data sources for use by any entity (primarily the Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC)) into a net-centric enterprise, enabling more rapid distribution of data to the warfighter based on an AFSPC provided prioritization list.  This effort will define and implement the technical architecture, and support the concept to provide the foundational data necessary to enable rapid, responsive decisions by the Commander, United States Strategic Command's Joint Functional Component Commander for Space (JFCC Space) and other national capability users to detect, evaluate, attribute space events.  This effort builds upon and operationalizes the successful Extended Space Sensor Architecture Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ESSA ACTD) and prototypes how disparate and legacy space sensor network data can be translated into a net-centric operating environment.  Data will be exposed as defined by published DoD and community interface standards to ensure technical interoperability. 

Data exposed from Space Situational Awareness (SSA) sensors and other non-traditional data sources via N-CSDS effort will be integrated into the JMS program (PE 0305614F).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The MOU includes description of the need for Australian funding for part of the relocation project.  The project will relocate a C-Band radar to Harold E. Holt Naval Communications Station (HEH NCS) in Australia and upgrade it to perform a Space Situational Awareness (SSA) mission.  When completed, the radar will provide data for catalog maintenance, space object identification, and support for special events (e.g., space launches, satellite breakups, and maneuvers).

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY14 and prior years Space Fence (65A009) is included in PE 0604425F Space Situational Awareness Systems.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Space Fence effort will develop a system of ground-based sensors to improve upon the former Air Force Space Surveillance System (AFSSS), a Very High Frequency (VHF) radar operational from 1961 to 2013. The Space Fence will provide a more accurate and timely detection capability of  smaller orbiting objects, primarily in low-earth orbit (LEO). The system will use higher frequency S-band radars at globally dispersed sites. As a result, it will greatly expand the uncued detection and tracking capacity of the Space Surveillance Network, from around 20,000 to up to 100,000+ objects, while working in concert with other network sensors.  Requirements are identified in the June 2012 approved Space Fence Capabilities Development Document.

This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>In 2015, Project 65A009, Space Fence efforts were transistioned from PE 0604425F - Space Situational Awareness Systems, Project 65A009 in order to improve transparancy for ACAT I acquisition programs.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Space Fence effort will develop a system of ground-based sensors to improve upon the former Air Force Space Surveillance System (AFSSS), a Very High Frequency (VHF) radar operational from 1961 to 2013. The Space Fence will provide a more accurate and timely detection capability of  smaller orbiting objects, primarily in low-earth orbit (LEO). The system will use higher frequency S-band radars at globally dispersed sites. As a result, it will greatly expand the uncued detection and tracking capacity of the Space Surveillance Network, from around 20,000 to up to 100,000+ objects, while working in concert with other network sensors.  Requirements are identified in the June 2012 approved Space Fence Capabilities Development Document.

This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Lockheed Martin and Raytheon successfully completed contracts for development through a Preliminary Design Review. In FY13, a full and open competition was conducted and Milestone B for Increment 1 was held and is pending 2366b certification and ADM approval. A single Engineering, Manufacturing, and Development (EMD), Production and Deployment contract will be awarded in FY14. The contract will take a single contractor through Critical Design Review (CDR), fabrication, integration, test, production and deployment, with up to two years of Interim Contractor Support (ICS). The program will utilize a two increment approach. Increment 1/Initial Operational Capability (IOC) will consist of successful operations at the first radar site located in the Kwajalein Atoll and the Space Fence Operations Center (SOC) at a CONUS location. Increment 2 will include completion of the second radar at a location which is to be determined pending negotiations with the proposed host nation.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This project concentrates on the overall systems engineering, modeling and simulation, architecture and network requirements development, effectiveness assessment and requirements allocation to component systems of the Airborne Electronic Attack (AEA) System of Systems (SoS).  It also includes establishment and use of virtual test capabilities for system of systems effectiveness testing/evaluation for AEA, studies and technology risk mitigation demonstrations for potential AEA SoS components and AEA SoS battle management, development planning, and the development and maintenance of the Air Force electronic warfare capability investment strategy.  These efforts are crucial in the development of critical electronic attack capabilities in support of Air Force and joint operations to include Global Strike and Persistent Global Attack Concepts of Operations (CONOPS).

The joint AEA SoS includes the Navy EA-6B and EA-18G core components; the Air Force Miniature Air Launched Decoy (MALD) and its stand-in jammer variant, MALD-J; the EC-130H Compass Call Baseline 0 (formerly Block 35) configuration; Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar equipped aircraft; potentially an unmanned recoverable stand-in jamming platform; potentially a manned low/mid frequency, high power component capable of location and reactive jamming suppression of enemy integrated air defense system (IADS) radars outside the ranges of the associated Surface-to-Air Missiles (SAMs) and non-IADS targets.  Recent events have led to an increased focus on developing advanced electronic attack capabilities for use in irregular warfare against non-IADS targets such as communication networks, remote controlled improvised explosive devices and man portable air defenses.  In addition, there is an increased focus on examining non-traditional electronic attack alternatives to counter both IADS and non-IADS components such as communication networks, computers, command and control links, etc. in both major combat and irregular warfare scenarios.

This program is included in budget activity 5, System Development and Demonstration, because of the development and/or testing associated with Airborne Electronic Attack.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project concentrates on the overall systems engineering, modeling and simulation, architecture and network requirements development, effectiveness assessment and requirements allocation to component systems of the Airborne Electronic Attack (AEA) System of Systems (SoS).  It also includes establishment and use of virtual test capabilities for system of systems effectiveness testing/evaluation for AEA, studies and technology risk mitigation demonstrations for potential AEA SoS components and AEA SoS battle management, development planning, and the development and maintenance of the Air Force electronic warfare capability investment strategy.  These efforts are crucial in the development of critical electronic attack capabilities in support of Air Force and joint operations to include Global Strike and Persistent Global Attack Concepts of Operations (CONOPS).

The joint AEA SoS includes the Navy EA-6B and EA-18G core components; the Air Force Miniature Air Launched Decoy (MALD) and its stand-in jammer variant, MALD-J; the EC-130H Compass Call Baseline 0 (formerly Block 35) configuration; Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar equipped aircraft; potentially an unmanned recoverable stand-in jamming platform; potentially a manned low/mid frequency, high power component capable of location and reactive jamming suppression of enemy integrated air defense system (IADS) radars outside the ranges of the associated Surface-to-Air Missiles (SAMs) and non-IADS targets.  Recent events have led to an increased focus on developing advanced electronic attack capabilities for use in irregular warfare against non-IADS targets such as communication networks, remote controlled improvised explosive devices and man portable air defenses.  In addition, there is an increased focus on examining non-traditional electronic attack alternatives to counter both IADS and non-IADS components such as communication networks, computers, command and control links, etc. in both major combat and irregular warfare scenarios.

This program is included in budget activity 5, System Development and Demonstration, because of the development and/or testing associated with Airborne Electronic Attack.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

1. SBIRS EMD:  The Space-Based Infrared Systems (SBIRS) primary mission is to provide initial warning of a ballistic missile attack on the US, its deployed forces, and its allies. SBIRS will enhance detection and improve reporting of intercontinental ballistic missile launches, submarine launched ballistic missile launches, and tactical ballistic missile launches. SBIRS supports Missile Defense, Battlespace Awareness, and Technical Intelligence missions by providing reliable, accurate, and timely data to Unified Combatant Commanders, Joint Task Force (JTF) Commanders, the intelligence community, and other users. SBIRS provides increased detection and tracking performance in order to meet requirements in Air Force Space Command's Operational Requirements Document. The SBIRS system includes both space and ground elements. The space segment consists of Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO) satellites, payloads hosted on satellites in Highly Elliptical Orbit (HEO), and Defense Support Program (DSP) satellites. The ground segment consists of both fixed and mobile data processing elements, communications infrastructure, and relay ground stations serving all SBIRS space elements. The HEO-1 and HEO-2 payloads are on-orbit and certified for Integrated Tactical Warning/Attack Assessment (ITW/AA) missile warning operations and technical intelligence operations. The GEO-1 and GEO-2 satellites have completed AFSPC and USSTRATCOM operational acceptance.  GEO-1 received ITW/AA certification in August 2013  The GEO-2 satellite received ITW/AA certification in December 2013. Ground segment development continues through FY18.  The baseline requirement document is the 1996 SBIRS ORD.

2. SMI: Future SBIRS Overhead Persistent Infrared (OPIR) satellites will be procured using the Department of Defense (DOD) Efficient Space Procurement (ESP) concept. ESP is an approach which seeks stable production and efficient sub-contractor product management through the block buy of two space vehicles at one time (please see SBIRS P-40 Exhibit). A portion of the savings realized from ESP block buys are programmed for investment into OPIR Space Modernization Initiative (SMI); the current OPIR SMI project was established in this manner in the FY12 President's Budget. The primary objective of SMI is to enable and inform future decisions to maintain and evolve a capable, resilient, and affordable OPIR architecture, by maturing technologies and mitigating risk areas to facilitate OPIR modernization to be executed within the Department's constrained resources.  SMI supports the Program of Record by assessing future parts and material obsolescence and future affordability and capability design modifications.  SMI funds engineering activities to reduce future system and production costs through manufacturing and producibility enhancements and through technology insertion. SMI will also mature potential technology upgrades at the component and system level for future space and ground architecture affordability and capability enhancements. The SBIRS OPIR SMI plan includes studies and risk reduction activities to evolve the current Program of Record SBIRS GEO satellites, reduce production schedules, and reduce system costs. SMI funded data exploitation efforts include OPIR mission data processing, data fusion, data publication, algorithm development, network connectivity, and sensor performance assessments. The data exploitation efforts will identify affordable, responsive, and resilient measures to improve battlespace awareness data dissemination to the warfighter. SMI Architecture and Component Study efforts will assess future architecture alternatives for viability, affordability, capability and resilience. The SMI Hosted Payloads and Wide Field of View Testbeds efforts will explore technology maturation, qualification of new components, and subsystem/component prototyping to evolve the OPIR architecture.

3. Evolved SBIRS Follow-on: Knowledge gained from the SBIRS SMI projects will inform a future Defense Acquisition Board(DAB)decision for the Evolved SBIRS effort.  DAB alternatives are expected to include 1) continued production of SBIRS PoR design; 2) an evolved satellite and ground system derived from the SBIRS POR designs; 3) an evolved satellite and ground system that includes a combination of PoR derivatives and new systems; or 4)a disaggregated OPIR system.  The Evolved SBIRS effort will implement the DAB directed program alternative begining with FY18 funding.  The Evolved SBIRS efforts will also include the initial HEO 5-6 development anticipate to begin in FY19.

This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Future SBIRS Overhead Persistent Infrared (OPIR) satellites will be procured using the Department of Defense (DOD) Efficient Space Procurement (ESP) concept. ESP is an approach which seeks stable production and efficient sub-contractor product management through the block buy of two space vehicles at one time (please see SBIRS P-40 Exhibit). A portion of the savings realized from ESP block buys are programmed for investment into OPIR Space Modernization Initiative (SMI); the current OPIR SMI project was established in this manner in the FY12 President's Budget. The primary objective of SMI is to enable and inform future decisions to maintain and evolve a capable, resilient, and affordable OPIR architecture, by maturing technologies and mitigating risk areas to facilitate OPIR modernization to be executed within the Department's constrained resources.  SMI supports the Program of Record by assessing future parts and material obsolescence and future affordability and capability design modifications.  SMI funds engineering activities to reduce future system and production costs through manufacturing and producibility enhancements and through technology insertion. SMI will also mature potential technology upgrades at the component and system level for future space and ground architecture affordability and capability enhancements. The SBIRS OPIR SMI plan includes studies and risk reduction activities to evolve the current Program of Record SBIRS GEO satellites, reduce production schedules, and reduce system costs. SMI funded data exploitation efforts include OPIR mission data processing, data fusion, data publication, algorithm development, network connectivity, and sensor performance assessments. The data exploitation efforts will identify affordable, responsive, and resilient measures to improve battlespace awareness data dissemination to the warfighter. SMI Architecture and Component Study efforts will assess future architecture alternatives for viability, affordability, capability and resilience. The SMI Hosted Payloads and Wide Field of View Testbeds efforts will explore technology maturation, qualification of new components, and subsystem/component prototyping to evolve the OPIR architecture.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The program office will use a variety acquisition approaches to execute various concept studies, technology maturation efforts, testbed/prototype demonstrations, and data exploitation initiatives and projects.  The program office will collaborate with appropriate contracting agencies to support each individual effort. Activities such as SBIRS GEO obsolescence and affordability enhancements to the existing satellite design will leverage existing Program of Record contracts. Technology maturation and component prototyping and/or qualification could leverage existing contracts, but where practical could be competed.  New technology, replacement components and system designs will be acquired with government data rights to a maximum extent to allow their incorporation into any future OPIR satellite production or system development. Contracting partnerships with other agencies will also be used to study, develop and demonstrate and prove emerging capabilities.  FFRDC and SETA contractors will also be used to conduct and support studies.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Knowledge gained from the SBIRS SMI projects will inform a future Defense Acquisition Board (DAB) decision for the Evolved SBIRS effort.  DAB alternatives are expected to include 1) continued production of SBIRS PoR design; 2) an evolved satellite and ground system derived from the SBIRS POR designs; 3) an evolved satellite and ground system that includes a combination of PoR derivatives and new systems; or 4) a disaggregated OPIR system.  The Evolved SBIRS effort will implement the DAB directed program alternative begining with FY18 funding.  The Evolved SBIRS efforts will also include the initial HEO 5-6 development (anticipate to begin in FY19).

The "cost to complete" and "total cost" fields above will be populated after completion of the formal cost estimate in support of the DAB decision.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY 2015, Project 653133, Bombs &amp; Fuzes, includes new start efforts, Improved Lethality (IL).</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Armament/Ordnance Development program provides for initial and continuing development of weapons/munitions (kinetic and non-kinetic) and munitions equipment for support and operational use.  This program develops and improves the following weapons and weapons subsystems:  bombs, bomb fuzes (to include the FMU-152 and FMU-139 general purpose, commodity fuzes), insensitive explosive fills (Insensitive Munitions - IM), aircraft ammunition, stores-aircraft interface upgrades to include the Universal Armament Interface (UAI), directed energy technology transition to weapons, munitions materiel handling equipment (MMHE), munitions containers, and other weapon subsystems.
  
- Bombs and Fuzes (Armament Subsystems):  This project develops and improves conventional weapons/munitions (kinetic and non-kinetic) and fuzes.  The project also provides an opportunity to quickly insert emerging technologies into existing and developing aircraft munitions and fuzes.  Bombs and fuzes provides research, development and testing of conventional warhead and fuzing modifications to improve lethality against area targets, to include anti-personnel anti-material (APAM) targets.  This project provides for the development and testing necessary to provide a suitable manufacturing base of conventional warheads and fuzes.  The project provides for research, development, and testing of medium caliber ammunition and enterprise management of guns, ammunition, and Munitions Materiel Handling Equipment (MMHE) systems integration and testing to ensure tested and certified medium caliber ammunition is provided to users.  The project helps the AF meet Insensitive Munitions (IM) compliance requirements through strategic planning, development of insensitive explosive fills, and bomb case modifications to make weapons insensitive to unplanned stimuli.   Armament Standardization/Control/Munitions Materiel Handling Equipment (MMHE) is a continuing project to develop and improve the standardization and commonality of munitions handling and armament equipment to preclude duplication.  This project also funds the operation of the tri-service Container Design Retrieval System (CDRS), maintaining a container database to preclude proliferation and duplication of munitions containers and supporting organic container design.

- BLU-109 and BLU-113 Upgrade [Advanced BLU-109 and BLU-113 (A2K/A5K)]:  This project demonstrates advancements in capability of these two legacy penetrator warheads, enabling them to hold more targets at risk than currently achievable.

- Stores-Aircraft Interface: This project conducts stores-aircraft interface upgrades and standards development to include the Universal Armament Interface (UAI).  UAI is an Air Force initiative to develop standardized software interfaces in aircraft, weapons and mission planning to support integration of weapons independent of aircraft Operational Flight Program (OFP) cycles. Significant savings of cost and time are achieved using UAI.

This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full rate production.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Bombs &amp; Fuzes (Armament Subsystems) Project contains a variety of work:

- Bombs/munitions and fuzes.
(a) Medium Caliber Ammunition project assesses, refines, and develops medium caliber ammunition, to include, but not limited to, conducting PGU-28A/B (F-22) and 25mm (F-35) qualification testing.
(b)  This project funds follow-on development activities for legacy fuzes, including reliability enhancements and producibility improvements.
(c) Improved Lethality (IL): IL continues and expands development planning and legacy warhead efforts to improve lethality against area targets, to include anti-personnel anti-material (APAM) targets.  This effort studies, designs, develops and tests warhead and fuzing modifications which improve  lethality against APAM while meeting current DoD policy on cluster munitions and unintended harm to civilians.  These improvements may be synergistic with maintaining a suitable manufacturing base.  This effort is a new start effort in Project 653133, Bombs &amp; Fuzes, in FY15.

- Insensitive Munitions (IM). IM develops less sensitive explosive fills and bomb case modifications to improve the response of conventional weapons to unplanned stimuli. The project also supports AF IM strategic planning to achieve IM compliance IAW U.S. Code, Title 10, Subtitle A, Part N, Chapter 141, Section 2389, Ensuring safety regarding insensitive munitions.

- Munitions Materiel Handling Equipment (MMHE) and Container Design Retrieval System (CDRS).  Armament Standardization/Control/Munitions Materiel Handling Equipment (MMHE) is a continuing project to develop and improve the standardization and commonality of munitions handling and armament equipment to preclude duplication.  Efforts are limited to the study, design, and development of MMHE and armament control systems.  Procurement will be performed and funded by the applicable weapons system project.  The tri-service  Container Design Retrieval System (CDRS) is a database intended to preclude proliferation and duplication of munitions containers.  It also supports organic container design, acquisition transportation, prototyping and testing capabilities, as well as the Joint Ordnance Commander's Working Group (JOCG) for Packaging, Handling, and Loading.

The enhancements will enable these two weapons to hold more targets at risk than currently achievable with legacy weapons.  The initial effort will focus on demonstrating an advanced 2000 lb (A2K) warhead and an advanced 5000 lb (A5K) warhead, which improve the survivability and reliability of the legacy warheads.  The project leverages work previously accomplished by the Legacy Warhead Improvement Program (LWIP).
 

BA5 - This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Universal Armament Interface (UAI) is an Air Force program to develop, enhance, and implement standardized interfaces in current and future aircraft (manned or unmanned), weapons and mission planning to support integration of weapons independent of aircraft Operational Flight Program (OFP) cycles. UAI is currently being implemented on the F-15E, F-16 Block 40/50, and EPAF(European Participating Air Forces) F-16 aircraft, Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) I and II, Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM), Laser JDAM, Joint Air-to-Surface Stand-off Missile (JASSM) and Precision Guided Munitions Planning Software (PGMPS). Additional aircraft and weapons, including but not limited to, Joint Strike Fighter (JSF/F-35), MQ-9, as well as Army and Navy systems, have program plans to implement UAI. The UAI program office is responsible for development and enhancement of the standard (U.S. and allied),  support to coalition/allied/joint interoperability efforts for weapons-platform interface efforts, provision of certification tools and implementation support to aircraft and weapons.

BA5 - This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>In December 2004, under the authority of a class Justification and Approval (J&amp;A), the UAI program office awarded individual Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contracts to Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Raytheon.  Each Original Equipment Manufacturer is responsible for a different piece of the total UAI requirement based on its product-specific (platform/weapon) expertise.  During FY10 these contracts expired.  Under the authority of a new class J&amp;A, Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF) contracts were awarded to the four UAI vendors in August 2010.  Follow-on period of performance was awarded in February 2013 for 12 months to better align future contract awards with funding through the Five Year Defense Plan.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project Chicken Little (PCL) continues providing superior rapid reaction signature exploitation capabilities for use on both the traditional and the asymmetrical battlefield. PCL delivers vital one-of-a-kind research, development, test and evaluation (RDT&amp;E) expertise directly to the warfighter, capability developer, and allied/coalition forces.

From its inception in 1985, PCL constantly advances the state-of-the-art for developmental smart munitions, seekers/sensors and their platforms.  PCL also focuses its capability against today's networked weapons, emerging weapon concepts, and helps develop innovative targeting technologies to be employed against a wide variety of vehicle targets, theater air defense units, and an extensive array of associated equipment.  

Combat systems and support equipment exhibit physical characteristics (i.e. signatures), and present certain vulnerabilities, which can be exploited by various targeting technologies leading to the elimination or incapacitation of the threat through the application of force (e.g. smart munitions or directed energy) or application of intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance (ISR) methods.  PCL collects physical, functional, and signature attributes of real foreign threat systems and related equipment; these data feed high-fidelity models used to predict detection, classification, vulnerability and effectiveness performance for ISR sensor and weapon system design.  PCL collects high resolution signature data using a variety of ground, air, and space-based sensors against both new and existing (obtained, sustained, and maintained to be signature representative) foreign targets; with and without the presence of camouflage, concealment, and deception materials; and operated using enemy tactics/CONOPS.  The resulting highly reliable, realistic  data directly supports munitions/targeting development programs and helps mitigate overall acquisition risk. PCL serves as a major focal point for joint signature exploitation, collection, and dissemination amongst the DoD and intelligence community (IC). PCL is a prime contributor in the time critical process to rapidly exploit, assess, and determine US and allied weapon/targeting performance against high value targets.  Customers include: the major Defense and Service Intelligence Centers, all Services, the Joint Technical Coordinating Group (JTCG) who develop the Joint Munitions Effectiveness Manuals (JMEMs), Combatant Commands, AF Major Commands, US Air Force Weapons School curriculum support, and others. Current projects include, but are not limited to: target signature exploitation, target geometric modeling (for identifying vulnerabilities), improving air capabilities against protected structures (specifically hard and deeply buried targets), and the testing of multiple seekers, sensors, and targeting technologies in representative environments against COCOM/MAJCOM/IC high value targets.

                                    <r2:Description>A critical underpinning of the System Exploitation major thrust area, Sensor Week occurs in even years and provides a unique air, ground, and National Technical Means (NTM) demonstration/validation of candidate Seeker/Sensor/ISR technologies.

Sensor Week is a specialized venue of the System Exploitation Major Thrust area; therefore, in even calendar years this major thrust receives the majority of the program element funding.  During odd calendar years this major thrust area receives funding for planning the next Sensor Week.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program supports the vision of Agile Combat Support (ACS), which is to provide an integrated and interoperable mission-ready total force capable of delivering responsive, persistent, effective, and affordable support across the range of military operations to achieve joint effects. To this end, ACS is challenged to provide lighter, leaner, rapidly-deployable and technologically-advanced materiel and forces; timelier planning and execution capabilities; and more agile, responsive, and efficient sustainment capabilities to the warfighter. Consequently, this program provides capabilities to field, base, protect, support, and sustain air, space, and cyberspace forces with an intentional focus on efficiency and effectiveness. Current projects in this program provide Civil Engineering Readiness (BPAC 652895) and Aeromedical Readiness (BPAC 654910). Civil Engineering Readiness projects enable rapid deployment, defense, and sustainment of airfield operations within established timelines anywhere in the world. Aeromedical Readiness projects provide aerospace medical systems and treatment equipment to meet unique, worldwide warfighter medical operational requirements.

In general, unplanned STF projects are an urgent response to real-time capabilities gaps identified by the warfighter which may be satisfied quickly by purchasing commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) products. COTS products require a STF certification before use by the warfighter. Historically, approximately five urgent STF evaluations are made each year.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The majority of efforts funded in this project employ a streamlined acquisition approach. Whenever practical, Government-Off-The-Shelf/Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (GOTS/COTS) items are tested and evaluated as candidates for solutions to user needs. This normally involves characterization, verification, and qualification testing to ensure GOTS/COTS equipment is properly certified and adapted for military purposes. However, acquisition strategies may be carried out at the project level for traditional Engineering, Manufacturing and Development (EMD), e.g., Integrated Aircrew Ensemble (IAE) and Aircrew Laser Eye Protection (ALEP) Block III.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Combat Training Range (CTR) program provides equipment and support to Air Force units and combat training ranges for mission testing, training, and evaluation of aircrews, as well as the operational testing of weapon systems and tactics under simulated combat conditions.  This program provides funding for the development and integration of electronic warfare training capabilities to include P5 Combat Training Systems (P5CTS), threat emitters, communication jammers, instrumentation equipment/systems, and evolutionary upgrades to facilitate standardization and integration across all platforms to include coalition and 5th Generation aircraft.  The P5 Combat Training System, a collaborative development between USAF and USN, provides air combat training systems for the services at operational locations worldwide.  Increments include: hardware and software upgrades; an encrypted software communications architecture compliant data link to facilitate interoperability in a security environment and training with 5th Generation aircraft; internal pod replacement subsystems; integration of new aircraft Operational Flight Programs. This program also includes the development of advanced threat emitters. The Joint Threat Emitter (JTE) continues the development of a comprehensive suite of threat signals for aircrew tactics and electronic combat training for simulated penetrations of hostile airspace. This program complements existing range threat simulators by emulating signals that simulate current and future air defense and threat radars. JTE awarded a follow-on production contract to improve the current baseline by removing obsolescence and proprietary software to enable full organic sustainment. The follow-on production contract includes the development of a non-proprietary software baseline and the procurement of that source code in addition to JTE systems, Mobile Command and Control Units (MC2U), Fixed Command and Control Units (FC2U), and additional spares. Consistent with an evolutionary acquisition strategy and documented ACC training requirements, development will continue with next generation threat systems. Future developments will continue to add additional capability to the warfighter's training ranges. The Advanced Radar Threat System (ARTS) program, formerly named JTE Increment 2, will develop, design, build and test threat system simulators based on advanced foreign fielded surface-to-air missile (SAM) radar threat systems. ARTS is designed to be used at Department of Defense (DoD) training ranges for aircrew training and tactics development to increase combat effectiveness and aircrew survivability by training aircrews to engage or defend against an advanced SAM threat before encountering it in actual combat. Various aircraft platforms may train against ARTS, but the most stringent requirements placed on ARTS design come from 5th generation aircraft capabilities. The ARTS-Variant 1 (ARTS-V1) is focused on strategic, long-range, re-locatable radar threat systems while ARTS-Variant 2 (ARTS-V2) is focused on tactical, mobile, short/medium-range radar threat systems. Since a similar ARTS-V1 capability is being developed through the Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program, ARTS-V2 development is being accelerated. It was originally to start development after ARTS-V1 was in procurement. This program also funds development of replacement components for Legacy Range Threat Systems (due to obsolescence) to extend the system's service life .  Legacy Systems include the Multiple Threat Emitter System (MUTES), the Miniature Multiple Threat Emitter System (Mini-MUTES), the Modular Threat Emitter (MTE) system, the Tactical Radar Threat Generator (TRTG) system, the Band Simulator, the Common Electronic Attack Receiver (CEAR) and the Unmanned Modular Threat Emitter (UMTE) system. Additionally, this program funds ongoing analyses, studies, risk reduction efforts, and technology development to enhance range systems, such as combat training range equipment integration into a Live Virtual Constructive architecture, communication and GPS jammers, weapon drop scoring systems and infrastructure networks. These enhancements add a critical dimension to exercises and optimize warfighter training.

This program is in Budget Activity 5 - Systems Development and Demonstration because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Combat Training Range (CTR) program provides equipment and support to Air Force units and combat training ranges for mission testing, training, and evaluation of aircrews, as well as the operational testing of weapon systems and tactics under simulated combat conditions.  This program provides funding for the development and integration of electronic warfare training capabilities to include P5 Combat Training Systems (P5CTS), threat emitters, communication jammers, instrumentation equipment/systems, and evolutionary upgrades to facilitate standardization and integration across all platforms to include coalition and 5th Generation aircraft.  The P5 Combat Training System, a collaborative development between USAF and USN, provides air combat training systems for the services at operational locations worldwide.  Increments include: hardware and software upgrades; an encrypted software communications architecture compliant data link to facilitate interoperability in a security environment and training with 5th Generation aircraft; internal pod replacement subsystems; integration of new aircraft Operational Flight Programs. This program also includes the development of advanced threat emitters. The Joint Threat Emitter (JTE) continues the development of a comprehensive suite of threat signals for aircrew tactics and electronic combat training for simulated penetrations of hostile airspace. This program complements existing range threat simulators by emulating signals that simulate current and future air defense and threat radars. JTE awarded a follow-on production contract to improve the current baseline by removing obsolescence and proprietary software to enable full organic sustainment. The follow-on production contract includes the development of a non-proprietary software baseline and the procurement of that source code in addition to JTE systems, Mobile Command and Control Units (MC2U), Fixed Command and Control Units (FC2U), and additional spares. Consistent with an evolutionary acquisition strategy and documented ACC training requirements, development will continue with next generation threat systems. Future developments will continue to add additional capability to the warfighter's training ranges. The Advanced Radar Threat System (ARTS) program, formerly named JTE Increment 2, will develop, design, build and test threat system simulators based on advanced foreign fielded surface-to-air missile (SAM) radar threat systems. ARTS is designed to be used at Department of Defense (DoD) training ranges for aircrew training and tactics development to increase combat effectiveness and aircrew survivability by training aircrews to engage or defend against an advanced SAM threat before encountering it in actual combat. Various aircraft platforms may train against ARTS, but the most stringent requirements placed on ARTS design come from 5th generation aircraft capabilities. The ARTS-Variant 1 (ARTS-V1) is focused on strategic, long-range, re-locatable radar threat systems while ARTS-Variant 2 (ARTS-V2) is focused on tactical, mobile, short/medium-range radar threat systems. Since a similar ARTS-V1 capability is being developed through the Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program, ARTS-V2 development is being accelerated. It was originally to start development after ARTS-V1 was in procurement. This program also funds development of replacement components for Legacy Range Threat Systems (due to obsolescence) to extend the system's service life .  Legacy Systems include the Multiple Threat Emitter System (MUTES), the Miniature Multiple Threat Emitter System (Mini-MUTES), the Modular Threat Emitter (MTE) system, the Tactical Radar Threat Generator (TRTG) system, the Band Simulator, the Common Electronic Attack Receiver (CEAR) and the Unmanned Modular Threat Emitter (UMTE) system. Additionally, this program funds ongoing analyses, studies, risk reduction efforts, and technology development to enhance range systems, such as combat training range equipment integration into a Live Virtual Constructive architecture, communication and GPS jammers, weapon drop scoring systems and infrastructure networks. These enhancements add a critical dimension to exercises and optimize warfighter training.

This program is in Budget Activity 5 - Systems Development and Demonstration because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY 2014, Project Number 652053, National Air Intel Center, efforts transferred to PE 0603260F (BA5), Intelligence Advanced Development, Project Number 652053, National Air Intel Center, in order to increase management efficiency, reduce administrative actions, and ensure continued minimization of effort duplication.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Intelligence Equipment (IE) Program Element (PE) performs the engineering development of software, and/or automated information operations techniques to streamline the processing, integration, exploitation, display, and dissemination of strategic and tactical intelligence information.  IE provides continuing development and upgrades of threat analysis capabilities to produce integrated, predictive air and space intelligence to enable military operations, force modernization decisions, and policymaking.  IE accelerates and increases the accuracy of threat estimates and system descriptions to deployed operational forces.  IE also provides clients with accurate, predictive, relevant, and timely intelligence support client processes, operational planning, and mission execution.  IE develops new or upgraded analysis, modeling and simulation tools focused on intelligence production in support of all source AF operational and developmental functions.  Each of the development projects within the IE program portfolio transition technologies to the operational communities through the incremental release of upgraded versions over a period of years as the development projects progress towards the final configuration.  IE may reallocate existing resources to support out-of-cycle new/updated warfighter requirements.  Requirements for this PE are gathered and prioritized by the Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Agency (AFISRA).  Development of new/improved capabilities to meet the requirements is managed by Air Force Research Lab (AFRL)/Analytical Systems Branch (RIED).  

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.

This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because the program develops and inserts new technologies into existing systems and models in order to keep existing systems current and affordable while ensuring system integration, interoperability, and utility.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Intelligence Equipment (IE) Program Element (PE) performs the engineering development of software, and/or automated information operations techniques to streamline the processing, integration, exploitation, display, and dissemination of strategic and tactical intelligence information.  IE provides continuing development and upgrades of threat analysis capabilities to produce integrated, predictive air and space intelligence to enable military operations, force modernization decisions, and policymaking.  IE accelerates and increases the accuracy of threat estimates and system descriptions to deployed operational forces.  IE also provides clients with accurate, predictive, relevant, and timely intelligence support client processes, operational planning, and mission execution.  IE develops new or upgraded analysis, modeling and simulation tools focused on intelligence production in support of all source AF operational and developmental functions.  Each of the development projects within the IE program portfolio transition technologies to the operational communities through the incremental release of upgraded versions over a period of years as the development projects progress towards the final configuration.  IE may reallocate existing resources to support out-of-cycle new/updated warfighter requirements.  Requirements for this PE are gathered and prioritized by the Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Agency (AFISRA).  Development of new/improved capabilities to meet the requirements is managed by Air Force Research Lab (AFRL)/Analytical Systems Branch (RIED).  

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.

This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because the program develops and inserts new technologies into existing systems and models in order to keep existing systems current and affordable while ensuring system integration, interoperability, and utility.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) Program will develop and field an affordable, highly common family of next generation strike aircraft for the United States Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps and allies. The three variants are the F-35A Conventional Takeoff and Landing (CTOL); F-35B Short Takeoff and Vertical Landing (STOVL); and the F-35C Aircraft Carrier suitable Variant (CV). The CTOL will be a stealthy multi-role aircraft, primary air-to-ground for the Air Force to replace the F-16 and A-10 and complement the F-22. The STOVL variant will be a multi-role strike fighter aircraft to replace the AV-8B and F/A-18A/C/D for the Marine Corps, replace the Sea Harrier and GR 7 for the United Kingdom, and replace the AV-8 currently employed by the Italian Navy. The CV will provide the DoN a multi-role, stealthy strike fighter aircraft to complement the F/A-18E/F. 

The United Kingdom, other International Partner nations, and Foreign Military Sales customers are also participants in the JSF program.  The program shown here reflects USN, USMC, USAF, and International Partner funding.

Funding at the accomplishment/planned program level is reported as the total of all services and partners as these activities support all aircraft variants.  

The SDD budget funds a total quantity of 20 RDT&amp;E test articles to include 6 ground test articles and 14 flight test articles for Navy and Air Force use.

FY07:  1 CTOL flight test article 
FY08:  1 STOVL flight test article; 1 STOVL ground test article 
FY09:  1 STOVL flight test article; 2 CTOL ground test articles 
FY10:  6 flight test articles: 3 CTOL, 2 STOVL, 1 CV; 3 ground test articles: 1 STOVL, 2 CV
FY11:  4 flight test articles: 1 CTOL, 1 STOVL, 2 CV
FY13:  1 CV flight test article

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The F-35 JSF Program will develop and field an affordable, highly common family of next generation strike aircraft for the United States Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps and allies. The three variants are the F-35A Conventional Takeoff and Landing (CTOL); F-35B Short Takeoff and Vertical Landing (STOVL); and the F-35C Aircraft Carrier suitable Variant (CV). The CTOL will be a stealthy multi-role aircraft, primary air-to-ground for the Air Force to replace the F-16 and A-10 and complement the F-22. The STOVL variant will be a multi-role strike fighter aircraft to replace the AV-8B and F/A-18A/C/D for the Marine Corps, replace the Sea Harrier and GR 7 for the United Kingdom, and replace the AV-8 currently employed by the Italian Navy. The CV will provide the DoN a multi-role, stealthy strike fighter aircraft to complement the F/A-18E/F. 

The United Kingdom, other International Partner nations, and Foreign Military Sales customers are also participants in the JSF program.  The program shown here reflects USN, USMC, USAF, and International Partner funding.

The top-line Program element reflects the unique variant for each Service. Funding at the accomplishment/planned program level is reported as the total of all services and partners as these activities support all aircraft variants.

The SDD budget funds a total quantity of 20 RDT&amp;E test articles to include 6 ground test articles and 14 flight test articles for USN and USAF use.

FY07:  1 CTOL flight test article 
FY08:  1 STOVL flight test article; 1 STOVL ground test article 
FY09:  1 STOVL flight test article; 2 CTOL ground test articles 
FY10:  6 flight test articles: 3 CTOL, 2 STOVL, 1 CV; 3 ground test articles: 1 STOVL, 2 CV
FY11:  4 flight test articles: 1 CTOL, 1 STOVL, 2 CV
FY13:  1 CV flight test article

Note:  The USAF/USN/USMC PROCUREMENT line include Aircraft Procurement and Advanced Procurement only.  Initial Spares and Repair Parts for all Services are reflected in separate lines.  International Partner Funding includes funds provided under the Italy and Netherlands Bilateral agreements.  

RELATED RDT&amp;E:  Funding prior to JSF SDD (FY94-FY01):  USN PE 0603800N $1,950,617; USAF PE 0603800F $1,907,352; DARPA PE 0603800E $118,056; and International Partner contributions of $253.921 for a total of $4,229,896.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The SDD program consists of a cost-reimbursement contract awarded to Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company to develop the F-35 Air System, consisting of three aircraft variants and its associated logistics support system, for the U.S. Services and international participants.  Similarly, a cost-reimbursement contract was awarded to Pratt &amp; Whitney to develop the F135 propulsion system.  Ground and flight testing will be conducted during development to accomplish validation and verification, with the extensive use of modeling and simulation to offset the risk of this large, complex, and concurrent lifecycle program.  A comprehensive logistics support environment, including an integrated training system for aircrew, maintenance, and support personnel, is also being developed.

On 25 April 2011, the Department of Defense terminated the development of the General Electric Rolls-Royce Fighter Engine Team F136 propulsion system.  

The F-35 Program has made international involvement a key element of the acquisition strategy.  This includes international partnership in the development, production, and sustainment phases of the lifecycle.  Additional international participation includes Foreign Military Sales arrangements.

In Fiscal Year (FY) 2007, separate cost-type contracts were awarded to Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company and Pratt &amp; Whitney to begin low rate initial production for F-35 air vehicles, propulsion systems, and sustainment for the fielded systems.  Transition to fixed-price-type contracts occurred with the fourth low rate lot.  To provide logistics support for delivered aircraft, Performance-Based Logistics cost-type contracts will be awarded to Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company and Pratt &amp; Whitney.

At the completion of Low Rate Initial Production, a Defense Acquisition Board review, and Milestone Decision Authority approval, the F-35 Program will enter Full Rate Production.  Fixed-price procurement contracts will be awarded for F-35 air vehicles and propulsion systems for the U.S. Services and international participants.  Multiyear procurement authority for the F-35 Air System will be requested for Full Rate Production.  Concurrently, multiple-year, fixed-price-type Performance Based Logistics contracts for sustainment will be executed to support multi-Service and multi-national requirements.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Funds enhancements to the deployability and suitability of the air system such as low observable (LO) maintenance enhancements, security architecture updates,redesign of obsolete items and integrated training simulators.  These enhancements will provide vital on-demand support to the war-fighter within a deployed environment and are not funded via the existing SDD program or tied to Block 4 Operational Fight Program (OFP) development. Funding will result in achieving targeted suitability, maintainability, and affordability returns employing the F-35 in deployed or austere locations. 

-Funding at the accomplishment/planned program level is reported as the total of all services as these activities support all aircraft variants.  The annual funding contribution between the USN and USMC is approximately equal.
 
BA5 - This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY 2015, Project 655037, Support Equipment, efforts were transferred to PE 0101213F, Minuteman Squadrons, Project 672985, MM Support Equip, and Project 672984, MM III Baseline Support in order to consolidate ICBM investment activities under a common PE. 

In FY 2015, Project 655081, ICBM Crypto, efforts were transferred to PE 0101213F, Minuteman Squadrons, Project 672986, MM Crypto Mods in order to consolidate ICBM investment activities under a common PE.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) efforts will ensure the extension of the operational life of the Minuteman III ICBM weapon system through 2030.  

The Support Equipment program designs, develops, and tests replacement of obsolete/non-serviceable weapon system support and flight test equipment.  The efforts include design, development, and testing of support equipment such as Electrical-Electronic Equipment Test Sets (EEETS), Reentry Field Support Equipment (RFSE), Code System Media (CSM), Payload Transporter Replacement (PTR), Higher Authority Command/Rapid Message Processing Element (HAC/RMPE) Message Generator, Strategic Targeting Application Computer System (STACS), and Transporter Erector Replacement Program (TERP).  In FY15, efforts listed above in PE 0604851F, Intercontinental Ballistic Missile - EMD, Project 655037, Support Equipment will be included in PE 0101213F, Minuteman Squadrons, Project 672985, MM Support Equip.  Also in FY15, PTR funding was eliminated pending revalidation of the requirement through an ICBM Transportation Security Study due July 2014.  PTR development will continue in FY14.  

Efforts also include the design, development, and testing of replacement flight test equipment necessary to conduct Force Development Evaluations (FDEs) and ICBM Fuze Modernization flight tests such as the Instrumentation Wafer Replacement Program (IWRP) and the Signal Conditioner Monitor (SCM) replacement program.  FDEs are required by USSTRATCOM and the Department of Energy to determine continuing reliability and effectiveness of the ICBM weapon system.  Beginning in FY 2015, IWRP and SCM efforts previously included in PE 0604851F, Intercontinental Ballistic Missile - EMD, Project 655037, Support Equipment will be included in PE 0101213F, Minuteman Squadrons, Project 672984, MM III Baseline Support as one combined program, the MM III Instrumentation Wafer Replacement Program (MMIWRP).  

Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) Cryptography Upgrade Increment II (ICU II) executes USSTRATCOM, Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC), and Nuclear Weapon Safety Center (NWSC) requirements by implementing the KS-60 capabilities of remote key/code change and irreversible transformation as mandated in the approved Capabilities Development Document (CDD) dated 4 January 2005 and addresses Nuclear Weapon System Safety Group Operational Safety Review (NWSSG OSR) requirements 98-2, 00-1 and 02-2.  It also incorporates continuous signal lockout capabilities to prevent the widespread loss of status monitoring.  These features will greatly increase security during code changes by reducing the frequency of open sites 75 days annually and will reduce associated resource costs for 450 launch facilities (LF) and 45 launch control centers (LCC).  In FY 2015, ICU II effort previously included in PE 0604851, Intercontinental Ballistic Missile - EMD, Project 655081, ICBM Crypto will be included in PE 0101213F, Minuteman Squadrons, Project 672986, MM Crypto Mods.

The Operational Equipment program designs, develops, and tests replacement of weapon system equipment.  The effort includes the Solid Rocket Motor (SRM) Modernization effort to define operational requirements, investigate available technologies and prepare an acquisition strategy for SRM development.  This effort, coupled with the Propulsion Application Program under PE 0603851F, ICBM Demonstration/Validation, will support development of requirements and implementation timeline for a follow-on SRM program.  In FY 2015, new efforts related to the Operational Equipment will start under PE 0101213F, Minuteman Squadrons, Project 672987, MM Ops Equip.

This program is Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Segment #1, responsible for providing software to accept National Security Agency (NSA) codes, Operations Plan (OPLAN) changes and software updates on compact disk (CD), has been completed.  Segment #2 will provide software and hardware necessary to import all other data on CD and produce Wing Codes Processing System products on CD.  Segment #2 will also replace the Cartridge Transfer Unit (CTU) with the Data Transfer Unit (DTU).  CSM effectively supports the replacement of aging media required to transport and handle mission essential codes and data throughout the ICBM weapon system.  The shelf life of the current stock of DC300 tape cartridges and 9-track tapes expires in 2015.  CSM delivers the capability to load codes/software on Minuteman III ICBMs through 2030 and is critical to code change activities.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) Cryptography Upgrade Increment II (ICU II) executes USSTRATCOM, Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC), and Nuclear Weapon Safety Center (NWSC) requirements by implementing the KS-60 capabilities of remote key/code change and irreversible transformation as mandated in the approved Capabilities Development Document (CDD) dated 4 January 2005 and addresses Nuclear Weapon System Safety Group Operational Safety Review (NWSSG OSR) requirements 98-2, 00-1 and 02-2.  It also incorporates continuous signal lockout capabilities to prevent the widespread loss of status monitoring.  These features will greatly increase security during code changes by reducing the frequency of open sites 75 days annually and will reduce associated resource costs for 450 launch facilities (LF) and 45 launch control centers (LCC).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>SRM Modernization will conduct pre-acquisition efforts in conjunction with ongoing ICBM Demonstration/Validation Propulsion Application Program efforts maturing SRM technologies.  As these efforts are conducted and results from SRM aging and surveillance activities and Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) Analysis of Alternatives become available, a follow-on SRM Modernization strategy will be established.

FY13 SRM Modernization funding will be disbursed using two contract vehicles. The first contract will utilize Hill AFB's Design Engineering Support Program (DESP III).  This will be a competitive source selection, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ), Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contract.  The second effort will use the existing Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) GSA contract which is a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>In FY 2014, 650004, Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle, was completed.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) is a Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP) Acquisition Category (ACAT) 1D program that procures launch services to deliver National Security Space (NSS) space vehicles (SVs) on orbit. 

The program is completing research and developmental items including new entrant certification and studies, current RL10 and common upper stage development and integration; secondary payload adaptor standard service, and special studies (to include but not limited to upper stage manufacturability, alternative manufacturing process, and affordable upper stage engine studies, and other related support activities).

This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Long Range Stand Off (LRSO) effort will develop a weapon system to replace the Air Force's Air Launched Cruise Missile (ALCM), operational since 1986.  The LRSO weapon system will be capable of penetrating and surviving advanced Integrated Air Defense Systems (IADS) from significant stand off range to prosecute strategic targets in support of the Air Force's global attack capability and strategic deterrence core function. LRSO FY14 and FY15 funding supports program office standup, Milestone A activities, preparation for the Request For Proposal (RFP) release, and source selection activities. 

This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD), because it is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Long Range Stand Off (LRSO) effort will develop a weapon system to replace the Air Force's Air Launched Cruise Missile (ALCM), operational since 1986.  The LRSO weapon system will be capable of penetrating and surviving advanced Integrated Air Defense Systems (IADS) from significant stand off range to prosecute strategic targets in support of the Air Force's global attack capability and strategic deterrence core function. LRSO FY14 and FY15 funding supports program office standup, Milestone A activities, preparation for the Request For Proposal (RFP) release, and source selection activities. 

This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD), because it is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY 2013, Project 655082, ICBM Fuze Support efforts were transferred from PE 0604851F, Intercontinental Ballistic Missile - EMD, Project 657006, ICBM EMD: Fuze Support, in order to distinguish the effort as a pre-ACAT I program.

Prior Years funding includes $9.740M from PE 0604222F in FY11 and $42.114M from PE 0604851F in FY12.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The ICBM Fuze program replaces the Mk21 (W87) fuze.  The Mk21 replacement project scope includes the design and development of a form, fit, function replacement fuze associated with the legacy W87 warhead.  The legacy Mk21 fuze is three times past its design life and ongoing Mk21 refurbishment does not meet Nuclear Weapon Stockpile Plan requirements.

The United States Air Force (USAF) will develop the Mk21 fuze in cooperation with the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), US Navy (USN) and United Kingdom.  The ICBM Fuze program will leverage technologies, parts, components and development/production capabilities resulting from extensive fuze work performed by the USN and NNSA.  The ICBM Fuze program will also develop associated Minuteman III weapon system modifications, support equipment, data, flight test hardware, and training.  It will also conduct required system testing (including ground and flight tests) and fielding efforts.  The program coordinates USAF Mk21 Fuze replacement development efforts to synchronize USAF arming and fuzing and Department of Energy (DOE) warhead requirements.  When prudent, the ICBM Fuze Modernization program will conduct trade studies and initiate conceptual designs to address operational system issues and meet future requirements.  

As a cooperative USAF, USN and NNSA weapon sustainment acquisition, the USAF will implement joint Department of Defense (DoD)-DOE Nuclear Weapons Life Cycle Activities. The ICBM Fuze Modernization program will be tailored to use joint DoD-DOE phase 6.X processes for routine nuclear stockpile activities to align with USN and NNSA operations.  

In FY15, the ICBM Fuze Modernization program was rebaselined due to fiscal constraints. The Mk21 (W87) Fuze Replacement design and development efforts were extended to shift the First Production Unit (FPU) delivery from FY19 to FY22.  In addition, previous plans to integrate and test the Mk21 fuze replacement with the NNSA W78/88-1 Life Extension Program (LEP) warhead have been deferred beyond the Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP).

This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B equivalent approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                    <r2:SummaryExplanation>FY 2013 funding reflects a decrease of $0.098M due to Congressional reductions, $2.005M due to SBIR transfer, and a decrease of $6.039M due to sequestration.

FY 2014 funding reflects a decrease of $11.000M due to Congressional reductions.

FY 2015 funding reflects a decrease of $155.010 due to program restructure delaying Mk21 replacement fuze FPU to FY22 consistent with related NNSA and USN efforts, and deferring the NNSA W78/88-1 LEP warhead beyond the FYDP.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The ICBM Fuze program replaces the Mk21 (W87) fuze.  The Mk21 replacement project scope includes the design and development of a form, fit, function replacement fuze associated with the legacy W87 warhead.  The legacy Mk21 fuze is three times past its design life and ongoing Mk21 refurbishment does not meet Nuclear Weapon Stockpile Plan requirements.

The United States Air Force (USAF) will develop the Mk21 fuze in cooperation with the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), US Navy (USN) and United Kingdom.  The ICBM Fuze program will leverage technologies, parts, components and development/production capabilities resulting from extensive fuze work performed by the USN and NNSA.  The ICBM Fuze program will also develop associated Minuteman III weapon system modifications, support equipment, data, flight test hardware, and training.  It will also conduct required system testing (including ground and flight tests) and fielding efforts.  The program coordinates USAF Mk21 Fuze replacement development efforts to synchronize USAF arming and fuzing and Department of Energy (DOE) warhead requirements.  When prudent, the ICBM Fuze Modernization program will conduct trade studies and initiate conceptual designs to address operational system issues and meet future requirements.  

As a cooperative USAF, USN and NNSA weapon sustainment acquisition, the USAF will implement joint Department of Defense (DoD)-DOE Nuclear Weapons Life Cycle Activities. The ICBM Fuze Modernization program will be tailored to use joint DoD-DOE phase 6.X processes for routine nuclear stockpile activities to align with USN and NNSA operations.  

In FY15, the ICBM Fuze Modernization program was rebaselined due to fiscal constraints. The Mk21 (W87) Fuze Replacement design and development efforts were extended to shift the First Production Unit (FPU) delivery from FY19 to FY22.  In addition, previous plans to integrate and test the Mk21 fuze replacement with the NNSA W78/88-1 Life Extension Program (LEP) warhead have been deferred beyond the Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP).

This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B equivalent approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Mk21 fuze will be modernized in a collaborative effort with the US Navy Mk5 fuze reducing total program cost and development time by leveraging potential compatibility and commonality of ICBM and Submarine Launched Ballistic Missile warheads and fuze components. The US Navy Mk5 fuze will be developed first, followed by Mk21. The US Navy Mk5 fuze entered Phase 6.3 Development Engineering in Aug 2012. USAF Mk21 fuze entered Phase 6.3 in Aug 2013. Both Services participate in all design and development efforts to ensure use of adaptable components, subassemblies and technology. Both services will use NNSA/SNL to perform fuze design and development. The USAF will separately compete and contract for MM III unique missile modification and fuze integration efforts utilizing a combination of the Integration Support Contract (ISC) for SETA and the Reentry System/Reentry Vehicle Integration Contract for weapons system integration.  Both services will use Kansas City Production Plant (KCPP) to perform production and sustainment.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY2015, Project 655068, Joint Tactical Radio System, efforts were transferred from PE 0604280F Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS), Project 655068, Joint Tactical Radio System, to in order to improve transparency of ACAT 1 Acquisition programs.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Funding prior to FY15 was located in PE 0604280F. The JTRS development program is a joint program managed through the Navy's PEO for Joint Tactical Networks (PEO JTN).  The JTN was formed upon the descoping of the Joint Tactical Radio System development program (PE 0604280F).  JTN will provide interoperable, secure Joint Tactical Networking applications capable of operating in a variety of radio solutions to maintain and sustain an affordable, government-controlled open architecture, in support of Combatant Commanders', Services' and Coalition mission network requirements.  JTN is responsible for the continuous development, delivery, and maintenance of networking waveforms and modified legacy radio waveforms that are Software Communications Architecture (SCA) compliant. SCA compliant waveforms enable interoperability and support Net-Centric operational warfare at sea, in the air and on the ground.  Networking waveforms extend the Global Information Grid (GIG) to the first tactical mile and to the warfighter. 

The JTN team is responsible for (1) the overall management and oversight of the Waveforms contained in the JTN repository; (2) development, validation, and evolution of a common JTN SCA; (3) development and evolution of waveform software applications for tactical radios; (4) development of software cryptographic algorithms and equipment applications (Information Assurance); (5) development and evolution of the JTN networking and network management software components, Joint Enterprise Network Manager (JENM); (6) testing and certification of JTN waveforms, network services, and network management; and, (7) full lifecycle support of waveforms and networking applications in order to maintain a robust industry base of radio vendors.

The individual services provide 1/3 each of funding to support activities of the JTN. 

This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD), currently it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                    <r2:SummaryExplanation>The JTRS development program is a joint program managed through the JTRS JPEO. Each of the joint services, including the Air Force, transfers its funding to the Navy's budget under Joint Tactical Radio System Program (PE 0604280N, BA 5). This annual transfer of funds to the Navy PE is the cause of the seemingly drastic change from current to future fiscal years. The reduction in funding in RDT&amp;E prediction is based upon the anticipated maturation of program development.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>In FY2015, Project 655068, Joint Tactical Radio System, efforts were transferred from PE 0604280F Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS), Project 655068, Joint Tactical Radio System, to in order to improve transparency of ACAT 1 Acquisition programs.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Funding prior to FY15 was located in PE 0604280F. The JTRS development program is a joint program managed through the Navy's PEO for Joint Tactical Networks (PEO JTN).  The JTN was formed upon the descoping of the Joint Tactical Radio System development program (PE 0604280F).  JTN will provide interoperable, secure Joint Tactical Networking applications capable of operating in a variety of radio solutions to maintain and sustain an affordable, government-controlled open architecture, in support of Combatant Commanders', Services' and Coalition mission network requirements.  JTN is responsible for the continuous development, delivery, and maintenance of networking waveforms and modified legacy radio waveforms that are Software Communications Architecture (SCA) compliant. SCA compliant waveforms enable interoperability and support Net-Centric operational warfare at sea, in the air and on the ground.  Networking waveforms extend the Global Information Grid (GIG) to the first tactical mile and to the warfighter. 

The JTN team is responsible for (1) the overall management and oversight of the Waveforms contained in the JTN repository; (2) development, validation, and evolution of a common JTN SCA; (3) development and evolution of waveform software applications for tactical radios; (4) development of software cryptographic algorithms and equipment applications (Information Assurance); (5) development and evolution of the JTN networking and network management software components, Joint Enterprise Network Manager (JENM); (6) testing and certification of JTN waveforms, network services, and network management; and, (7) full lifecycle support of waveforms and networking applications in order to maintain a robust industry base of radio vendors.

The individual services provide 1/3 each of funding to support activities of the JTN. 

This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD), currently it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

In FY13, a separate Program Element was created, per direction of DoD, for Increment 3.2B in support of milestone B.  All Increment 3.2B efforts and associated funding prior to FY13 continue to be included in this F-22 baseline documentation.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Increment 3.2B will integrate the newest air-to-air intercept missiles (i.e., AIM-9X and AIM-120D), further improve the Electronic Protection (EP) capability over Increment 3.2A, and enhance the F-22s geolocation capability from the Increment 3.1 baseline with the addition of the Geolocation 2 candidate. Increment 3.2B will include the Enhanced Stores Management System (ESMS), as well as, Common Weapon Engagement Zone (Common WEZ), an Intra-Flight Datalink (IFDL) improvement to increase IFDL bandwidth and enable cooperative functions required to realize Increment 3.2B candidates.

In addition to the aforementioned hardware modifications and integration requirements, Increment 3.2B will develop, certify and integrate a new platform operational flight program to ensure the system interoperability and performance of all increment-level developments.

The development program includes development, studies, and analysis to enhance the air vehicle and training system to improve/enhance F-22 weapons, communications, Electronic Warfare, and Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities.

BA5 - This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

In FY13, a separate Program Element (0605213F) was created for Increment 3.2B FY13 milestone B and beyond efforts, to provide Congress and Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD) greater technical and funding visibility into the program.  All increment 3.2B efforts and associated funding prior to FY13 are included in the F-22A Squadrons (0207138F) budget documentation.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Increment 3.2B will integrate the newest air-to-air intercept missiles (i.e., AIM-9X and AIM-120D), further improve the Electronic Protection (EP) capability over Increment 3.2A, and enhance the F-22s geolocation capability from the Increment 3.1 baseline with the addition of the Geolocation 2 candidate. Increment 3.2B will include the Enhanced Stores Management System (ESMS), as well as, Common Weapon Engagement Zone (Common WEZ), an Intra-Flight Datalink (IFDL) improvement to increase IFDL bandwidth and enable cooperative functions required to realize Increment 3.2B candidates.

In addition to the aforementioned hardware modifications and integration requirements, Increment 3.2B will develop, certify and integrate a new platform operational flight program to ensure the system interoperability and performance of all increment-level developments.

The development program includes development, studies, and analysis to enhance the air vehicle and training system to improve/enhance F-22 weapons, communications, Electronic Warfare, and Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities.

BA5 - This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Raptor Enhancement Development &amp; Integration (REDI) contract is an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity Ordering contract that maximizes flexibility to start, stop, accelerate and decelerate projects as required. The REDI contract was established to be more responsive to evolving war fighter requirements. The REDI contract allows the issuance of orders for the highest priority war fighter capabilities in operationally meaningful capability increments, requirements analysis, contractor cost estimates and studies, development and demonstration of capability enhancements, and unanticipated future war fighter requirements. Each increment is broken into phases to initiate requirements analysis, the design phase and the development, integration and verification phase of a specific incremental development effort.  The REDI II contract is a follow-on Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract to the initial REDI contract.  REDI II provides maximum flexibility to manage various modernization projects.  The REDI II contract allows for the issuance of orders for efforts associated with the planning, analysis, design, development, qualification, test and documentation of F-22 weapon system performance enhancements, life-cycle improvements, Operational Flight Program (OFP) upgrades, and associated efforts essential to accomplishing the F-22 mission.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY 2015, 655313, Hard Target Void Sensing Fuze, efforts were transferred from PE 0604635F, Ground Attack Weapons Fuze Development, 645312, Hard Target Void Sensing Fuze, in order to properly align the funds in the correct Budget Activity, BA05, which supports Engineering, Manufacturing, and Development (EMD).</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program was created to include the whole spectrum of general purpose and specialized fuze development, resulting in commodity fuzes for use with air-to-ground weapons.
  
The Hard Target Void Sensing Fuze (HTVSF) is an advanced system designed to provide fuzing and void sensing functions for legacy penetrator weapons to destroy hardened targets protected by multiple layers of soil and/or reinforced concrete.  The HTVSF will also provide in-flight cockpit programmability, safing and arming, multi-function (time delay and void sensing) and multi-delay arming.  Program Element funding currently supports the Engineering, Manufacturing, and Development (EMD) effort for HTVSF.

This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full rate production.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Replacement of the legacy KC-135 fleet will take place in three stages, known as the KC-X (now the KC-46), KC-Y, and the KC-Z.  The initial KC-46 increment will replace roughly a third of the current capability with the purchase of 179 aircraft.  The Air Force completed an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) in Apr 2006 to determine the most appropriate strategy to recapitalize the aging fleet of KC-135 aerial refueling aircraft.  Based on this analysis, the Air Force concluded that a strategy of full and open competition to select a commercial derivative replacement tanker aircraft would result in a best value tanker contract.  To initiate the first phase of the KC-135 replacement, the KC-46 program released a final Request for Proposal (RFP) on 24 Feb 2010, and entered source selection on 9 Jul 2010.  The KC-46 program held a Milestone B Defense Acquisition Board (DAB) on 23 Feb 2011, received approval to enter Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) from OUSD(AT&amp;L) on 24 Feb 2011, and awarded the KC-46 EMD contract to Boeing on 24 Feb 2011 to develop and procure 179 KC-46 aircraft.  

The KC-46 will provide the capability to fuel joint and coalition receivers via a boom or drogue system on every mission and will also augment the airlift fleet with cargo, passenger and aeromedical evacuation capabilities.  The KC-46 will be able to operate in day/night and adverse weather conditions to enable deployment, employment, sustainment and redeployment of U.S. joint, allied, and coalition forces.  The KC-46 will have communication, navigation and surveillance equipment for world-wide operations; will have the capability to perform missions in chemical and biological environments; will have the ability to operate in up to medium threat environments with self-defense/protection (both active and passive) capabilities; and will have necessary battle space awareness to mitigate survivability threats.

The KC-46 development effort will also procure the necessary ground and flight test assets to support development/operational test.  The program plans to procure four RDT&amp;E aircraft for integration and demonstration of capability that will ultimately be operationally fielded after a successful operational test phase.  In addition, aircrew and maintenance training systems will be developed and procured using KC-46 funding.  The Aircrew Training System (ATS) entered source selection on 31 May 2012 and a contract was awarded on 1 May 2013 to FlightSafety Services Corp.  The ATS contract will provide aircrew training devices, to include Weapon System Trainers (WST), Boom Operator Trainers (BOT), Fuselage Trainers (FuT) and Part-Task Trainers (PTT) at each Main Operating Base (MOB) and the Formal Training Unit (FTU).  The aircrew training system will also support Distributed Mission Operations (DMO), provide aircrew instruction, develop courseware, provide logistics support, acquire Technical Data Packages (TDP) to support future competition efforts, and manage training device concurrency with the aircraft.  The Maintenance Training System (MTS) is scheduled to enter source selection in FY 2014.  Initial training and sustainment efforts will be provided via Interim Contractor Support (ICS).  KC-46 funding will also support a follow-on sustainment planning Business Case Analysis (BCA), various studies/analyses and KC-Y/KC-Z planning activities.

This program is in Budget Activity 05, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Replacement of the legacy KC-135 fleet will take place in three stages, known as the KC-X (now the KC-46), KC-Y, and the KC-Z.  The initial KC-46 increment will replace roughly a third of the current capability with the purchase of 179 aircraft.  The Air Force completed an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) in Apr 2006 to determine the most appropriate strategy to recapitalize the aging fleet of KC-135 aerial refueling aircraft.  Based on this analysis, the Air Force concluded that a strategy of full and open competition to select a commercial derivative replacement tanker aircraft would result in a best value tanker contract.  To initiate the first phase of the KC-135 replacement, the KC-46 program released a final Request for Proposal (RFP) on 24 Feb 2010, and entered source selection on 9 Jul 2010.  The KC-46 program held a Milestone B Defense Acquisition Board (DAB) on 23 Feb 2011, received approval to enter Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) from OUSD(AT&amp;L) on 24 Feb 2011, and awarded the KC-46 EMD contract to Boeing on 24 Feb 2011 to develop and procure 179 KC-46 aircraft.  

The KC-46 will provide the capability to fuel joint and coalition receivers via a boom or drogue system on every mission and will also augment the airlift fleet with cargo, passenger and aeromedical evacuation capabilities.  The KC-46 will be able to operate in day/night and adverse weather conditions to enable deployment, employment, sustainment and redeployment of U.S. joint, allied, and coalition forces.  The KC-46 will have communication, navigation and surveillance equipment for world-wide operations; will have the capability to perform missions in chemical and biological environments; will have the ability to operate in up to medium threat environments with self-defense/protection (both active and passive) capabilities; and will have necessary battle space awareness to mitigate survivability threats.

The KC-46 development effort will also procure the necessary ground and flight test assets to support development/operational test.  The program plans to procure four RDT&amp;E aircraft for integration and demonstration of capability that will ultimately be operationally fielded after a successful operational test phase.  In addition, aircrew and maintenance training systems will be developed and procured using KC-46 funding.  The Aircrew Training System (ATS) entered source selection on 31 May 2012 and a contract was awarded on 1 May 2013 to FlightSafety Services Corp.  The ATS contract will provide aircrew training devices, to include Weapon System Trainers (WST), Boom Operator Trainers (BOT), Fuselage Trainers (FuT) and Part-Task Trainers (PTT) at each Main Operating Base (MOB) and the Formal Training Unit (FTU).  The aircrew training system will also support Distributed Mission Operations (DMO), provide aircrew instruction, develop courseware, provide logistics support, acquire Technical Data Packages (TDP) to support future competition efforts, and manage training device concurrency with the aircraft.  The Maintenance Training System (MTS) is scheduled to enter source selection in FY 2014.  Initial training and sustainment efforts will be provided via Interim Contractor Support (ICS).  KC-46 funding will also support a follow-on sustainment planning Business Case Analysis (BCA), various studies/analyses and KC-Y/KC-Z planning activities.

This program is in Budget Activity 05, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The KC-46 program acquisition strategy is to procure an existing commercial, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certified aircraft modified to meet USAF requirements.  The KC-46 program released a final Request for Proposal (RFP) on 24 Feb 2010, and entered source selection on 9 Jul 2010.  The KC-46 program held a Milestone B Defense Acquisition Board (DAB) on 23 Feb 2011, received approval to enter Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) from OUSD(AT&amp;L) on 24 Feb 2011, and awarded the KC-46 contract to Boeing on 24 Feb 2011 to develop and procure 179 KC-46 aircraft.  The KC-46 contract procurement was conducted via a full and open competition per Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15, and resulted in a FY 2011 EMD Fixed Price Incentive Firm (FPIF) contract.  The EMD phase will develop, build, and test four KC-46 aircraft, and will qualify receiver aircraft.  

Production will begin in FY 2015 with the first of two Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP) lots (Firm Fixed Priced (FFP)) and then Full-Rate Production (FRP) options (FFP with Not to Exceed (NTE) + Economic Price Adjustment (EPA)).  The LRIP and FRP options will be exercised following a successful Milestone C decision for the LRIP decision, and a successful completion of Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) for the FRP decision.  

The Aircrew Training System (ATS) acquisition strategy is to provide aircrew training devices and associated support structure to each Main Operating Base (MOB) and the Formal Training Unit (FTU).  The ATS entered source selection on 31 May 2012 and a contract was awarded on 1 May 2013 to FlightSafety Services Corp.  The ATS contract procurement was conducted via a full and open competition per Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15, and resulted in a FY 2013 EMD FPIF contract.  The EMD phase will develop and procure aircrew training devices delivered to the MOB #1 and the FTU.  All supported with courseware, Training System Support Center, technical data package and support equipment to ensure system availability and concurrency with the aircraft.  Production devices will commence in FY 2015 as FFP options. The government plans to compete the development, deployment, and sustainment of a Maintenance Training System separately.  

Based on the market research and a cost effectiveness analysis, the engines will be procured as contractor furnished equipment (CFE) for EMD.  Following EMD, the government will assess the potential of breaking out the engines as a separate procurement based on an updated market analysis.  

The KC-46 program is responsible for the development, testing, and production of a drogue-equipped, wing-mounted refueling system to meet Capability Development Document (CDD) thresholds and objectives, for simultaneous refueling of two probe-equipped receivers.  The system can be installed or removed from the KC-46 as mission needs dictate.
  
The long-term support concept for the KC-46 is organic two-level maintenance (2LM):  organization level (O-level) and depot level (D-level).  For the purposes of this program, all maintenance other than O-level shall be referred to as D-level.  The product support strategy will initially employ Interim Contractor Support before transitioning to a 100% organically managed mantenance and supply support capability.  Performance Based Logistics (PBL) solutions will be evaluated during EMD as viable approaches to facilitate the transition.  

This acquisition strategy requires sufficient aircraft to be designed, tested, and delivered to meet a Required Assets Available (RAA) date of 78 months after contract award.  RAA is defined as 18 aircraft meeting final production configuration with all required training and support in place.  Initial Operational Capability (IOC) will be attained when the Commander, Air Mobility Command (AMC/CC) determines the unit is operationally war ready. AMC has not yet determined an IOC date.  Full Operational Capability (FOC) is expected approximately 24 months after IOC.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                    <r2:Remarks>The KC-46 EMD contract was awarded 24 Feb 2011.  The contract ceiling price of $4.9B is the government's maximum financial liability on the prime contract.  The "Total Cost" value represents the Milestone B Service Cost Position (SCP), which accounts for the ceiling price of the contract plus the financial risk of potential design changes for the KC-46 Aircraft. 

The MTS contract award is the estimated date.</r2:Remarks>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY2015, Project 655340, Advanced Trainer Replacement T-X, efforts were transferred from Program 0604233F, Specialized Undergraduate Flight Training, Project 655340, Advanced Trainer Replacement T-X, in order to improve transparency of ACAT I acquisition programs.

In FY2017, Project 655361, Stores-Aircraft Interface, includes a new start effort.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Advanced Trainer Replacement, T-X, will replace Air Education and Training Command's (AETC) T-38C aircraft and associated Ground Based Training System (GBTS) currently used in the fighter/bomber advanced Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training (SUPT) track as well as in the Introduction to Fighter Fundamentals (IFF) program. The T-38C was first introduced in 1961 and now average 45 years.   T-X will close training gaps which the T-38 cannot fully address and have grown with the introduction of the 4th and 5th generation fighter aircraft. 
 
The Stores-Aircraft Interface project provides funding for the Companion Trainer Aircraft which is intended to develop a variant of the Advanced Pilot Training (APT) T-X aircraft to serve as a "Red Air" adversary or aggressor capability for 5th generation fighter aircraft.  A version of the T-X equipped with radar/data-link and hard-points for weapons and jammer carriage is envisioned for this role.  

This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because Milestone B approval is anticipated to conduct engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Companion Trainer is intended to develop a variant of the Advanced Pilot Training (APT) T-X aircraft to provide a "Red Air" adversary or aggressor capability for 5th generation fighter aircraft.  An Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) endorsed report estimates considerable savings over the life of the F-35 through use of Companion Trainer due to significantly lower operating costs.  The T-X variant will be equipped with radar/data-link and hard-points for weapons and jammer carriage is envisioned for this role.  Missionization of the T-X to meet Companion Trainer requirements is expected to begin in FY2017.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Combat Rescue Helicopter (CRH) program, formerly referred to as HH-60 Recapitalization, will replace the aging HH-60G. The HH-60G currently supports the Air Force's core function of Personnel Recovery.  The primary mission of the HH-60G is to conduct day / night / marginal weather Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) in order to recover downed aircrew or other isolated personnel in hostile or permissive environments.  Other mission areas include casualty evacuation (CASEVAC), medical evacuation (MEDEVAC), non-combatant evacuation operations, civil search and rescue, international aid, disaster humanitarian relief, and insertion/extraction of combat forces.

Funding Justification: The FY15 President's Budget shows this program having $0 in FY15. Based on the SECAF's decision to continue with the CRH program, the Air Force is committed to fully fund the program to the Air Force SCP in the FY16 Budget.  This commitment is dependent upon the Air Force's top line in the FY16 Budget being consistent with the out year funding levels identified in the FY15 President's Budget, which is in excess of the Budget Control Act funding levels.


This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY2015, Project 657104, Evolved AEHF MILSATCOM, includes one new start effort.

In FY2014, Project 657103, Advanced MILSATCOM, and Project 657104, Evolved AEHF MILSATCOM, efforts transferred from PE 0603430F, Advanced EHF MILSATCOM (Space), Project 644050, Advanced MILSATCOM, and Project 64A030, Evolved AEHF MILSATCOM, in order to transition to Budget Activity 5.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Develop and acquire Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM) satellites, mission control segment and cryptography for survivable, anti-jam, worldwide, secure communications for the strategic and tactical warfighters.  AEHF satellites will replenish the existing EHF system (Milstar) providing much higher capacity and data rate (5x increase over Milstar II) capabilities.  AEHF is a cooperative program that includes International Partners (Canada, the United Kingdom, and the Kingdom of the Netherlands).    

Space Vehicle-1 (SV-1) launched on 14 August 2010.  SV-1 experienced a propulsion anomaly and was raised to its geostationary orbit using alternative orbit raising techniques.  SV-1 completed on-orbit test and transitioned to operations in March 2012.  SV-2 launched on 4 May 2012, successfully completed on-orbit testing in October 2012, and is under operational control as of 7 Nov 2012.    
  
With SV-1 and SV-2 launched, the AEHF program has nearly completed its development phase and is now addressing obsolescence, production continuity, supplier stability and industrial base issues.  AEHF SV 5-6 are being procured using the Department of Defense (DoD) Efficient Space Procurement (ESP) concept.  The ESP concept is a procurement approach which seeks stable production and efficient sub-contractor product management through the block buy of two space vehicles at one time (as described in Advanced EHF MILSATCOM P-40 Exhibit).  

In addition, the ESP concept includes use of RDT&amp;E funding for a MILSATCOM Space Modernization Initiative (SMI), to fund engineering activities to reduce future production costs through manufacturing and producibility enhancements, improve capabilities through insertion of new technologies, and replace obsolete parts, crypto and materials.  The SV-6 crypto redesign funding is reported in the AEHF (SV 5-6 Subprogram) Acquisition Program Baseline; the remaining SMI efforts are not part of the AEHF Major Defense Acquistion Program.  The SMI efforts will provide opportunities for competition to develop potential technology upgrades at the component and system level for future satellites of the current or any follow-on system.  SMI efforts will include obsolescence management and mitigation, technology maturation, new components' qualification, subsystem and component prototyping, architecture and system concept studies (to include hosted payloads), and pathfinder efforts to address MILSATCOM capability gaps identified in the Joint Space Communications Layer (JSCL) Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) and the "Resilient Basis for SATCOM in Joint Operations" study, and currently being assessed in the Protected Satellite Communications Services (PSCS) Analysis of Alternatives (AoA).  The purpose of the PSCS AoA is to evaluate alternative space and control segment architectures, along with the associated user segment, to address the required protected satellite communications capabilities in the nuclear, contested, and benign operating environments.   

This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>In FY 2015, the Evolved AEHF Strategic only effort is a New Start.

In FY2014, Project 657104, efforts were transferred from PE 0603430F, Advanced EHF MILSATCOM (Space), Project 64A030, Evolved AEHF MILSATCOM, in order to transition to Budget Activity 5.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project funds the MILSATCOM Space Modernization Initiative (SMI) strategy. The main focus of the SMI strategy is to achieve a more affordable and flexible Protected Communications enterprise that will be capable of meeting near-term and future protected MILSATCOM warfighting mission requirements. This enterprise will incorporate engineering and acquisition concepts that will achieve a more resilient protected communications payload(s), develop affordable terminals and define viable ground systems requirements.The SMI strategy will also invest in a variety of promising new technologies and engineering concepts that will evolve current and future MILSATCOM technologies. These efforts will include conducting an assortment of protected communication demonstrations, identifying practicable capabilities that will reduce parts and obsolescence risk to the AEHF constellation and explore reasonable acquisition approaches that will expand the commercial transponder coverage that is capable of meeting current and future wideband SATCOM demand.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Enhanced Polar System (EPS) is the follow-on to the currently operational Interim Polar System (IPS) and is a component of the Extremely High Frequency SATCOM architecture providing secure, protected communications to worldwide users.  The EPS acquisition consists of four segments (Payload, Ground Control, Gateway, and Terminal) acquired by separate procurement actions.  Each EPS payload and its integration onto classified host satellites is funded by the EPS program while the development and integration is performed by the host organization.  The MILSATCOM System Directorate will procure the Ground Control and Planning Segment.  The Ground Gateway segment, funded by the EPS program, will be organically developed by the Navy's Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center Pacific (SSC-Pacific).  The MILSATCOM System Directorate is the prime systems integrator for the EPS payload, ground control, and gateway segments.  The Terminals that will use EPS will be acquired by each Service's Terminal Program Office.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>Project 657107, WGS Space Systems Resiliency Upgrade, is a FY15 New Start.

In FY2014, Project 657102, Command and Control System - Consolidated (CCS-C), efforts were transferred from 0603854F, Wideband Global SATCOM (Space), Project 644870, CCS-C, in order to transition to Budget Activity 5.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) System provides DoD users with high data rate military satellite communications (MILSATCOM) services in accordance with the Joint Space Management-approved MILSATCOM architecture (Aug 96), the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC)-approved MILSATCOM Capstone Requirements Document (Oct 97), and the JROC-approved WGS Operational Requirements Document (May 00).  Dual-frequency WGS satellites augment, then replace the DoD's Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS) X-band service and augment one-way Global Broadcast Service Ka-band capabilities.  In addition, WGS provides a new high capacity two-way Ka-band service.

All WGS Block I (Satellites 1-3) and Block II (Satellites 4-6) have been launched and are operational.  With the operation of WGS-5, the constellation has global coverage and Full Operational Capability (FOC) in March 2014.  The FY15 Project 657107, WGS Space Systems Resiliency Upgrade, is a new start and will be an Acquisition Category III (ACAT III) effort.  The WGS resiliency upgrade will enable the WGS system to both locate and neutralize ground-based jamming threats.

The MILSATCOM Command and Control System-Consolidated (CCS-C) system provides integrated launch and on-orbit command and control (C2) functionality, and backup operations at Schriever AFB and Vandenberg AFB, for MILSATCOM satellites as the legacy capability provided by the Air Force Satellite Control Network (PE 0305110F) has phased out according to plan.  CCS-C uses modified commercial off the shelf hardware/software to control emerging and legacy MILSATCOM systems including Milstar, DSCS, WGS and Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) satellites.  

The CCS-C project 657102 funds system architecture evolution to provide increased performance for additional satellites and to comply with DoD, Air Force, and AFSPC-directed standards for Information Assurance, Satellite Control Standardization, and Net-Readiness.  This continuing effort was previously funded in the FY14PB and prior as an ACAT II program.  With the 10 October 2013 FOC declaration, the program has transitioned to an ACAT III beginning FY2014.  The WGS and AEHF procurement program elements fund the mission unique software and databases for the WGS Block II Follow-On satellites and the AEHF 4-6 satellites, respectively.  

BA-5 - This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>This effort is a FY15 New Start</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) System provides the DoD with high data rate military satellite communications (MILSATCOM) services in accordance with the Joint Space Management Board-approved MILSATCOM architecture (August 1996), the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC)-approved MILSATCOM Capstone Requirements Document (October 1997), and JROC-approved WGS Operational Requirements Document (May 2000).  This program was originally conceived to augment the near-term "bandwidth gap" in warfighter communications needs.  Dual-frequency WGS satellites augment, then replace the DoD's Defense Satellite Communications System X-band service and augment one-way Global Broadcast Service Ka-band capabilities.  In addition, WGS provides a high capacity two-way Ka-band service.

All WGS Block I (Satellites 1-3) and Block II (Satellites 4-6) have been launched and are operational.  With the operation of WGS-5, the constellation has global coverage and Full Operational Capability (FOC) in March 2014.  The FY15 Project 657107, WGS Space Systems Resiliency Upgrade, is a new start and will be an Acquisition Category III (ACAT III) effort.  The WGS resiliency upgrade will enable the WGS system to both locate and neutralize ground-based jamming threats.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>AOC Increment 10.2 received a Milestone B decision 11 October 2013.  In FY 2015, PE 0605458F, Air &amp; Space Ops Center 10.2, project number 654945, AOC 10.2 Development, efforts were transferred from PE 0604458F, Air &amp; Space Ops Center, project number 644945, AOC Increment 10.2 development, in order to align post Milestone B development efforts with funding in RDT&amp;E Budget Activity 05, System Development &amp; Demonstration (SDD).  This is not a new start.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Air Operations Center Weapon System (AOC WS), AN/USQ-163 Falconer, the senior element of the Theater Air Control System (TACS), is the weapon system the Commander, Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR) provides the Combined/Joint Force Air Component Commander (C/JFACC) for planning, executing, and assessing theater-wide air and space operations.  The C/JFACC provides air, space and cyber support to the Combined/Joint Forces Commander (C/JFC) by coordinating, deconflicting and assessing the progress of various weapon systems to advance the C/JFC's campaign.  The AOC WS develops operations strategy and planning documents.  The weapon system also disseminates tasking orders; executes day-to-day peacetime and combat air, space and cyber operations; and provides rapid reaction to immediate situations by exercising positive control of friendly forces.

The AOC WS Increment 10.2 program keeps the AOC interoperable, certified, supportable, and compliant through the integration, testing and fielding of new capabilities and sustainment upgrades to the AOC WS baseline.  The program supports mission requirements at Geographic and Functional AOCs, as well as Support and Manpower Augmentation units.  To keep the AOC current and interoperable with the COCOMs, cyber requirements, and fifth generation weapon system/weapons, the AOC WS program plans to evolve the AOC through the integration and test of progressively improving capabilities.  These activities ensure a system of systems engineering perspective for the AOC WS, and include weapon system standardization activities as defined by AOC WS requirements documents.  The Modernization contractor, which was awarded the Modernization contract on 25 October 2011, conducted AOC 10.2 pre-Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) activities, including a Systems Requirements Review (SRR), an Interim Design Review (IDR), and a delta-Preliminary Design Review (delta-PDR).  In accordance with AOC 10.2 Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) direction (23 June 2010), the AOC 10.2 Modernization program conducted prototyping and Limited Early Install (LEI) activities through an iterative build methodology prior to Milestone B (MS B) to reduce integration risk and improve user feedback in the acquisition process.  AOC Increment 10.2 received a Milestone B decision 11 October 2013.  AOC 10.2 EMD activities include the design (i.e., Critical Design Review), development, integration of 3rd party capabilities, testing (Contractor in-plant system testing, Developmental Test and Evaluation, Operational Test and Evaluation, Operational Assessment, Test Readiness Review, etc.) of the AOC 10.2 baseline, as well as build-up and fielding of the Help Desk (HD), Formal Training Unit (FTU), Combined Air Operations Center-eXperimental (CAOC-X) suite, and one geographic site.

Activities also include studies and analysis to support current program planning and execution, as well as future program planning. 

This program is going into Budget Activity 5, System Development &amp; Demonstration (SDD) because the program passed Milestone B and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full fielding decision.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The acquisition strategy builds on existing capabilities using evolutionary acquisition to standardize, modernize and sustain the AOC.  The initial capability was AOC-WS Increment 10.0 which fielded the 10.0 configuration to five operational sites, plus a Help Desk and a Formal Training Unit.  The second increment, Increment 10.1, upgraded these locations to an integrated baseline and fielded the baseline to additional operational and reserve units worldwide.  The latest increment is AOC 10.2. The AOC Modernization Contract was competitively awarded on 25 October 2011, but due to contract protests and associated delays, the actual start date was 20 December 2011. The Modernization contractor is using a system of systems perspective, and is following systems engineering rigor, to evolve AOC to a Net-Centric environment, compliant with DoD Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) standards.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Key elements of the overall acquisition strategy include: use of sole source contract with a prime/integrating contractor (Northrop Grumman) who will perform subsystem and component competitions where appropriate, use of cost plus incentive fee (CPIF) development contracts, and the combination of developmental upgrades with software sustainment blocks to minimize the number of software releases, aircraft downtime, and differences in fielded configurations. The government will encourage the prime contractor to compete susbsystems and key components to reduce cost and risk.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Provides for development of Center Schedule Enterprise (CSE) program to provide an Air Force wide system to schedule, manage, and report utilization of all ranges and airspace. The system will meet new FAA interface requirements, replacing 31 different non-interoperable systems currently in use and provides a single common method of scheduling ranges and airspace to all AF and other DoD users.

This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Full Combat Mission Training (FCMT) supports Air Force Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) and Live-Virtual-Constructive (LVC) integration. DMO is an operational readiness initiative enabling the USAF to exercise and train at the operational and strategic levels of war while facilitating unit-level training.  Networked LVC components form the integrated DMO battlespace by linking geographically distributed high fidelity combat and combat support training devices, including Command and Control (C2) and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) systems. RDT&amp;E for Project 655012, FCMT, efforts are focused on development, demonstration, and transitioning of critical functions associated with the DMO/LVC network and linked simulators.  Project 655354, F-16 Block 40/50 Mission Training Centers (MTC), efforts are focused on development and demonstration of the F-16 Block 40/50 MTC.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Full Combat Mission Training (FCMT) supports Air Force Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) and Live-Virtual-Constructive (LVC) integration.  DMO is an operational readiness initiative enabling the USAF to exercise and train at the operational and strategic levels of war while facilitating unit-level training. FCMT funding  provides research in areas benefiting the AF DMO/LVC environment as a whole.  Provides research and development to facilitate integration of fielded and newly acquired, Air Force owned training devices into DMO/LVC networks.  Enhances the quality of training for the systems added to the network.  Enables aircrews to network with LVC components to form the integrated DMO battlespace.  Links geographically distributed, high-fidelity combat and combat support training devices including Command and Control (C2) and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) systems.  Develops, demonstrates and inserts multi-level security capability.  This capability allows the warfighters at home station to exercise and train at the operational and strategic levels of war as well as conduct networked unit-level training.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Each platform joining the Distributed Mission Operations (DMO)/Live-Virtual-Constructive (LVC) environment selects its own acquisition strategy based on using Command needs, Economic Analysis (EA) and the magnitude of the training system changes required to provide DMO capability.  The initial systems in the DMO/LVC environment; F-15C, AWACS, F-16 Block 40/50 and F-15E, all required new training systems.  In addition, the Operations and Integration capability was created.  The Training Simulation Service (TSS) acquisition strategy was used to meet a portion of these requirements.  In the TSS approach, the contractor owns and provides the simulator equipment, maintains simulator concurrency with weapon systems, and has incentives to keep the equipment up to date with simulator and network technologies. Currently fielded and projected Air Force-owned Flight and Mission Training Systems without DMO/LVC capability will be modified using Full Combat Mission Training (FCMT) funds to ensure compatibility with the DMO-LVC environment.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) Recapitalization (Recap) will provide a unique blend of Battle Management Command and Control (BMC2) and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) that enables the central tenant of Air Forces doctrine "Centralized Control and Decentralized Execution". Air Battle Managers onboard the JSTARS use its wide area ground surveillance radar to build situational awareness and identify targets which are passed to strike assets or crossed cued with ISR platforms. The capability to perform this dual mission at the tactical edge both reduces the time to execute the kill chain and improves ISR collections across the range of military options.

This program element enhances the warfighter's ability to achieve the joint vision of combat operations. It develops advanced battle management aids and information fusion technologies to enable rapid decisions by automating tracking and addressing time-critical targets. Concept exploration, program definition/risk reduction efforts, and studies support continuous improvements in development of BMC2 capabilities, network centric operational capabilities, and interoperability with joint service, allied, and coalition systems.

Currently this program element is comprised of the JSTARS Recap Program to include: (1) BMC2 System; (2) Sensor Systems; (3) Air Vehicle &amp; Avionics Systems; (4) Data, Voice, &amp; Advanced Communications Systems; and (5) Systems Engineering &amp; Integration (SE&amp;I). It may also include the furtherance of other related activities to include, but not be limited to, Open System Architecture (OSA) development and/or refinement for sensor systems and BMC2.

Activities also include studies and analyses to support both current program planning/execution and future program planning.

JSTARS Recap:

The JSTARS Recap program was initiated to satisfy the JSTARS Mission Area capability gaps and life-cycle affordability challenges as defined in the Synthetic Aperture Radar/Moving Target Indicator (SAR/MTI); JSTARS Mission Area Analysis of Alternative (AoA) and the SAR/MTI, BMC2 Initial Capabilities Document (ICD). The JSTARS Recap program consists of multiple efforts for the development and integration of all sub-systems necessary to satisfy the requirements documented in the ICD, AOA and, upon completion, the Capability Development Document (CDD). The efforts include, but are not limited to: BMC2 System; Sensor Systems; Air Vehicle &amp; Avionics Systems; Data, Voice &amp; Advanced Communications Systems; SE&amp;I; as well as related OSA development or refinement activities to improve AF weapon system life-cycle affordability. 

This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production. MDD is expected in FY14 with a MS B decision in FY16.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>In FY 2015, Project 650003, JSTARS Recapitalization efforts were transferred from PE 0604283F, BMC2 Sensor Development, Project 645363, MP-RTIP, in order to consolidate efforts and continue development of the JSTARs Recap.

In FY 2015, Project 650003, JSTARS Recapitalization efforts were transferred from PE 0207581F, Joint Surveillance/Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS), Project 670003, JSTARS, in order to consolidate efforts and continue development of the JSTARs Recap.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) Recapitalization (Recap) will provide a unique blend of Battle Management Command and Control (BMC2) and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) that enables the central tenant of Air Forces doctrine "Centralized Control and Decentralized Execution". Air Battle Managers onboard the JSTARS use its wide area ground surveillance radar to build situational awareness and identify targets which are passed to strike assets or crossed cued with ISR platforms. The capability to perform this dual mission at the tactical edge both reduces the time to execute the kill chain and improves ISR collections across the range of military options.

This program element enhances the warfighter's ability to achieve the joint vision of combat operations. It develops advanced battle management aids and information fusion technologies to enable rapid decisions by automating tracking and addressing time-critical targets. Concept exploration, program definition/risk reduction efforts, and studies support continuous improvements in development of BMC2 capabilities, network centric operational capabilities, and interoperability with joint service, allied, and coalition systems.

Currently this program element is comprised of the JSTARS Recap Program to include: (1) BMC2 System; (2) Sensor Systems; (3) Air Vehicle &amp; Avionics Systems; (4) Data, Voice, &amp; Advanced Communications Systems; and (5) Systems Engineering &amp; Integration (SE&amp;I). It may also include the furtherance of other related activities to include, but not be limited to, Open System Architecture (OSA) development and/or refinement for sensor systems and BMC2.

Activities also include studies and analyses to support both current program planning/execution and future program planning.

JSTARS Recap:

The JSTARS Recap program was initiated to satisfy the JSTARS Mission Area capability gaps and life-cycle affordability challenges as defined in the Synthetic Aperture Radar/Moving Target Indicator (SAR/MTI); JSTARS Mission Area Analysis of Alternative (AoA) and the SAR/MTI, BMC2 Initial Capabilities Document (ICD). The JSTARS Recap program consists of multiple efforts for the development and integration of all sub-systems necessary to satisfy the requirements documented in the ICD, AOA and, upon completion, the Capability Development Document (CDD). The efforts include, but are not limited to: BMC2 System; Sensor Systems; Air Vehicle &amp; Avionics Systems; Data, Voice &amp; Advanced Communications Systems; SE&amp;I; as well as related OSA development or refinement activities to improve AF weapon system life-cycle affordability. 

This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production. MDD is expected in FY14 with a MS B decision in FY16.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Using an evolutionary approach made possible by an OSA design that firmly defines interfaces and messaging standards, the BMC2 System will provide an on-board BMC2 solution that meets the Joint/Air Force Requirements as defined in the AoA, ICD, and CDD, thereby enabling rapid technology insertion based on mission need and funds availability. The BMC2 System development effort will also inform the AF OSA concept and frameworks with regard to applicability and efficacy of on-board BMC2 mission systems.</r2:Description>

JSTARS Recap is the first planned Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP) to leverage this body of work. JSTARS Recap also takes into considerations lessons learned from the Dismount Detection Radar (DDR) Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) program, which was a  pathfinder for OSA radar in a small, pod configured for surface surveillance missions. The JSTARS Recap Sensor Systems development effort will not only satisfy the requirements of the JSTARS Recap, but also intends to provide critical feedback to an OSA radar concept and framework with regard to applicability and efficacy in a wide area surface surveillance mission. Other sensor systems may include, but are not limited to, Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR) and multi/hyper-spectral.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY2015, Project 654103 CV-22, efforts were transferred to PE 0401318F, CV-22, Project 676033 CV-22 RDT&amp;E Post Production in order to align efforts in Budget Activity 07, Operational System Development, since CV-22 has been fielded.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The CV-22 is a Special Operations Forces (SOF) variant of the 1st generation V-22 tilt-rotor, multi-mission aircraft.  CV-22 RDT&amp;E provides development, integration, testing and enhancement of critical capability to insert, extract, and re-supply special operations forces into politically or militarily denied areas.  The CV-22 Block 10 configuration added terrain following radar, additional fuel tanks, additional radios, flare/chaff dispensers, radio frequency/infrared and defensive countermeasures, weapons, situational awareness improvements, and Communications, Navigation, Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) to the V-22 Block B aircraft.  Block 20 development includes, but is not limited to, improved communications, situational awareness, software, and other requirements specified in the V-22 Block C/20 Capabilities Production Document.  A future capabilities increment is following Block 20 to enhance defensive systems and self-deployment capabilities such as Distributed Ice Protection, improved engine performance, additional CNS/ATM and improved communication capabilities.  CV-22 RDT&amp;E also provides for a baseline CV-22 flight test aircraft for validation/verification of Block 20 and various software and reliability and maintainability mods.  The V-22 Joint Program Office is developing improved operational safety, suitability, and effectiveness capabilities in incremental modifications.  Ongoing planning and associated activities will take place to prevent diminishing manufacturing resources and obsolescence issues, as required.  

US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) and USAF jointly fund development projects to meet operational safety, suitability, and effectiveness mission needs.  This includes designing, prototyping, integrating, testing and fielding proposed solutions to emerging warfighter issues.  USSOCOM funds the development, integration and testing of Special Operations Forces (SOF) unique mission capability, while USAF funds interoperability, basic air vehicle enhancements, integration of Air Force and Navy maintenance and information systems used with the V-22, support for operational testing, and CV-22 implementation and testing of MV-22 Block B and Block C changes.  USSOCOM and USAF jointly fund correction of deficiencies and Block 20 development.  Block 20 increments 1 and 3 are developed with USAF funds and increment 2 is developed with USSOCOM funds.     

This program was in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD), through FY2014.  In FY2015, CV-22 RDT&amp;E funding transitioned to Budget Activity 7, Operational Systems Development, because the program has reached the end of System Development and Demonstration and is transitioning to Operational Systems Development.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The V-22 Joint Program Office (NAVAIRSYSCOM PMA-275) ensures that CV-22 changes are incorporated into the ongoing V-22 production line with minimal impact.  The Joint Program Office (JPO) is developing new capabilities for the V-22 in blocks.  Block 0 and Block 10 have completed development, and Block 20 is currently underway.  NAVAIRSYSCOM awarded a cost plus fixed fee contract with the prime contractor in Dec 2007 for Block 20 development and test.  After Block 20 development and test, future development efforts beyond Block 20 will be conducted as pre-planned product improvements.  Development activities for the V-22 program are performed by the prime contractor selected on a sole-source basis.  Bell-Boeing is a strategic partnership between Bell Helicopter and Boeing Integrated Defense Systems.  OSD re-designated the V-22 program from ACAT 1D to ACAT 1C on 24 Jul 2012.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This PE provides funding for the elements necessary to support the Air Force Electronic Warfare (EW) Test Process, including Directed Energy (DE).  This test process provides a scientific methodology to ensure the effective disciplined and efficient testing of EW and avionics systems.  Each capability or facility improvement is pursued in concert with the others to avoid duplicate capabilities while at the same time producing the proper mix of test resources needed to support the AF EW Test Process and testing of EW systems which can be used in any action involving the use of electromagnetic and DE to control the electromagnetic spectrum or to attack the enemy.  This PE provides funding for the management and technical oversight of implementation activities, development and improvement of digital EW models, measurement facilities improvements, hardware-in-the-loop test facilities improvements, and installed system test facility improvements.  Support includes requirements definition and analysis, project planning, programming and budgeting, technical oversight, and application of T&amp;E facility Improvement &amp; Modernization (I&amp;M).  Products include studies, analyses, improved Modeling &amp; Simulation (M&amp;S) of threat sources, improved or new T&amp;E capabilties to support EW testing and related documentation.  Additionally, this PE provides funding to support the acquisition and analysis efforts of the Foreign Materiel Program and EW intelligence efforts.

This program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&amp;E Management Support because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides funding to support Foreign Materiel Operational Test and Evaluation (FMOT&amp;E), which ensures the ability of operational commands to test and develop effective Electronic Attack/Electronic Protection (EA/EP) techniques and tactics.  Funds are required for:  deployment of systems to test facilities; travel of personnel to the test sites to evaluate and validate test results;  range and laboratory costs; test consumables; costs for instrumentation of systems; and contracted engineering support for the conduct of tests and subsequent reporting.  Funding for this program is required to prevent future aircraft losses due to improper and inaccurate aircrew tactics (e.g., lack of evasive action or proper tactics training to avoid missile attack).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The AF requires a comprehensive set of test facilities to implement the Air Force Electronic Warfare (EW) Test Process in order to test EW systems, including Directed Energy (DE).  To manage program risk effectively throughout the weapons system acquisition process, and conduct T&amp;E effectively and efficiently, a broad multi-spectrum, integrated set of T&amp;E capabilities for modeling and simulation through open-air ranges (OAR) are required. The EW Test Process Support task provides for investment management, coordinated technical oversight, and application of EW T&amp;E facilities, including studies, analyses, and related documentation.  The National Radar Cross Section (RCS) Test Facility (NRTF) at Holloman AFB, NM, provides timely, accurate, and secure RCS and antenna measurements for tri-service and joint program offices, DoD laboratories, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and industry. The NRTF tests fielded and developmental systems and technology to meet Low Observable (a.k.a. stealth) and EW customer requirements.  The Guided Weapons Evaluation Facility (GWEF), 412 EWG/OL-HN and the Digital Integrated Air Defense System (DIADS) provide the ability to realistically evaluate hardware components and simulated weapon systems against manned hardware threat representations throughout the acquisition process.  GWEF provides simulations of advanced Infrared (IR) &amp; Radio Frequency (RF) semi-active Surface-to-Air Missiles (SAMs), Air-to-Air Missiles (AAMs), RF missile warning, IR and Laser countermeasure functions; integration of actual threat hardware and ground clutter into advanced threat RF and IR missile simulations.  DIADS provides algorithm based enemy command and control (C2) capabilities plus early warning radar detection, limited ground control intercept features and also allows man-in-the-loop interaction for the enemy C2 positions.  The Advanced Warfare Test and Evaluation Capability (AWTEC) will replace 90's technology with state-of-the-art stimulators to upgrade the Benefield Anechoic Facility (BAF) at Edwards AFB, CA and provides Electromagnetic Interference/Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMI/EMC) capabilities at the BAF.  Improvement and modernization efforts within this PE are identified for the EW mission area.  EW provides planning, improvements, and modernization needed for test capabilities to conduct and support the AF EW test process, including DE.  This test process provides a scientific methodology to ensure the effective disciplined and efficient testing of EW and avionics systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project's specific purpose is to support USAF Foreign Materiel Program requirements through the acquisition and analysis of foreign materiel.  Items considered for these Foreign Materiel Acquisition (FMA) funds are included in the prioritized Air Force FMA Top 20 list established each year. Each Major Command (MAJCOM) prepares and approves a Foreign Materiel - Mission Requirements Statement for each requirement.  Annually, the MAJCOM commanders establish a list of their top 20 requirements. The MAJCOMs' requirements lists are integrated and prioritized into a classified Air Force requirement list.  Each MAJCOM then approves the FMA Top 20 List and final validation comes from the Air Force Vice Chief of Staff.  System analyses are based on and driven by acquisitions.  The USAF provides assessments and data for threat systems to all DoD components.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This PE provides planning, improvements, and modernization for test capabilities at three Air Force Test Center (AFTC) organizations: 96 Test Wing at Eglin AFB FL (to include 96 Test Group at Holloman AFB NM, and operating locations at Wright-Patterson AFB OH), Arnold Engineering Development Complex (AEDC) at Arnold AFB TN and the 412 Test Wing at Edwards AFB CA.  The purpose is to help test organizations improve and develop their test infrastructure and capabilities to keep pace with improvements in weapon system technologies.  

The improvement and modernization (I&amp;M) requirements are defined through the AF Test Investment Planning &amp; Programming (TIPP) Process.  All projects have been reviewed through the Tri-Service Reliance process (to communicate AF efforts to the other Services and avoid unwarranted duplication of effort) and are documented in the Technology Development Acquisition Program (TDAP) database.  Each project has its own planning, development, equipment acquisition, equipment installation, and checkout phases which often require significant differences in funding from one year to the next.  As such, the changes in category funding from year to year do not necessarily indicate program growth, but rather a planned phasing of improvement and modernization efforts.  The test capabilities at these locations enable testing through all phases of weapon system acquisition, from system concept exploration through component and full scale integrated weapon system testing to operational testing.  These test organizations are a part of the Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB), operated and maintained by the Air Force for DoD test and evaluation.  These national test assets are available to others requiring their unique capabilities.

The 96TW, at Eglin AFB FL, conducts and supports developmental test and evaluation (DT&amp;E) of non-nuclear air armaments; Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems; target acquisition and weapon delivery systems; navigation systems; provides a climatic simulation capability; determines target/test item spectral signatures; and provides Cyber testing capabilities as part of the Joint Information Operations (IO) Range.  The 96TG at Holloman AFB, NM provides independent test and evaluation of inertial, Global Positioning System (GPS) and integrated systems used for aircraft navigation and missile guidance systems including vulnerability to electronic interference; provides the liaison function for coordinating and scheduling all US Air Force test operations at White Sands Missile Range; provides subsonic through hypersonic ground testing of aircraft and missiles in a flight-representative environment under highly instrumented conditions; and executes flight test and test support for advanced avionics and weapons development of joint, international and commercial test programs.

AEDC, at Arnold AFB TN, provides pre-flight and reliability ground environmental test support for DoD aeropropulsion, flight systems, and space and missile programs.  The center has 53 test facilities providing: aerodynamic testing of scale model aircraft, missiles, and space systems; testing of large and full-scale satellites, sensors, and space vehicles in a simulated space environment; altitude environmental testing for aircraft, missile, and spacecraft propulsion systems; and testing of large-scale models such as space boosters together with their propulsion systems.

The 412th Test Wing, at Edwards AFB CA, conducts and supports DT&amp;E and Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&amp;E) of aircraft and aircraft systems, aerospace research vehicles, unmanned aerial vehicles, cruise missiles, parachute delivery/recovery/systems, and cargo handling systems.

I&amp;M efforts within this PE are identified in four mission area categories:  Airframe/Propulsion/Avionics (APA); Armament/Munitions (A/M); Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (C4ISR); and Space.  These categories describe general types of effort that will be conducted in this PE.  APA provides planning, improvements, and modernization needed for test capabilities to conduct and support DT&amp;E and OT&amp;E of aircraft and aircraft systems, aerospace research vehicles, unmanned aerial vehicles, cruise missiles, parachute delivery/recovery systems, cargo handling systems, and turbine engines.  APA focuses on evaluation of the vehicle airframe, propulsion system, and avionics systems, as well as overall systems integration testing.  It encompasses both ground test facilities, on-board test aircraft systems, and open-air range infrastructure, including instrumentation and data processing.  A/M provides planning, improvements and modernization to conduct DT&amp;E of air-to-ground and air-to-air armaments and munitions, which include gun, chaff and flare systems as well as aerial decoy and target systems.  The A/M category encompasses the full range of DT&amp;E from digital modeling and simulation, to precision measurement testing, to hardware-in-the-loop and installed systems testing, to open-air range testing.  Elements of A/M DT&amp;E include environmental, warhead effectiveness, arena blast/fragmentation, guidance navigation and control, aerodynamics, propulsion, electromagnetic interference and compatibility, mass properties, seeker and signature measurement, survivability, lethality, integration, reliability, net-centric and terminal effects testing.  A/M also involves the design and development of systems needed to support A/M DT&amp;E including the design and development sleds, targets, range support systems and various instrumentation and measurement systems.  C4ISR provides planning, improvements and modernization to conduct DT&amp;E of systems that support C2 functions which range from air campaign planning at the theater level to wing level C2 operations, to planning individual missions, to putting weapons on target using concepts such as machine to machine targeting.  C4ISR includes ground and flight performance testing of airborne C2 networks and tactical data links, air operation centers, mission planning systems, multi-level security systems, radio and communication systems, ISR systems, information assurance systems, and radar systems such as those used by JSTARS and air traffic control systems.  C4ISR conducts DT&amp;E on a full range of systems covering the sensor (detection) to the shooter (weapon), including functional and environmental testing of these systems.  C4ISR includes DT&amp;E for offensive and defensive Cyber capabilities.  Space provides planning, improvements, and modernization needed for test capabilities to perform developmental and operational testing for space and launch acquisition and sustainment programs.  Test capabilities include launch vehicle, satellite, missile, sensor, thermal protection system, signature, hardness, and interface testing.  The capabilities reside at Vandenberg, Kirtland, Arnold, Patrick, Schriever, Peterson, Holloman Air Force Bases and others.  Infrastructure includes launch sites, mobile control units, thermal vacuum chambers, sled track, arc heated wind tunnels, ballistic test ranges, signature collection, and the requisite personnel.  

Budget Activity Justification:  This program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&amp;E Management Support, because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This PE provides planning, improvements, and modernization for test capabilities at three Air Force Test Center (AFTC) organizations: 96 Test Wing at Eglin AFB FL (to include 96 Test Group at Holloman AFB NM, and operating locations at Wright-Patterson AFB OH), Arnold Engineering Development Complex (AEDC) at Arnold AFB TN and the 412 Test Wing at Edwards AFB CA.  The purpose is to help test organizations improve and develop their test infrastructure and capabilities to keep pace with improvements in weapon system technologies.  

The improvement and modernization (I&amp;M) requirements are defined through the AF Test Investment Planning &amp; Programming (TIPP) Process.  All projects have been reviewed through the Tri-Service Reliance process (to communicate AF efforts to the other Services and avoid unwarranted duplication of effort) and are documented in the Technology Development Acquisition Program (TDAP) database.  Each project has its own planning, development, equipment acquisition, equipment installation, and checkout phases which often require significant differences in funding from one year to the next.  As such, the changes in category funding from year to year do not necessarily indicate program growth, but rather a planned phasing of improvement and modernization efforts.  The test capabilities at these locations enable testing through all phases of weapon system acquisition, from system concept exploration through component and full scale integrated weapon system testing to operational testing.  These test organizations are a part of the Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB), operated and maintained by the Air Force for DoD test and evaluation.  These national test assets are available to others requiring their unique capabilities.

The 96TW, at Eglin AFB FL, conducts and supports developmental test and evaluation (DT&amp;E) of non-nuclear air armaments; Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems; target acquisition and weapon delivery systems; navigation systems; provides a climatic simulation capability; determines target/test item spectral signatures; and provides Cyber testing capabilities as part of the Joint Information Operations (IO) Range.  The 96TG at Holloman AFB, NM provides independent test and evaluation of inertial, Global Positioning System (GPS) and integrated systems used for aircraft navigation and missile guidance systems including vulnerability to electronic interference; provides the liaison function for coordinating and scheduling all US Air Force test operations at White Sands Missile Range; provides subsonic through hypersonic ground testing of aircraft and missiles in a flight-representative environment under highly instrumented conditions; and executes flight test and test support for advanced avionics and weapons development of joint, international and commercial test programs.

AEDC, at Arnold AFB TN, provides pre-flight and reliability ground environmental test support for DoD aeropropulsion, flight systems, and space and missile programs.  The center has 53 test facilities providing: aerodynamic testing of scale model aircraft, missiles, and space systems; testing of large and full-scale satellites, sensors, and space vehicles in a simulated space environment; altitude environmental testing for aircraft, missile, and spacecraft propulsion systems; and testing of large-scale models such as space boosters together with their propulsion systems.

The 412th Test Wing, at Edwards AFB CA, conducts and supports DT&amp;E and Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&amp;E) of aircraft and aircraft systems, aerospace research vehicles, unmanned aerial vehicles, cruise missiles, parachute delivery/recovery/systems, and cargo handling systems.

I&amp;M efforts within this PE are identified in four mission area categories:  Airframe/Propulsion/Avionics (APA); Armament/Munitions (A/M); Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (C4ISR); and Space.  These categories describe general types of effort that will be conducted in this PE.  APA provides planning, improvements, and modernization needed for test capabilities to conduct and support DT&amp;E and OT&amp;E of aircraft and aircraft systems, aerospace research vehicles, unmanned aerial vehicles, cruise missiles, parachute delivery/recovery systems, cargo handling systems, and turbine engines.  APA focuses on evaluation of the vehicle airframe, propulsion system, and avionics systems, as well as overall systems integration testing.  It encompasses both ground test facilities, on-board test aircraft systems, and open-air range infrastructure, including instrumentation and data processing.  A/M provides planning, improvements and modernization to conduct DT&amp;E of air-to-ground and air-to-air armaments and munitions, which include gun, chaff and flare systems as well as aerial decoy and target systems.  The A/M category encompasses the full range of DT&amp;E from digital modeling and simulation, to precision measurement testing, to hardware-in-the-loop and installed systems testing, to open-air range testing.  Elements of A/M DT&amp;E include environmental, warhead effectiveness, arena blast/fragmentation, guidance navigation and control, aerodynamics, propulsion, electromagnetic interference and compatibility, mass properties, seeker and signature measurement, survivability, lethality, integration, reliability, net-centric and terminal effects testing.  A/M also involves the design and development of systems needed to support A/M DT&amp;E including the design and development sleds, targets, range support systems and various instrumentation and measurement systems.  C4ISR provides planning, improvements and modernization to conduct DT&amp;E of systems that support C2 functions which range from air campaign planning at the theater level to wing level C2 operations, to planning individual missions, to putting weapons on target using concepts such as machine to machine targeting.  C4ISR includes ground and flight performance testing of airborne C2 networks and tactical data links, air operation centers, mission planning systems, multi-level security systems, radio and communication systems, ISR systems, information assurance systems, and radar systems such as those used by JSTARS and air traffic control systems.  C4ISR conducts DT&amp;E on a full range of systems covering the sensor (detection) to the shooter (weapon), including functional and environmental testing of these systems.  C4ISR includes DT&amp;E for offensive and defensive Cyber capabilities.  Space provides planning, improvements, and modernization needed for test capabilities to perform developmental and operational testing for space and launch acquisition and sustainment programs.  Test capabilities include launch vehicle, satellite, missile, sensor, thermal protection system, signature, hardness, and interface testing.  The capabilities reside at Vandenberg, Kirtland, Arnold, Patrick, Schriever, Peterson, Holloman Air Force Bases and others.  Infrastructure includes launch sites, mobile control units, thermal vacuum chambers, sled track, arc heated wind tunnels, ballistic test ranges, signature collection, and the requisite personnel.  

Budget Activity Justification:  This program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&amp;E Management Support, because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program provides for continuing analytical research across a broad spectrum of aerospace issues and concerns. The Project AIR FORCE (PAF) research agenda is focused primarily on mid to long-term problems; in addition, PAF provides quick response assistance for senior Air Force officials on high priority, near term issues. Within these areas, PAF addresses difficult and complex, far-reaching and inter-related questions linked to future strategies, approaches and policies, in order to enhance Air Force senior leadership's deliberations and decisionmaking on major issues. The Air Force Steering Group, chaired by the Vice Chief of Staff, reviews, monitors, and approves PAF annual research efforts. Each project is initiated, processed, and approved in accordance with PAF Sponsoring Agreement which requires General Officer (or SES equivalent) sponsorship and involvement on a continuing basis.  

PAF is organized in four primary research program areas: strategy and doctrine; force modernization employment; manpower, personnel and training; and resource management. Integrative research projects are also conducted at the division level with direct support provided through the most applicable program. Research programs address organizational crosscutting issues as defined by specific research themes approved by the Air Force Steering Group. These research themes encompass a wide spectrum of topics including external challenges to national security; terrorism and homeland defense; joint and coalition operations; integrated roadmap for ISR capabilities; enhancing, tailoring and reducing infrastructure to meet new force requirements; potential changes to the Active/Reserve/National Guard/Civilian/Contractor manpower mix; and improved weapon system costing.    

The research program will continue to build upon research foundations, examining the evolving security environment, emerging threats, national and military strategy, transformation approaches including investment strategies to provide capabilities within changing Defense budgets, operational concepts to meet evolving and increasingly joint missions, exploiting advanced technologies, increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of combat support, and developing the total force (Active/Reserve/National Guard/Civilian/Contractor).  These efforts will continue to inform and support the senior Air Force leadership regarding personnel management and training; improving logistical efficiencies and force sustainment; ongoing conflicts and joint operations; force structure capabilities, limitations, and operational concepts; and making force structure tradeoffs within resource constraints to meet future national security and Air Force needs.  

Future research will build upon earlier work to continue to help the Air Force to rapidly and appropriately adapt to the changing world environment and emerging threats; continue to modernize and employ its force structure to provide capabilities within changing DoD budgets; assess lessons learned from recent and ongoing conflicts; develop and utilize its total force; and enhance the support of our aerospace forces, ranging from sustainment of the force structure to agile combat support.  

PAF research spans functional and organizational boundaries and is managed in a manner to facilitate independence and freedom from organizational bias thereby providing perspectives and insights to senior Air Force leaders free from parochial influences not necessarily in the best interest of the Air Force at large. Benefits of independent non-Department of Defense analysis of complex present day and emerging issues are shared beyond the immediacy of the Air Force.  PAF study results are given wide dissemination within the DOD on a routine basis and are deposited with the Defense Technical Information Center available to a broad range of qualified government and commercial-sector individuals and activities.

This program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&amp;E Management and Support because this budget activity includes research, development, and test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program provides for continuing analytical research across a broad spectrum of aerospace issues and concerns. The Project AIR FORCE (PAF) research agenda is focused primarily on mid to long-term problems; in addition, PAF provides quick response assistance for senior Air Force officials on high priority, near term issues. Within these areas, PAF addresses difficult and complex, far-reaching and inter-related questions linked to future strategies, approaches and policies, in order to enhance Air Force senior leadership's deliberations and decisionmaking on major issues. The Air Force Steering Group, chaired by the Vice Chief of Staff, reviews, monitors, and approves PAF annual research efforts. Each project is initiated, processed, and approved in accordance with PAF Sponsoring Agreement which requires General Officer (or SES equivalent) sponsorship and involvement on a continuing basis.  

PAF is organized in four primary research program areas: strategy and doctrine; force modernization employment; manpower, personnel and training; and resource management. Integrative research projects are also conducted at the division level with direct support provided through the most applicable program. Research programs address organizational crosscutting issues as defined by specific research themes approved by the Air Force Steering Group. These research themes encompass a wide spectrum of topics including external challenges to national security; terrorism and homeland defense; joint and coalition operations; integrated roadmap for ISR capabilities; enhancing, tailoring and reducing infrastructure to meet new force requirements; potential changes to the Active/Reserve/National Guard/Civilian/Contractor manpower mix; and improved weapon system costing.    

The research program will continue to build upon research foundations, examining the evolving security environment, emerging threats, national and military strategy, transformation approaches including investment strategies to provide capabilities within changing Defense budgets, operational concepts to meet evolving and increasingly joint missions, exploiting advanced technologies, increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of combat support, and developing the total force (Active/Reserve/National Guard/Civilian/Contractor).  These efforts will continue to inform and support the senior Air Force leadership regarding personnel management and training; improving logistical efficiencies and force sustainment; ongoing conflicts and joint operations; force structure capabilities, limitations, and operational concepts; and making force structure tradeoffs within resource constraints to meet future national security and Air Force needs.  

Future research will build upon earlier work to continue to help the Air Force to rapidly and appropriately adapt to the changing world environment and emerging threats; continue to modernize and employ its force structure to provide capabilities within changing DoD budgets; assess lessons learned from recent and ongoing conflicts; develop and utilize its total force; and enhance the support of our aerospace forces, ranging from sustainment of the force structure to agile combat support.  

PAF research spans functional and organizational boundaries and is managed in a manner to facilitate independence and freedom from organizational bias thereby providing perspectives and insights to senior Air Force leaders free from parochial influences not necessarily in the best interest of the Air Force at large. Benefits of independent non-Department of Defense analysis of complex present day and emerging issues are shared beyond the immediacy of the Air Force.  PAF study results are given wide dissemination within the DOD on a routine basis and are deposited with the Defense Technical Information Center available to a broad range of qualified government and commercial-sector individuals and activities.

This program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&amp;E Management and Support because this budget activity includes research, development, and test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element funds Congressionally mandated Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) to support major weapon system acquisition decisions beyond Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP), Milestone C, full rate production, fielding, and declaration of Initial Operational Capability (IOC). For major defense acquisition programs, the law requires IOT&amp;E be completed under realistic operating conditions before proceeding beyond LRIP. IOT&amp;E will be planned to completely and unambiguously answer all critical operational issues (COI) as thoroughly as possible. IOT&amp;E is conducted to determine the operational effectiveness and suitability and resolve overall mission capability of systems undergoing research and development (R&amp;D) efforts. It is an evaluation of a system's performance when the complete system is tested and evaluated against operational criteria by personnel with the same qualifications as those who will operate, maintain and support the system when deployed. In general, IOT&amp;E is performed on new systems in development, major modifications, and other systems as directed. This PE funds the Air Force Operational Test Agency's participation in Integrated Test and Evaluation (IT&amp;E), Multiservice Operational Test and Evaluation (MOT&amp;E), and Follow-on Operational Test and Evaluation (FOT&amp;E) when it is the continuation of IOT&amp;E activities past the full rate production decision. FOT&amp;E answers specific questions about unresolved COIs and test issues, or completes areas not finished during the IOT&amp;E. This PE also funds related operational test and evaluation (OT&amp;E) activities such as Early Influence, Operational Utility Evaluations (OUE), Early Operational Assessments (EOA), Operational Assessments (OA), and independent IOT&amp;E which support major milestones and decision points prior to Milestone C, full rate production, fielding, or declaration of IOC. IOT&amp;E programs are identified in several system categories: Air; Space; Weapons; Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR); and Combat Support. This is a level of effort program element driven by Congressionally and DoD acquisition mandated requirements for operational testing.

Budget Activity Justification: This program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&amp;E Management Support because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain operations required for general test and evaluation.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Test facilities, capabilities and resources operated through this program include wind tunnels, rocket and jet engine test cells, armament test ranges, hardware-in-the-loop test facilities, climatic test facilities, avionics test facilities, aircraft testbeds, dry lakebed landing sites, instrumented test ranges, civilian payroll, and contractor services.  It also provides resources for maintaining and modifying as required Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) assigned test and test support coded aircraft.  No acquisition contracts are funded from this program; test support contracts for services and supplies and equipment are predominantly awarded on the basis of full and open competition.   

This program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&amp;E Management Support, because this budget activity includes research, development, test, and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Rocket Systems Launch Program (RSLP) provides responsive space and Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) launch vehicle support to DoD and other government agencies using commercial launch systems and excess ballistic missile assets.  The RSLP mission was established by the Secretary of Defense in 1972.  It provides mission planning, payload integration, vehicle acquisition, processing, launch operations, booster storage and disposition, aging surveillance, maintenance and logistics support for selected DoD responsive space and RDT&amp;E launches.  Costs directly attributable to a specific launch or program (e.g. reliability of flight testing, maintenance of launch vehicle processing infrastructure) are paid by the user (Air Force, Navy, Army, Missile Defense Agency (MDA), Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA), National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), etc.).  RSLP maintains exclusive control of deactivated Minuteman and Peacekeeper assets used in testing to include refurbishment, transportation and handling, storage, and launch services.  RSLP also funds general research, development, and supplemental reliability of flight testing efforts for launch to enhance the reliability of the Minotaur and other fleet vehicles (e.g., updates to the Modular Mechanical Ordnance Destruct System). 

This program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&amp;E Management Support because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Rocket Systems Launch Program (RSLP) provides responsive space and Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) launch vehicle support to DoD and other government agencies using commercial launch systems and excess ballistic missile assets.  The RSLP mission was established by the Secretary of Defense in 1972.  It provides mission planning, payload integration, vehicle acquisition, processing, launch operations, booster storage and disposition, aging surveillance, maintenance and logistics support for selected DoD responsive space and RDT&amp;E launches.  Costs directly attributable to a specific launch or program (e.g. reliability of flight testing, maintenance of launch vehicle processing infrastructure) are paid by the user (Air Force, Navy, Army, Missile Defense Agency (MDA), Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA), National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), etc.).  RSLP maintains exclusive control of deactivated Minuteman and Peacekeeper assets used in testing to include refurbishment, transportation and handling, storage, and launch services.  RSLP also funds general research, development, and supplemental reliability of flight testing efforts for launch to enhance the reliability of the Minotaur and other fleet vehicles (e.g., updates to the Modular Mechanical Ordnance Destruct System). 

This program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&amp;E Management Support because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Space Test Program (STP) conducts space test missions for the purpose of accelerating DoD space technology transformation while lowering developmental risk. The program flies an optimally selected number of DoD-sponsored experiments consistent with priority, opportunity, and funding.   STP missions provide a cost-effective way to flight test new militarily relevant space system technologies, concepts, and designs, providing a way to:   
- Support the acquisition block development approach 
- Demonstrate and develop responsive research and development (R&amp;D) space capabilities 
- Provide early operational capabilities to quickly react to new developments 
- Perform operational risk reduction through direct flight test of prototype components 
- Improve operational design by characterizing the space environment, event, or sensor physics proposed for an operational system/system upgrade 
- Develop, integrate, test, and acquire advanced payload support hardware for launch vehicles (LV) and human-rated spaceflight vehicles 
 
The Deputy Secretary of Defense Space Test Program Management &amp; Funding Policy, issued in July 2002, reaffirmed STP as the primary provider of spaceflight for the DoD space research community.  The July 2002 policy statement also reaffirmed STP's role as the single manager for all DoD payloads on the International Space Station (ISS).

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Restoration includes repair and replacement work to restore damaged facilities due to accident or failure attributable to inadequate sustainment, excessive age, or other causes. Modernization includes alteration of facilities to implement a new, higher standard (including regulatory changes), to accommodate new functions, or to replace building components that typically last more than 50 years (such as foundations and structural components).  Other tasks associated with facilities operations (such as custodial services, grass cutting, and the provision of central utilities) are not included.   These restoration/modernization funds support the following Air Force test organizations and their associated test and evaluation facilities, including:  remote locations, 96th Test Group (TG) at Holloman AFB, NM, the 96th Test Wing (TW) at Eglin AFB, FL, the Arnold Engineering and Development Complex (AEDC) at Arnold AFB, TN, the 412th TW at Edwards AFB, CA, 96 TG Landing Gear Test Facility (LGTF) at Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, Hypersonic Wind Tunnel 9 at White Oak, MD, and the National Full-Scale Aerodynamics Complex (NFAC) at Moffett Field, CA.

Budget Activity Justification: This program element is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&amp;E Management Support because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Restoration includes repair and replacement work to restore damaged facilities due to accident or failure attributable to inadequate sustainment, excessive age, or other causes. Modernization includes alteration of facilities to implement a new, higher standard (including regulatory changes), to accommodate new functions, or to replace building components that typically last more than 50 years (such as foundations and structural components).  Other tasks associated with facilities operations (such as custodial services, grass cutting, and the provision of central utilities) are not included.   These restoration/modernization funds support the following Air Force test organizations and their associated test and evaluation facilities, including:  remote locations, 96th Test Group (TG) at Holloman AFB, NM, the 96th Test Wing (TW) at Eglin AFB, FL, the Arnold Engineering and Development Complex (AEDC) at Arnold AFB, TN, the 412th TW at Edwards AFB, CA, 96 TG Landing Gear Test Facility (LGTF) at Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, Hypersonic Wind Tunnel 9 at White Oak, MD, and the National Full-Scale Aerodynamics Complex (NFAC) at Moffett Field, CA.

Budget Activity Justification: This program element is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&amp;E Management Support because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Provides resources for sustainment activities required for an inventory of Air Force Material Command (AFMC) Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) facilities.  Facility sustainment includes regularly scheduled adjustments and inspections, preventative maintenance tasks, and emergency response and service calls for minor repairs. It also includes major repairs or replacement of facility components that are expected to occur periodically.  In addition to standard facility sustainment, such as roof replacement, refinishing of wall and floor surfaces, and repairing and replacing of heating and cooling systems, this work includes inspections and repairs of heavy plant machinery in large industrial facilities.  This work includes, but is not limited to, inspection and repair of high-power electrical switching gear, hydraulic, lubrication, forced-air and fluid cooling systems, high pressure vessel health monitoring, facility control and remote monitoring systems, liquid oxygen systems, steam systems, test instrumentation, and fire detection and suppression systems.  Other tasks associated with facilities operations (such as custodial services, grass cutting, and landscaping, waste disposal, and the provision of central utilities) are not included. These sustainment funds support the following Air Force organizations and their associated test and evaluation facilities, including:  remote locations, 96th Test Group (TG) at Holloman AFB, NM, the 96th Test Wing (TW) at Eglin AFB, FL, the Arnold Engineering and Development Complex (AEDC) at Arnold AFB, TN, the 412 Test Wing (TW) at Edwards AFB, CA, 96 TG Landing Gear Test Facility (LGTF) at Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, Hypersonic Wind Tunnel 9 at White Oak, MD, and the National Full-Scale Aerodynamics Complex (NFAC) at Moffett Field, CA.

Budget Activity Justification:  This program element is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&amp;E Management Support because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Requirements Analysis and Maturation (RAM) program funds early systems engineering and pre-acquisition planning and analysis activities. These activities include requirements analysis, capability decomposition and trade space characterization, concept development (system of systems, air, space, and cyber), cost analysis, modeling and simulation of representative or prototype systems, and costs associated with these activities to include analytical tools and travel. Outcomes of these activities are fiscally and technologically informed requirements, mature concepts that are technically feasible, and areas for science and technology (S&amp;T) investment to reduce technology risks. These activities provide the analytic basis for cost and capability trades to inform weapon systems requirements and acquisition milestones, decision points, and phases; for example, the Materiel Development Decision (MDD). A number of Department of Defense (DoD), Government Accountability Office (GAO), and independent industry studies point to a need for more disciplined, early-phase systems engineering and pre-systems acquisition planning to produce decision-quality acquisition information that previously did not surface until after the initiation of a program. Early-phase systems engineering and technical planning activities funded by this program provide the foundation for informed investment decisions leading to successful acquisition programs. Specific efforts are determined each year based upon the highest Air Force priorities.

This program is in Budget Activity 6 RDT&amp;E Management Support because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, develpment, test and evaluation.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This project supports the development of Space Test and Training Range (STTR) capabilities required to support developmental and operational test, training, exercises and tactics development for Space Control systems and related architecture. This includes development, demonstration and delivery of test assets, special test equipment, capabilities and systems required to test, validate, and verify performance of integrated space control systems. The objective of the STTR is to provide a safe, secure, controllable and repeatable environment for the testing and training of Space Control mission systems and operators that is both realistic and relevant.  Additionally, this program supports the development of test range assets required to support developmental and operational test, exercises, training, and tactics development for Air Force and Joint-service space control systems/units. Included are both the fixed node Space Range Operation Center (SROC) at Schriever AFB and a deployable capability to support complex Joint and AF exercises. A space range Family of Systems (FoS) called Big Top is being developed to accomplish the STTR mission. The Big Top objective is integration into a Distributed Mission Architecture, tying into both the Information Operations (IO) and Air ranges for increased realism and complexity. This technology will allow for the first-ever use of a realistic signal environment to increase the realism and efficiency of space control squadron training.  This program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&amp;E Management Support, because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and modernize the Space Test and Training Range.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>In FY 2015, Project 666156 Space Test and Training Range Development efforts were transferred from PE 0603438F, Space Test and Training Range Development Project 64A007 Space Range to improve alignment with budget activity.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports the development of Space Test and Training Range (STTR) capabilities required to support developmental and operational test, training, exercises and tactics development for Space Control systems and related architecture. This includes development, demonstration and delivery of test assets, special test equipment, capabilities and systems required to test, validate, and verify performance of integrated space control systems. The objective of the STTR is to provide a safe, secure, controllable and repeatable environment for the testing and training of Space Control mission systems and operators that is both realistic and relevant.  Additionally, this program supports the development of test range assets required to support developmental and operational test, exercises, training, and tactics development for Air Force and Joint-service space control systems/units. Included are both the fixed node Space Range Operation Center (SROC) at Schriever AFB and a deployable capability to support complex Joint and AF exercises. A space range Family of Systems (FoS) called Big Top is being developed to accomplish the STTR mission. The Big Top objective is integration into a Distributed Mission Architecture, tying into both the Information Operations (IO) and Air ranges for increased realism and complexity. This technology will allow for the first-ever use of a realistic signal environment to increase the realism and efficiency of space control squadron training.  This program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&amp;E Management Support, because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and modernize the Space Test and Training Range.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY 2015, Project 668101, MSSE and JIAMD Capability Initiative, was terminated.

Per the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) of 8 May 2013, the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) assumed technical authority responsibility of air and missile defense integration activities.  In addition, the Air Force will provide FY 2014 PE 0606323F, Multi-Service Systems Engineering (MSSE), funding to MDA subject to sequestration and other congressional reductions.  MDA will budget for Integrated Air &amp; Missile Defense engineering and integration as part of the President's Budget 2015 process.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Multi-Service System Engineering Team (MSSET) serves as a joint acquisition effort to build the framework for future work towards achieving near-term Joint Track Management Capability (JTMC) and long-term Joint Integrated Air and Missile Defense (JIAMD) capabilities.  

The MSSET will perform systems engineering activities in collaboration with the Missile Defense Agency (MDA), Services, Joint Staff, and OSD. The MSSET will review Service Program of Record (PoRs) and MDA systems based upon operationally validated JIAMD requirements and Prioritized Capabilities List (PCL) needs. It will then recommend engineering changes (e.g., Interface Control Documents (ICDs), common standards, and/or specifications) that can provide incremental improvements in Joint war fighting capability, as described in the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC)-validated Joint IAMD operational requirements, information exchange requirements, as well as other war fighter-approved requirements.  The MSSET scope will encompass the collaborative efforts to provide the war fighter the ability to effectively and efficiently utilize all available resources to counter the complete air, cruise missile, and ballistic missile threats. Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution, as well as future program planning.

The objective of the MSSET is to recommend incremental improvements in fielded capabilities within the construct of Service and MDA PoRs.  The following list includes several, priority Family of Systems (FOS) engineering tasks. These tasks go beyond the expected scope of engineering efforts conducted by an individual Service and MDA in their POR for IAMD:

- Conduct the engineering activity to develop coordinated Joint IAMD Department of Defense (DoD) Architecture Framework (DODAF) products (e.g., System Views) while maintaining and deriving common standards.
- Develop, recommend, and document as necessary overarching JIAMD technical/performance requirements.
- Perform Joint IAMD FOS engineering and related analyses, and develop recommendations for incrementally implementing Joint IAMD capabilities. 
- Develop Joint IAMD FOS engineering and Capability Validation Plans and strategies.
- Recommend updates to the Joint Staff IAMD Operational Views as necessary.
- Ensure that Joint engineering tasks are conducted in a logical sequence and in a timely manner to provide the Services and MDA the most benefit and adequate time to consider engineering recommendations derived by the MSSET.
- JPEO act in the role of Secretariat for the AMD Integration Standing-Committee to Missile Defense Executive Board (MDEB).

This program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&amp;E Management Support, this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>In FY 2015, Project 668101, MSSE and JIAMD Capability Initiative, was terminated.

Per the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) of 8 May 2013, the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) assumed technical authority responsibility of air and missile defense integration activities.  The Air Force will provide FY 2014 PE 0606323F, Multi-Service Systems Engineering (MSSE), funding to MDA.  MDA will budget for Integrated Air &amp; Missile Defense engineering and integration as part of the President's Budget 2015 process.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Multi-Service System Engineering Team (MSSET) serves as a joint acquisition effort to build the framework for future work towards achieving near-term Joint Track Management Capability (JTMC) and long-term Joint Integrated Air and Missile Defense (JIAMD) capabilities.  

The MSSET will perform systems engineering activities in collaboration with the Missile Defense Agency (MDA), Services, Joint Staff, and OSD. The MSSET will review Service Program of Record (PoRs) and MDA systems based upon operationally validated JIAMD requirements and Prioritized Capabilities List (PCL) needs. It will then recommend engineering changes (e.g., Interface Control Documents (ICDs), common standards, and/or specifications) that can provide incremental improvements in Joint war fighting capability, as described in the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC)-validated Joint IAMD operational requirements, information exchange requirements, as well as other war fighter-approved requirements.  The MSSET scope will encompass the collaborative efforts to provide the war fighter the ability to effectively and efficiently utilize all available resources to counter the complete air, cruise missile, and ballistic missile threats. Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution, as well as future program planning.

The objective of the MSSET is to recommend incremental improvements in fielded capabilities within the construct of Service and MDA PoRs.  The following list includes several, priority Family of Systems (FOS) engineering tasks. These tasks go beyond the expected scope of engineering efforts conducted by an individual Service and MDA in their POR for IAMD:

- Conduct the engineering activity to develop coordinated Joint IAMD Department of Defense (DoD) Architecture Framework (DODAF) products (e.g., System Views) while maintaining and deriving common standards.
- Develop, recommend, and document as necessary overarching JIAMD technical/performance requirements.
- Perform Joint IAMD FOS engineering and related analyses, and develop recommendations for incrementally implementing Joint IAMD capabilities. 
- Develop Joint IAMD FOS engineering and Capability Validation Plans and strategies.
- Recommend updates to the Joint Staff IAMD Operational Views as necessary.
- Ensure that Joint engineering tasks are conducted in a logical sequence and in a timely manner to provide the Services and MDA the most benefit and adequate time to consider engineering recommendations derived by the MSSET.
- JPEO act in the role of Secretariat for the AMD Integration Standing-Committee to Missile Defense Executive Board (MDEB).

This program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&amp;E Management Support, this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) equips US and allied forces with operational space and missile systems, launch systems, and command and control infrastructure in support of global military and national security operations.  SMC operates with over 6,300 people and an annual budget exceeding $8B providing joint warfighters navigation, communication, weather, warning, force application, and space control capabilities.  In FY12--as an AF pilot initiative--SMC acquisition workforce civilian personnel funding was transferred from O&amp;M, AF and Section 852 accounts to RDT&amp;E, AF funds. 

SMC is authorized to employ approximately 1,560 civilian acquisition professionals.  This includes all existing acquisition workforce civilian personnel, continued contractor to civilian conversions and Acquisition Improvement Program hiring.  The funding does not include the costs for the base operating support civilian personnel supporting the Los Angeles AFB air base group. Funding SMC civilian payroll from the RDT&amp;E appropriation provides program managers the flexibility to hire additional civilian personnel with program dollars versus additional contractors in concert with Acquisition Workforce Improvement Initiatives.

This program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&amp;E Management Support because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) equips US and allied forces with operational space and missile systems, launch systems, and command and control infrastructure in support of global military and national security operations.  SMC operates with over 6,300 people and an annual budget exceeding $8B providing joint warfighters navigation, communication, weather, warning, force application, and space control capabilities.  In FY12--as an AF pilot initiative--SMC acquisition workforce civilian personnel funding was transferred from O&amp;M, AF and Section 852 accounts to RDT&amp;E, AF funds. 

SMC is authorized to employ approximately 1,560 civilian acquisition professionals.  This includes all existing acquisition workforce civilian personnel, continued contractor to civilian conversions and Acquisition Improvement Program hiring.  The funding does not include the costs for the base operating support civilian personnel supporting the Los Angeles AFB air base group. Funding SMC civilian payroll from the RDT&amp;E appropriation provides program managers the flexibility to hire additional civilian personnel with program dollars versus additional contractors in concert with Acquisition Workforce Improvement Initiatives.

This program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&amp;E Management Support because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>In FY2014, Project 66ACS1 efforts were transferred to Project 66ACSI to consolidate and streamline efforts for Performance Measures, Technical and Analytical Support, and Recruiting and Development.

The program funds efforts to meet the Defense Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act (DAWIA), as well as Congressional, SECDEF, and SECAF mandates to provide program management execution tools, systems integration and architectural analysis, information technology infrastructure development, and technical workforce management.  Funding also provides the framework for Air Force business and acquisition transformation in developing capabilities-based architectures, re-engineering and enabling technologies, integrating robust systems engineering into early acquisition processes, and developing and managing a technical workforce with the expertise to uniformly implement OSD and Air Force engineering guidance and policies. These efforts provide stability in Air Force Acquisition by integrating major processes to reverse trends toward unpredictable program cost, schedule, and performance to facilitate quick response to urgent operational needs from across the entire spectrum of potential conflicts. These integrated capabilities will provide OSD and AF acquisition leadership insights needed to effectively manage a complex portfolio of acquisition programs through more timely and reliable access to authoritative acquisition data.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>In FY2014, Project 66ACS1 efforts were transferred to Project 66ACSI to consolidate and streamline efforts for Performance Measures, Technical and Analytical Support, and Recruiting and Development.

The program funds efforts to meet the Defense Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act (DAWIA), as well as Congressional, SECDEF, and SECAF mandates to provide program management execution tools, systems integration and architectural analysis, information technology infrastructure development, and technical workforce management.  Funding also provides the framework for Air Force business and acquisition transformation in developing capabilities-based architectures, re-engineering and enabling technologies, integrating robust systems engineering into early acquisition processes, and developing and managing a technical workforce with the expertise to uniformly implement OSD and Air Force engineering guidance and policies. These efforts provide stability in Air Force Acquisition by integrating major processes to reverse trends toward unpredictable program cost, schedule, and performance to facilitate quick response to urgent operational needs from across the entire spectrum of potential conflicts. These integrated capabilities will provide OSD and AF acquisition leadership insights needed to effectively manage a complex portfolio of acquisition programs through more timely and reliable access to authoritative acquisition data.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The mission of this program is to establish, sustain, expand, and enhance mutually beneficial international partnerships through the implementation of air, space, and cyber international armament cooperation (IAC) agreements thereby supporting USAF and DoD goals and objectives.  These International Agreements (IAs) will significantly improve US and allied conventional defense capacity and capabilities; accelerate the availability of defense systems; realize solutions to meet capability gaps; acquire, upgrade, sustain, and/or support common or interoperable equipment with our allies; create cooperative acquisition, production, or logistic partnerships; promote mutual and equitable sharing of effort, cost, information, and risk; provide operational access; leverage economies of scale; and promote interoperability and commonality with our allies. 

The USAF is party to numerous air, space, and cyber bilateral and multilateral IAs to solve common US and allied military capability gaps, develop materiel solutions, harmonize requirements, and build interoperability with our international partners.  This program element funds the USAF to identify, develop, process, negotiate, implement, manage, and conclude IAs in compliance with statutory provisions, legal authorities, fiscal constraints, technology transfer controls, intellectual property rights, third party transfer provisions, equitability criteria, industrial base factors, and political-military interests.  Included in this program are air, space, and cyber international armaments cooperation; technology assessment; specialized working groups; Air Senior National Representative (ASNR) activities; IAC program and project reviews; bilateral and multilateral staff talks; activities associated with air, space, and cyber IAs; Engineering and Scientist Exchange Program (ESEP); and Administrative and Professional Exchange Program (APEP).  These funds are not to be used for civilian salaries or the construction of permanent facilities.

This program is in Budget Activity 6, Management and Support, because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

These International Agreements (IAs) will significantly improve US and allied conventional defense capacity and capabilities; accelerate the availability of defense systems; realize solutions to meet capability gaps; acquire, upgrade, sustain, and/or support common or interoperable equipment with our allies; create cooperative acquisition, production, or logistic partnerships; promote mutual and equitable sharing of effort, cost, information, and risk; provide operational access; leverage economies of scale; and promote interoperability and commonality with our allies. 

The USAF is party to numerous air, space, and cyber bilateral and multilateral IAs to solve common US and allied military capability gaps, develop materiel solutions, harmonize requirements, and build interoperability with our international partners.  This program element funds the USAF to identify, develop, process, negotiate, implement, manage, and conclude IAs in compliance with statutory provisions, legal authorities, fiscal constraints, technology transfer controls, intellectual property rights, third party transfer provisions, equitability criteria, industrial base factors, and political-military interests.  Included in this program are air, space, and cyber international armaments cooperation; technology assessment; specialized working groups; Air Senior National Representative (ASNR) activities; IAC program and project reviews; bilateral and multilateral staff talks; activities associated with air, space, and cyber IAs; Engineering and Scientist Exchange Program (ESEP); and Administrative and Professional Exchange Program (APEP).  These funds are not to be used for civilian salaries or the construction of permanent facilities.

This program is in Budget Activity 6, Management and Support, because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>This program element is the only source of USAF funds to identify, develop, process, negotiate, implement, manage, and conclude international armaments cooperation (IAC) opportunities to: (a) acquire, develop, upgrade, sustain, and support common or interoperable equipment with our allies; (b) leverage USAF resources with our allies through cost sharing and economies of scale; (c) exploit the best US and allied technologies for equipping coalition forces; and (d) foster interoperability and commonality with our allies.  We obtain these benefits only after IAC opportunities are identified, explored, assessed, developed and IAs are negotiated and concluded.  This PE provides funds to execute up-front IAC responsibilities, realize cooperative opportunities, assess allied technologies and generate sound, cost-effective cooperative programs between the USAF and our international partners.  Once international agreemetns (IAs) are concluded they are transferred to the appropriate technology or systems program office and are then funded by the program office.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
