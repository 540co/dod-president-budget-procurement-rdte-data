DESCRIPTION:

(E96105) CTG 9MM MARKING, M1041 (BLUE) is used for force on force training engagements.  The cartridge can be fired with existing M9/M11 pistols with use of a conversion kit.  The M9 kit consists of a replacement barrel only.  The M11 kit consists of a replacement barrel and recoil spring guide.  A blue enameled portion of the M9 and M11 barrels is visible through the ejection port of the weapons.  The projectile leaves a mark upon impact (similar to paintball), enabling after action evaluation of training scenarios.  It differs from paintball in that it is a full complete cartridge with projectile and cartridge case containing a propulsion system for a low velocity launch.  The M1041 is required to hit targets accurately out to 12 meters.  The cartridge has been safety certified to be fired in close proximity at properly protected human subjects.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.

The M9 kit consists of a replacement barrel only.  The M11 kit consists of a replacement barrel and recoil spring guide.  A blue enameled portion of the M9 and M11 barrels is visible through the ejection port of the weapons.  The projectile leaves a mark upon impact (similar to paintball), enabling after action evaluation of training scenarios.  It differs from paintball in that it is a full complete cartridge with projectile and cartridge case containing a propulsion system for a low velocity launch.  The M1041 is required to hit targets accurately out to 12 meters.  The cartridge has been safety certified to be fired in close proximity at properly protected human subjects.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E05218) CTG MODULAR HANDGUN SYSTEM AMMUNITION consists of four cartridges – Ball, Jacketed Hollow Point (JHP), Short Range Training (SRTA), and Drilled Dummy Inert (DDI).  The Ball cartridge is intended for use against enemy personnel, for training, and for force protection.  The JHP cartridge is required for use in situations where limited over-penetration of targets is necessary to reduce collateral damage.  The JHP is not a combat or training round.  Its use is restricted to Army law enforcement in the Continental U.S., Hawaii, Alaska, and U.S. Territories.  SRTA cartridges are used solely for training on range restricted ranges.  DDI cartridges are completely inert.  They are plated and drilled for easy identification and used for training and weapon familiarization.  This item is Code B, not approved for service use.

(E05217) CTG, 9MM SINGLE ROUND, Dummy Drill and Inert (DDI), M917A1 ammunition cartridge is an inert (no energetic) dummy round used as an ammunition training aid and for weapon familiarization.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.  

(E05210) CTG 9MM BALL M882 (Combat Pack) cartridge contains a bullet comprised of a copper alloy jacket and a lead alloy core.  The cartridge is identified by the plain bullet tip.  The ammunition complies with NATO STANAG 4090 and is packed in military type packaging.  It is used in M9 and M11 pistols.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.

            <proc:Description>This budget line includes 20MM ALL TYPES:

(E08909) The 20MM Multi-Purpose Tracer - Self-Destruct (MPT-SD) cartridge is an improved, fuzeless, pyrotechnically initiated 20mm High Explosive cartridge.  The projectile consists of a heavy walled steel body charged with an explosive mix and an incendiary mix.  The M940 is currently being employed as a force protection munition in the M61 cannon of the Land Based Phalanx Weapon System (LPWS) for Counter-Rocket, Artillery and Mortar (C-RAM).  It is effective against light armor at 1,000 meters and against airborne and light surface targets at 2,000 meters.  The projectile self destructs at 2,300 meters, minimizing collateral surface damage when engaging airborne targets.  The M940 replaced the M246 High Explosive Incendiary-Tracer, Self Destroying (HEI-T-SD) as the primary air defense cartridge.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>This is a training standard item used in both training and combat. 

The procurement supports annual training and builds a war reserve inventory in accordance with the Army's procurement goals.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>This budget line includes 25MM ALL TYPES:

(E08203) The 25MM M793 Target Practice - Tracer Cartridge is a ballistically matched training round that simulates the M792 25mm High Explosive Incendiary - Tracer Cartridge and the MK210 High Explosive Incendiary - Tracer Cartridge.  The M793 supports gunnery training for the Army's Bradley Fighting Vehicles, the United States Marine Corps Light Armored Vehicles, and the Navy's MK38 Deck Gun.  The M793 is a percussion primed round.  It is packed for the Army and USMC in linked belts of 30 cartridges per PA125 Container.  It is packed for the Navy in linked belts of 55 cartridges in the CNU405 Container.  The M28 metal link is used to belt M793 cartridges.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E08204) The 25MM M910 Target Practice Discarding Sabot-Tracer cartridge is a ballistically matched training round that simulates the M791 25mm Armor Piercing Discarding Sabot-Tracer cartridge.  The M910 is also used as a training counterpart for the M919 25mm Armor Piercing Discarding Sabot Fin Stabilized-Traced cartridge, though the M910 cannot simulate the full range of the M919.  The M910 supports gunnery training for the Army's Bradley Fighting Vehicles and United States Marine Corps Light Armored Vehicles.  The M910 is a percussion primed round, packed in linked belts of 30 cartridges per PA125 container.  The M28 metal link is used to belt M910 cartridges.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E08209) The 25MM M794 is an inert training device.  It physically mimics 25mm M792, M793, MK210, PGU-23 and PGU-25 ammunition.  It is used for training of proper handling and loading of ammunition and for non-firing system training and checkout of 25mm weapons prior to exposing soldiers to live ammunition.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E74400) The 25MM HPT M846 is a High Pressure Test round used exclusively for acceptance testing of 25mm barrels.  One M846 is fired as a "proof" round on each new barrel. If the barrel does not rupture it is considered good for fielding.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E92500) The 25MM High Explosive Air Burst (HEAB), XM1083 is a programmable ammunition that is fired from the Individual Counter Defilade Weapon System.  The XM1083 HEAB features a mid body fuze with front and aft warheads that can be programmed to airburst at a designated range to defeat defilade targets.  The Individual Counter Defilade Weapon System dramatically increases lethality, range, and capability through the use of a family of low-velocity 25mm ammunition.  This item is code B, not approved for service use.

(E92510)  The 25MM XM1081 is the training cartridge for the XM1083 HEAB which is fired from the Individual Counter Defilade Weapon System. The XM1081 is a metal projectile with a propulsion system which ensures a ballistic match to the XM1083 HEAB for realistic training of the Individual Counter Defilade Weapon System. The Individual Counter Defilade Weapon System dramatically increases lethality, range, and capability through the use of a family of low-velocity 25mm ammunition. This item is code B, not approved for service use.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>This budget line includes 40MM ALL TYPES:

(E11800) The 40mm M430A1 is a High-Explosive Dual-Purpose cartridge (HEDP), and is fired from a MK19 Grenade Machine Gun at a max range of 2,200 meters.  It is capable of penetrating three inches of steel armor and inflicting personnel casualties in the target area.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.    

(E12502) The 40mm M385A1 practice cartridge is a fixed round of ammunition consisting of a one-piece solid aluminum projectile body with copper rotating band and is fired from a MK19 Grenade Machine Gun at a max range of 2,200 meters.  The cartridge is used as training ammunition.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.  

(E12601) The 40mm M433 is a High Explosive dual purpose impact type round designed to penetrate lightly armored targets and perform an anti-personnel mission, and is compatible with the M203, M320, and M79 Grenade Launchers.  Upon impact, the detonator triggers the spitback shaped charge and produces a jet blast that detonates the high explosive bursting charge.  Detonation of the bursting charge forms an armor-piercing jet of molten metal and fragmentation of the projectile body.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.  

(E74200) The 40mm Practice M781 is a training cartridge for the M203, M320, and M79 Grenade Launchers.  It is a fixed round of ammunition consisting of zinc-alloy projectile body with a rotating band and cartridge case assembly.  A hollow polystyrene ogive is filled with high visibility yellow-orange dye.  A .38 caliber blank cartridge is press-fitted into the base of the cartridge case and provides gas pressure needed to propel projectile through the launcher barrel.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.    

(E74315) The 40mm Practice M918/M385A1 Mixed Belt cartridge configuration for the MK19 Grenade Machine Gun is a high velocity training projectile with realistic signature effects providing sufficient flash, smoke and sound upon impact to be seen/heard out to 1,200 meters.  In addition to providing audible/visual signature for day or night firing, the mixed belt for MK19 Grenade Machine Gun will minimize hazards to troops in the training area.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.   

(E84500) The 40mm M992 cartridge is a fixed round of ammunition consisting of a projectile assembly and cartridge case assembly, compatible with the M203, M320, and M79 Grenade Launchers.  The body contains a pyrotechnic flare candle and is attached to a parachute.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E05611) The 40mm High Velocity Day Night Thermal cartridge is a training cartridge for the Mk19 Grenade Machine Gun.  This is a fixed round of ammunition consisting of a projectile assembly and cartridge case assembly.  The projectile ogive is filled with a signature material that provides a signature upon impact that can be seen, day or night with unaided eye, thermal and night vision weapon sights.  The cartridge does not contain any fuzing eliminating unexploded ordnance issues on the training ranges due to non-functioning training ammunition.  This item is code B, not approved for service use.

(E05610) The 40mm Low Velocity Day Night Thermal cartridge is a training cartridge for the M203, M320 and M79 Grenade Launchers.  
This is a fixed round of ammunition consisting of a projectile assembly and cartridge case assembly.

            <proc:Description>(E89600)60MM Mortar, All Types
This line includes 60mm Mortar Ammunition, All Types.

The 60mm Mortar cartridges are designed for use with the M224A1 Lightweight Company Mortar System (LWCMS) in all light infantry battalions including Airborne, Air Assault and Ranger. The short minimum range of the M224 makes the 60mm mortar ammunition well suited for close protective fires against an assaulting enemy, for block-to-block fighting in cities, and combat over close terrain with restricted visibility.  

(E70400)CTG, MORTAR, 60MM ILLUM VL M721 W/MTSQ FUZE
The M721 cartridge is a fin stabilized, mortar cartridge that consists of a M776 Mechanical Time Superquick (MTSQ) fuze, a thin wall steel body tube and aluminum tail cone that contains the payload (parachute and canister), and a fin assembly that contains the ignition cartridge and propelling charges.  The payload is base ejected and upon ignition produces visible light illumination. This visible light illumination allows for monitoring of enemy activities and adjustment of fire at greater observation distances during night operations. It also provides a means for day/night signaling.  It is particularly useful in combined operations with allies who may not have night vision devices (NVDs). The M721/M767 Illumination Cartridges (Range 200 meter minimum to 3,200 meter maximum) are ballistically similar to the M720A1 HE Cartridge, allowing a gun to illuminate and fire on the same target without adjustments. 
These items are Code A, approved for service use.

(E85700)CTG, MORTAR, 60MM ILLUM IR M767 SERIES W/MTSQ FUZE
The M767 cartridge is a fin stabilized, mortar cartridge that consists of a M776 Mechanical Time Superquick (MTSQ) fuze, a thin wall steel body tube and aluminum tail cone that contains the payload (parachute and canister), and a fin assembly that contains the ignition cartridge and propelling charges.  The payload is base ejected and upon ignition produces infrared (IR) illumination. The advantage of the infrared over conventional illumination is that there is minimal visible light. This reduces the possibility of exposing forward friendly troop positions while also allowing covert adjustment of fire at greater observation distances through use of passive Night Vision Devices (NVD). The M721/M767 Illumination Cartridges (Range 300 meter minimum to 3,175 meter maximum) are ballistically similar to the M720A1 HE Cartridge, allowing a gun to illuminate and fire on the same target without adjustments. 
This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E72199)CTG, MORTAR 60MM HE EnFrag M1061 (IM) W/M734A1 MOF
The M1061, 60mm High Explosive Enhanced Fragmentation (EF) cartridge with multi-option fuze is used against personnel and a higher category of materiel target sets providing both fragmentation and blast effect.  This round uses the insensitive main charge explosive PBNX-110.  Lethality is maintained by an enhanced fragmentation warhead.  The M1061 EF uses the highly reliable and countermeasure resistant M734A1 multi-option fuze.  When the fuze is set in the proximity mode, it functions at a height over the target that is optimized for lethality.  
The M1061 is Code A, approved for service use.

(E93900)CTG, MORTAR, 60MM HE M720 SERIES W/MOFM
The M720A1 60mm High Explosive Cartridge with Multi-Option Fuze is used against personnel and materiel providing both fragmentation and blast effects. The 60mm High Explosive Cartridges (Range 70 meter minimum to 3,400 meter maximum) are Insensitive Munitions (IM) enhanced, HE rounds.  Lethality is maintained by using a high fragmentation steel (HF-1) shell body loaded with approximately 2lbs. of an IM explosive. The M720A1 also incorporates the highly reliable and countermeasure resistant M734A1 multi-option fuze. When the fuze is set in the proximity mode, it functions at a height over the target that is optimized for lethality.
This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E92900)CTG MORTAR 60MM HE M768 W/PD FUZE
The 60mm High Explosive Cartridges are Insensitive Munitions (IM) enhanced, HE rounds. The M786 High Explosive cartridge (Range 70 meter minimum to 3,400 meter maximum) is used with the new M783 dual safety, point detonating/delay fuze, tail fin assembly, and high fragmentation steel (HF-1) shell body loaded with approximately 2lbs. of an IM explosive. This round is used primarily in training because it is significantly less expensive than the M720A1, the preferred war fighting round. However, the M768 is lethal and can be used in combat.
This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E92200)CTG Mortar 60MM FRPC M769 SERIES W/PRACTICE FUZE
The M769 is a low-cost, full range, practice round that will replace a percentage of the standard HE rounds used in 60mm mortar training. The M769 FRPC (Range 70 meter minimum to 3,500 meter maximum) has been designed to provide the user with realistic training at a fraction of the cost. It is identical in shape, size and weight to the M720/M720A1 HE cartridges. The flash, bang and smoke signature provided by the M775 fuze is channeled to exhaust holes in the rear of the cartridge through the use of a center vent tube.
This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E98600)CTG, Mortar, 60MM WP SMOKE M722 SERIES W/PD FUZE
The M722A1 60mm Smoke cartridge is designed as a spotting/marking round. The steel projectile is bulk loaded with white phosphorous. When the fuze functions, it detonates the M85 burster, which ruptures the projectile and disperses the white phosphorus. The M722A1 WP Smoke ((Range 200 meter minimum to 3,200 meter maximum) replaced the M745 mechanical point-detonating fuze with the reliable, safe, and cost effective electronic M783 Point Detonating (PD) and Delay (DLY) fuze.
This item is Code A, approved for service use.</proc:Description>

            </proc:ResourceSummary>
            <proc:Description>This budget line includes 81mm Mortar Ammunition, All Types.
The 81mm Mortar cartridges are designed for use with the M252 Mortar Weapon System used by the Stryker Brigade Combat Teams as well as light infantry battalions including Airborne, Air Assault and Ranger.  

(E18403)CTG, MORTAR, 81MM HE M821 W/MOFM 
The 81mm High Explosive Cartridges are Insensitive Munitions (IM) enhanced, HE rounds. The 81mm HE Cartridges consist of a fuze, a threaded plastic fuze adapter, a HF-1 steel projectile body loaded with approximately 3lbs. of IMX-104 explosive, a plastic obturating ring, a M24 Fin, the M220 Propelling Charges, and a M299 Ignition Cartridge. The M821A2 HE (Range 70 meter minimum to 5,859 meter maximum) also incorporates the highly reliable and countermeasure resistant M734A1 multi-option fuze. When the fuze is set in the proximity mode, it functions at a height over the target that is optimized for lethality.
IM features of this cartridge reduce the vulnerability to unplanned stimuli, e.g. fire/heat, shock and impact, while maintaining or exceeding the same level of effectiveness in combat.
These items are Code A, approved for service use.

(E18404)CTG, MORTAR, 81MM HE M889 SERIES W/PD FUZE 
The 81mm High Explosive Cartridges are Insensitive Munitions (IM) enhanced, HE rounds. The 81mm HE Cartridges consist of a fuze, a threaded plastic fuze adapter, a HF-1 steel projectile body loaded with approximately 3lbs. of IMX-104 explosive, a plastic obturating ring, a M24 Fin, the M220 Propelling Charges, and a M299 Ignition Cartridge. The M889A2 HE (Range 70 meter minimum to 5,859 meter maximum) is used with the new M783 dual safety, point detonating/delay fuze.  This round is used primarily in training because it is significantly less expensive than the M821A2, the preferred war fighting round. However, the M889A2 is lethal and can be used in combat.
IM features of this cartridge reduce the vulnerability to unplanned stimuli, e.g. fire/heat, shock and impact, while maintaining or exceeding the same level of effectiveness in combat.
These items are Code A, approved for service use.

(E69600)CTG, MORTAR, 81MM FRPC M879 SERIES W/PRACTICE FUZE
The M879 is a low-cost, full range, practice round that will replace a percentage of the standard HE rounds used in 81mm mortar training. The M879 FRPC (Range 70 meter minimum to 5,800 meter maximum) has been designed to provide the user with realistic training at a fraction of the cost. It is identical in shape, size and weight to the M889A2/M821A2 HE cartridges. The flash, bang and smoke signature provided by the M751 fuze is channeled to exhaust holes in the rear of the cartridge through the use of a center vent tube.

(E76100)CTG, MORTAR, 81MM VL ILLUM M853 SERIES W/MTSQ FUZE
The M853A1 cartridge is a fin stabilized, mortar cartridge that consists of a M772 Mechanical Time Super Quick (MTSQ) fuze, a thin wall aluminum body tube and aluminum tail cone that contains the payload (parachute and canister), and a fin assembly that contains the ignition cartridge and propelling charges. The payload is base ejected and upon ignition produces visible light illumination. This visible light illumination allows for monitoring of enemy activities and adjustment of fire at greater observation distances during night operations. It also provides a means for day/night signaling. It is particularly useful in combined operations with allies who may not have night vision devices (NVDs). This round illuminates to the full range of the HE round, which allows adjustment of fire at any distance out to the maximum range. The M853A1 (Range 300 meter minimum and 5,050 maximum) is range-matched to the 81mm High Explosive (HE) and smoke cartridges.  
This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E76200)CTG, MORTAR, 81MM RP SMOKE M819 SERIES W/MTSQ FUZE
The M819 Cartridge is a fin stabilized thin wall steel body tube containing 28 palletized red phosphorous (RP) wedges; it uses the highly reliable M772 Mechanical Time Super Quick (MTSQ) fuze. After a set time delay, the RP wedges are ejected and dispersed on the target to quickly produce an obscuring smoke screen. A full screen can be developed with 3 rounds as opposed to 15 rounds with the M375 series WP cartridge that is used to create smoke screens to cover movement of troops and/or disrupt visibility of enemy forces.
This cartridge was modified to include Gas Absorbent Modules (GAMS) that absorb the phosphine gas emitted by the RP to keep the round stable.  The M819 (Range 300 meter minimum and 4,900 maximum) is range-matched to the 81mm High Explosive (HE) and Illum cartridges.

            <proc:Description>This budget line item includes 120mm Mortars, All Types.
The 120mm Mortar Cartridges are designed for use with the M120, 120mm Towed Mortar System and the M121, Carrier Mortar System. As well as use with the Brigade Combat Team Mortar System.
   
(E25502)CTG, MORTAR, 120MM HE M933 SERIES W/PD FUZE
The M933A1 120mm High Explosive (HE) cartridge with the M783 Point Detonating/ Delay (PD/DLY) Fuze is used against personnel, bunker and light materiel targets. It consists of a Steel Shell Body with Composition B fill, and aluminum M31 Fin Assembly. The propulsion system utilizes the M1020 Ignition Cartridge and four horseshoe-shaped, water- resistant M234 Propelling Charges. The M933A1 HE (Range 200 meter minimum to 7,200 meter maximum) is used with the new M783 dual safety, point detonating/delay fuze.  This round is used primarily in training because it is significantly less expensive than the M934A1, the preferred war fighting round. However, the M933A1 is lethal and can be used in combat.
This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E25507)CTG, MORTAR, 120MM FRPC M931 SERIES W/PRACT FUZE
The M931 is a low-cost, full range, practice round that will replace a percentage of the standard HE rounds used in 120mm mortar training. The M931 FRPC (Range 200 meter minimum to 7,200 meter maximum) has been designed to provide the user with realistic training for 120mm Mortar crews at a fraction of the cost. It is identical in shape, size and weight to the M933A1/M934A1 HE cartridges.  The M931 is equipped with M781 PD Practice Fuze. The M781 PD Practice Fuze produces a flash, bang, and smoke signature that provides audio/visual feedback to the mortar crew and forward observer.
This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E91300)CTG, MORTAR, 120MM WP SMOKE M929 SERIES W/MOFM
 The M929 White Phosphorous (WP) Smoke Cartridge is used to provide smoke, with some incendiary effect for various screening missions. The cartridge is filled with 5 lbs of WP. The M929 uses the highly reliable and countermeasure resistant M734A1 multi-option fuze when functions, detonates the burster, which disperses the felt pads which are soaked with WP over the target.  The smoke obscuration is generated by a spontaneous reaction between the WP and oxygen.  The M929 (Range 200 meter minimum and 7,200 maximum) is range-matched to the 120mm High Explosive (HE) and Illum cartridges
This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E91400)CTG, MORTAR 120MM HE M934 SERIES W/MOFM
The Cartridge Mortar High Explosive (HE) M934A1 (Range 200 meter minimum and 7,200 maximum) is used against personnel and materiel providing both fragmentation and blast effect.  It consists of tail assembly, and projectile body with composition B explosive fill. The propulsion system utilizes the M1020 Ignition Cartridge and four horseshoe-shaped, water- resistant M234 Propelling Charges. The M934A1 (uses the highly reliable and countermeasure resistant M734A1 multi-option fuze.  The proximity setting will burst the round at a height over the target that is optimized for lethality. 
This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E91500)CTG, MORTAR, 120MM IR ILLUM M983 SERIES W/MTSQ
SYSTEM DESCRIPTION:
The M983 cartridge is ballistically similar to the M930 VL except for the chemical composition of the illuminating material, and provides a field of view equal or greater to that of the M930 VL cartridge. The M983 cartridge is a fin stabilized, mortar cartridge that consists of a M776 Mechanical Time Super Quick (MTSQ) fuze, a steel 2-piece shell body, and a fin assembly. The payload is base ejected. The advantage is that there is minimal visible light. This reduces the possibility of exposing forward friendly troop positions while also allowing covert adjustment of fire at greater observation distances through use of passive Night Vision Devices (NVDs). The M983 IR (Range 375 minimum to 6,675 meter maximum) illuminates to the full range of the M934A1 HE round.
This item is Code A, approved for service use.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>This budget line includes CARTRIDGE, TANK, 105MM and 120MM ALL TYPES:

(E22125) The M724A1E1 Cartridge will replace the (E22100) M724A1 Cartridge and provide the Army with a range limited (7,000 meters, maximum) round which can be safely fired at all training sites.  The Cartridge, M724A1E1, 105mm Target Practice Discarding Sabot with Tracer (TPDS-T) is used for gunnery training in the Army's 105mm Stryker Brigade Combat Team (SBCT) Mobile Gun System (MGS).  This discarding sabot round is similar in external appearance and is ballistically similar out to 2,000 meters with the M900, Armor Piercing Fin Stabilized Discarding Sabot w/Tracer Cartridge.  It is used as a training surrogate for the M900 Cartridge used by the MGS.  The M724A1E1 Cartridge consists of a deep drawn steel cartridge case, electric primer, propellant and a projectile consisting of a sub-projectile (steel core, windshield, fin and tracer) and aluminum sabot.  This item is Code B, not approved for service use.

(E73201) The Cartridge, 120mm, Target Practice Multi Purpose-Tracer (TPMP-T) M1002 is a target practice cartridge that simulates the size, weight, ballistics and the loader's function of setting the nose switch of the High Explosive Multi-Purpose cartridge M830A1.  This round is fired from the M256 120mm smoothbore cannon on the M1A1/M1A2 Abrams Tank.  The projectile is inert and composed of an aluminum body, steel nose with dummy plastic switch, aluminum tailcone, aluminum sabot, nylon obturators and tracer.  The tailcone imparts spin to the projectile in flight for stabilization and provides the mechanism to limit the projectile's maximum range.  The M1002 replaces the M831A1 cartridge.  Tank crews will conduct live fire training with the cartridge to achieve and maintain gunnery proficiency. This item is Code A, approved for service use. 

(E73300) The 120mm M831A1 Target Practice-Tracer (TP-T) is a target practice round that simulates the ballistics of the chemical energy service round (M830).  This round is fired from the M256 120mm smoothbore cannon on the M1A1/M1A2 Abrams tank.  The projectile is inert and is composed of a steel spike aluminum body, ring, stabilizer, nylon obturator and tracer.  The stabilizer imparts spin to the projectile in flight for stabilization and provides the mechanism to limit the projectile's maximum range.  The M831A1 is superseded by the M1002 cartridge.  Tank crews will conduct live fire training with the cartridge to achieve and maintain gunnery proficiency.  This item is Code A, approved for service use. 

(E73400) The 120mm M865 Target Practice Cone-Stabilized Discarding Sabot with Tracer (TPCSDS-T) is a target practice round that simulates the ballistics of the 120mm M829 Series Armor Piercing Fin-Stabilized Discarding Sabot with Tracer (APFSDS-T) round. This round is fired from the M256 120mm cannon on the M1A1/M1A2 Abrams tank.  The projectile is inert and is composed of a steel core, aluminum fin, aluminum sabots, nylon obturator and tracer.  The fin imparts spin to the projectile in flight for stabilization and provides the mechanism to limit the projectile's maximum range.  Tank crews will conduct live fire training with the cartridge to achieve and maintain gunnery proficiency. This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E88106) The 120mm M829E4 Armor Piercing Fin Stabilized, Discarding Sabot with Tracer (APFSDS-T) cartridge is the follow on to the M829A3 APFSDS-T cartridge.  The M829E4 is the most effective anti-armor kinetic energy cartridge fired from the M256 120mm smoothbore cannon mounted on the Abrams Main Battle Tank.  This cartridge has been designed to defeat advances in armor protection, specifically advancement in explosive reactive armor (ERA).  The cartridge incorporates advancements in propulsion, using a temperature insensitive propellant, novel penetrator design, and an advanced composite sabot.  The projectile system consists of a depleted uranium Penetrator mated to a drag reducing windshield and flight stabilizing multi-bladed fin, all secured for launch with a composite sabot.  The M829E4 captures several new technologies along with components previously used on previous APFSDS-T cartridge, but incorporates technology advancements to yield significant improvement in performance over previous fielded cartridges.  This item is Code B, not approved for service use.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>(E15101)Artillery Cartridges, 75MM And 105MM, All Types
This budget line includes Cartridge, Artillery, 75mm &amp; 105mm, All Types.

(E15200)CTG, ARTY, 75MM BLANK, M337A1
The 75mm M337A2 is a non-tactical blank cartridge fired from a M116 Howitzer that is used in burial, retreat ceremonies and VIP Salutes.  It consists of a cartridge case containing loosely packed black powder and a press-fitted percussion primer. A fiberglass wad is inserted over the black powder and a polystyrene closing cup is cemented in place with a polyester resin adhesive. When the firing pin of the weapon strikes the primer, a flash is generated which ignites the black powder charge producing flash, smoke, and a loud report to simulate weapon firing.
This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E21200)CTG, ARTY, 105MM BLANK M395
The 105mm M395 blank cartridge is a non-tactical cartridge fired from a M119 Series Towed Howitzer that is used in burial, retreat ceremonies and VIP Salutes as well as simulation of battlefield noise used for training exercises.  It is assembled with a loose 770 gram black powder charge retained by a glass-fibre closing wad and a polystyrene closing cup glued in place by an epoxy resin. The base of the case is fitted with an M61 percussion element and a primer. Detonation of the case contents creates sound, flash and smoke.
This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E21501)CTG, ARTY, 105MM HE, M1 W/O FUZE
The 105mm M1 High Explosive (HE) cartridge contains a HE fill and is used primarily for training although some cartridges are expended in combat operations for fragmentation and blast.  The cartridge is loaded with an M67 propellant charge, consisting of seven numbered increment bags sewn together in numerical order. Projectile function is dependent upon the fuze used and may function on impact (instantaneous or delay), above ground at a predetermined height or in proximity to the target area. Fuze function detonates the HE projectile filler resulting in projectile fragmentation and blast.  Range varies from 3.5 to 11.3 kilometers, depending on the number of charge bags used.  The program remanufactures/recapitalizes the remaining unserviceable cartridges through replacement of M67 Prop Charge and Primer at a reduced cost over new production to provide a cost effective training cartridge. This item is Code A, approved for service use.
Funding for the 105MM HE, M1 program in FY2013 and FY2014 is for new production and recapitalization.  The  FY2014 funding completes new production to fill the war reserve. All funding for the M1 program in FY2015 is for recapitalization. 

(E21601)CTG, ARTY, 105MM HE-BB PFF M1130 W/O FUZE
The 105mm M1130 High Explosive (HE) cartridge fired from a M119 Series Towed Howitzer contains a HE fill and is used in combat operations for missions that are fired at a maximum range of 13.5 kilometers and high quadrant elevation.  Firing rounds at high quadrant elevation is required to engage targets beyond the tall crests of mountainous terrain.  The M1130 is a semi-fixed cartridge composed of the M14 Cartridge Case, M28B2 Percussion Primer, M67 Propelling Charge and a Base Bleed. The cartridge warhead is composed of natural fragmenting steel with an inner liner that provides increased lethality against personnel and soft targets as well as increased accuracy due to its aerodynamic shape.  The cartridge also consists of insensitive munition (IM) explosive filler that reduces vulnerability to unplanned stimuli.  The M1130 Cartridge is compatible with the M782 MOFA and the M767ETSQ series fuzes.
This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E21610)CTG, ARTY, 105MM HE-BB PFF M1130A1 W/O FUZE
The 105mm M1130A1 High Explosive (HE) cartridge fired from a M119 Series Towed Howitzer contains a HE fill and is primarily used in combat operations for missions that are fired at long range (maximum range is 17.5 kilometers) and high quadrant elevation.  Firing rounds at high quadrant elevation is required to engage targets beyond the tall crests of mountainous terrain.  The projectile warhead is composed of natural fragmenting steel with an inner liner that provides increased lethality against personnel and soft targets as well as increased accuracy due to its aerodynamic shape.  The cartridge also consists of insensitive munition (IM) explosive filler that reduces vulnerability to unplanned stimuli.  The M1130A1 Cartridge is compatible with the M782 MOFA and the M767ETSQ series fuzes. The program upgrades current M1130 cartridges by replacing the M67 propellant with the M350 propellant that extends the range an additional 4 kilomieters.  
This item is Code B, not approved for service use.

(E21705)CTG, ARTY, 105MM IR ILLUM M1064 W/O FUZE
The 105mm M1064 Infrared (IR) Illuminating Cartridge is compatible with the M762 series ET fuze, M67 propelling charge, and is packaged in the PA117 Shipping Container. The XM1064 consists of a 40 gram expelling charge, illuminant canister and parachute assembly. Upon fuze function, the expelling charge simultaneously ignites the illuminate while ejecting it from the projectile. Once dispensed, fins on the canister assist in reducing the spin rate while the parachute provides a descent rate of 12 m/s. The Infrared Illumination greatly enhances the effectiveness of night vision devices providing front line units with temporary battlefield infrared illumination to observe the movements and maneuvers of enemy forces under the cover of darkness.
The item is Code A approved for service use.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>(E89500)ARTILLERY PROJECTILE, 155MM, ALL TYPES
This budget line includes Projectiles, Artillery, 155mm, All Types.  
(E21618)PROJ, ARTY, 155MM EXT RANGE MARKING RD M110A3
The 155mm Smoke White Phosphorous (WP) M110A3 Artillery Round utilizes projectile bodies generated from the current M483 Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munition (DPICM) demilitarization program and incorporates a more producible WP Bulk-filled Canister with 15.0 lbs of WP that provides smoke spotting capability to a maximum range of 22.5 kilometers providing increased operational effectiveness and improved training .  
This item is Code B, not approved for service use.
(E26904)Proj, Arty, 155MM IR ILLUM M1123
The 155mm M1123 Infrared Illumination projectile is used with night vision devices to illuminate a designated target area to a maximum range of 17.5 kilometers.  The projectile has a hollow, steel-forged body containing an illumination canister, a canister expelling charge in the nose and a drogue parachute in the base.  The illumination canister contains the main parachute and lines, the illumination candle assembly and secondary expelling charge and a delay element holder.  The outer shell of the canister is fitted with four longitudinal fins.  The projectile uses an Electronic Time Fuze.  When the fuze functions, the primary expelling charge ignites forcing the drogue parachute and canister assembly against the base plate, rupturing the base pins and expelling the canister and parachute.  The drogue parachute deploys and the canister fins extend.  The expelling charge also ignites the delay element in the canister nose.  The delay element ignites the secondary expelling charge within the canister after 8 seconds igniting the candle and expelling the main parachute.  With the main parachute open, the illuminate candle descends at 15 feet per second and burns for 120 seconds.  The M1123 Provides Infrared battlefield illumination that is 2.4x larger in diameter than the M1066 Infrared Illuminating projectile.
This item is Code A, approved for service use.
(E26904)PROJ, ARTY, 155MM VL ILLUM M1124
The 155MM Visual Light Illumination M1124 fired from 155mm howitzers is used to illuminate the battlefield to a maximum range of 17.5 kilometers.  The projectile has a hollow, steel-forged body containing an illumination canister, a canister expelling charge in the nose and a drogue parachute in the base.  The illuminate canister contains the main parachute and lines, the illuminate candle assembly and secondary expelling charge and a delay element holder.  The outer shell of the canister is fitted with four longitudinal fins.  The projectile uses a Mechanical or Electronic Time fuze.  When the fuze functions, the primary expelling charge ignites forcing the drogue parachute and canister assembly against the base plate, rupturing the base pins and expelling the canister and parachute.  The drogue parachute then deploys and the canister fins extend.  The expelling charge also ignites the delay element in the canister nose.  The delay element ignites the secondary expelling charge within the canister after 8 seconds igniting the candle and expelling the main parachute.  With the main parachute open, the illumination candle descends at 15 feet per second and burns for 120 seconds producing approximately 1,000,000 candlepower.  
This item is Code A, approved for service use.
(E27603)PROJ, ARTY, 155MM HE IM TRAINING M1122
The 155mm M1122 High Explosive (HE) projectile will be the primary HE round used for training. The M1122 is a lower cost HE training round. The M1122 will replace the M804A1 and M107 Projectiles for training.  It utilizes M483A1 DPICM metal parts from an ongoing M483A1 demil effort, is filled with high density concrete to simulate the weight of the M795 HE Projectile, and incorporates several Insensitive Munitions (IM) technologies (IMX-101 explosive fill, PBXN-9 Supplementary Charge, Meltable Fuze Well Liner and Meltable Fuze Plug) to increase survivability and safety.  The M1122 will replicate the flight characteristics of the wartime M795 HE projectile with a maximum range of 22.5 kilometers.
This item is Code A, approved for service use.
(E66800)PROJ, ARTY, 155MM HE, M795
The M795 High Explosive (HE) Projectile is the primary HE round used for warfare operations with maximum range of 22.5 kilometers.  The M795 incorporates Insensitive Munitions (IM) technologies that reduces vulnerability from unplanned stimuli e.g. fire/heat, shock and impact, while maintaining or exceeding the same level of effectiveness in combat.  The 155mm M795 has a high fragmentation steel (HF1) body projectile filled with 23.8 pounds of IMX101 Explosive fill, PBXN-9 Supplementary Charge, and Meltable Fuze Plug.  The projectile can use several different fuzes (impact, mechanical time, electronic time and short intrusion proximity).  It is used for conventional fire support for harassment and interdiction, fragmentation and blast effect.    The M795 projectile is employed against personnel, trucks, electronic surveillance and target acquisition devices, supply points, command and control and communications (C3) installations, and mechanized and armored forces.
This item is Code A, approved for service use.
(E67800)PROJ, ARTY, 155MM WP SMOKE M825
The 155mm WP M825A1 is an improved artillery projectile which produces a ground screening smoke cloud 125-150 meters wide for 5-10 minutes.  This smoke screen is produced by burning multiple wedge-shaped pieces of felt saturated with White Phosphorous (WP).  The system consists principally of a projectile carrier and Canister containing 116 WP felt wedges and a center core Burster. Projectile carrier is comprised of an Ogive, Expulsion Charge, modified all steel body, and a one-piece steel dome shaped base.  Upon M762/M762A1 ET fuze function, the Expulsion Charge is initiated which simultaneously dispenses the Canister and ignites a short delay. This delay provides ample time for Canister and projectile body separation prior to functioning of the center core Burster which ruptures the Canister and disperses 116 WP felt wedges. In less than 45 seconds, a dense and uniform smoke screen is created by burning of the WP. This projectile is shipped with a fusible lifting plug which protects the item during shipping, handling, and storage.  
This item is Code A, approved for service use.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>This budget line item includes the Excalibur family of munitions for the use in the M777A2 Lightweight 155mm Howitzer (LW155), the M109A6 Paladin Howitzer, and the Swedish Archer Howitzer.

Excalibur is a Precision Guided Extended Range 155mm Artillery projectile providing Brigade Combat Teams an organic precision fires capability. Additionally it provides improved fire support capability due to its increased range of 40.5 kilometers and demonstrated accuracy of &lt;4 meters radial miss distances, which enables a first round effect on target reducing the number of rounds required while reducing collateral damage. Excalibur is compatible with the M777A2 Lightweight 155mm Howitzer (LW155), the M109A6 Paladin Howitzer, and the Swedish Archer Howitzer. Excalibur provides a 35% range increase over current Rocket Assisted Projectiles with a &lt;10 meter circular error probable requirement at all ranges. Excalibur is also highly resistant to Global Positioning System (GPS) jamming. This item is Code A, approved for service use.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2015 Base Budget supports critical Army Title 10 war reserve/operational, training, and test requirements IAW DoD Instruction 3000.04 (Munitions Requirements Process) and AR 5-13 (Total Army Munitions Requirements Process and Prioritization System). War reserve requirements support OSD-approved Combatant Commander Operational Plans, Homeland Defense, and other OSD-directed missions. Training requirements support individual and collective training of Active and Reserve Component forces at Army schools, home station, and the combined training centers. Test requirements support the development, fielding, safety, and quality assurance of Army munitions and equipment throughout their life-cycle.

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.

Excalibur Increments Ia-1 and Ia-2 are currently fielded and in use by units throughout Afghanistan and deployed globally to support other Military Contingency Operations. Excalibur is an International Cooperative Development program, teamed with the Kingdom of Sweden (KoS), which contributed resources towards the development in accordance with an established Project Agreement. Excalibur Increment Ia-1 was initially fielded to units in Iraq and Afghanistan in response to an urgent need request in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (as of September 2010 re-named to Operation New Dawn) and Operation Enduring Freedom. Increment Ia-2 was fielded in early FY 2012 and greatly increases range from 25.2 kilometers to 40.5 kilometers. The Excalibur guided projectile program is using an incremental development approach to provide a combat capability to the Soldier as quickly as possible while delivering advanced capabilities at lower costs. Excalibur Increment Ib will provide further performance improvements while significantly lowering unit costs. 

Increment Ib completed a successful Milestone C Decision Review on December 12, 2012. The first Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) contract was awarded on December 21, 2012, second LRIP option was awarded August 26, 2013 and third LRIP option was awarded December 16, 2013.

This is a war reserve item currently being used in combat. The FY 2015 request builds a war reserve inventory in accordance with the Army procurement goals. FY 2015 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $35.672 million supports the procurement of 416 Increment Ib projectiles.</proc:Justification>

(E27502)ARTY, 155MM PROP CHG, MACS M231 SERIES
The Modular Artillery Charge System (MACS) M231 "Low Zone" is intended for use with all United States 155mm cannon field artillery systems.  The M231 is designed to achieve ranges from 3 to 11 kilometers. Each MACS increment includes propellant, an ignition system, and a combustible case.  Packaging permits long-term storage and helps protect the items from unplanned stimuli.  
This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(ER8021)ARTY, 155MM PROP CHG, MACS M232 SERIES
The Modular Artillery Charge System (MACS) M232 "High Zone" is intended for use with all United States 155mm cannon field artillery systems.  The M232 "High Zone" increment is designed to achieve ranges from 10 to 40 kilometers.  Each MACS increment includes propellant, an ignition system, and a combustible case.  Performance enhancing additives are included in the M232 "High Zone" increment.  Packaging permits long-term storage and helps protect the items from unplanned stimuli.  
This item is Code A, approved for service use

(E62208)ARTY, FUZE PD M739A1
The M739A1 Point Detonating (PD) and Delay Fuze is the Army's preferred, primary fuze for 105mm and 155mm projectiles to address point detonating/delay artillery functions. The M739A1 fuze contains an Impact Delay Module (IDM) assembly.  The IDM provides fuze initiation delay based upon the completion of mechanical actions caused by projectile deceleration and will function immediately after passing through the target.
This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E99250)ARTY, FUZE, PRECISION GUIDANCE KIT (PGK)
The Precision Guidance Kit (PGK) is a Global Positioning System (GPS) guidance kit with point detonating and height of burst fuzing functions. PGK provides near precision accuracy and efficiency for 155mm M795 and M549A1 high explosive (HE) projectiles. Using an integrated GPS receiver, the PGK corrects the inherent errors associated with ballistic firing solutions and reduces the number of projectiles required to execute fire missions. This item is Code A, approved for service use.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>This budget line includes Mines and Mine Clearing Charges, All Types.

E39315 Mine Anti-Personnel M18A1 W/Non-Electric Ignition System (Claymore) is a command detonated munition used mainly to protect defensive positions.  It contains 1.5 pounds of C-4 that projects 700 steel fragments in a fan shaped, 60-degree horizontal arc.  It is initiated with a non-electric Mini Detonator Assembly.  The Claymore may be employed with obstacles or on approaches, forward edges, and flanks as close-in protection against a dismounted infantry attack.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.

E75101 Mine Clearing Line Charge M58 Series (MICLIC) is a rocket propelled explosive line charge mounted on a standard military trailer.  The line charge is propelled over the minefield by the rocket and detonated, clearing a one vehicle wide lane 100 meter long, 8 meters wide.  The MICLIC is effective against single pulse, pressure fuzed mines.  The line charge does not defeat blast hardened or complex fused mines.  The M58 is being actively used in Combat Engineering Operations.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.

E78310 Cutter, Line for Assault Breaching Vehicle is the hardware needed to adapt the M58 Mine Clearing Line Charge (MICLIC) to the Assault Breaching Vehicle, which was fielded July 2011.  The modification hardware consists of an M1134A4 Fuze, arresting cable line cutter, Y cable accessory, and line cutter bracket.  The item separates the line charge from the vehicle after deployment, allowing the operator to remain safely inside an armored vehicle.  This item is Code B, not approved for service use.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>This budget line includes Anti-Personnel Landmine Alternatives (APLA), All Types.

E91700 Spider is a hand emplaced, remotely controlled, anti-personnel munition system that was designed to replace the capability of the persistent anti-personnel landmines banned from use after December 2010 per US Landmine policy.  Spider, as a Man-in-the-Loop system, offers numerous capabilities for asymmetric warfare focusing on the control of insurgents and small unit force protection.  The system is made up of 4 subsystems:  Man-in-the-Loop (the human operator), Remote Control Station (the system command and control station), Repeater (a communication link to the munitions that provides extended range), and Munition Control Units (delivers anti-personnel effects).  The Spider is designed to mitigate the indiscriminate initiation of the lethal mechanism.  A Soldier/Marine makes a conscious decision to engage a target with the lethal mechanism.  Spider's sensor capabilities and controlled munitions provide needed force protection and battlefield shaping.  Spider allows measured and graduated responses including sense only, non-lethal, and lethal modes.  Spider also supports net-centric operations by feeding situational awareness information (location and status) into the Battle Command system.  The Spider system with its many desirable features makes it a versatile weapon system that has significant utility across the full spectrum of military operations and will support current and future operations.  This item is Code A, approved for service use with Full Material Release and Type Classification Standard.  Type Classification Standard and Full Material Release were achieved in July and September 2013 respectively.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2015 Base Budget supports critical Army Title 10 war reserve/operational, training, and test requirements IAW DoD Instruction 3000.04 (Munitions Requirements Process) and AR 5-13 (Total Army Munitions Requirements Process and Prioritization System).  War reserve requirements support OSD-approved Combatant Commander Operational Plans, Homeland Defense, and other OSD-directed missions.  Training requirements support individual and collective training of Active and Reserve Component forces at Army schools, home station, and the combined training centers.  Test requirements support the development, fielding, safety, and quality assurance of Army munitions and equipment throughout their life-cycle.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>This budget line includes Shoulder Launched Munitions, All Types.

(E36901)ROCKET, PRACTICE, 21MM SUBCALIBER for Shoulder Launched Munitions (SLM) simulates the firing of unguided shoulder fired munitions.  It simulates the tactical munitions flight trajectory, but with less noise and backblast.  It is currently used by Navy and Marine Corps to simulate the M72 LAW.  It has also been adapted to the M141 Bunker Defeat Munition (BDM) and is used in New Equipment Training (NET)/Mobile Training Teams (MTT).  This item is Code A, approved for service use.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2015 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $.945 million supports procurement of 1 variant of Shoulder Launched Munitions.

FY 2015 Base Budget supports critical Army Title 10 war reserve/operational, training, and test requirements IAW DoD Instruction 3000.04 (Munitions Requirements Process) and AR 5-13 (Total Army Munitions Requirements Process and Prioritization System).  War reserve requirements support OSD-approved Combatant Commander Operational Plans, Homeland Defense, and other OSD-directed missions.  Training requirements support individual and collective training of Active and Reserve Component forces at Army schools, home station, and the combined training centers.  Test requirements support the development, fielding, safety, and quality assurance of Army munitions and equipment throughout their life-cycle.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>This budget line procures all Hydra 70 rocket types in support of operational, training and war reserve requirements.  The system provides combat overmatch capability and ensures the availability of munitions to support combat operations.  This system of aerial rockets is used by Army aircraft (AH-64A/D Apache, OH-58D Kiowa Warrior and Special Operations aircraft) to perform a number of roles including anti-materiel, anti-personnel, air-to-ground suppression and illumination.

NOTE:  QTY EA</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>The Hydra-70 Product Office is the procurement agent for all services for 2.75 Rockets.  This budget activity includes both training standard items and items that may be used in both training and combat.  The FY2015 procurement supports annual training and builds a war reserve inventory in accordance with the Army's procurement goals.  FY2015 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $27.286 million will procure 741 Hydra 70 rockets.  The Army intends to convert any price advantage created through contract negotiations, other service procurement, and/or Foreign Military Sale (FMS) into an increase of the Army's procurement of Hydra 70 Rockets.  Pricing in FY 14-19 is uncertain due to a planned competitive contract award in 3QFY14. The P-40/P-5 estimates are based on historical matrix pricing and will be updated once a contract has been awarded.  The FY15-19 funding profile is significantly below historical procurement levels which may adversely impact the industrial base.  

"In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities."</proc:Justification>

The block demolition charge consists of 1-1/4 pounds of composition C-4 plastic explosive packed in a Mylar-film bag.  Pressure sensitive adhesive tape is provided on one of the rectangular surfaces, allowing quick emplacement by the individual soldier on the object to be destroyed.  The explosive may be cut and/or removed from its wrapper and hand molded into a desired shape suited to the target.  Upon detonation, the shock wave destroys the target by cutting, breaching or cratering.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E50804) Trainer, Selectable Lightweight Attack Munition (SLAM) M320A1 simulates the controls and function of the M4A1 SLAM.  It is used to train soldiers in the safe handling and use of the tactical munition.  This item is Code B, not approved for service use.

(E51300) Charge Demolition Block Cratering 40 pound is a demolition charge designed to destroy roads, bridge abutments, runways, buildings, fortifications and other concrete structures.  It uses a low velocity explosive which destroys by a lifting and heaving motion rather than the cutting action of high velocity charges.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E51400) Charge Demolition Sheet 50 Foot Roll, M186 is a flexible explosive.  It is 3 inches wide and 1/4 inch thick.  It can be easily cut and formed into various shapes and is primarily used as a cutting charge.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E52500) Cap Blasting Electric M6 is used to initiate high explosives.  It is initiated by an electrical charge from a blasting machine or other source of electric power.  Blasting cap M6 consists of a base charge of RDX, an intermediate charge of lead azide and an ignition charge of smokeless powder, potassium chlorate and lead salt of dinitro cresol in an aluminum alloy cup.  Two 12-foot lead wires, connected by a bridge wire in the ignition charge, extend through a rubber plug assembly in the open end of the cup.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E53200) Charge Demolition Shaped M3 40 pound is used to blast craters in paved and unpaved roads and to bore holes in metals, masonry or concrete.  It contains a 15-inch stand-off, 29.5 pound Comp B main charge and a 0.11 pound Comp A3 booster.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E54100) Detonating Cord is used to prime and detonate explosive charges.  Unlike the time fuze, which burns slowly, detonating cord burns almost instantaneously.  It is used to link a series of near simultaneous charges.  The Type 1, Class E detonating cord consists of a core of high velocity explosive in a seamless textile tube.  The tube is covered with a thin layer of asphalt and sheathed in an outer cover of plastic coated textile.  The plastic outer cover is smooth and colored olive drab.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E60200) Cutter Cartridge Actuated 2 Second Delay M21 is a cartridge actuated device that is used in aerial delivery systems for cargo.  It severs a reefing line which allows a parachute to fully deploy.  The cutter is installed in a mounting bracket which is attached to the parachute.  Major components consist of a case, firing pin assembly, lanyard, knife assembly, delay assembly, and cotter pin.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E76718) Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) items for Percussion Actuated Non-electric (PAN) disrupter items are special 12-gauge cartridges for Standoff Disrupter Improvised Explosive Device (SD-IED) Tool (AKA "PAN Disrupter") that provide the EOD soldier with a set of cartridges specifically designed for disrupting various types of IEDs.  Various cartridges enable use against different types of IEDs, such as soft case, pipe bomb, or hard case.  These items are Code B, not approved for service use.

(E76728) MK 788-0, Main Charge Disrupter is a device used to render-safe unexploded ordnance (UXO).  Upon initiation, the device attacks and neutralizes the main charge explosive by generating reactions up to and including low-order detonations. It is a non-developmental item (NDI) consisting of an energetic tool (ET), a demolition material interface adapter, and an emplacement stand.   The MCD provides EOD with an improved neutralization capability in situations where the use of more traditional methods (attacking the fuzing mechanism or high-order detonation) is not possible or desired.  This item is Code B, not approved for service use.

(E81302) Cap Blasting Non-Elec, W/30 ft Shock Tube is part of the family of Modern Demolition Initiators (MDI).  It consists of a blasting cap which is factory sealed to a length of shock tube.  The tube is activated using an M81 igniter.  A shock wave travels the length of the tube, with a delay measured in milliseconds, and ignites the blasting cap which in turn initiates the main charge.  The MDI is not susceptible to electrostatic discharge or Radio Frequency (RF) jamming.  The 30 foot length is generally used as a linking charge for a series of demolitions.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E81307) Igniter, Time Fuze and Shock Tube, M81 is a device, hand held by the individual Soldier, with a small primer charge that will activate the M700 Time Fuze as well as a shock tube.  It is the primary device for all non-electrical demolition initiation.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E81310) Cap Blasting Inert, Non-Elect, Delay, M14 is an inert nondelay military sized blasting cap which is factory crimped to 7.5 feet of inert time fuze.  This component is a trainer for the M14 blasting cap which provides up to a five minute delay before initiation of charges or demolition devices to allow soldiers to achieve safe separation.  The M14 Inert is a member of the Modernized Demolition Initiators (MDI), a set of components which non-electrically initiates explosives using either shock-tube or low powered detonator cord which has been in commercial use for twenty years.  The new components are lighter, more reliable and easier to use.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E99800) Anti-Personnel Obstacle Breaching System (APOBS) Training Aid, Inert is a classroom training aid for the APOBS (E72800). It's appearance and weight are identical to the APOBS, but it is entirely non-functional and is only used to demonstrate proper set up of the system prior to firing.

(E49100)Flare, AC Countermeasure, M206 Magnesium Teflon IR
The M206 flares are part of a family of advanced IR decoy flares designed for use by Army helicopters and fixed wing aircraft to meet advanced threats in current and future operational environments.  This flare is a Magnesium Teflon Viton flare.  When used together with the M212, a spectrally matched flare, and the M211, a pyrophoric alloy material payload that reacts with air to emit intense IR radiation, it provides protection against a wide range of surface to air threats.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E88900)Flare AC Cntermeasure M211 Pyrophoric Msl IR Decoy
These flares are part of a family of advanced infrared (IR) decoy flares designed for use by Army helicopters and fixed wing aircraft to meet advanced threats in current and future operational environments.  The M211 uses a special high surface area metal foil, which rapidly oxidizes when exposed to oxygen.  When one of the flares is dispensed from the host aircraft, the special pyrophoric material payload reacts with air to emit intense IR radiation that is not visible to the naked eye.  The IR radiation diverts heat-seeking missiles away from the aircraft.  When used together with the M212, a spectrally matched flare, and the M206, a Magnesium Teflon Viton flare, the flares provide protection against a wide range of surface to air threats.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.

            <proc:Description>This budget line includes Simulators, All Types.

(E42801) M9 Simulator Projectile Airburst Liquid is used in training to provide a realistic chemical-biological defense system.  An electronic actuating charge propels the simulant-filled bottle into the air, then a one-second burn-through delay fuze sets off the burster charge at approximately a 30 foot or 50 foot height by a 150 foot width to disperse a vapor cloud spray, which triggers the chemical sensors by causing color changes to chemical agent detector paper; five projectors can be burst at the same time to increase the area.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E49700) M115A2 Artillery Ground Burst Simulator is a hand thrown device that is used in training to simulate battle noise and effects (shell in flight and ground explosion) during troop maneuvers.  The simulator has a 6-10 second delay followed by a 2-4 second whistle ending with a flash and loud report; the surface danger zone is 35 meters.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E49900) M117 Booby Trap Simulator is used in training to teach the installation, detection and use of booby traps, and to instill caution in troops exposed to traps set by the enemy.  The simulator is trip wire initiated and produces a flash and bang.  The surface danger zone is 6 feet.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E50000) M118 Booby Trap Simulator is used in training to teach the installation, detection and use of booby traps, and to instill caution in troops exposed to traps set by the enemy.

            <proc:Description>The Ammunition Peculiar Equipment (APE) program provides support for ammunition operations including surveillance, demilitarization (demil), maintenance, renovation, modification, packaging, and preservation per Army Regulation 700-20, Ammunition Peculiar Equipment.  APE is developed, acquired, maintained, and supervised through the Single Manager for Conventional Ammunition per DoD Instruction 5160.68.  APE provides unique, low-density equipment items specifically designed, fabricated, tested, procured, and adopted for use in worldwide United States (US) military ammunition depot operations on conventional ammunition.  APE maintains a central source of standard, modern, safe, efficient, reliable, and environmentally acceptable equipment for ammunition operations.  This equipment is different from production line plant equipment as it disassembles ammunition items into components, sorts, removes hazardous materials to reduce human interaction and improves personnel safety.  Maintenance APE is also designed to perform cleaning and renovation functions on ammunition subjected to deterioration effects (rust, corrosion, weathering, etc) during its storage life.  APE supporting surveillance is key to stockpile sampling and function tests of the items to assure readiness for combat or training.  Demilitarization APE is similar to maintenance APE but must go further in disassembly to destroy hazardous components, sort and reclaim salvageable parts or metals.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2015 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $14.906 million will support APE and replacement parts that must be on-hand to perform ammunition depot operations for conventional ammunition.  These operations cannot be accomplished if the required APE is not supplied in a timely manner.  The equipment is loaned to worldwide locations for the accomplishment of depot-type operations based on the ammunition requirements.  APE is required to support the Ammunition Stockpile Reliability Program, Surveillance Program, equipment for worldwide maintenance and demil, prepositioned ships, and Government-Owned, Contractor-Operated plants as Government Furnished Equipment for ammunition depot operations at those locations.  The APE assets maintain and verify the quality of the ammunition stockpile, thereby saving the cost of purchasing new replacement ammunition.  APE proficiently executes the ammunition demil mission to safely perform or support disassembly, destruction, or removal processes with an emphasis on recycling, re-utilization and preserving demil assets in a manner that supports ammunition sustainment, safety and environmental compliance.

The APE program provides essential major parts and equipment upgrades at the Demilitarization Facility (DEFAC) in the Republic of Korea (ROK).  A Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) was signed on 4 November 2011 by US Forces Korea and the ROK Ministry of National Defense, which permits the demilitarization of US titled munitions.  The DEFAC provides an environmentally safe means of demil for both US and ROK titled munitions, and the demil of US titled munitions at the DEFAC avoids significant retrograde shipment costs.  Current DEFAC operations meltout/demil US titled munitions for six months out of the year, and demil ROK titled munitions the other six months.  

The program provides global support to the US Military Services for ammunition sustainment and demil operations, including deployment, operations and support of the Ammunition Supply Point (ASP) suites.  The ASP suites include APE, which will increase the efficiency of the receipt, inspection and issuance of ammunition to the warfighter.  Deployment of APE to support ASP suites will increase efficiencies for ammunition sustainment operations by reducing logistics burdens and related risks allowing better primary mission readiness, enhanced hazardous operations safety and more efficient operating conditions requiring less ammunition retrograde/demil by providing capability to preserve ammunition assets.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>This budget line provides funding for modernization efforts at Government-Owned, Contractor-Operated Army Ammunition plants and commercial facilities, including replacement of obsolete or worn production equipment, correction of deficiencies and upgrade of infrastructures.  The Provision of Industrial Facilities (PIF) budget line also establishes, augments and improves ammunition production capabilities through strategic modernization efforts, expands production capacity, maintains environmental compliance, and improves quality of work environment and safety at ammunition plants, as well as emergency modernization and associated construction to address production disruptions at various sites.

This budget line provides funding for preservation, storage and movement of real property facilities and equipment required for anticipated future requirements at active and inactive Army ammunition installations, also known as Layaway of Industrial Facilities (LIF) activities.  Funding will also support consolidation of laid-away production equipment and redistribution of production equipment that cannot be stored on-site.  Laid-away efforts will also include retaining critical operational and technical knowledge of production equipment, such as engineering designs, process data and control manufacturing practices.  Efforts will also include safety-related decontamination, disposal and demolition of production equipment and facilities, and environmental site assessments.

Procurements funds will also support the Maintenance of Inactive Facilities (MIF) to include utilities, buildings, plant equipment, special tooling, and special test equipment being retained to support future production requirements.  Additional efforts include support of associated MIF costs such as grounds maintenance, fire protection, equipment security, and administrative support.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2015 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $148.092 million support modernization projects to include upgrades to the small caliber production lines at Lake City Army Ammunition Plant (AAP) and Line 3A Load Assemble and Pack (LAP) operations of Insensitive Munitions Explosive (IMX) projectiles at Iowa AAP, replacement of strong nitric acid storage tanks at Radford AAP, construction of a Nitric Acid Concentrator/ Sulfuric Acid Concentrator (NAC/SAC) facility at Holston AAP, as well as technology improvements at Scranton AAP.  Funds will support improvements to quality of work environment, enhancing personnel safety and health, and efforts to maintain environmental compliance at the ammunition plants.  Funds will also provide engineering support of industrial facilities, pre-design efforts for future years modernization projects and procurement efforts at Aberdeen and Yuma Test Centers to include production acceptance tests for various ammunition end items.

FY 2015 Base procurement dollars also support the protection and preservation of industrial facilities at active and inactive Army ammunition installations and equipment that are no longer required for current production but must be retained for future peacetime or emergency production needs.  These LIF efforts include reducing the industrial base footprint by demolishing facilities and equipment no longer required at Iowa and Lake City Army Ammunition Plants.

FY 2015 Base procurement dollars also support MIF efforts at active and inactive ammunition installations.</proc:Justification>

This facility will recover the spent acid used in IM Explosives (IMX)-101, IMX-104 manufacturing and other Dinitroanisole and Nitrotriazalone IMX bases.  This project will provide Holston AAP with the capability to reconcentrate spent nitric acid in order to avoid ammonia nitrate waste disposal costs.

Projectiles filled with Insensitive Munitions Explosives-101 (IMX-101) require a higher temperature preheat than with trinitrotoluene-based material.  The current oven configuration will not allow complete uniform projectile preheat or the ability to preheat IMX-101-filled projectiles.  The new oven will be capable of supporting both current and future production on Line 3A and reduce the preheat time of projectiles.</proc:NarrativeExplanation>

                            <proc:NarrativeExplanation>Procurement dollars in the amount of $0.778 million support the replacement of the waste treatment facility at Scranton Army Ammunition Plant (AAP).  The current waste treatment facility is approximately 20 years old and replacement parts are difficult to produce or not available.  The sand filter is ineffective which reduces the system efficiency.  A new sewer permit has reduced the effluent limit for Zinc, and the existing system has problems maintaining proper levels when less than three bonderizer systems are running.  This new treatment system will allow Scranton AAP to remain in compliance with the new sewer permit and avoid fines or penalties.</proc:NarrativeExplanation>

                            <proc:NarrativeExplanation>FY 2015 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $1.525 million replaces the analog video scoring and data collection system with a digital capability at the multipurpose impact firing range which is used for testing munitions; procures equipment for high explosive assembly, drilling, and remote capabilities for removing and replacing ammunition components; replaces aging magnetic particle equipment, gages, sensors and transducers for testing cannon tubes; and acquires precision, high-dynamic, rugged sensors to include displacement, pyro-shock/acceleration, Infrared flash detector, and pressure transducers.  The majority of the instrumentation being upgraded or replaced is obsolete and has met or exceeded its economic life.  This instrumentation is required to ensure complete and accurate test data is collected and safety and environmental hazards are minimized.  Benefits of this project include increased test efficiencies and decreased costs and risks to Army Program Managers.</proc:NarrativeExplanation>

                            <proc:Description>FY 2015 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $0.458 million support the care and maintenance of laid-away critical production facilities at Iowa Army Ammunition Plant.  They include periodic inspections of equipment and buildings, corrective maintenance to maintain weather-tightness of buildings, preservation touchup, asbestos management, and minimum maintenance of specialized production equipment.  These efforts are responsible for associated MIF costs and provide for monitoring of excess facilities until they can be disposed.  These efforts also provide for well monitoring at the inert landfill, trench 5, in order to comply with a signed consent agreement between the plant, State of Iowa and United States Environmental Protection Agency.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>The Conventional Munitions Demilitarization Program provides for the demilitarization (demil) and disposal of Single Manager for Conventional Ammunition (SMCA) conventional ammunition for all Military Services per DoD Directive 5160.65 and DoD Instruction 5160.68 that is unserviceable, obsolete, unsafe, or excess to requirements.  The program accomplishes demil using open burning/open detonation (OB/OD) processes or closed disposal technologies (CDT) with primary emphasis on resource recovery and recycling (R3).  This program also provides for operations and technical support and services; packaging, crating, handling, and transportation (PCHT) of ammunition for demil projects at United States Army depots, plants and activities; commercial contracts that provide CDT demil support and services, and international operations, which include the European and Pacific Theatres.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2015 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $113.881 million will support the demilitarization of conventional ammunition as well as missile and missile components for all Military Services.

FY 2015 funds will support the US demil operations of conventional ammunition in both Continental United States (CONUS) and Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS).  CONUS demil operations are performed by a combination of Government Owned, Government Operated (GOGO) depots, Government Owned, Contractor Operated (GOCO) depots as well as commercial contractors.  OCONUS demil operations are performed at Demilitarization Facilities (DEFACs) in the Republic of Korea and Japan as well as commercial contractors in the European Union. 

As of the end of September 2013, the conventional ammunition demil account contained 613,748 tons of ammunition in CONUS wholesale storage locations: 563,477 tons of conventional ammunition and 50,271 tons of missiles and/or missile components (msl/comp).  As of the end of September 2013, 71,480 tons of conventional ammunition were demilitarized with 65,000 tons planned for FY 2014.  As of the end of September 2013, 181,807 msl/comp have been demilitarized with 89,683 msl/comp planned for FY 2014.  

Stockpile growth and generations.  An estimated 116,373 tons of conventional ammunition will be generated into the SMCA Resource, Recovery and Disposition Account (B5A) in FY 2014 and 109,750 tons in FY 2015.  For FY 2016 through FY 2019, 403,698 tons of conventional ammunition are forecasted to be added into the B5A.  For missile demil, an estimated 105,779 msl/comp are planned for generations into the B5A in FY 2014 and 90,136 tons in FY 2015.  For FY 2016 through FY 2019, 115,829 msl/comp are forecasted to be added into the B5A.

Stockpile growth factors.  The demil stockpile is expected to grow as a result of Military Services generations and will also be driven by other factors such as cluster munitions, land mine policies and the disestablishment of War Reserve Stocks Allies (WRSA) accounts at OCONUS locations.  There are currently approximately 186,000 tons of cluster munitions in the demil stockpile.  To ensure compliance with the Cluster Muitions Policy, an additional 339,000 tons are expected to be added into the B5A no later than FY 2018.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>The Armament Retooling and Manufacturing Support (ARMS) program reuses idle capacity at active and inactive Government-Owned, Contractor-Operated (GOCO) Army Ammunition Plants and GOCO Army Depots through commercialization.  Congress enacted this program in the FY 1993 Defense Authorization Act (Public Law (PL) 102-484) and codified in FY 2000                     (10 U.S.C.4551-4555).  ARMS resources are used for facility strategic reuse plans, marketing plans, building renovation and recapitalization, equipment purchase, relocation, or consolidation, and environmental baseline studies to encourage commercial use of underutilized Army assets.  The ARMS objectives include sustaining critical manufacturing capabilities and critical skills; reducing facility operating and maintenance costs; decreasing product cost; providing opportunities for small business; and accelerating private sector economic development, employment and investment.  The ARMS program allows the Army to manage portions of the ammunition infrastructure as a commercial business.  This management concept has allowed the Army to apply overhead costs across multiple commercial contracts to reduce operating costs.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2015 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $2.504 million support financial and marketing investments to attract revenue-producing tenants to locate on GOCO Army Ammunition Plants and GOCO Army Depots.  The ARMS Program reduces Army cost of ownership and maintains critical munitions industrial base skills.  Revenues collected will be utilized to reduce overhead and total annual operating costs, improve and maintain existing buildings for current tenants, and perform improvements to other vacant buildings to entice potential tenants.</proc:Justification>
