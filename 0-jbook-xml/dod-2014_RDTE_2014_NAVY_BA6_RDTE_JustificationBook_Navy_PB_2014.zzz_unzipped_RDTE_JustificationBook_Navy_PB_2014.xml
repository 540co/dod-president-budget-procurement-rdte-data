                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The objective of this project is development of necessary simulation facilities and approaches to allow determination of the effectiveness of Electronic Warfare (EW) in real world engagement situations and to support the introduction of modern, effective systems into Naval Aviation. The heavy use of test resources by all Services demonstrates the importance of these assets. The Navy has been very successful in executing all of its major programs, and to date has had no major technical problems.

The Electronic Warfare Environment Simulation project is unique because it is the only program within the Department of Defense which develops and provides Naval anti-air warfare threat assets for Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E).

This project directly supports the T&amp;E resource requirements for all Naval Air EW development programs, to include multi-spectral situational awareness and countermeasures. Programs in development and future programs include: ALR-67(v) 3, Integrated Defensive Electronic Countermeasures Suite ALQ-214, the AAR-47 (v) 3, AVR-2, Advanced 6" Expendable, Advanced Strategic Tactical Expendable, ALQ-144A, Joint and Allied Threat Awareness System, Joint Strike Fighter, EA-18G, LR700, Low Band Transmitter, P-8A, and the Next Generation Jammer.

This project provides for the development of an Integrated Air Defense T&amp;E capability to be fielded at each of the three sites comprising the Navy's Tri-Center complex: Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, China Lake and Point Mugu in CA, and Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Patuxent River, MD.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The projects that have been grouped in the Radio Frequency Threat Capabilities accomplishment area through FY 2013 will realign to either the Acquisition and Measurement Capabilities accomplishment or the Engagement Capabilities accomplishment starting in FY 2014.  This change was made to allow a more detailed tracking for those projects.

Funding increases from FY 2012 to FY 2013 due to the need for additional test capability for the Next Generation Jammer and the Joint Strike Fighter programs.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The objective of the Effectiveness of Navy Electronic Warfare (EW) Systems (ENEWS) Project is the development and application of necessary simulation assets to determine the effectiveness of EW for Navy ships in simulated real-world engagement situations.  The project primarily supports the introduction of modern, effective shipboard and offboard EW systems, and tactics for the Surface Navy.  The heavy use of ENEWS resources by Naval Sea Systems Command, Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&amp;E) Force, Special Operations, and other EW Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) agencies speaks to the overall importance of this project.  The project provides support for EW system design, Engineering Test (ET), Development Test (DT), Operational Test (OT), and the development of utilization tactics.  In the past ENEWS' quick reaction capabilities have had great impact on crisis situations such as the Libyan crises, Iran threat, Persian Gulf crisis, and Operation Desert Shield/Storm.  Simulation Display (SIMDIS) is an ENEWS modeling tool that was developed to support T&amp;E.  SIMDIS has been adopted by most Department of Defense (DoD) T&amp;E and training ranges to provide visualization of T&amp;E and training scenarios.  One of the primary threats to surface ships is Anti-Ship Capable Missile systems.  The ENEWS Project is unique in that it is the only project within DoD dedicated to developing and providing realistic Anti-Ship Capable Missile assets to test and evaluate the effectiveness of shipboard EW systems and tactics against these type threats.  The ENEWS Project is a critical part of the Office of the Secretary of Defense Test Resource Master Plan.  This plan employs many of the ENEWS assets for planning, analysis, testing, and verification of shipboard and off-board EW systems techniques and tactics.  As part of its normal activities, ENEWS provides Development Test and Evaluation (DT&amp;E), OT&amp;E, and Follow-on Operational Test and Evaluation (FOT&amp;E) support to the surface Navy for all ship classes.  DT, OT and FOT&amp;E support includes AN/SLQ-32 Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program (SEWIP), Nulka, Rapid Anti-ship Integrated Defense System, all MK245 Giant tests, advanced InfraRed (IR) decoys, decoy placement, ship IR signature and radar cross section measurement of DDG-51, LPD-17, DD-21 and PC class ships, High Power Microwave program, and other ship self-defense initiatives, including T&amp;E of Future Naval Capability process.  In addition, ENEWS assets are regularly employed to test the effectiveness of North Atlantic Treaty Organization ships' EW systems in joint allied exercises.  ENEWS assets also support Joint EW exercises that are conducted with Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) nations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                    <r2:SummaryExplanation>The Subsonic Aerial Target (SSAT) (designated the BQM-177A) program required additional funding in FY 2014 to meet revised program cost estimates for the addition of (Classified) requirements for an Increment 2.

The Multi-Stage Supersonic Target (MSST) (designated the GQM-173A) program increased in design/development costs, requiring additional funding in FY 2012 to align to the Contractor's Estimate to Complete (EAC) and prevent delays in the initial production schedule. The reprogramming transactions were compiled from the midyear sweep and internal realignments. The GQM-173A encountered test failures and as a result Milestone (MS) C is now planned for FY 2015. Funds in the amount of $28.987 million have been shifted from WPN (BLI 22800) in FY 2014 to continue EMD in order to complete all tests satisfactorily.  

Air Superiority Target (AST) program: For FY 2012 the Navy share was reduced from the planned amount and shifted to FY 2013 because work on the Pre-EMD contract was delayed by water flooding a Boeing subcontractor.  For FY 2013, increased budget covers efforts on the Boeing EMD contract and also the acquisition of 3 QF-16 targets. FY 2014 will not include costs for EMD contract efforts.

QF-4 Full Scale Aerial Target (FSAT):  The expenses of this effort are a function of the number of sorties/target-presentations combined with the quantity of aircraft on the ramp at Tyndall and Holloman Air Force Bases requiring calendar maintenance.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Aerial target systems, Target Control (TC), and associated Target Augmentation and Auxiliary Systems (TA/AS) are developed to support test &amp; evaluation and advanced fleet training for Joint Strike and Littoral Warfare Systems required to defend fleet surface and air units in a hostile environment. In addition to hardware, software and operational concept development, studies will be performed by an University Affiliated Research Center (UARC) to specify and verify needed target performance for future target development. For the design and validation of targets under development, the UARC will provide engineering studies in areas such as structures, controls, guidance, and propulsion.  For those hardware and software items presently under development by commercial vendors, the UARC will provide oversight and validation of vendor design and development approach.
As to specific harware development, this project includes:
- Subsonic Targets: Subsonic Aerial Target (SSAT) (designated the BQM-177A) development.  The BQM-177A primarily represents subsonic anti-ship cruise missile threats in direct support of the test &amp; evaluation (T&amp;E) of major combat weapons systems programs and of fleet training.  
- Supersonic Targets: Supersonic Sea Skimming Target (SSST), Multi-Stage Supersonic Target (MSST) (designated the GQM-173A), and supersonic high-diver capability development.  The family of supersonic target capabilities represents supersonic anti-ship cruise missile threats in direct support of Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&amp;E), Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&amp;E) and Live Fire Test and Evaluation of major combat weapons systems programs in development.
- TC and TA/AS development: TC provides command and control of targets to enable the execution of threat-representative mission profiles.  TA/AS enables each target to be uniquely configured for specific mission profiles. TA/AS-configured targets are used for radar acquisition test, electronic countermeasures (jamming) evaluation, infrared measurement and testing, radar cross section evaluation, decoy-effectiveness testing, maneuver analysis, electronic warfare evaluation, warhead-effectiveness testing and evaluation of fleet tactics.  TA/AS scoring capabilities include both surface and airborne scalar and vector scoring systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>The GQM-173A target emulates a two-stage anti-ship cruise missile. The GQM-173A will have a subsonic bus stage vehicle which will tumble and fall into the sea, and a supersonic sprint stage vehicle which continues flight to impact. The fielded system will provide threat representation in support of DT&amp;E and OT&amp;E and will identify deficiencies in shipboard air defense systems. Funding will also continue for GQM-163 SSST upgrades/evolutionary development to keep pace with evolving threat characteristics. Efforts include continuing to establish operational capability at Pacific Missile Range Facility, developing performance envelope characteristics to include flight termination performance, and continuing development of high-diver capability.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides for the development and procurement of aerial targets and associated systems used exclusively for test and evaluation of naval weapons systems which closely represent current and projected threats to fleet units in the Joint Strike and the Littoral Warfare environments. These representations must include characteristics related to size, performance envelope, and electromagnetic and infrared signatures. As threats change, changes must be made to keep the targets threat representative in response to changes in the test requirements of the developers of naval weapons systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>A new cost effective expendable ASW Training Target is required to acoustically and dynamically emulate threat submarines for fleet qualification and proficiency training on and off undersea ranges.  Acoustically a new system is required to provide a higher fidelity active sonar system and torpedo sonar system with expanded frequency coverage than current systems to be compatible with sonar and torpedo systems being fielded on the P-8, SH-60R, and AN-SQQ-89 capable surface ships and the MK54 Mod 0 and MK48 Mod 7 Torpedoes. Dynamically the target needs to emulate both low and high speed ends of threat submarines performance envelope to provide needed training realism.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Maritime Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) Planning System (MIPS) is an automated air and missile defense planning tool that supports the Joint Force Maritime Component Commander at the operational level of war by automatically and optimally allocating and stationing ships in support of Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) or Anti-Air Warfare (AAW).  MIPS contains United States Army Patriot and Terminal High Altitude Air Defense (THAAD) models to ensure synergistic allocation and positioning of maritime units in relation to other joint units, providing optimized mutual defense for selected defended assets against selected BMD and AAW threats.  

MIPS requires additional algorithms and software development efforts that include Bottom Contours, Long Range Surveillance &amp; Track (LRS&amp;T), Launch on Tactical Digital Information Link (TADIL), Cued Engagement and Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) stationing capabilities to improve model performance and meet the expanding requirements for optimized IAMD.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports detailed mission, capability, and technical analysis of future naval warfighting requirements.  This work provides the analytical basis for integration and prioritization of overall military capability requirements and acquisition programs in support of executing the Naval Capability Development Process and development/delivery of Mission Capability Packages, Naval Capability Packages, and Integrated Strategic Capability Plans for Chief of Naval Operations (CNO).
Concept formulation for ships, boats and unmanned maritime vehicles must be continuously exercised to remain viable. It takes years to train competent practitioners, and knowledge currency is quickly lost without practice. Evolving threats and technologies drive concepts (and the tools, processes, and skills needed to produce them) towards obsolescence without constant attention. Capability Based Assessments and Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) timelines are insufficient for establishing potential material solution cost versus capability relationships without significant concept formulation work beforehand. Active collaboration between the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations requirement sponsors, Program Offices, and the various System Command (Naval Sea Systems Command, Naval Air Systems Command and Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command) engineers is critical for fully exploring the trade space by conducting analysis for affordability, effectiveness and risk.  
The majority of Total Ownership Cost (TOC) is locked into a design before it is even a program. In the later stages of a program it becomes much more costly to make changes that will significantly impact TOC. Investment up front in concept design can have a high payoff in TOC reduction over the life of a platform class.
This project funds concept development engineering, mission effectiveness analysis, and other analyses for formulation of future surface ship and associated platform force structure along with development of the tools to accomplish these efforts. Advanced platform concept studies and systems technology assessments will be conducted as will the development and upgrade of concept design and engineering tools, methods, and criteria.
Outputs include concept costing and performance parameterization for comparative assessment against capability objectives and synthesis to quantify overall (Fleet) capabilities. These products (expressions of cost vs. capability) will serve as the basis of requirements and Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System analysis, define the trade space for AoA efforts, and underpin discussion of force architecture/structure during Quadrennial Defense Review, Long Range Shipbuilding Strategy builds, and Joint Requirements Oversight Council reviews.

Beginning in FY 2014, funding for these efforts, except for the Portfolio Management Decision Support System, is being shifted to PE 0605853N, Management, Technical, &amp; International Support, Project 2221, Joint Mission Assessment Studies, to better align these efforts with other Navy capability analysis efforts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Portfolio Management Decision Support System (PMDSS) is an analytic Portfolio Management Methodology used to aid Navy leadership with both investment and divestment programming decisions. This methodology provides an assessment process that fosters informed, understandable, repeatable investment decisions with consistent, pedigreed, and retrievable information. The focus of this effort is to refine the system to identify programs as potential candidates for divestment. It provides leadership and resource sponsors with a starting point for their offset decision process as well as an issue ranking capability. PMDSS will include linkage of programs to N3/N5 strategic imperatives, programs mapped to warfare areas, program interdependencies annotated, and balance factors that can be adjusted to reflect Navy Leadership Priorities. The effort expands on PMDSS by capturing and mapping issues/funding adjustments, and providing a system capable of identifying fiscal interdependencies and consideration to risk in order to increase accuracy in calculating programmatic risk.

                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>This PE provides funding to support continuing need for studies and analysis of issues critical to decisions required by the Chief of Naval Personnel and his staff regarding manpower, personnel, training and education policies, and programs that have far-reaching implications to service members and the Navy budget.  This PE supports research of both Naval Postgraduate School faculty and students, and in FY10 began the formulation of focused economic research, to include behavioral economics.  This focus will provide continuing analysis and research to facilitate the data gathering and synthesis to provide consistent and timely update to economic indicators to use in the numerous models that support management decisions within the MPTE arena that have significant impact on the efficient use of the nearly $27B Manpower &amp; Personnel, Navy budget.  The economic research will consolidate the data necessary to perform elasticity estimations and maintain this data for subsequent estimations.  To gather the data necessary to perform such estimations, would conservatively cost more than $300K on each such occasion.  The MPTE enterprise uses dozens of models, most of which require elasticity updates.  Consolidating the data repository to support this analysis will result in a cost avoidance of more than $1M and this does not include any of the actual model revisions.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Funding supports the analytic, risk reduction, and programmatic activities to recapitalize the Carrier Onboard Delivery (COD) capability. This medium-lift/long-range logistics aircraft will provide critical air connector capability for time-critical logistics within the Navy Seabasing logistics enabling concept in support of the Carrier Strike Groups. This capability is currently provided by the C-2A Greyhounds, which are projected to begin retiring in large numbers as they reach their fatigue service life limits and the force falls below primary aircraft allocation in 2028.

This effort is funded under Project Element 0605525N Carrier Onbaord Delivery (COD) Follow On in FY 2014.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Center for Naval Analyses (CNA) is the Department of the Navy's (DoN) only Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC). CNA provides independent, objective, and expert analyses based on its unique access to sensitive data and hands-on exposure to fleet operations gained through its world-wide field program. CNA's research program is centrally funded by this program element and is primarily concentrated along one Marine Corps category and thirteen Navy categories of study called product areas. These product areas are structured to enhance CNA's focus of research and analysis upon the major present and future needs and issues of the Navy and the Marine Corps. Because of rapid advances in technology, changes in the fleet, the increasing complexity of weapon systems, and reductions in manpower, force structure, budgets, the current security environment, and Department of Defense (DoD) transformation, the Navy and Marine Corps have a greater need for analyses that are sophisticated, relevant, and timely. CNA is highly qualified to meet that need.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports the Marine Corps portion of the DoN CNA Research Program, and is managed as an element of the Marine Corps Studies System. This program provides the Marine Corps with independent and objective research and analysis of specific issues/topics appropriately performed by a FFRDC. As a result of the findings and recommendations of the Fiscal Year 1997 Defense Science Board, the Marine Corps refocused the type of support CNA provides.  The CNA maintains a varied number of field representatives for the Operational Forces Commanders and eight (8) program areas for CNA to establish and maintain. The program areas are linked to the Marine Corps Advocacy (prepotency), which are: (1) Policy and Operations; (2) Systems and Tactics; (3) Research, Development and Acquisition; (4) Infrastructure and Readiness; (5) Manpower, Medical and Training; (6) Resources, Planning and Assessments; (7) Capabilities, Force Structure and Systems and (8) Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance.  Scientific Analyst support provides six scientific analysts for the following six focus areas: Deputy Commandant (DC), Plans, Policies and Operations; DC Aviation; DC Installation and Logistics; DC Programs and Resources; DC Manpower Reserve Affairs; and Director, Manpower Plans (MP) - Manpower and Reserve Affairs (M&amp;RA). The program continues analytical support for field exercises, Ad Hoc and Quick Response study requirements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>The Marine Corps' portion of the CNA program is executed via the Marine Corps Studies System (MCSS) Annual Plan which is reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis. The MCSS maintains a comprehensive listing of all CNA studies performed for the Marine Corps.  The MCSS ensures there are no duplicate analytical efforts within the Marine Corps.  Additionally, the Operations Analysis Division of Marine Corps Combat Development Command (MCCDC) provides analytical review of all CNA products for the Marine Corps and integrates the results and recommendations into a quarterly newsletter for research and analysis.  Other evaluation processes are as follows: 
A) Contract Status Meetings: The Marine Corps participates in the DoN Contract Status Meetings. As part of the CNA oversight process, the Contracting Officer chairs a monthly meeting with the COTR, the Marine Corps, and members of the CNA Business Support Group to provide guidance regarding contract management. Issues range from reviewing the Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC) database requirements to emphasize the contractual requirement that all ongoing research be submitted to DTIC to ensure against duplication to reviewing CNA's cost effectiveness and efficiency.
B) Marine Corps Three-Star Flag Officer Review: The Commanding General, Marine Corps Combat Development Command (MCCDC) and the Director, Operations Analysis Division meet several times per month to review the current fiscal year's research program and provide guidance to CNA regarding their future research requirements for the Marine Corps. These high level meetings are essential to provide CNA with Marine Corps' guidance to ensure that the research conducted is of the greatest value to the Marine Corps. The meetings also serve as the roadmap for research during the upcoming fiscal year. The Marine Corps' research plan is consolidated with the DoN's Annual Plan that is submitted to the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Integration of Capabilities and Resources (N8) for final review and acceptance.
C) CNA Comprehensive Review: Prior to contract renewal, CNA, as a FFRDC, must be evaluated to ensure that the DoN wants to renew their contract for an additional five years. The Marine Corps conducts a comprehensive review of sponsors' technical needs and mission requirements, consideration of alternative sources, efficiency and effectiveness, and management and cost effectiveness that contributes to DoN's establishment of criteria and sponsorship agreement.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>CNA is reviewed throughout the research year on several different levels to ensure that research produced is not duplicated elsewhere.  The primary (and most effective) method of review for duplication is the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) review and approval of each and every project proposal submitted by CNA.  This method is highly effective in providing the necessary oversight to ensure that duplication of effort does not occur.  The Marine Corps Studies System (MCSS) maintains a comprehensive listing of all CNA studies performed for the USMC.  The MCSS ensures that there are no duplicate analytical efforts within the USMC.  Additionally, the Studies and Analysis Division of the Marine Corps Combat Development Command (MCCDC) provides analytical review of all CNA products for the USMC and integrates the results and recommendations into a quarterly newsletter and an annual plan for research and analysis.

B) Two-Star Flag Officers and VCNO Corporate Board Meetings:  DoN Two-Star and their equivalent civilian counterparts meet several times a year to review the current fiscal year's research and provide guidance to CNA regarding their future research for DoN.  These high level meetings are essential to provide CNA with DoN's guidance to ensure that the research conducted is of the greatest value to DoN.  The meetings also serve as the catalyst for the formation of the CNA Annual Plan, CNA's roadmap for research during the upcoming fiscal year.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program requires each Federal agency that has an extramural budget for R&amp;D in excess of $100,000,000 to set aside 2.6% for SBIR in FY 2012.  This funds  R&amp;D at small businesses.  The program goals are to stimulate technological innovation; increase small business participation in federally funded R&amp;D; foster participation by minority and disadvantaged firms in technological innovation; and increase private sector commercialization of federal R&amp;D.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

						Phase 1 and Phase II's awarded based on solicitations issued three times a year for SBIR describing R&amp;D needs and inviting proposals from small companies.

Phase I Feasibility:
Phase I awards determined the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of the proposed effort and quality of performance by the small business concerns (SBC).

Phase II Technology Development:
Phase II awards are based on the SBC's Phase I results and potential of the Phase II proposal to address the Navy's needs.  These awards further developed the technology, maturing the Technology Readiness Level(TRL) and providing prototypes or other sources validating the technology.

Phase III - Since the DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000, the Navy continues annually to award more in Phase III contracts then the rest of the DOD combined and continues to be called out in studies and Congressional language as the premier Department of Defense (DoD) SBIR program. Although no government SBIR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and/or private sector. The target is to transition a company's SBIR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community. One important strength of the SBIR program is that once a company has received a Phase I award the follow-on Phase II and III awards can be awarded in a non competitive process since the competitive process took place under phase I.

						Phase I Feasibility:
Phase I awards determined the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of the proposed effort and quality of performance by the
small business concerns (SBC). 

Phase II Technology Development:
Phase II awards are based on the SBC's Phase I results and potential of the Phase II proposal to address the Navy's needs. These awards further
developed the technology, maturing the Technology Readiness Level(TRL) and providing prototypes or other sources validating the technology. 

Phase III - Since the DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000, the Navy continues annually to award more in Phase III contracts then the rest of the DOD combined and continues to be called out in studies and Congressional language as the premier Department of Defense (DoD) SBIR program.  Although no government SBIR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and/or private sector.  The target is to transition a company's SBIR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community. One important strength of the SBIR program is that once a company has received a Phase I award the follow-on Phase II and III awards can be awarded in a non competitive process since the competitive process took place under phase I.

Phase III - Since the DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000, the Navy continues annually to award more in Phase III contracts then the rest of the DOD combined and continues to be called out in studies and Congressional language as the premier Department of Defense (DoD) SBIR program. Although no government SBIR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and/or private sector. The target is to transition a company's SBIR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community. One important strength of the SBIR program is that once a company has received a Phase I award the follow-on Phase II and III awards can be awarded in a non competitive process since the competitive process took place under phase I.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program requires each Federal agency that has an extramural budget for R&amp;D in excess of $1,000,000,000 to set aside 0.35% for STTR in FY 2012.  This funds cooperative R&amp;D between small businesses and research institutions.  The program goals are to create vehicles from moving ideas from research institutions to market; enable researchers to pursue commercial application of technologies; and bridge funding gap between basic research and commercial product.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

						Phase 1 and Phase II's awarded based on solicitations issued three times a year for SBIR describing R&amp;D needs and inviting proposals from small companies.

Phase I Feasibility:
Phase I awards determined the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of the proposed effort and quality of performance by the small business concerns (SBC).

Phase II Technology Development:
Phase II awards are based on the SBC's Phase I results and potential of the Phase II proposal to address the Navy's needs.  These awards further developed the technology, maturing the Technology Readiness Level(TRL) and providing prototypes or other sources validating the technology.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program requires each Federal agency that has an extramural budget for R&amp;D in excess of $100,000,000 to set aside 2.6% for SBIR in FY 2012.  This funds  R&amp;D at small businesses.  The program goals are to stimulate technological innovation; increase small business participation in federally funded R&amp;D; foster participation by minority and disadvantaged firms in technological innovation; and increase private sector commercialization of federal R&amp;D.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

						Phase 1 and Phase II's awarded based on solicitations issued three times a year for SBIR describing R&amp;D needs and inviting proposals from small companies.

Phase I Feasibility:
Phase I awards determined the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of the proposed effort and quality of performance by the small business concerns (SBC).

Phase II Technology Development:
Phase II awards are based on the SBC's Phase I results and potential of the Phase II proposal to address the Navy's needs.  These awards further developed the technology, maturing the Technology Readiness Level(TRL) and providing prototypes or other sources validating the technology.

Phase III - Since the DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000, the Navy continues annually to award more in Phase III contracts then the rest of the DOD combined and continues to be called out in studies and Congressional language as the premier Department of Defense (DoD) SBIR program. Although no government SBIR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and/or private sector. The target is to transition a company's SBIR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community. One important strength of the SBIR program is that once a company has received a Phase I award the follow-on Phase II and III awards can be awarded in a non competitive process since the competitive process took place under phase I.

						Phase I Feasibility:
Phase I awards determined the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of the proposed effort and quality of performance by the small business concerns (SBC).

Phase II Technology Development:
Phase II awards are based on the SBC's Phase I results and potential of the Phase II proposal to address the Navy's needs. These awards further developed the technology, maturing the Technology Readiness Level(TRL) and providing prototypes or other sources validating the technology. 

Phase III - Since the DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000, the Navy continues annually to award more in Phase III contracts then the rest of the DOD combined and continues to be called out in studies and Congressional language as the premier Department of Defense (DoD) SBIR program.  Although no government SBIR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and/or private sector.  The target is to transition a company's SBIR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community. One important strength of the SBIR program is that once a company has received a Phase I award the follow-on Phase II and III awards can be awarded in a non competitive process since the competitive process took place under phase I.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>International Cooperative RDT&amp;E: provide program management, execution, and support to implement a broad range of cooperative Naval Research and Development, Test and Evaluation initiatives to improve coalition interoperability, harmonize US Navy requirements with allied and friendly nations, and identify cooperative international opportunities, and improve coalition interoperability.  In addition, it develops coherent approaches, coordinating with partner nations, to sea-based missile defense, command, control, communications, computers and intelligence (C4I), and cooperative acquisition programs while also identifying technology to support the Global Maritime Partnership initiative.

Naval War College Strategic Studies Support:  Provides research, analysis and gaming activities which serve as a focal point, stimulus, and major source of strategic and operational thought within the Navy, joint and interagency communities.  These efforts generate strategic and operational alternatives, quantitative analysis, war gaming and political military assessments, and provide recommendations regarding the formulation and execution of maritime options .  The War Gaming Department plans, designs, executes, analyzes and reports on the Navy's Title 10 war games.  These war games provide analytical input to the Navy's Strategic Plan, assessments of future concepts, and recommendations to the Navy's Quadrennial Defense Review, force design, and strategy process.  The War Gaming Department also designs, executes and analyzes war games for theater security cooperation plans and operational war fighting issues.  

Assessment Program: The Navy Assessment Program provides capability-based planning assessment for Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS), conducts analysis to affect war fighting capability trades and enterprise resources, identifies needs, gaps, and overlaps, and assesses alternative solutions to Joint needs.  The program supports both the development and use of modeling, simulation and analytically-based warfare and provides business analyses and analytic tools that provide the basis for decision making with respect to concepts of operations (CONOPS), Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) Systems (Information Dominance); warfare systems (Sea Strike, Sea Shield, and Sea Basing) and analytical underpinnings/basis for programmatic decisions of the Navy's top leadership regarding their architectures, force structure, and the Navy's core "organize, train, and equip mission" (the warfare and provider Enterprises).  The program provides overarching Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution System (PPBES) analyses and guidance for PPBES which provides gap analysis and investment strategy and total obligation authority allocation.  It provides independent capability analysis and assists in structuring follow-on Navy analyses.  The program coordinates Navy's position for the enhanced planning process and conducts net assessments.  It serves as the lead campaign analysis to approve Navy warfare and support requirements.  The program supports "A Cooperative Strategy for 21st Century Seapower 21" as modified by the Maritime Strategy which charts a course for the Navy, Coast Guard and Marine Corps to work collectively with each other and international partners to prevent crises from occurring or reacting quickly should one occur to avoid negative impact to the United States.  It serves as an independent assessor providing a broad-view perspective across the Navy staff apart from resource sponsors, with an integrated look at both war fighting and war fighting support programs.  The program supports the world class modeling efforts to attain a level of Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) capability that is world class and establishes the Navy as a leader in the Department of Defense (DoD) M&amp;S community.  It provides Navy alternatives in assessing the implications embedded within resource decisions in a quantified context of costs versus capability versus risk.  The program provides independent analytic support to Navy leadership in conjunction with various executive level decision forums.  It develops tools and analytical methodologies that assist in evaluating Navy programs and provides technical leadership for the analysis functional area of Naval Modeling and Simulation.

Mid-Range Financial Improvement Plans: This project supports the Research Development Test &amp; Evaluation, Navy (RDTEN) portion of the larger DoD and Navy-wide effort to implement the financial improvement plan.  Funding is for the sustainment of clean and auditable statements for RDTEN.

Operations Integration Group:  Classified

CHENG: Develops and implements architecture-based systems engineering processes, methods and tools that assure integrated and interoperable systems are delivered to the fleet.  This project provides the mission-oriented technical basis for implementing capability-based acquisition management within the Navy to engineer and field Navy and Marine Corps combat systems, weapon systems, and command, control, communications, computers and intelligence (C4I) programs that must operate as  family-of-systems (FoS) or system-of-systems (SoS).  The focus of this project is on identifying the functions, relationships, and connections between systems at both the force and unit level and across warfare mission areas, and encompasses three key elements:  Systems Engineering to provide the framework for making engineering decisions by war fighting capability at the FoS/SoS level and supports consistent engineering and investment decision-making across Navy and Marine Corps programs within capability-based acquisition portfolios.  Naval Collaborative Engineering Environment development and implementation as a DON enterprise resource for Naval integration and interoperability information to enable collaboration and decision support among Fleet organizations, Program Executive Offices, Program Managers, Systems Commands, prime contractors, Resource/Warfare Sponsors and Comptroller organizations.  Standards, Policies and Guidelines engineering and technical staff to implement DoN, Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and Joint integration and interoperability and Anti-Tamper initiatives.

Naval Research Laboratory (NRL)Facilities Modernization: This program has been established to provide a systematic and planned approach to improve vital in-house science and technology (S&amp;T) laboratory facilities which are reaching or have reached critical stages of deterioration.  The program includes restoration and modernization (R&amp;M) initiatives for about 350,000 net square feet, where the average age of the buildings is 67 years old.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Provides program management, execution, and support to implement a broad range of cooperative naval Research and Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) initiatives to improve coalition interoperability, harmonize US Navy requirements with allied and friendly nations, identify cooperative international opportunities, and improve coalition interoperability.  In addition, it develops coherent approaches in coordination with combatant commanders (COCOMs), and appropriate partner nations, to sea-based missile defense, command, control, communications, computers and intelligence (C4I), and cooperative acquisition programs while also identifying technology to support the Global Maritime Partnership Initiative.

The project scope supports the strategic shift to the Pacific Region with emphasis on Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) and Coalition Interoperability.  Relationships have been, and are being initiated with a greatly expanded and diverse group of maritime countries, particularly those with nascent and littoral navies.  The project was restructured internally to both maintain ongoing international relationships and projects, while preparing to facilitate support for a global network of maritime nations under MDA and Coalition Interoperability requirements. 

Ongoing cooperative RDT&amp;E programs, projects and exchanges are pursued to identify cooperative acquisition programs, enhance OCO efforts and MDA development, fill capability gaps, improve US/coalition interoperability, and set standardization with international partners. Such efforts have resulted in:
1. Negotiating and developing approximately 57 international RDT&amp;E Agreements annually with allied and friendly nations;
2. Executing approximately 300 Information Exchange Annexes (IEAs) with foreign partners;
3. Improving IEA information dissemination with allied and friendly countries and within Department of the Navy (DoN);
4. Coordinating Navy inputs to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (OUSD) Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (AT&amp;L) Foreign Comparative Test (FCT) Program, and Coalition Warfare Program (CWT) as well as the DoN Technology Transfer Security Assistance Review Boards (TTSARB). 
5. Represent the US Navy in Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) directed Armaments Cooperation Forums, including the Conference of NATO Armaments Directors' groups {NATO Naval Armaments Group (NNAG)}, and Senior National Representative-Maritime (SNR-M);
6.  Funding of various international RDT&amp;E support databases including Technical Project Officer (TPO), International Agreement Generators, Information/Data Exchange Agreements, and Project Agreements/Memorandums of Understanding;
7.  Leading the Engineering and Scientist Exchange Program (ESEP).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

  personnel to successfully operate at the operational level of war.
- Actively participate in creation and review of existing and emerging doctrine, and  have active involvement in
  the development of evolving operational level issues.
- Incorporate more interactive technologies for staff collaboration while conducting distributed operations.
- Conduct research in advanced adaptive intelligence, information warfare, and other advanced decision-support tools,
  including adapting Spiral-developed systems into the MOC classroom environment. 
- Continue research to improve coalition-related MOC education programs for International Officers and senior
  officers (continued improvements).  Includes support for MAWS and alignment with all other operational level
  education at NWC and other Service educational facilities.
- Examine gaps in education at the OLW; develop COI to close same gaps (Information management/knowledge management,
  et al). 

Assist and Assess Team (AAT):
- Expand research and analysis into integrating lateral and vertical operations of Commander, TENTH Fleet MOC with
  operations at existing numbered fleet MOCs, USFFC and US Pacific Fleet, as well as upward to the new USCYBERCOM and
  downward to subordinate CTFs and commands.
- Conduct research and analysis into potential methods for integration of information operations (to include cyber
  operations) with traditional kinetic joint fires operations.  Cyber operations (network attack, defense, and
  exploitation) present unique challenges due to the global nature of the domain, the potential effects on other MOCs
  and the importance of alignment for effective strategic communication.
- Conduct research into how Navy units worldwide can support Commander, TENTH Fleet in the execution of the full
  spectrum of information and cyber operations. 
- Provide tailored assistance to Commander, TENTH Fleet and Commanders of other MOCs to communicate results of above 
  research and analysis efforts and to strengthen staff knowledge of joint information operations planning, execution,
  and assessment.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Navy Assessment Program provides capability-based planning assessment for Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS), conducts analysis to affect war fighting capability trades and enterprise resources, identifies needs, gaps, and overlaps, and assesses alternative solutions to Joint needs.  The program supports both the development and use of modeling, simulation and analytically-based warfare and provides business analyses and analytic tools that provide the basis for decision making with respect to concepts of operations, Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Systems (Information Dominance); warfare systems (Sea Strike, Sea Shield, and Sea Basing) and analytical underpinnings/basis for programmatic decisions of the Navy's top leadership regarding their architectures, force structure, and the Navy's core "organize, train, and equip mission" (the warfare and provider Enterprises).  The program provides overarching Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution System (PPBES) analyses and guidance for PPBES which provides gap analysis and investment strategy and total obligation authority allocation.  It provides independent capability analysis and assists in structuring follow-on Navy analyses.  The program coordinates Navy's position for the enhanced planning process and conducts net assessments.  It serves as the lead campaign analysis to approve Navy warfare and support requirements.  The program supports "A Cooperative Strategy for 21st Century Seapower 21" as modified by the Maritime Strategy which charts a course for the Navy, Coast Guard and Marine Corps to work collectively with each other and international partners to prevent crises from occurring or reacting quickly should one occur to avoid negative impact to the United States.  It serves as an independent assessor providing a broad-view perspective across the Navy staff apart from resource sponsors, with an integrated look at both war fighting and war fighting support programs.  The program supports the world class modeling efforts to attain a level of Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) capability that is world class and establishes the Navy as a leader in the Department of Defense M&amp;S community.  It provides Navy alternatives in assessing the implications embedded within resource decisions in a quantified context of costs versus capability versus risk.  The program provides independent analytic support to Navy leadership in conjunction with various executive level decision forums.

Beginning in FY 2014, this project also includes funding for Concept Formulation (CONFORM) efforts.  This is a shift of funding from PE 0605152N, Studies and Analysis Support, Project 2092, Naval Warfare Studies.  CONFORM for ships, boats and unmanned maritime vehicles must be continuously exercised to remain viable. It takes years to train competent practitioners, and knowledge currency is quickly lost without practice. Evolving threats and technologies drive concepts (and the tools, processes, and skills needed to produce them) towards obsolescence without constant attention. Capability Based Assessments and Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) timelines are insufficient for establishing potential material solution cost versus capability relationships without significant concept formulation work beforehand. Active collaboration between the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations requirement sponsors, Program Offices, and the various System Command (Naval Sea Systems Command, Naval Air Systems Command and Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command) engineers is critical for fully exploring the trade space by conducting analysis for affordability, effectiveness and risk.  
The majority of Total Ownership Cost (TOC) is locked into a design before it is even a program. In the later stages of a program it becomes much more costly to make changes that will significantly impact TOC. Investment up front in concept design can have a high payoff in TOC reduction over the life of a platform class.
This project funds concept development engineering, mission effectiveness analysis, and other analyses for formulation of future surface ship and associated platform force structure along with development of the tools to accomplish these efforts. Advanced platform concept studies and systems technology assessments will be conducted as will the development and upgrade of concept design and engineering tools, methods, and criteria.
Outputs include concept costing and performance parameterization for comparative assessment against capability objectives and synthesis to quantify overall (Fleet) capabilities. These products (expressions of cost vs. capability) will serve as the basis of requirements and Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System analysis, define the trade space for AoA efforts, and underpin discussion of force architecture/structure during Quadrennial Defense Review, Long Range Shipbuilding Strategy builds, and Joint Requirements Oversight Council reviews.
Capabilities-Based Assessment (CBA) is the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) analysis process that includes three phases: Functional Area Analysis (FAA), Functional Needs Analysis (FNA), and Functional Solution Analysis (FSA). The results of the CBA are used to develop a joint capabilities document (based on the FAA and FNA) or initial capabilities document (based on the full analysis). CBA funding provides the resource sponsors the means to develop the analytic underpinning required by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 3170.01G to support the determination of Naval warfighting capabilities and force structure needed to support the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC)/JCIDS requirements validation process and to inform Program Objective Memorandum programming decisions.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

					-Address the one-year backlog of Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) efforts due to the lack of FY13 funding. Specifically modeling or analysis gaps that have been corporately deemed critical to improving POM decision-making.
-Develop and improve analysis capabilities which support Joint and Navy analytic agendas and resource-allocation decision making by refining the linkages between cost and performance in performance-modeled programs in support of OPNAV analysis and assessment.  Areas of tool development and improvement include mission- and campaign-level warfighting models, active and reserve manpower, afloat and ashore readiness, and medical capabilities.
-Focus on integrated analysis capabilities that cut across business and program accounts.  Specific efforts will address cyber warfare and security, optimizing the training pipeline, integrating ship maintenance and operations price performance models, and improving mission- and campaign-level C5ISR models and representations. 
-Update the high-level readiness model that fully integrates all aspects of warfighting support (operational utilization, training cycles, training centers, depots, etc.) and personnel (recruitment, training, development, deployment, retention, etc.) across the Navy's warfighting platforms (aircraft, ships, submarines, etc.), facilities and personnel development centers.

Studies will be performed in a continuous manner to support future recapitalization of Surface Combatants, Amphibious Ships, Carriers, Auxiliary Ships and other emerging program requirements.
- Collaborate with Warfare Systems design experts to perform continuous Warfare Systems analysis at the ship and fleet level. Warfare Systems effectiveness assessment tools will be continually developed and enhanced as required to address future concepts and to incorporate improvements in information technology systems. Additionally, collaboration with aircraft, C4ISR, and networks by continuing dialog and collaboration between NAVSEA, NAVAIR, and SPAWAR systems commands will refine fleet level requirements.
- Refine platform concept stage cost analysis tools to predict cost better in areas where weight-based algorithms may not be appropriate. It will continually enhance tools to estimate total ownership cost more accurately at the ship and weapons system concept development stage. Conduct cost estimates in support of future concept design exploration, CBA, and AoA efforts. Further develop Cost Estimating Relationships (CERs) to accommodate emerging technologies incorporated in future platforms. Develop cost estimating tools which incorporate emerging technologies applicable to future platforms.
- Conduct future force structure concept formulation. Fleet synthesis and analysis will be conducted, which includes capabilities requirements, platform design and cost and quantitative tracking of the long-term evolution of the fleet as new platforms are introduced and old ones are retired. Among the areas to be examined are interoperability concepts, force architecture impact studies, Long Range Shipbuilding Schedule (LRSS) support, and operational employment concept studies.

                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>The overall goal is to conduct analysis to support the Navy decisions needed to turn strategy and guidance into the Fleet needed within acceptable risk.
The May 2007 revision of the Joint Chiefs of Staff's Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) instruction (CJCSI 3170.01F) requires a Capabilities-Based Assessment (CBA) to assess new requirements. A CBA instruction has been developed by the Chief Navy Office's warfare integration office that prescribes a procedure and structure to this warfighting requirements generation process (JCIDS). A CBA is required to address and validate capability shortfalls or gaps as defined by combatant commanders. It is an analytical process that includes three phases: the Functional Area Analysis, the Functional Needs Analysis, and the Functional Solution Analysis. This process is designed to address future warfighting requirements and analysis needs and improve the quality of Analysis of Alternatives. CBA supports Navy programming decisions and provides the means to develop the analytic underpinning to support the determination of Naval capabilities and force structure recapitalization investments required to fulfill the Maritime Strategy.
-The overall goal is to conduct analysis to support the Navy decisions needed to turn strategy and guidance into the Fleet needed within acceptable risk. METRIC: Risks are balanced
across capability that delivers the right capabilities within the resources available to Navy. Navy Assessment Program supports the development of platform specific studies and
Capability-Based Assessments, an analytical effort resulting in Functional Area Analysis, Functional Needs Analysis, and Functional Solutions Analysis. Efforts provide added
analytical rigor relative to program's maturation under the Joint Capabilities, Integration, and Development System and support warfare integration initiatives.
-Navy Standard Scenarios with Warfare and Warfare Support Analyses: Goal: To ensure that essential elements of warfare analyses, including scenarios, operational concepts, tactics,
capabilities of platforms and systems (for Navy, Joint, coalition and threat forces), key assumptions and input data are defined and traceable to government approved source material.
METRIC: Consistency with other ongoing analyses as directed, develop Measures of Performance and Measures of Effectiveness and recommend appropriate modeling/methodology to
support analysis. Models/methodology used reflect study objects, level of fidelity required and time constraints.
-Capability Based Assessments with Campaign Mission Analyses Analytical and Technical Support: Goal: To provide analyses and technical and engineering support including, but not
limited to, joint campaign analysis that examines the ability to counter a range of coordinated threat capabilities, high level tradeoffs between service capabilities, or impact of largescale
architecture, force structure of modernization decision; mission-level effectiveness analyses to determine system capabilities; analyses of alternative force structures to determine
ability to meet peacetime deployment or steady-state requirements and respond to transition to war and contingency operations; cost-effectiveness and analyses; Acquisition Category
Program Office and Systems Command assessments; and analyses of new technologies. METRIC: Develop analysis plans; determine proposed alternatives for analysis; and research
performance data on current and future threats, coalition and own force systems; perform technology investigations and forecasts; develop or obtain cost data for current or planned
systems; develop and use Cost Estimating Relationships to determine cost for conceptual or future systems for which no cost data is available; identify analysis assumptions, limitations
and uncertainties; use established models or develop new models or methodologies to perform analyses; and interpret and analyze results.
-Campaign Analysis-Modeling and Simulation: Goal: Develop and maintain a standard set of models for use in warfare analyses and analyses performed to support Planning Strategy
that work at the campaign, mission, and engagement levels. METRIC: A combination of model design statements, model study reports, system specifications, updated model reports,
model/database documents, model verification and validation plans, code, and Plan of Action and Milestones reports developed or updated that encompass all aspects of Sea Power 21
to include at a minimum air, land, sea, and Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance.
-Joint Assessments and Integration and Investment Strategy Development: Goal: Conduct assessments to determine shortfalls and redundancies in existing or planned operational or
support capabilities; identify key issues including deficiencies in war fighting capability; determine priorities for needed capabilities; assesses affordability of high payoff systems
and technologies; assess effectiveness and affordability of alternative force structures; and formulate investment strategies. Continue development and refinement of Navy program
planning to determine the war fighting wholeness and cost effectiveness of alternative Navy strategies. METRIC: Identify shortfalls and redundancies in existing or planned capabilities.
Determine the impact of variations in warfare systems and architectures in threat, U.S. and combined forces and strategies. Provide engineering and analytic support for the assessment
and transition of technology for use in the Investment Strategy.
-World Class Modeling (WCM), Simulation, and Capability Analysis: Goal: Development of new models or model upgrades to meet requirements identified by the WCM requirements
process that support the Program Objective Memorandum decision-making process, with the goal of creating a state-of-the art set of models for use in warfare and warfare support
analyses. METRIC: Develop model design documents, model study reports, system specifications, updated model reports, model documentation, model verification and validation
plans, code, Plan of Action and Milestones reports, and technical reports.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Develops and implements architecture-based systems engineering processes, methods and tools that assure integrated and interoperable systems are delivered to the fleet.  This project provides the mission-oriented technical basis for implementing capability-based acquisition management within the Navy to engineer and field Navy and Marine Corps combat systems, weapon systems, and command, control, communications, computers and intelligence (C4I) programs that must operate as  family-of-systems (FoS) or system-of-systems (SoS).  The focus of this project is on identifying the functions, relationships, and connections between systems at both the force and unit level and across warfare mission areas, and encompasses three key elements:  Systems Engineering to provide the framework for making engineering decisions by war fighting capability at the FoS/SoS level and supports consistent engineering and investment decision-making across Navy and Marine Corps programs within capability-based acquisition portfolios.  Naval Collaborative Engineering Environment development and implementation as a DON enterprise resource for Naval integration and interoperability information to enable collaboration and decision support among Fleet organizations, Program Executive Offices, Program Managers, Systems Commands, prime contractors, Resource/Warfare Sponsors and Comptroller organizations.  Standards, Policies and Guidelines engineering and technical staff to implement DoN, Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and Joint integration and interoperability and Anti-Tamper initiatives.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Standards, Policy, and Guidelines: - Alignment of SPGs across the Naval Enterprise and with OSD and Joint organizations will support standard acquisition implementation and improve compatibility and interoperability thereby lowering development and maintenance costs across programs												
- Aggregating systems for the purpose of conducting certification and accreditation and consolidating mandatory documentation for aggregations versus individual systems will optimize (cost tradeoffs and focus on high priority issues) certifications, reduce paperwork and associated costs, and put attention on systems engineering, IA, and ISPs for systems in their aggregated operational state vice just the individual system development state.   Document costs for major programs are $1 to $3.5 Million per system.  An aggregation may include 15 or more systems with four or more being major systems.  Aggregation presents a high potential for Return on Investment.												
- NR-KPP processes will clarify requirements and capabilities (including their metrics) that acquisition programs need to develop systems.  This clarification will eliminate guesses in terms of operational needs, thereby reducing the risk of program failure and reducing program and life-cycle costs.

						Initial year of a concerted effort to modernize electronics science and technology laboratories, equipment, and specialized facilities.  Existing NRL buildings will be renovated in order to relocate critical electronics S&amp;T equipment and specialized laboratories from space that has reached a significant level of maintenance and operational disruption and failure due to advanced age (45 year old building) and inability to sustain and modernize with scientists and researchers in place.

The vast majority of these items represent fixed costs associated with Scientists and Engineers supporting the Navy's Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Programs.  

The Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) Billings project 2353 funds accounting services provided to ONR and Navy Research and Development (R&amp;D) activities.

The decrease in the Office of Naval Research Navy ERP project 3234 is due to reduced costs associated with the initial stand-up of N-ERP.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This continuing program provides support for ships and aircraft required to accommodate Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) of new systems. The RDT&amp;E ship and aircraft inventory is required to adequately test new and improved weapon systems, stay current with threats, and increase warfighting capability of the fleet. The program provides integrated logistics support for aircraft at selected field activities; provides depot-level rework of aircraft, engines, and components for the Navy inventory of RDT&amp;E aircraft; and provides support for ships and aircraft bailed to contractors for Navy RDT&amp;E projects. Costs covered under this element include aircrew training and proficiency, fuel, supplies, equipment, repair, Aviation Depot Level Repairables, overhaul of ships and aircraft, as well as organizational, intermediate, and depot maintenance of ships and aircraft in the Navy RDT&amp;E inventory.

JUSTIFICATION FOR BUDGET ACTIVITY: This program is funded under RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, TEST and EVALUATION MANAGEMENT SUPPORT because it supports efforts directed toward sustaining or modernizing installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) Aircraft Support. This continuing project funds costs associated with RDT&amp;E fixed and rotary wing aircraft which accommodate test and evaluation of aircraft/weapon systems. Testing aboard these platforms reduces the number of fleet units required to support RDT&amp;E efforts.  Included in these costs are Aviation Depot-Level Repairables (AVDLR), which are spare and replacement aircraft parts and components to support overhead maintenance related flight operations, aircrew training, and proficiency flight hours. This project also funds airframe Standard Depot Level Maintenance (SDLM), the Integrated Maintenance Concept (IMC) and Phased Depot Maintenance (PDM), in-service repairs, emergency repairs, and engine repairs, as well as aircraft material condition and field inspections. Additionally, it funds Individual Material Readiness List (IMRL) tools and support equipment, and other systems for application to and compatibility with RDT&amp;E requirements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides for the maintenance of Hull Mechanical and Electrical (HM&amp;E) and installed Combat Systems of the Self-Defense Test Ship (SDTS) in support of the Navy Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) of ship self-defense systems. Testing aboard this ship reduces the number of fleet units required to support RDT&amp;E efforts. 

SDTS provides the capability to safely test self-defense weapon systems within their minimum range. A major cost of this project is regularly scheduled ship, combat system and remote control maintenance. The remainder of the funds is used for purchase of expendable supplies and routine equipment, fuel and petroleum products, and repairs and supporting services. Most costs are fixed and are associated with simply having this platform in the inventory.

This project will no longer provide for the maintenance installed Combat Systems of the SDTS (FY14 forward), funding has been moved to the 3206 line.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The T&amp;E Enterprise consolidates all Air Warfare (AW) Ship Self Defense (SSD) at-sea testing across multiple class ships, beginning with CVN 74, LHD 8, LPD17, LSD 41/49, LHA 6, DDG 1000, CVN 78, and Littoral Combat Ship (LCS). This consolidated AW SSD test and evaluation approach meets the Probability of Raid Annihilation (PRA) (PRA is defined as a required surface ship defense against Anti-Ship Cruise Missiles), Self Defense Test Ship (SDTS) testing requirements as outlined in Air Warfare Ship Self Defense Enterprise TEMP 1714, and lead/operational ship testing requirements for ESSM TEMP 1471, RAM Blk 2 TEMP 286-1, DDG 1000 TEMP 1560, CVN 78 TEMP 1610, CEC TEMP 1415, SSDS TEMP 1400, LHA 6 TEMP 1697, AN/SPQ-9B TEMP 1463, SEWIP TEMP 1658 (Block 1A), 0686, and LCS TEMP 1695.

LHA 6 acquisition, installation and testing supports all big deck Amphibs and Carriers in the OA configuration as well as RAM BLK 2 OPEVAL, SSDS OA with RAM BLK 2, First non AEGIS SEWIP and ESSM.

This project provides for the maintenance installed Combat Systems of the SDTS (FY14 forward).

The T&amp;E Enterprise merges common ship, element, and system requirements into the least number of test events while leveraging planned Combat System Ship Qualification Trials (CSSQTs) to accomplish Developmental Testing (DT) and Operational Testing (OT) requirements. All tests on the SDTS require the sharing of infrastructure, missile range allocations, execution time and underway time to eliminate duplicative testing.

T&amp;E Enterprise preserves end-to-end mission Operational Testing in a realistic operational environment, capitalizing on Probability of Raid Annihilation M&amp;S data validated with results of that Operational Testing, and ensuring a consistent approach across ship classes. Applicability of all test events is beneficial across multiple ship classes with the same variation under test.

The T&amp;E Enterprise acquires equipment (FY12-14) for installation onboard the SDTS (FY12-15), conducts test and evaluation on the SDTS and lead/operational ships (FY12-18) and satisfies the Probability of Raid Annihilation (PRA) Testbed Model Development and test execution requirements (FY12-18).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

						The Enterprise conducted ET-03 on the SDTS in the October - November 2011.  Results from the event spawned a failure review board (FRB) to examine system of system (SoS) observations from the test.  As a result of the FRB, ET-05 which had been planned for Q4FY12 - Q1FY13 has been split into two test periods (Q4FY12-Q1FY13 and Q4FY13-Q1FY14).  

The Enterprise planned on the SDTS entering dry dock availability in August 2011 but due to contacting delays and a protest of the eventual award, the SDTS did not enter the shipyard until January 2012. Upon completion of dry dock which is now scheduled for August 2013, the SDTS will participate in ET-05. 

The PRA testbed completed DT 6 and DT 6.5 adding new and newly matured software capability to the federate.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>JUSTIFICATION FOR BUDGET ACTIVITY: This program is funded under RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, TEST and EVALUATION MANAGEMENT SUPPORT because it supports efforts directed toward sustaining or modernizing installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation.

This program provides institutional maintenance and operations support for:  the Naval Undersea Warfare Center Detachment Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center (AUTEC), Andros Island, Bahamas; the Environmental Compliance Program; Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD), Point Mugu and China Lake, CA; Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD), Patuxent River, MD; Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) related capabilities at the Pacific Missile Range Facility, Barking Sands, HI; Maintenance and  Repair at NAWCWD, NAWCAD, and AUTEC; and the Naval Undersea Warfare Center Keyport Nanoose and Dabob Bay Ranges.  The T&amp;E activities make up the Navy portion of the Department of Defense's Major Range and Test Facility Base.  These activities are chartered to perform T&amp;E for the development and acquisition of technology advanced weapons systems.  Core T&amp;E capabilities and capacity are operated to obtain weapons system performance documentation for acquisition program milestone decisions to provide operational forces with effective weapons systems.  This program provides Navy Acquisition Program Managers required test capabilities; lowers cost of T&amp;E; removes cost and scheduling impact of providing their own T&amp;E resources; and retains the physical airspace, land space and sea space needed to conduct testing.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>As a detachment of Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Division Newport, the mission of the Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center (AUTEC) is to provide the US Navy an underwater range facility for full-spectrum test and evaluation of Undersea Warfare systems and for Fleet training and readiness assessment.  The AUTEC Program Office is headquartered at Newport, RI.  AUTEC's administrative offices are located at West Palm Beach, Florida.  Test facilities are located at Andros Island, Sites 1 through 4, and the Berry Islands in the Bahamas.  AUTEC aircraft make scheduled daily flights between West Palm Beach and Andros Town Airport.  

AUTEC manages and, under service contract, maintains and operates a 500 square nautical miles deep-water and a 100 square nautical miles shallow-water acoustic tracking range; air-target tracking capabilities; sonobuoy simulation systems; electronic warfare threat simulation systems; rotary wing aircraft; aircraft ground support facilities; acoustic targets; torpedo retrieval and flushing capabilities; open-ocean range craft; marine support facilities; and data processing and analysis capabilities.  

Major test facilities on Andros Island are located at Site 1.  The Command Control Building houses the range tracking displays and replay centers, the computer center, operations support functions, communications center, and the central timing system. The Range Support Facility houses a torpedo post-run workshop, Mark 46 /Mark 50 lightweight torpedo Intermediate Maintenance Activity (IMA), a Mark 30 undersea target IMA, a Mark 48 heavyweight torpedo Research and Development Turnaround facility and related technical facilities. The complex includes electrical and physical calibration labs, a complete electronics maintenance shop, a dive locker, a precision machine shop, and logistics support areas.

AUTEC has a 285-foot concrete pier with a controlling depth of 17 feet (5.2 meters) at mean low tide. An adjacent wharf is approximately 240 feet in length (72 meters) with a controlling depth of 15 feet at mean low tide.  Power is available at both locations.  Facilities at the pier/marine area include fully equipped machine /fabrication and marine overhaul shops.  Also at Site 1, six Range User Buildings are maintained  for assembling test equipment and equipment check-out during test mobilization or dockside periods. These staging areas are equipped with a variety of power sources, gantry cranes, compressed air and security features. A fully equipped range user hanger for ground maintenance and storage of helicopters is located at the AUTEC helicopter airstrip.  Sites 2, 3, and 4 are small instrumented areas located south of Site 1 used to extend tracking of sonobuoys, communications, and air target track.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project provides continuing maintenance and operational support for the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) capabilities.  These capabilities include the Pacific Ranges and Facilities, consisting of China Lake Ranges and the Point Mugu Sea Range, aerial and surface targets, test instrumentation, and T&amp;E aircraft.  The Pacific Ranges use China Lake's 1.1 million acres of land and 17,000 square miles of military restricted (R-2508) airspace together with Point Mugu's 125,000 square miles of instrumented sea range and 36,000 square miles of controlled overlying airspace, and airfield and test instrumentation at San Nicolas Island to perform its T&amp;E mission.  Included in the China Lake ranges is the Electronic Combat Range (ECR), which provides outdoor free space development and operational testing of airborne electronic warfare systems and tactics against shipboard and land based air defense systems. These ranges perform metric radar, multilateration and optical  tracking of test objects; command, control,  and destruct for range safety purposes; communications; frequency interference control and analysis; collection processing and display of telemetered data; real-time data processing and display; and the operation of a sub scale aerial target launch capability.  Other test capabilities include sled tracks, measurement facility; propulsion, warhead, environmental, rocket motor, and other missile component test facilities; and gun ranges.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element (PE) provides Commander, Operational Test and Evaluation Force (COMOPTEVFOR) general support funding for headquarters annual operating costs and ensures COMOPTEVFOR compliance with Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) and Secretary of the Navy (SECNAV) directives to conduct independent operational testing and evaluation. Funding supports planning, conducting, and reporting on the operational effectiveness and suitability of new and improved systems and recommending fleet usage to the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO). Funding also supports ongoing development and implementation of new requirements relative to integrated testing. The CNO, as well as acquisition executives and managers at all levels, have a continuing need for expeditious and efficient conduct of Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&amp;E) by COMOPTEVFOR in support of training and equipping fleet forces.  To this end, this funding supports COMOPTEVFOR's continued pursuit of a variety of senior management initiatives aimed at increasing efficiencies in T&amp;E; these senior management initiatives include IT database and decision making technology upgrades, implementation of Integrated Testing and Mission Based Test Design across all programs, and improved staffing and expertise in the areas of DON acquisition processes, Modeling and Simulation, Statistical Studies, Cost Analysis, Information Assurance, and similar disciplines. All of these senior management initiatives are aimed at improving the quality of testing and evaluation, thus ensuring delivery to fleet units of fully tested and capable combat systems.  OT&amp;E issues have direct long term Navy-wide implications on the Fleet's readiness and war fighting capability. Rapid advances in technology, changes in fleet tactics, and increased complexity of weapons systems and platforms, combined with reductions in manpower, force structure, and budgets have created an increased need for technical and operational analyses that are sophisticated and timely in order to ensure an optimal return on investment of Navy resources. Funding is also provided for Navy support of the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) sponsored Joint Test and Evaluation (JT&amp;E) program.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>As indicated in section A above, funding provides for core headquarters operations and support (O&amp;S) costs related to required operational testing and evaluation (T&amp;E) conducted in support of Navy acquisition programs. The preponderance of funding provides for the annual O&amp;S costs for day to day operations of the staff/headquarters of COMOPTEVFOR, located in Norfolk, Virginia. (Pursuant to DoD Financial Management Regulations and Navy financial policy guidance, as a T&amp;E activity, COMOPTEVFOR's annual support costs are funded via RDTEN vice OMN; hence, and unlike most RDTEN programs, these funds provide for O&amp;S costs typical of military field commands/activities). Within this project, over 1/2 of the funding supports salaries of assigned civilian personnel. The remaining funds provide for other routine support costs such as travel, IT support, supplies, and other overhead/administrative support costs. The primary metric used within the project involves support for scheduled Navy acquisition program testing and subsequent analysis and reporting of results of testing to appropriate senior Navy acquisition officials and to the Navy chain of command directly to the CNO and various OPNAV/SECNAV staff offices. The performance goal is met when all assigned/scheduled testing and reporting is supported each year. Specific test program success is measured through analytic results of testing conducted throughout the year and constant interaction with program offices, acquisition decision makers, OPNAV staff resource sponsor offices, OSD and other service T&amp;E offices/activities, and miscellaneous other customers/stakeholders. This project also supports testing and evaluation of various Joint/multi-service programs in which the Navy shares responsibilities in support of the acquisition community. The following metrics relate directly to the funding provided and are applicable to current operations.

As indicated in section A above, funding provides for core headquarters operations and support (O&amp;S) costs related to required operational testing and evaluation (T&amp;E) conducted in support of Navy acquisition programs. The preponderance of funding provides for the annual O&amp;S costs for day to day operations of the staff/headquarters of COMOPTEVFOR, located in Norfolk, Virginia. (Pursuant to DoD Financial Management Regulations and Navy financial policy guidance, as a T&amp;E activity, COMOPTEVFOR's annual support costs are funded via RDTEN vice OMN; hence, and unlike most RDT&amp;EN programs, these funds provide for O&amp;S costs typical of military field commands/activities). Within this project, over 1/2 of the funding supports salaries of assigned civilian personnel. The remaining funds provide for other routine support costs such as travel, IT support, supplies, and other overhead/administrative support costs. The primary metric used within the project involves support for scheduled Navy acquisition program testing and subsequent analysis and reporting of results of testing to appropriate senior Navy acquisition officials and to the Navy chain of command directly to the CNO and various OPNAV/SECNAV staff offices. The performance goal is met when all assigned/scheduled testing and reporting is supported each year. Specific test program success is measured through analytic results of testing conducted throughout the year and constant interaction with program offices, acquisition decision makers, OPNAV staff resource sponsor offices, OSD and other service T&amp;E offices/activities, and miscellaneous other customers/stakeholders. This project also supports testing and evaluation of various Joint/multi-service programs in which the Navy shares responsibilities in support of the acquisition community. The following metrics relate directly to the funding provided and are applicable to current operations.

						(a) Joint Emitters during Overseas Contingency Operations is a source of debilitating Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) to critical air operations and BMD assets.  Funding will be used to expand afloat and ashore spectrum management tools to address the critical need for interoperability. USN/USMC integration promotes interoperability with the multi-national deployed forces fighting the OCO and decreases the risk of friendly fire incidents. Increased situational awareness, reduction of interference, and restored mission capability are all expected benefits of the improved processes and procedures. The requested funds will deliver a Joint capability system that allows group planning and execution, information data discovery, data interoperability, and data fusion to USN and USMC forces directly supporting OCO OPS.  (AESOP=$2.2M)

(b) Develops advanced technology to identify and reduce EMI sources from Navy systems and platforms.  Supports both In-Theater &amp; Pre-Deployment support. Funding to address actions taken to restore units to a desired level of combat capability. Upgrades to deploying ships and development of EMI solution for the deploying strike group. This funding will be used to evaluate and mitigate potential EMI problems that may be introduced as the fleet continues to field additional variants of combat systems and commission new ships. Timely development of EMI solutions restores combat capability lost due to EMI. Evaluation of short-term and long-term EMI fix evaluation on deploying ships is required to determine optimum EMI solution. (SEMCIP=$3.0M)

						- Initiated and completed studies supporting resource and requirement decisions in the Planning, Programming,
and Budgeting Execution (PPBE) System; FORCEnet Fleet experiments; FORCEnet Architecture selection; evaluation of Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTP); alignment of Science and Technology (S&amp;T) and Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) efforts with FORCEnet requirements; evaluation and selection of Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) tools and scenarios.

SEWSAP (1) applied previously-developed models and analytical methods to identify areas of highest sensitivity in Command, Control, Communications (C3) performance, (2) extend previous architectural work on Naval operational functions and networks to detailed analyses of C3 and network requirements and, (3) extend previous system engineering results to newly emerging implementation issues.

- Initiated studies supporting resource and requirement decisions in the PPBE System. Conduct FORCEnet/Information Dominance Fleet experiments; FORCEnet/Information Dominance Architecture selection; evaluation of TTP and Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) efforts with FORCEnet/Information Dominance requirements. Begin evaluation of M&amp;S tools and scenarios.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>(U) Link Crimson (Navy TENCAP) is a congressionally directed program to conduct space-related R&amp;D in order to field integrated national-to-tactical system capabilities in response to OPLANS for PACOM and CENTCOM. TENCAP responds to the fleet's top, strategically important capability gaps within National systems and is the Navy's primary interface with the NRO and national agencies for the rapid fielding (12-18 months) of cutting edge technology. These include advanced sensors, onboard and ground processing, and integrated information fusion capabilities. Link Crimson supports operational missions in Enterprise ISR Convergence, Irregular Warfare, Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO), Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA), Information Operations (IO), Anti-Surface Warfare  (ASUW), Mine Warfare (MIW), Environmental Data (METOC), ISR Mgmt / Battlespace Awareness (BA). 

(U) This program is funded under Budget Activity 6 because it supports the operations and installations required for general research and development use.  Program baseline will also address research and development into Strategic Signals; Undersea and Irregular Warfare; Counter Unmanned Air Systems; Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination; Commercial Navigation Radar Threats; Maritime Intelligence Fusion; Open Ocean Surveillance; Threat Geo-location; and Command &amp; Control.  Link Crimson also supports and participates in Fleet exercises, which provide the venue for testing and demonstrating new prototype capabilities and enhancements. Link Crimson holistically develops warfighting capabilities by synchronizing insertion of technologies with existing Navy, joint, and national agency programs.    Additional detailed information is available at a higher level of classification.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>As established and directed under Marine Corps Order 3902.1D, the Marine Corps Studies System (MCSS),assigned solely to Operations Analysis Division (OAD), Marine Corps Combat Development Command, provides research and analyses to ensure a greater understanding of issues and alternatives concerning organizations, tactics, doctrine, policies, force plans, strategies, procedures, intelligence, weapon selection, systems' programs and resource allocation. In the MCSS, these topics are treated in both the Service and Joint contexts. Using the MCSS, the Marine Corps nominates, approves, commences, manages and distributes the resultant analytical products. MCSS study and analysis nominations are evaluated and selected on a quarterly basis. Research conducted produces comprehensive and integrated analyses aligned to Senior Leadership's requirements and decision timelines.  A 'call' for studies occurs quarterly and is targeted to a particular audience that understands USMC current and future mission requirements and the need for the comprehensive analyses that meets the Commandant's Strategic Goals, saves lives, and utilizes funds efficiently.</r2:Description>

						* Naval Engineering Capacity to Support Marine Corps Operations: Research quantified the current capacity and requirements of Naval engineering support to Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) operations along with future capacity requirements through 2025.  Identified the complementary capabilities, gaps, and perceived redundancies of Naval engineering capacity to support current Marine Corps operations through 2025 and provided alternative solutions that shape Naval engineering capacity to support MAGTF operations from the present state through 2025.

* Electronic Warfare Manpower Capability Analysis: Analyzed Electronic Warfare (EW) manpower, force structure, and training for both officer and enlisted Military Occupatiuonal Specialties (MOSs) to recommend the best alternatives for the distributed capabilities envisioned in the MAGTF Electronic Warfare Concept of Operations, to include: how to maintain aviation EW expertise within the MAGTF with elimination of the Electronic Countermeasures Officer (ECMO) MOS with the VMAQ squadrons; identify need to modify existing MOSs or creating new ones; assess the mix of officer and enlisted billets within the force structure across EW-related MOSs, and recommend force structure changes to VMU squadrons, providing a viable transition plan prior to VMAQ deactivation.

* Marine Corps Expeditionary Energy Modeling and Simulation Analysis Support: This effort entails the development of a comprehensive Modeling and Simulation framework to support the goals of the USMC Expeditionary Energy Strategy, mapping to the priorities set by the Expeditionary Energy Water Waste (E2W2) Capabilities Based Assessment/Initial Capabilities Document (CBA/ICD), and future Program Objective Memoranda (POM) investment plan.

* Deployment to Dwell Measurement Study: Provides the Commandant of the Marine Corps an accurate tool for measuring deployment-to-dwell ratios for USMC aviation units and aides in the determination of force allocations in response to requests for USMC forces by the Joint Staff and the Secretary of Defense.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Marine Corps Operational Test and Evaluation Activity (MCOTEA) supports the material acquisition process by managing the Marine Corps Operational Test (OT) programs for Acquisition Categories (ACAT) I through ACAT IV (less OT of manned aircraft) and performs other functions that may be directed by the Commandant of the Marine Corps. The primary purpose of Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&amp;E) is to provide information to the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) regarding the Operational Effectiveness (OE) and Operational Suitability (OS) of the system addressed at a decision point. MCOTEA must ensure that the Marines in the Operating Forces receive the very best possible equipment and support. MCOTEA must also ensure each system proposed for acquisition is tested adequately, evaluated objectively and reported independently.

Marine Corps Operational Test and Evaluation Activity (MCOTEA) is the only unit that provides the Marine Corps with required operational test and evaluation (OT&amp;E) capability, ensuring the Marine Corps is compliant with laws and regulations, and ensuring that training and equipment are operationally effective, relevant, and suitable. Additionally, MCOTEA's early involvement, coordination, and oversight in developmental testing and evaluation of new combat and combat support systems ensures that our Marines are the best trained, and have the best equipment, with the lowest test costs for taxpayers. Finally, MCOTEA's support of rapid acquisitions ensures that Marines in the fight are supported with the newest and most advanced equipment and that the Marine Corps is compliant with regulations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

					Enhancement reflects compliance with Office of Federal Procurement (OFPP) Policy Letter 11-01 by preserving inherently governmental and critical Operational Test &amp; Evaluation (OT&amp;E) capability. This enhancement also captures a significant portion of direct OT&amp;E costs which were previously reflected in program exhibits. As a result, program offices will avoid a significant portion of these direct OT&amp;E costs through the FYDP.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Family of Incident Response Systems (FIRS) consists of equipment, systems, and services designed to provide Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) incident response forces the capabilities needed to effectively respond to a terrorist attack using Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High-Yield Explosives (CBRNE). FIRS meets the mission requirements for the detection; mass casualty decontamination; force protection; responder inter-agency interoperability; C4I; urban search and rescue; medical and general support requirements needed by these forces to mitigate the effects of a CBRNE terrorist attack. FIRS relies primarily on Commercial Off-The-Shelf/Non-Developmental Items (COTS/NDI) equipment and systems that meet the particular mission requirements of Consequence Management (CM). Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical (NBC) systems are adopted if they meet the CM mission requirements. FIRS R&amp;D effort allows the program to keep abreast of emerging technologies in the commercial sector and address operational capability gaps that cannot be met by commercial items.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Phase A (previously known as Phase 0) Activities consist of a series of interrelated activities of the acquisition process designed to investigate potential material solutions to validate needs, estimate program costs, support sound business decisions, correct inherent disconnects between the Programming, Planning, Budgeting and Execution (PPBE) cycle, the Combat Development and Acquisition Management Systems, and prevent undue delays in pursuing priority requirements. The process supports Commanding General (CG), MCCDC and Commander, Marine Corps Systems Command (COMMARCORSYSCOM) by providing funding to priority programs, thus allowing for the examination of concepts and alternatives to support an orderly transition from requirements to initiatives and initiatives to funded programs. This will permit the POM process to focus on activities of evaluating, prioritizing and integrating rather than defining and resolving raw, immature requirements.  

Phase A activities "jump start" high priority programs of the acquisition process. Furthermore, since 70% of a program's life cycle cost is determined during Phase A, this initiative puts resources to work where the return on investment is the greatest. Typical studies conducted on Phase A activities include, but are not limited to Market Surveys, Business Case Analysis (BCA), Cost as an Independent Variable (CAIV) analysis, Life Cycle Cost Estimates, Cost Comparison Analysis, Acquisition Strategies, and Trade-off Analysis in lieu of an Analysis of Alternatives.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>
