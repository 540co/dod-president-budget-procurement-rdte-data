                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Partner Outreach and Collaboration Support (POCS); formerly: Regional International Outreach (RIO) - PfP Information Management System (PIMS), is an Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) initiative.  The focus of the program is a common information technology platform (GlobalNET) to improve international partner outreach and collaboration efforts in a federated environment. A federated environment â€“ characterized by the capacity of DoD institutions and Partners to directly share participants and content across proprietary community websites - fostering networks of partner influencers and enabling better use of DoD resources through collaboration among the Regional Centers for Security Studies, PfP and international partners, other DoD educational institutions and communities. GlobalNET currently support over 60,000 users. The program uses spiral methodology to speed the delivery of open source collaboration technologies the user community. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) oversees execution of the research and development of the GlobalNET effort and its operations, and ensures that the program addresses DoD security cooperation requirements in the context of defense, interagency, and international information sharing and collaboration needs.

The GlobalNET effort focuses on improving collaboration, supporting outreach efforts, and enabling communication among the Regional Centers for Security Studies, the Combatant Commanders, the DSCA, OUSD (Policy), North Atlantic Treaty Organizationâ€™s (NATO) Military Partnerships Directorate (MPD), the PfP Consortium of Defense Academies, PfP Partner countries, and other DoD institutions and communities. It provides DoD and international partner security practitioners a platform to share information, communicate and collaborate globally 24/7, and supports administrative activities. It provides the ability to form collaborative communities of interest around security issues. GlobalNET facilitates information sharing and knowledge management concepts in accordance with U.S. policy. POCS implements the Congressional endorsement for the modernization of Defense capabilities in eligible PfP countries relative to their telecommunications infrastructure, and provides allies and partner countries the ability to team in critical cooperative activities that underpin the spirit of the PfP program.  The program supports PfP coalition initiatives through the development of distributive collaboration tools to assist U.S./NATO-approved PfP cooperative activities.  This support is important to achieve the interoperability/integration outlined in the Guidance for the Employment of the Force.  POCS supports internet-based education, collaboration, exercise simulations, and training center requirements. 

The Regional Centers Person/Activity Management System (RCPAMS) provides an integrated student and activities management framework that was designed to complement the capabilities of the Security Assistance Network (SAN). The sharing of data between the SAN, RCPAMS, and GlobalNET provides faculty and students an effective information service  to ensure student, activity, and alumni management.  Information will be shared between the systems improving data integrity.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The focus of the program is a common information technology platform (GlobalNET) to improve international partner outreach and collaboration efforts in a federated environment. A federated environment â€“ characterized by the capacity of DoD institutions and Partners to directly share participants and content across proprietary community websites - fostering networks of partner influencers and enabling better use of DoD resources through collaboration among the Regional Centers for Security Studies, PfP and international partners, other DoD educational institutions and communities. GlobalNET currently support over 60,000 users.  The program uses spiral methodology to speed the delivery of open source collaboration technologies the user community. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) oversees execution of the research and development of the GlobalNET effort and its operations, and ensures that the program addresses DoD security cooperation requirements in the context of defense, interagency, and international information sharing and collaboration needs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Because of all of the advanced graphics and expansion of the user base, it is expected that we will need this additional capacity and the best plan to distribute it out to an alternate location.

Ensure that discovery is much easier including adding the capability to refine search results using a keyword based refinement methodology.  The amount of data the system will be collecting dictates greater refinement of the search results.  In addition, build the capability to allow the users to refine the data by multiple folders. 

Re-engineer the security model to allow much greater granular permission on functions.  The current model does not allow permissions down to the activity level and that is need as more users are starting to restrict access to functions. 

Re-engineer the email integration capabilities.  Put more control on the content of sent emails and well as greater capabilities to receive emails and incorporated them into the system as natively entered data elements.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The GlobalNET effort employs a spiral acquisition strategy ensuring a well-defined model for each institution/community that can be exported globally.  The program uses a regional approach to ensure sustainable, leave-behind technology and information sharing procedures.  By partnering with other U.S. Government activities, existing assets are leveraged to preserve U.S. investments, avoid duplication of effort between activities, and offer economically prudent solutions to improve information sharing and achieve U.S. security cooperation goals.  Independent Operational Test teams are brought on to ensure that GlobalNET bears independent validation of the development teamâ€™s effort.  GlobalNET has regional based personnel to assist partners who are not familiar with social collaboration and networking media.  RCPAMS uses a similar spiral, testing, and fielding approach.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>POCS  development performance is measured in several methods: the successful meeting of stated performance objectives in the statement of work, and meeting target dates in the project management plan; via a combination of statistics including the number of trouble tickets generated on the development site, operational user feedback on development site usability, and design; and the systemâ€™s performance during developmental and operational testing.   The use of a 3rd party to execute the operational test ensures that the system meets the performance metrics prior to moving to production.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Overseas Humanitarian Assistance Shared Information System (OHASIS) provides stakeholders of DoD Humanitarian Assistance (HA) programs, including embassy staff, the Combatant Commands, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA), and a broad range of Department of Defense and interagency partners, the capability to manage, support, and visualize Overseas Humanitarian, Disaster, and Civic Aid (OHDACA) funded projects on a web-based map display, in addition to automating report generation, providing tools to coordinate with Interagency and partner nation stakeholders, and perform a variety of analyses.

Under the direction of DSCA, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Army Geospatial Center (AGC) is responsible for the entire lifecycle--from system definition to development, support, training, and product improvement of OHASIS. The AGC has been responsible for the OHASIS system since 2005 and has evolved it to the present 2.3 system, which contains more than 15,000 active projects (6,000 of which have been completed) valued at more than $2.1 billion, with a community of over 6,000 users. The OHASIS system is a critical and mission essential means for thousands of military and civilian users to develop, staff, coordinate, approve, fund, implement, manage, and evaluate projects intended to assist the Combatant Commands in accomplishing theater campaign plan objectives and achieve strategic ends states in support of U.S. national security and foreign policy interests.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Overseas Humanitarian Assistance Shared Information System (OHASIS) provides stakeholders of DoD Humanitarian Assistance (HA) programs, including embassy staff, the Combatant Commands, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA), and a broad range of Department of Defense and  interagency partners, the capability to manage, support, and visualize Overseas Humanitarian, Disaster, and Civic Aid (OHDACA) funded projects on a web-based map display, in addition to  automating report generation, providing tools to coordinate with Interagency and partner nation stakeholders, and perform a variety of analyses. 

Under the direction of DSCA, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Army Geospatial Center (AGC) is responsible for the entire lifecycle--from system definition to development, support, training, and product improvement of OHASIS. The AGC has been responsible for the OHASIS system since 2005 and has evolved it to the present 2.3 system, which contains more than 15,000 active projects (6,000 of which have been completed) valued at more than $2.1 billion, with a community of over 6,000 users. The OHASIS system is a critical and mission essential means for thousands of military and civilian users to develop, staff, coordinate, approve, fund, implement, manage, and evaluate projects intended to assist the Combatant Commands in accomplishing theater campaign plan objectives and achieve strategic ends states in support of U.S. national security and foreign policy interests.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This strategy also will continue to leverage industry standard technologies for web development, database technology, database modeling, geographic information systems, reporting, and documentation.  As additional users require the system, it will continue to be developed with scalability and maintainability as key considerations.  Additionally, this capability will help DoD better collaborate and support external agencies and their programs by leveraging the web services that have been designed in the initial baseline.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Global Theater Security Cooperation Management information System (G-TSCMIS) Program is an Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) initiative to develop and deploy a common web-based, centrally hosted Management Information System (MIS) that will serve as the information focus point for the Nationâ€™s Security Cooperation (SC) efforts by providing decision makers, SC planners and other users with the ability to view, manage, assess, and report SC activities and events. G-TSCMIS will consolidate, improve upon, and replace legacy TSCMIS solutions hosted at over 20 Department of Defense (DoD) Services, Agencies, and Combatant Commands (CCDRs). It will provide a comprehensive picture of whole-of-government SC activities, and will contribute to planning more effective cooperative security activities to align or meet desired outcomes in support of SC end states. The program is an evolutionary rapid Information Technology (IT) acquisition pilot program, as described in FY 2010 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) Section 804, that provides users at every user command with greater capability through several iterations and releases that are developed and implemented over time. The Department of Navy (DoN) was assigned acquisition lead for the effort by Deputy Secretary of Defense (DEPSECDEF).

G-TSCMIS is a fully interoperable component of Adaptive Planning and Execution (APEX) and the DoD Joint C2 (JC2) Capability. The effort will support the strategic planning of CCDRs by providing access to reports of programs, activities, events, funding, assessments, and status of achieving defined end states. G-TSCMIS will provide visualization, assessment, reporting, and data management throughout the conduct of SC activities planning and execution phases. Information from the SC activities will be binned by separate SC programs, budget lines/funding streams, equipment drawdown, etc. This will enable users at the tactical level to focus on specific programs, participating forces, events, and activities, while users at the strategic level will be able to access summary reports of geographic regions, resource requirements, or total expenditure of funds by source. G-TSCMIS support to DoD's SC reporting requirements is mandated by federal law for many SC programs and activities. To adhere to U.S. regulations, G-TSCMIS reports will be tailored to include programs, events, and activities by category, geographical areas, assessments, U.S. staffing levels, and sources of funding.

G-TSCMIS will interface with other systems, such as Joint Training Information Management System (JTIMS), Overseas Humanitarian Assistance Shared Info System (OHASIS), and Global Force Management - Data Initiative (GFM-DI). G-TSCMIS must also be interoperable with the other United States Government (USG) foreign assistance and international cooperation information systems. G-TSCMIS will allow decision makers and analysts to identify redundant investments, plan more effective engagements, and find gaps and opportunities for building more capable partners. The program uses multiple, rapidly executed releases of capability beginning with a Milestone B equivalent initial build decision held in Quarter 1 FY 2012, which resulted in approval from the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) to enter the Incremental and Iterative Development and Deployment (IIDD) phase. The initial releases require defined objectives and mature technology. Based on analysis of required capabilities and resources, the Program Office is planning on executing G-TSCMIS in four major releases, each with three iterations (except Release 4), across the period of FY 2012-FY 2018.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Global Theater Security Cooperation Management information System (G-TSCMIS) Program is an Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) initiative to develop and deploy a common web-based, centrally hosted Management Information System (MIS) that will serve as the information focus point for the Nationâ€™s Security Cooperation (SC) efforts by providing decision makers, SC planners and other users with the ability to view, manage, assess, and report SC activities and events. G-TSCMIS will consolidate, improve upon, and replace legacy TSCMIS solutions hosted at over 20 Department of Defense (DoD) Services, Agencies, and Combatant Commands (CCDRs). It will provide a comprehensive picture of whole-of-government SC activities, and will contribute to planning more effective cooperative security activities to align or meet desired outcomes in support of SC end states. The program is an evolutionary rapid Information Technology (IT) acquisition pilot program, as described in FY 2010 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) Section 804, that provides users at every user command with greater capability through several iterations and releases that are developed and implemented over time. The Department of Navy (DoN) was assigned acquisition lead for the effort by Deputy Secretary of Defense (DEPSECDEF).

G-TSCMIS is a fully interoperable component of Adaptive Planning and Execution (APEX) and the DoD Joint C2 (JC2) Capability. The effort will support the strategic planning of CCDRs by providing access to reports of programs, activities, events, funding, assessments, and status of achieving defined end states. G-TSCMIS will provide visualization, assessment, reporting, and data management throughout the conduct of SC activities planning and execution phases. Information from the SC activities will be binned by separate SC programs, budget lines/funding streams, equipment drawdown, etc. This will enable users at the tactical level to focus on specific programs, participating forces, events, and activities, while users at the strategic level will be able to access summary reports of geographic regions, resource requirements, or total expenditure of funds by source. G-TSCMIS support to DoD's SC reporting requirements is mandated by federal law for many SC programs and activities. To adhere to U.S. regulations, G-TSCMIS reports will be tailored to include programs, events, and activities by category, geographical areas, assessments, U.S. staffing levels, and sources of funding.

G-TSCMIS will interface with other systems, such as Joint Training Information Management System (JTIMS), Overseas Humanitarian Assistance Shared Info System (OHASIS), and Global Force Management - Data Initiative (GFM-DI). G-TSCMIS must also be interoperable with the other United States Government (USG) foreign assistance and international cooperation information systems. G-TSCMIS will allow decision makers and analysts to identify redundant investments, plan more effective engagements, and find gaps and opportunities for building more capable partners. The program uses multiple, rapidly executed releases of capability beginning with a Milestone B equivalent initial build decision held in Quarter 1 FY 2012, which resulted in approval from the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) to enter the Incremental and Iterative Development and Deployment (IIDD) phase. The initial releases require defined objectives and mature technology. Based on analysis of required capabilities and resources, the Program Office is planning on executing G-TSCMIS in five major releases, each with three iterations, across the period of FY 2012-FY 2021.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>G-TSCMIS will follow the Rapid IT Acquisition approach as detailed in Section 804 of the 2010 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). G-TSCMIS will initiate an evolutionary and iterative development process for a software-only solution using multiple, rapidly executed releases of capability beginning with a Build Decision in FY2012 and enter the Incremental and Iterative Development and Deployment (IIDD) phase. Once fielded and operational on both NIPR and SIPR, users will access G- TSCMIS over a web browser with information on a centralized server. The development period is planned for FY 2012 through FY 2020. G-TSCMIS contracting used fair opportunity competitive procedures on the Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) MAC for Releases 1 and 2, and fair and open competition for the Release 3 contract. Barriers to competition were minimized by using performance and functional specifications and equivalent commercial standards. Releases 4 and 5 will continue to be completed by separate contract(s). Either another IDIQ MAC or MACs will be used or a new contract or contracts will be created for the final two releases.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>G-TSCMIS performance is measured in several outcome-based methods. The JC2 Capability Definition Package produced by JS J6 defines the Key Performance Parameters (KPP) and Key System Attributes (KSA) to be met. JS J6 also approved specific Measures of Effectiveness and Measures of Performance (MOE/MOP), establishing thresholds and objectives for G-TSCMIS software to meet. Successful meeting of stated performance objectives in the statement of work, and meeting cost, schedule and performance targets as defined in the G-TSCMIS Acquisition Program Baseline are key metrics for the program.  The use of participating Service Operational Test Agencies to perform operational testing ensures G-TSCMIS meets the performance metrics prior to making the software operational. Additional statistics-based metrics, trouble tickets logged by the Service Desk, operational user feedback and IV&amp;V and Developmental tests validate system performance.
