                <r2:ProgramElementNote>The National Security Science and Engineering Faculty Fellowship (NSSEFF) program was realigned from the National Defense Education Program (NDEP), Program Element (PE) 0601120D8Z, to PE 0601110D8Z, project code P060, in fiscal year (FY) 2015.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Supporting basic research provides the DoD with a deep and broad awareness of current directions in areas of research important to U.S. military capabilities – including physics and the physical sciences, materials science, chemistry and chemical engineering, electrical engineering, mathematics, computer science, mechanical and aerodynamic engineering, ocean sciences, biological sciences, and the social sciences, among others.  Basic research sustains scientific and engineering communities as it generates the critical technical underpinnings of DoD capabilities.  Basic research allows exploration and discovery, yielding disruptive non-incremental advances that can improve or radically change military capabilities, strategy, and operations.  

The Basic Research Initiatives PE supports the defense basic research enterprise in three critical areas:  Strategic Support for Basic Research (SSBR), the Minerva Research Initiative, and the National Security Science and Engineering Faculty Fellowship (NSSEFF) program.

Strategic Support for Basic Research (SSBR) supports initiatives to implement the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD(R&amp;E))’s strategic plan for defense basic research.  This plan defines specific and quantifiable actions to help create conditions for defense basic research investments capable of creating high-payoff, transformative scientific breakthroughs for DoD.  SSBR initiatives support the five aims of:  (1) providing scientific leadership; (2) attracting the Nation’s best Scientists and Engineers (S&amp;Es); (3) ensuring the coherence and balance of the Basic Research portfolio; (4) fostering connections between DoD performers and DoD; and (5) improving the efficiency of the defense research business environment.

The Minerva Research Initiative, a defense-wide basic research program in the social sciences directed by the OSD and executed by the Services, seeks to build a deeper understanding of the social, cultural, and political forces that shape the U.S. security interests around the world.  Deeper understanding of the social and cultural environments, where threats such as radical actors and regional instabilities develop, supports more effective strategic and operational policy decisions.  Minerva program priorities are consistent with the goals set forth in the 2014 QDR, informing DoD efforts to effectively build security globally.

The National Security Science and Engineering Faculty Fellowship (NSSEFF) program was realigned from the National Defense Education Program (NDEP), PE 0601120D8Z, to this PE beginning in FY 2015.  The NSSEFF program supports world-class researchers in scientific areas of critical importance to DoD and ensures the cultivation of exceptional talent.  Fellows’ work spans a broad set of emerging scientific areas.  The NSSEFF program is a key resource that fosters close connections between academia and the DoD science and engineering enterprise, a primary goal of SSBR efforts.  Fellows provide DoD the deep scientific expertise of today’s leading research universities and collaborate with DoD scientists and engineers.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:Text>A Department-wide solicitation of critical defense social science questions to be set as Minerva priority research areas drew responses from Service leadership, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), Combatant Commands (COCOMs), J5, the intelligence community, and others.  The resulting broad agency announcement (BAA) and correlated source selection process identified several new university-led research grants to be awarded in these newly derived focus areas.  The FY 2014 BAA yielded 260 submissions from which 12 proposals were selected for three- to five-year awards by panels of defense Science and Technology (S&amp;T) managers, defense policy makers, and academic experts in accordance with the appropriated FY 2014 budget.

The Minerva Research Fellows (Chairs) program (active from FY 2010 through FY 2013) was restructured to more effectively build in-house social science capabilities and better connect social science research insights to current and future defense leadership at PME institutions and elsewhere.  The Research for Defense Education Faculty (R-DEF) program was designed to augment existing institutional resources by enabling activities such as research by active teaching faculty, PME curriculum development, new academic-government exchange opportunities, and research-informed tabletop exercises.  A pilot solicitation yielded support for 14 small projects.</r2:Text>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The National Defense Education Program (NDEP) ensures the Department of Defense (DoD) will have access to high-quality science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) personnel vital to national defense now and in the future.  NDEP’s portfolio provides solutions to workforce challenges, which include: (1) impending retirement of 33 percent of DoD’s STEM workforce; (2) low college readiness rate and interest in STEM majors; and (3) challenges that DoD, like other Federal employers, face in recruiting and retaining high-quality STEM talent in a competitive environment.

NDEP aligns to the DoD Science and Technology (S&amp;T) priorities and the Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Institutions (HBCU/MIs) program.  It is synchronized with the Federal Five-Year STEM Strategic Plan, the DoD STEM Strategic Plan, and the DoD Strategic Workforce Plan.  NDEP components engage in assessment and evaluation as required by the Office of Management and Budget and the Government Accountability Office.

Science, Mathematics, and Research for Transformation (SMART) awards highly competitive scholarships-for-service to undergraduate and graduate students in 19 STEM academic disciplines and moves graduates directly into DoD's workforce following graduation.  Internships engage SMART scholars in hands-on, research and work experiences in DoD facilities, thereby enhancing their educational experience.  Since its inception as a pilot program in FY 2005, SMART has supported approximately 1,575 students from bachelor to doctoral levels and, to date, approximately 900 have completed program studies and are currently employed in the DoD workforce.  SMART ensures that DoD has a steady infusion of high-quality U.S. technical talent, prepared in areas of critical importance to DoD, ready to apply their technical knowledge, skills, and abilities to fulfill DoD’s mission.

The National Security Science and Engineering Faculty Fellowship (NSSEFF) program was realigned from the NDEP PE to PE 0601110D8Z, beginning in FY 2015.  The NSSEFF program supports world-class researchers in scientific areas of critical importance to DoD and ensures the cultivation of exceptional talent.  Fellows’ work spans a broad set of emerging scientific areas.  The NSSEFF program is a key resource that fosters close connections between academia and the DoD science and engineering enterprise, a primary goal of Strategic Support for Basic Research (SSBR) efforts.  Fellows provide DoD the deep scientific expertise of today’s leading research universities and collaborate with DoD scientists and engineers.

STEM Activities Support (SAS) supports initiatives to implement the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD(R&amp;E))’s strategic plan for STEM.  SAS fosters conditions for STEM investments to support a diverse, world-class STEM talent pool and workforce to meet national defense needs.  Initiatives include developing and implementing policy guidance, conducting analyses, and developing standards, while ensuring adherence to DoD and Federal initiatives and objectives.

Section 233 of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2015 and the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 directed the Secretary of the Defense to establish a pilot program to enhance the preparation of dependents of members of the armed forces for careers in STEM and provide assistance to STEM teachers at elementary or secondary schools at which a significant number of military dependents are enrolled.  In FY 2016, the Pre-kindergarten through twelfth grade (P-12) Military Child STEM Educational Program continues support for the pilot program.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>The National Security Science and Engineering Faculty Fellowship (NSSEFF) program was realigned from PE 0601120D8Z to PE 0601110D8Z (P060), Basic Research Initiatives, in FY 2015.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The National Defense Education Program (NDEP) ensures the Department of Defense (DoD) will have access to high-quality science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) personnel vital to national defense now and in the future.  NDEP’s portfolio provides solutions to workforce challenges, which include: (1) impending retirement of 33 percent of the Department's STEM workforce; (2) low college readiness rate and interest in STEM majors; and (3) challenges that the DoD, like other Federal employers, face in recruiting and retaining high-quality STEM talent in a competitive environment.

NDEP aligns to the DoD Science and Technology (S&amp;T) priorities and the Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Institutions (HBCU/MIs) program.  It is synchronized with the Federal Five-Year STEM Strategic Plan, the DoD STEM Strategic Plan, and the DoD Strategic Workforce Plan.  NDEP components engage in assessment and evaluation as required by the Office of Management and Budget and the Government Accountability Office.

Science, Mathematics, and Research for Transformation (SMART) awards highly competitive scholarships-for-service to undergraduate and graduate students in 19 STEM academic disciplines and moves graduates directly into DoD's workforce following graduation.  Internships engage SMART scholars in hands-on, research and work experiences in DoD facilities, thereby enhancing their educational experience.  Since its inception as a pilot program in FY 2005, SMART has supported approximately 1,575 students from bachelor to doctoral levels and, to date, approximately 900 have completed program studies and are currently employed in the DoD workforce.  SMART ensures that DoD has a steady infusion of high-quality U.S. technical talent, prepared in areas of critical importance to DoD, ready to apply their technical knowledge, skills, and abilities to fulfill DoD’s mission.

The National Security Science and Engineering Faculty Fellowship (NSSEFF) program was realigned from the NDEP PE to PE 0601110D8Z, beginning in FY 2015.  The NSSEFF program supports world-class researchers in scientific areas of critical importance to DoD and ensures the cultivation of exceptional talent.  Fellows’ work spans a broad set of emerging scientific areas.  The NSSEFF program is a key resource that fosters close connections between academia and the DoD science and engineering enterprise, a primary goal of Strategic Support for Basic Research (SSBR) efforts.  Fellows provide DoD the deep scientific expertise of today’s leading research universities and collaborate with DoD scientists and engineers.

STEM Activities Support (SAS) supports initiatives to implement the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD(R&amp;E))’s strategic plan for STEM.  SAS fosters conditions for STEM investments to support a diverse, world-class STEM talent pool and workforce to meet national defense needs.  Initiatives include developing and implementing policy guidance, conducting analyses, and developing standards, while ensuring adherence to DoD and Federal initiatives and objectives.

Section 233 of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2015 and the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 directed the Secretary of the Defense to establish a pilot program to enhance the preparation of dependents of members of the armed forces for careers in STEM and provide assistance to STEM teachers at elementary or secondary schools at which a significant number of military dependents are enrolled.  In FY 2016, the Pre-kindergarten through twelfth grade (P-12) Military Child STEM Educational Program continues support for the pilot program.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>SMART is a scholarship-for-service program that provides support to high performing U.S. graduate and undergraduate students in 19 academic STEM disciplines identified as areas of future workforce need by DoD.  

The disciplines align with the Department’s seven S&amp;T priorities and emerging scientific research areas.  The disciplines are: Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering; Biosciences; Chemical Engineering; Chemistry; Civil Engineering; Cognitive, Neural, and Behavioral Sciences; Computer Science; Electrical Engineering; Geosciences; Industrial and Systems Engineering; Information Sciences; Materials Science and Engineering; Mathematics; Mechanical Engineering; Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering; Nuclear Engineering; Oceanography; Operations Research; and Physics.  Upon completion of their degree, students fulfill a service commitment to DoD on a one-to-one payback per year of education funded.  In part, SMART's success is measured by participants that remain in the DoD workforce beyond their required service commitment.  77 percent have completed their service commitment and are still employed by DoD beyond their original service commitment.

Oversight of the SMART program falls under the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (OASD(R&amp;E)).  Two types of individuals participate in the program: (1) retention scholars who are current DoD employees; and (2) recruitment scholars who are college students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate programs and represent new talent for the Department.  Internships provide SMART scholars with an opportunity to engage in hands-on research and work experiences in defense laboratories, thereby enhancing their educational experience.

Since FY 2005, approximately 1,575 students have participated in the SMART program at approximately 160 sponsoring facilities.  As of August 2014, approximately 900 SMART scholars have transitioned into the service commitment phase.  To date, these scholars have transitioned as civilian employees into the Air Force, Army, Navy, and other DoD components.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program addresses applied research associated with improving the lethality, reliability, safety, and survivability of munitions and weapon systems.  The goal is to develop and demonstrate joint enabling technologies that can be used by the Program Executive Officers (PEOs) as they develop their specific weapon programs.  The program invests in and demonstrates technologies from a Joint Service perspective, thus maximizing efficiencies, ensuring the development of technology with the broadest applicability while avoiding duplication of efforts.

Munition Area Technology Groups (MATGs) and Fuze Area Technology Groups (FATGs) have been established for each munition and capability area and are tasked with: 1) coordinating, establishing, and maintaining 2018 and 2023 year technology development plans and roadmaps, 2) coordinating biannual meetings to review technical and programmatic details of each funded and proposed effort, 3) developing and submitting Technology Transition Agreements in coordination with appropriate PEOs for insertion in their Insensitive Munitions (IM) Strategic Plans / Fuze Technology Development Plan, and 4) interfacing with other MATGs / FATGs and IM / fuze science and technology projects as appropriate.  The Joint Insensitive Munitions Technology Program (JIMTP) and Joint Fuze Technology Program (JFTP) will utilize a Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) (consisting of senior Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of Energy (DOE) laboratory representatives, and senior Munitions PEO representatives) to provide program oversight, policy, direction, and priorities during its annual meeting.

The Insensitive Munitions (IM) effort will demonstrate enabling technologies needed to develop weapons in compliance with requirements established in United States Code, Title 10, Chapter 141, Section 2389 and DoD Instruction 5000.1.  This effort will take promising technologies demonstrated at the laboratory scale and transition them into demonstration programs utilizing generic hardware based on priority munitions identified in the PEO IM Strategic Plans.  Mature demonstrated IM technology can be transitioned, thereby decreasing their program costs and schedule risk and facilitating spin-offs to other non-compliant munitions within their portfolios.

The JIMTP investments focus on five Munition Areas:  1) High Performance Rocket Propulsion (HPP), 2) Minimum Signature Rocket Propulsion (MSP), 3) Blast and Fragmentation Warheads (BFW), 4) Anti-Armor Warheads (AAW), and 5) Gun Propulsion (GP).  MATGs, under tri-service leadership, have developed technology roadmaps for each Munition Area that are used to guide investments based on goals consistent with the DoD IM Strategic Plan.  These IM technologies, alone or in combination, will be developed and tested at the small-scale, and for eventual incorporation in hardware, simulating real-world munitions, to demonstrate their utility and feasibility. 

The Enabling Fuze Technology effort will also demonstrate fuze enabling technologies needed to develop weapons that address priority capability areas identified in the Guidance for Development of the Force (GDF), the Secretary of Defense Memorandum, DoD Policy on Cluster Munitions and Unintended Harm to Civilians, and shortfalls in current weapon systems.  This effort will develop fuzing technologies and mature them for transition into advanced technology (Budget Activity (BA) 6.3) programs and/or design tools and protocols for weapon fuzing.  In this way, the Service and Industrial base weapon and fuze communities will be able to heavily leverage and apply these emerging and promising technologies in fuzing modeling and simulation tools, multi-point initiation, high reliability fuze architectures, survivable components, modular fuze packaging, and fuze sensor. 

The Joint Fuze Technology Program investments focus on four specific capability areas that have been identified by Department strategic guidance and current shortfalls in weapon systems and will be validated by the PEOs and the Heads of the Service Science and Technology (S&amp;T) communities.  These capability areas are:  1) Hard Target Survivable Fuzing, 2) Tailorable Effects Weapon Fuzing, 3) High Reliability Fuzing, and 4) Enabling Fuze Technologies and Common Architecture.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Joint Insensitive Munitions (IM) Technology Program (JIMTP) aims to develop the enabling technologies needed to build weapons in compliance with statutory requirements (United States Code, Title 10, Chapter 141, Section 2389) and regulation (DoDI 5000.1 and 5000.02, and CJCSI 3170.01F).  This effort will take promising technologies developed at the laboratory scale and mature them for transition into advanced technology (Budget Activity (BA) 6.3) programs based on the priority munitions identified in the DoD IM Strategic Plans.  Mature and demonstrated IM technology can be transitioned to the PEOs, thereby decreasing the program costs and schedule risk.  This will additionally promote spin-offs to other non-compliant munitions within the DoD portfolio.  Without new technology, future variants of current weapon systems will have the same, or worse, response to IM stimuli.  New weapon developments will face similar challenges.  This is especially true with increased performance requirements for improved and new systems. 

The JIMTP investments focus on five Munition Areas:  1) High Performance Rocket Propulsion, 2) Minimum Signature Rocket Propulsion, 3) Blast and Fragmentation Warheads, 4) Anti-Armor Warheads, and 5) Gun Propulsion.  Munition Area Technology Groups (MATGs), under tri-service leadership, have developed technology roadmaps for each Munition Area that are used to guide investments based on goals consistent with the DoD IM Strategic Plans.  The program is structured around these five areas with clear cross-cutting tasks.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>HPP focuses on the development and demonstration of technologies to improve the IM response of HPP systems, rocket motors with Ammonium Perchlorate and with or without a metal fuel, for rockets and missiles launched from air, ground, and sea platforms.  These technologies, when applied to rocket motors, improve to one or more threats, while not degrading the response to other IM threats and, at minimum, maintaining munition performance.  Technologies include, but are not limited to, rocket propellant ingredients, including synthesis, characterization and scale-up; reduced smoke or smoky propellants, including formulation, characterization and scale-up; rocket motor case design; materials for active and passive thermal mitigation; shock mitigation materials and techniques; passive and active coatings; active and passive venting techniques for motor cases or containers; ignition systems; sensors; and thrust mitigation techniques.  Operating conditions may be controlled or widely varying in both temperature and vibration.  The 2018 and 2023 year goals of the HPP MATG are concentrated on solving the IM response of missile propulsion systems due to Fragment Impacts and Slow Cook Off for the majority of HPP rocket motors, and solving the Fast Cook Off response of very large HPP motors.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>AAW focuses on the development and demonstration of explosive ingredients, explosives, and warhead and fuze technologies for improving IM of AAW munitions.  The development of explosive ingredients, explosives, and warhead and fuze technologies, when applied to munitions, improve IM response to one or more threats, while not degrading the response to other IM threats and, at minimum, maintain munition performance.  Technologies include, but are not limited to, new ingredient synthesis and characterization, initial formulation development, scale-up, warhead/charge configuration, venting techniques for both munitions and their containers, protection/packaging materials and systems, shock mitigation liners, and initiation devices, techniques, and technologies.  Applications vary but include high performance warhead fills, booster explosives, and all other technology to mitigate the violent response of AAW munitions to IM threats.  Munition operating conditions may be controlled or have widely varying environmental conditions, such as temperature and vibration, and other factors such as cost, availability, and reliability may be critically important depending on the intended munition application.  The 2018 and 2023 year goals of the AAW MATG are concentrated on solving the IM response of anti-armor warheads to the Fragment Impact, Sympathetic Reaction, and Shaped Charge Jet threats for larger munitions and the Fragment Impact, Slow Cookoff, and Sympathetic Reaction / Shaped Charge Jet threats for Medium Caliber Munitions.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This RDT&amp;E effort will demonstrate fuze enabling technologies needed to develop weapons that address priority capability areas identified in the Guidance for Development of the Force (GDF), the Secretary of Defense Memorandum, DoD Policy on Cluster Munitions and Unintended Harm to Civilians, and shortfalls in current weapon systems.  This effort will develop enabling technologies at the laboratory scale and transition them into Budget Activity (BA) 6.3 demonstration programs for weapons where priority capabilities and technology needs have been identified and validated by the Program Executive Officers (PEOs) and the Heads of the Service Science and Technology (S&amp;T) communities.  Mature BA 6.2 fuze technologies will be transitioned, thereby decreasing their program costs and schedule risk and facilitating spin-offs to other munitions within their portfolios.

Under the Joint Fuze Technology Program (JFTP), investments are focused on specific capability areas that have been identified by Department strategic guidance and current shortfalls in weapon systems and validated by the PEOs and Heads of the Service S&amp;T communities.  These four capability areas are: 1) Hard Target Survivable Fuzing, 2) Tailorable Effects (TE) Weapon Fuzing, 3) High Reliability Fuzing, and 4) Enabling Fuze Technologies and Common Architecture.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>The Hard Target Fuzing challenges are grouped into three Technology Areas.  First, improved modeling and simulation capabilities provide the validated computational tools necessary for hard target applications.  Second, basic phenomenology and understanding of the Fuze Environment is the science-based endeavor of providing the test equipment, instrumentation, and analysis techniques for experimentation and data gathering necessary for next generation fuzing.  Third, hard target survivable fuze components are developed to increase the effectiveness of facility denial munitions by improving the prediction tools and testing methodologies to evaluate the survivability and functionality of legacy and future fuzes.  Development of these technologies will enable next generation boosted and hypersonic penetrators to execute missions against hardened and deeply buried targets.</r2:Description>

These technologies will enable the next generation of cluster munitions to achieve the required greater than 99 percent reliability goal.  Evolving DoD emphasis on increased weapon system reliability is driving the need to consider new and novel approaches for achieving increased fuze reliability while maintaining or enhancing fuze design safety.  DoD policy, higher weapon reliability expectations and harsher weapon system operational requirements are dictating the need for higher fuze reliability than available using current technologies.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Lincoln Laboratory (LL) research line program is an advanced technology research and development effort conducted through a cost reimbursable contract with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).  The LL Program funds innovations that directly lead to the development of new system concepts, technologies, components and materials in support of Lincoln Laboratory’s missions in Advanced Electronics Technology, Communications Systems, Cyber Security and Information Sciences, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Systems and Technology, Tactical Systems, Space Control, and Air and Missile Defense.  The Lincoln Laboratory Program supports these missions by conducting research and development in nine science and engineering disciplines:
- Advanced Devices, with emphasis on development of devices and subsystems utilizing microelectronic, photonic, biological, and chemical technologies to enable new approaches to Department of Defense (DoD) systems.
- Optical Systems and Technologies, including the development of focal plane arrays, integrated imagers, laser communications, imaging and spectroscopic detection systems.
- Radio Frequency (RF) Systems and Technologies, including the development of novel active and passive radio frequency (RF) sensors, development of electronic protection and electronics attack technologies, and system concepts and communication systems.
- Information, Computation, and Exploitation, which includes the development of novel architectures, tools, and techniques for the processing, fusion, interpretation, computation, and exploitation of multi-sensor, multi-intelligence data. 
- Cyber Security, which includes the development of technologies and new techniques for the protection of systems against cyber attack and exploitation.
- Biomedical Sciences and Technology, which supports the development of technologies to aid the warfighter, to investigate relevant research in brain and cognitive sciences, to develop engineered biological systems, and to assess physical performance and injury recovery.
-  Autonomous Systems, which includes the development of technologies with the objective of developing mobile, autonomous, robotic platforms, sensors and algorithms that support key capabilities needed for a wide range of defense applications.
- Quantum System Sciences, which develops basic technologies that support sensing, communication and computation using quantum information, focusing on the demonstration of scalable computation platforms, demonstration of quantum protected communications and magnetic field sensing using highly-compact, atomic-like defects in diamond.

Supporting these and other priority technology and capability areas are work efforts entitled Technical Intelligence and Testbed for Comparative Analysis:
- Technical Intelligence is working to develop a comprehensive understanding of technology emergence and advancement in a range of relevant scientific areas such as nanotechnology, directed energy, and propulsion.  Some details are classified, but one focus area is working to establish a broad horizon scanning and technology forecasting capability through a collaborative effort by the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Intelligence Community.  This effort will develop insight into our relative position in science and technology around the world over time, as well as determine potential impacts on DoD capability development and future threat environments.  
- The Testbed for Comparative Analysis will enable the evaluation of quantitative, horizon scanning and technology forecasting techniques for discovering disruptive technologies that may impact the DoD.  This effort will provide the DoD with objective ways to evaluate the accuracy of existing and future horizon scanning and technology forecasting efforts.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

In particular, Lincoln Laboratory developed interferometric techniques for high-resolution imaging of satellites in geosynchronous orbit from a ground station and for high-resolution imaging of the Earth from a spacecraft.  The interferometric imager work includes the development of new algorithms and the development of methods to mechanically support the apertures, measure the atmospheric phase aberrations, and apply phase corrections to each aperture.  Additionally, advances in coherent combining of lasers were extended, for the first time, to quantum cascade lasers operating in the mid-wave infrared, with applications to infrared countermeasures and active hyperspectral imaging.  Third, new computational imaging architectures were developed that leverage the capabilities of specialized focal plane arrays as a means to further improve performance.  Finally, a new effort was initiated to develop a coherent focal plane array, which will enable wide area imaging of motion and vibration.</r2:Text>

Based on this initial cubesat, future nano-satellite development efforts for weather sensing have successfully transitioned to externally sponsored programs.  Methods for further extending the linearity of radio frequency receivers were investigated using a technique called time-varying quantization, which can remove nonlinearities in the analog-to-digital conversion step.  Techniques to improve antennas by making them conformal and by making smaller antennas with wider bandwidths were also developed.  Finally, techniques to use integrated photonics to improve the bandwidth of simultaneous transmit and receive (STAR) systems were explored.</r2:Text>

As this project concludes, two new radio frequency (RF) integrated circuit efforts will be initiated:  the development of miniature RF circuits integrated on chips with photovoltaic cells and batteries in a very thin, flexible form factor; and gallium nitride on silicon technology will be advanced to enable large, high-power, low-cost/scalable RF arrays for radar, communication and electronic warfare applications.  Efforts to develop RF photonics will focus on developing a low noise figure, broadband amplifier that can support both remote antenna installations and can serve as the front-end for the more complex, integrated-photonics-based processing approaches that have previously been investigated.  This low-noise-figure amplifier will use recently developed advances in high-power diode lasers, high-speed modulators and high-power photodetectors.  New technology to integrate simultaneous transmit and receive (STAR) capabilities at the element level in phased arrays will also be developed.  Finally, a number of RF communication efforts will be aimed at enabling networking in contested environments, providing higher-security RF waveforms and using compressed sensing techniques to create more advanced, low-cost receiver capabilities.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:Text>Lincoln Laboratory developed techniques for processing large data sets, which include new efforts to compute on masked data and optimized analysis of large cyber, social media, and biological data sets.  These techniques continue to be adopted by the intelligence community and other organizations that need to perform complex analysis of large and rapidly expanding data sets.  Graph analytics techniques and bounds for network discovery were developed. A new hardware development effort was initiated to demonstrate a scalable architecture specifically optimized for graph analytics.  Additionally, new analytics were developed for applications including multi-intelligence fusion of uncooperatively collected audio and visual datasets, customizable pattern analytics, analysis of satellite imagery, and more efficient change detection in synthetic aperture radar collections.</r2:Text>

The graph processing efforts will move from the design and simulation stage to prototyping and demonstration.  Finally, new techniques that were previously developed as part of individual analysis tools will be more tightly integrated into efforts aimed at (1) providing adaptive and interactive analytic capabilities, (2) instrumenting and measuring how humans interact with these tools, and (3) integrating together tools that simulate and optimize the performance of algorithms on different hardware platforms.</r2:Text>

Most of the system protection work was focused on cloud computing systems, including better techniques for protecting information storage and sharing in commercial cloud systems, new functional encryption techniques, and a private cloud testbed that was used to develop new technologies for future DoD and US government dedicated cloud systems.  Additionally, a smaller effort was aimed at developing more secure processors that only require the data and operating instructions to be decrypted for a short period of time, in a very limited part of the processor, to limit vulnerabilities.  Efforts aimed at understanding cyber vulnerabilities and exploitation strategies included the development of tools aimed at both small and large-scale systems.  At the device level, a portfolio of widely applicable tools were developed for low-level reverse engineering of software and hardware.  At the system level, tools for obtaining situational awareness of cyber protections, vulnerabilities and the history of a network were developed and deployed, both on the MIT Lincoln Laboratory network and more recently to DoD computer networks.</r2:Text>

In the synthetic biology area, tools and techniques were developed to engineer new genetic codes and a 100-plex microfluidic module was built to test genetic code design.  Third, to better understand physical injury and performance, several approaches were pursued.  These included the world’s first demonstration of ultrasound excitation and measurement using remote optical techniques.  Finally, a number of biomarkers and epigenomic markers were measured and combined with other data to get a more complete understanding of performance, health, and recovery from injury.

The quantum computing modalities include superconducting qubits and trapped ions, with both of these efforts focusing on the most forward-looking technology developments in their fields.  These developments include record coherence times using scalable, gate-based architectures for superconducting qubits and the development of integrated photonics for scalable arrays of trapped ion qubits.  New FY 2014 externally-funded efforts now support important companion technology development in both of these quantum computing modalities.  The FY 2014 quantum communication work included theoretical efforts to understand the cryptographic security of quantum protocols and experimental efforts to develop single-photon detectors and entangled / single photon generators that offer record speed and efficiency.  Finally, ensembles of nitrogen vacancies (atomic-like defects) in diamond were operated in a new geometry based on total internal reflection within the diamond to achieve the highest magnetic field sensitivity yet demonstrated for a diamond-based magnetometer.  All of these quantum sciences efforts are closely connected to work on MIT campus through collaborations that involve both the MIT faculty, who are world-experts in these fields, as well as their graduate students who work collaboratively in both locations.  As part of this collaboration, a 40-kilometer-long dark fiber link was established between MIT campus and MIT Lincoln Laboratory to enable future quantum communication demonstrations.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:Text>Lincoln Laboratory imbedded active elements into both optical and radio frequency meta-materials to produce electrically tuned filters.  Additionally, graphene, a two-dimensional material, was combined with plasmonic structures to act as optical limiters for focal plane arrays.  This work was successfully transitioned into a separate program for further development.  Finally, a new effort was initiated to develop low-loss polymer and metal materials that can be used in high-resolution additive manufacturing to print 3D high-performance conductive and dielectric materials.</r2:Text>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Our military forces require resilient, reliable networks and computer systems to conduct effective operations.  However, the number and sophistication of threats in cyberspace are rapidly growing, making it critical to improve the cyber security of Department of Defense (DoD) systems to counter those threats and assure our missions.  The Cyber Applied Research program focuses on innovative and sustained research in both cyber security and computer network operations to develop new concepts to harden key network and computer components, design new resilient cyber infrastructures, increase the military’s ability to fight and survive during cyber attacks, disrupt nation-state level attack planning and execution, measure the state of cyber security, explore and exploit new ideas in cyber warfare for agile cyber operations and mission assurance, and protect tactical networks, weapons systems and platforms.

This program builds upon existing basic and applied research results.  The program focuses on integrating computer network defense and computer network operations, addressing joint problems in cyber operations, and filling capability and technology gaps as identified in the 2012 Cyber Priority Steering Council Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Roadmap, the 2013 Cyber S&amp;T Capability Gap Framework and other assessments conducted by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (OASD(R&amp;E)).  Progress and results are reviewed by the DoD Cyber S&amp;T Community of Interest.  New efforts will also be aligned with emerging U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) mission requirements.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

These capabilities present technology challenges in the areas of Autonomic Cyber Agility and Cyber Maneuver.  Cyber Maneuver is a new way to manage systems dynamically in a cyber operation.  It is a set of emerging methods for maintaining defensive or offensive advantage in cyber operations.  It entails developing mechanisms that enable goal-directed reshaping of cyber systems.  Cyber Maneuver encompasses reallocation for repurposing a device or platform, reconfiguration for changing the way a system performs a task, and repositories for altering the operating state in a logical or physical topology.  Autonomic Cyber Agility covers several forms of agility e.g., as cyber infrastructures increase in scale and complexity, there is an urgent need for autonomous and agile mechanisms to reconfigure, heal, optimize, and protect defensive and offensive cyber mechanisms.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Develop the ability to assess and control the cyber situation within a military mission context.  While the focus in cyber research is often placed on individual technologies, how these technologies work toward an effective mission is critical for the DoD.  The objective of Assuring Effective Missions presents technology challenges in the areas of Cyber Mission Control and Effects at Scale.  Cyber Mission Control covers the ability to orchestrate cyber systems to achieve an overarching mission goal.  To perform dynamic analysis of asset criticality and course of action analysis alternatives, there is a critical need for tools that can map information technology assets to missions and use modeling and simulation, or other techniques.  Inherent in Cyber Mission Control is the ability to automatically derive and fuse information about the characteristics of information technology systems in a manner that allows us to describe, analyze, observe, and control the operation of information technology components.  A key goal of this research area is to have tools that enable commanders to assess and direct different information technology maneuvers in conjunction with mission actions.  Effects at Scale encompass full spectrum challenges that intersect with cyber becoming a new full-fledged domain of warfare.</r2:Description>

There are two technical challenges associated with cyber modeling, simulation, and experimentation: 1) Cyber Modeling and Simulation and 2) Cyber Measurement.  Cyber Modeling and Simulation seeks to develop tools and techniques that enable analytical modeling and multi-scale simulation of complex cyber systems.  Cyber Measurement develops cyber experimentation and test range technology to conduct controlled, repeatable experiments, providing the ability to track the progress of cyber research investments in a quantitative fashion.  This area will explore new analytical methodologies, models, and experimental data sets to establish metrics to measure a system’s state of security, apply the scientific method to establish the foundations of a framework in which cyber security research can be conducted, to test hypotheses with measurable and repeatable results, and the quantitative experimentation and assessment for new cyber technologies.  These new methodologies will enable the exploration of modeling and simulation tools and techniques that can drive innovation in research. Additionally, these methodologies will aid in integrated experimentation by simulating the cyber environment with sufficient fidelity and integrating cyber modeling and simulation with the traditional modeling and simulation related to the kinetic domain.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Human Social Culture Behavior (HSCB) Modeling Program is a vertically integrated effort to research, develop, and transition technologies, tools, and systems to programs of record and users in need.  The program exists to optimize United States (U.S.) forces’ ability to perform population-centric sensing, understand behaviors driven by social and cultural variables, and select effective courses of action in the full range of military operations.  Program research will enhance population-centric intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities for understanding the increasingly complex global environment to address national strategic challenges such as instability, aggression, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and violent extremism.  In three integrated program elements (PE), the program will conduct applied research, mature and demonstrate advanced technology, and develop transitionable methods, technology, tools, and prototypes.  Work under PE 0602670D8Z will focus on developing an applied science base, to include validated theory and methods, along with knowledge products and resources to support sociocultural behavior data collection, analysis and forecasting of sociocultural behavior, course of action planning, and effects analysis.  Research will address needs in two areas:  modeling and data.  It will develop and validate theoretical constructions, generate knowledge products, and develop stand-alone computational models of sociocultural behavior; and improve methods for collecting data that will facilitate model development and enhance forecasting and analysis capabilities.  The program will ensure that supported research is clearly tied to warfighters and their needs. 

Human behavior based theory, knowledge products, and stand-alone models will support development of software to help users represent, understand, and forecast sociocultural behavior at strategic, operational, and tactical levels.

Improved data collection methods will help build the sociocultural science base, facilitate subsequent model development and validation, and address emerging data types and sources.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Human Social Culture Behavior (HSCB) Modeling Program is a vertically integrated effort to research, develop, and transition technologies, tools, and systems to programs of record and users in need.  The Program exists to optimize United States (U.S.) forces’ ability to perform population-centric sensing, understand behaviors driven by social and cultural variables, and select effective courses of action in the full range of military operations.  Program research will enhance population-centric intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities for understanding the increasingly complex global environment to address national strategic challenges such as instability, aggression, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and violent extremism.  In three integrated program elements (PEs), the Program will conduct applied research, mature and demonstrate advanced technology, and develop transitionable methods, technology, tools, and prototypes.  Work under PE 0602670D8Z will focus on developing an applied science base, to include validated theory and methods, along with knowledge products and resources to support sociocultural behavior data collection, analysis and forecasting of sociocultural behavior, course of action planning, and effects analysis.  Research will address needs in two areas:  modeling and data.  It will develop and validate theoretical constructions, generate knowledge products, and develop stand-alone computational models of sociocultural behavior; and improve methods for collecting data that will facilitate model development and enhance forecasting and analysis capabilities.  The Program will ensure that supported research is clearly tied to warfighters and their needs. 

Human behavior based theory, knowledge products, and stand-alone models will support development of software to help users represent, understand, and forecast sociocultural behavior at strategic, operational, and tactical levels.

Improved data collection methods will help build the sociocultural science base, facilitate subsequent model development and validation, and address emerging data types and sources.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Software is a key to meeting the DoD’s increasing demand for high-quality, affordable, and timely national defense systems.  With growing global parity in software engineering, the DoD must maintain leadership to avoid strategic surprise.  To assist the DoD in retaining a long-term differential advantage over potential adversaries, the SEI Applied Research PE will develop and evaluate the feasibility and practicality of software and computer science concepts with the potential to improve future DoD systems.  The SEI’s program of work coordinates across the Department through Reliance 21, the overarching framework of the DoD’s Science &amp; Technology (S&amp;T) joint planning and coordination process.  This PE directly benefits these DoD S&amp;T Communities of Interest (COI): Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I); Autonomy; Cyber; and Engineered Resilient Systems.  Additionally, this PE benefits every COI to some degree due to the ubiquitous nature of software.  This PE also leverages expertise in government, industry, and academia to enable the development of joint-Service capabilities.

This PE represents a pivot toward more fundamental research that enables the DoD to address longer-term challenges in software technology and engineering.  The SEI Applied Research PE funds the SEI FFRDC as the leading DoD center for addressing these longer term challenges.  The SEI Applied Research PE bolsters the organic research at the SEI FFRDC, enables stronger collaborations between the SEI FFRDC and academia, attracts top researchers to the SEI, gives the DoD access to top experts in information science, and generally enhances the DoD’s ability to benefit from the military applications of research in software and computer science.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Software is a key to meeting the Department of Defense’s (DoD’s) increasing demand for high-quality, affordable, and timely national defense systems.  With growing global parity in software engineering, the DoD must maintain leadership to avoid strategic surprise.  To assist the DoD in retaining a long-term differential advantage over potential adversaries, the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) Applied Research PE seeks to establish a program of applied research that will develop and evaluate the feasibility and practicality of software and computer science concepts with the potential to improve future DoD systems. 

The SEI Applied Research Program Element (PE) has four main research thrusts:  (1) measurement techniques for the effectiveness of software technologies and methods; (2) design principles and tools for evolvable, scalable ecosystems; (3) models of computational behaviors; and (4) cyber-tradecraft and analytics.  These thrusts have known military applications and can be associated with active areas of basic research.  The SEI Applied Research PE seeks to translate this promising basic research into solutions for broadly defined military needs.  This PE will leverage the expertise of the SEI FFRDC in advanced technology development and technology transition to design, develop, and improve tools, prototypes, and new processes that meet general requirements for software-intensive DoD systems.

The SEI Applied Research PE will also conduct research in multicore computing, architecture-led iterative incremental development (Agile at scale); and emerging software and computer science areas that can act as catalysts for acquiring DoD systems with improved performance.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>Research projects at the SEI FFRDC will be awarded under this PE on a competitive basis across the SEI.  Funding levels in each thrust area may vary from year to year.  Research will address the goal of assisting the DoD to retain a long-term differential advantage over potential adversaries in the area of software-intensive systems.  The four main thrust areas are:

1) Measurement techniques for the effectiveness of software technologies and methods.  Modern tools, integrated development environments, and software engineering processes have captured large data sets about development activities.  This thrust seeks to study the metrics that affect cost, schedule, quality, and performance based on real-world observation and experiment.  

2) Design principles and tools for evolvable, scalable ecosystems.  The commercial world has many successful examples of software ecosystems, but the DoD has not capitalized on these to the same extent.  This thrust looks beyond implementing ecosystems in a DoD context and seeks to implement the underlying principles in a way that makes automated creation, evolution, and scaling of ecosystems easier.

3) Models of Computational Behaviors.  System performance depends on end-to-end models of computational behavior that include the user, architecture, source and object code, firmware components, and processor hardware.  This thrust seeks to study emerging ideas that better model end-to-end computational behavior.  

4) Cyber-tradecraft and analytics.  Cyberwarfare is an increasingly important and rapidly evolving dimension on the modern battlefield.  This thrust seeks to investigate methods that will give the DoD enduring advantages in the cyber battlespace such as reverse software engineering, automated code and malware analysis, code-level software resiliency (e.g., randomizing and time variant techniques), and other techniques such as those found in the Software Security Assurance State-of-the-Art Report.  

The SEI Applied Research PE will also conduct research in multicore computing, architecture-led iterative incremental development (Agile at scale); and emerging software and computer science areas that can act as catalysts for acquiring DoD systems with improved performance.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program addresses advanced technology development associated with improving the lethality, reliability, safety, and survivability of munitions and weapon systems.  The goal is to develop and demonstrate joint enabling technologies that can be used by the Program Executive Offices (PEO) as they develop their specific weapon programs.  The program invests in and demonstrates technologies from a Joint Service perspective, thus maximizing efficiencies, ensuring the development of technology with the broadest applicability while avoiding duplication of efforts.

Munition Area Technology Groups (MATGs) and Fuze Area Technology Groups (FATGs) have been established for each munition and capability area and are tasked with: 1) coordinating, establishing, and maintaining 2018 and 2023 year technology development plans and roadmaps, 2) coordinating biannual meetings to review technical and programmatic details of each funded and proposed effort, 3) developing and submitting Technology Transition Agreements in coordination with appropriate PEO for insertion in their Insensitive Munition (IM) Strategic Plans / Fuze Technology Development Plan, and 4) interfacing with other MATGs / FATGs and IM / fuze science and technology projects as appropriate.  The Joint Insensitive Munitions Technical Program (JIMTP) and Joint Fuze Technical Program (JFTP) will utilize a Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) (consisting of senior Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of Energy (DOE) laboratory representatives and senior Munitions PEO representatives) to provide program oversight, policy, direction, and priorities during its annual meeting.

The IM effort will demonstrate enabling technologies needed to develop weapons in compliance with IM requirements established in United States Code, Title 10, Chapter 141, Section 2389 and DoD Instruction 5000.1.  This effort will take promising technologies demonstrated at the laboratory scale and transition them into demonstration programs utilizing generic hardware based on priority munitions identified in the PEO IM Strategic Plans.  Mature and demonstrated IM technology can be transitioned, thereby decreasing their program costs and schedule risk and facilitating spin-offs to other non-compliant munitions within their portfolios.

The JIMTP investments focus on five Munition Areas:  1) High Performance Rocket Propulsion, 2) Minimum Signature Rocket Propulsion, 3) Blast and Fragmentation Warheads, 4) Anti-Armor Warheads, and 5) Gun Propulsion.  MATGs, under tri-service leadership, have developed technology roadmaps for each Munition Area which are used to guide investments based on goals consistent with the PEO IM Strategic Plans.  These IM technologies, alone or in combination, will be incorporated in hardware, simulating real-world munitions, to demonstrate their utility and feasibility as part of Technology Transition Agreements with PEOs.

The Enabling Fuze Advanced Technology effort will also demonstrate fuze enabling technologies needed to develop weapons that address priority capability areas identified in the Guidance for Development (GDF) of the Force, the Secretary of Defense Memorandum, DoD Policy on Cluster Munitions and Unintended Harm to Civilians, and shortfalls in current weapon systems.  This effort will take promising technologies demonstrated at the laboratory scale and transition them into demonstration weapons and programs based on priority capabilities and technology needs identified and validated by the PEOs and the Heads of the Service Science and Technology (S&amp;T) communities.  In this way, promising multi-point initiation architectures, high reliability fuze architectures, survivable components, modular fuze packaging, and components produced based on ease of manufacturing can be integrated into munitions applications and its ability to address required capability needs will be validated.  Mature fuze technologies will be transitioned to Weapon PEO’s and/or Industry, thereby decreasing program costs and schedule risk while facilitating technology into potentially broader range of munitions applications.

The JFTP investments focus on four specific capability areas that have been identified by the Department strategic guidance and current shortfalls in weapon systems and as validated by the PEOs and the Service S&amp;T communities.  These capability areas are:  1) Hard Target Survivable Fuzing, 2) Tailorable Effects Weapon Fuzing, 3) High Reliability Fuzing, and 4) Enabling Fuze Technologies and Common Architecture.  These Fuzing technologies will be incorporated in weapon applications to demonstrate their maturity and utility as part of Technology Transition Agreements with PEOs.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Insensitive Munitions (IM) effort addresses advanced technology development associated with improving the lethality, reliability, safety, and survivability of munitions and weapon systems.  The goal is to develop and demonstrate joint enabling technologies that can be used by program managers as they develop their specific weapon programs.  The program invests in and demonstrates technologies from a Joint Service perspective, thus ensuring the development of technology with the broadest applicability while avoiding duplication of efforts – providing efficiencies and cost savings for the Department.

This effort will demonstrate enabling technologies needed to develop weapons in compliance with IM requirements established in United States Code, Title 10, Chapter 141, Section 2389 and DoD Instruction 5000.1 and 5000.02.  This effort will take promising technologies demonstrated at the laboratory scale and transition them into demonstration programs utilizing generic hardware based on priority munitions identified in the Program Executive Office (PEO) IM Strategic Plans.  Mature demonstrated IM technology can be transitioned, thereby decreasing their program costs and schedule risk and facilitating spin-offs to other non-compliant munitions within their portfolios.

The Joint Insensitive Munitions Technology Program (JIMTP) investments focus on five Munition Areas:  1) High Performance Rocket Propulsion, 2) Minimum Signature Rocket Propulsion, 3) Blast and Fragmentation Warheads, 4) Anti-Armor Warheads, and 5) Gun Propulsion.  Munition Area Technology Groups (MATG), under tri-service leadership, have developed technology roadmaps for each Munition Area which is used to guide investments based on goals consistent with the DoD IM Strategic Plan.  These IM technologies, alone or in combination, will be incorporated in hardware, simulating real-world munitions, to demonstrate their utility and feasibility as part of Technology Transition Agreements with PEOs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>GP focuses on the development and demonstration of technologies in the area of GP systems.  The development and demonstration of gun propulsion technologies, when applied to munition systems, will improve munition Insensitive Munitions (IM) response to one or more threats, while not degrading the response to other IM threats and, at minimum, maintaining munition performance.  Technologies include, but are not limited to, gun propellant formulations, ingredients for gun propellant formulations (including synthesis, characterization and scale-up), cartridge case and packaging design, active and passive venting techniques, reduced sensitivity primer propellant and primer systems, and robust primers for insensitive propellants.  Applications vary, but include both large and medium caliber munitions, as well as propelling charges for mortars and shoulder launched munitions.  Operating requirements vary, and other factors such as barrel life and operation over varying environmental conditions may be critically important depending on the intended munition application.  The 2018 and 2023 year goals of the GP MATG are concentrated on solving the IM response of gun propulsion munitions to Fragment Impact and Slow Cook Off threats.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This effort will demonstrate fuze enabling technologies needed to develop weapons that address priority capability areas identified in the Guidance for Development of the Force, the Secretary of Defense Memorandum, DoD Policy on Cluster Munitions and Unintended Harm to Civilians, and shortfalls in current weapon systems.  This effort will take promising technologies integrated and tested to technology maturity and demonstrate the technologies to technological maturity utilizing weapon hardware based on priority capabilities and technology needs identified and validated by the Program Executive Officers (PEOs) and the Heads of the Service Science and Technology (S&amp;T) communities.  Mature demonstrated fuze technology will be transitioned, thereby decreasing their program costs and schedule risk and facilitating spin-offs to other munitions within their portfolios.  Under the Joint Fuze Technology Program (JFTP), investments are focused on specific capability areas that have been identified by Department strategic guidance and current shortfalls in weapon systems and validated by the PEOs and Heads of the Service S&amp;T communities.  These four capability areas are:  1) Hard Target Survivable Fuzing, 2) Tailorable Effects (TE) Weapon Fuzing, 3) High Reliability Fuzing, and 4) Enabling Fuze Technologies and Common Architecture.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>The Hard Target Fuzing challenges are grouped into three Technology Areas.  First, improved modeling and simulation capabilities provide the validated computational tools necessary for hard target applications.  Second, basic phenomenology &amp; understanding of the Fuze Environment is the science-based endeavor of providing the test equipment, instrumentation, and analysis techniques for experimentation and data gathering necessary for next generation fuzing.  Third, hard target survivable fuze components are developed to increase the effectiveness of facility denial munitions by improving the prediction tools and testing methodologies to evaluate the survivability and functionality of legacy and future fuzes.  Development of these technologies will enable next generation boosted and hypersonic penetrators to execute missions against hardened and deeply buried targets.</r2:Description>

This program’s fuzing technologies are critical to enable the next generation of cluster munitions to achieve the required greater than 99 percent reliability.  Evolving DoD emphasis on increased weapon system reliability is driving the need to consider new and novel approaches for achieving increased fuze reliability while maintaining or enhancing fuze design safety.  DoD policy, higher weapon reliability expectations and harsher weapon system operational requirements are dictating the need for higher fuze reliability than available using current technologies.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>P206, Explosive Ordnance Disposal/Low-Intensity Conflict (EOD/LIC).  The EOD/LIC Program develops and delivers advanced capabilities for military Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) operators and Special Operations Forces (SOF) to meet the challenges of improvised explosive devices (IEDs), force protection, and the war on terrorism.  EOD/LIC efforts focus in two areas:  support to SOF to combat terrorism; and access, detection, identification, and neutralization of all types of conventional explosive ordnance and improvised explosive devices.  Requirements submitted by the Joint Service EOD and Service Special Operations communities are prioritized and approved by OASD (SO/LIC).  With a decreased budget, CTTSO will proceed with The Improvised Device Defeat (IDD)subgroup expanding its inclusion of joint service EOD operators in its efforts since the Department’s announcement to cancel PE 0603121D8Z.  IDD will absorb the appropriate joint service EOD requirements for prioritization and interagency coordination going forward.  IDD will use the limited resources it possesses to provide the broadest possible capability improvement to the community.

 P207, Special Reconnaissance Capabilities (SRC).  The SRC Program exploits, leverages, and integrates DoD’s service and agency efforts to improve surveillance and reconnaissance tools (unattended sensors, tagging and tracking devices, data infiltration/exfiltration, remote delivery, and mobility/delivery of sensors), while providing risk reduction for DoD and other agency technology and development programs.  The SRC Program identifies, integrates, and operationalizes the technical tools for the collection of actionable information against a variety of targets and mission requirements, including emerging requirements, and maintains DoD’s on-line catalog of tools in order to minimize crisis response time for special reconnaissance and surveillance. 

P208, Information Dissemination Concepts (IDC).  The IDC Program addresses technology capabilities necessary to enable sustained information dissemination campaigns in denied areas.  The IDC program, working as necessary with DoD and the interagency, develops, modifies, and demonstrates concepts, mechanisms, platforms and payloads to propagate themes and messages that convince target audiences to take action favorable to the United States and its allies. The Surveillance, Collection, and Operations Support (SCOS) subgroup has managed the IDC project for CTTSO since gaining oversight of the funding.  The language program orchestrated by SCOS will remain, albeit with a drastic reduction in funding without PE 0603121D8Z.
 
P209, Irregular Warfare Support (IWS).  The IWS Program (IWSP) develops adaptive and agile capabilities and methodologies to support irregular warfare in the current and evolving strategic environments. IWSP supports joint, interagency, and other partners who conduct or counter irregular warfare through indirect and asymmetric approaches, though they may employ a full range of military and other capabilities, in order to erode an adversary’s power, influence, and will. Solutions include material and non-material operational analysis, concept development, field experimentation, and delivery of capabilities, to defeat the motivations, sanctuaries, and enterprises of targeted state and non-state actors.  As evidenced by every applicable Defense and National Security strategy document, (e.g., 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance (DSG), “Sustaining U.S. Global Leadership: Priorities for 21st Century Defense, Irregular Warfare capabilities are vital to U.S. security.  CTTSO, in coordination with the ASD (SO/LIC), is in the process of reviewing options to continue the IWS capability that is critical to the combating terrorism community.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:Text>Under IW Joint Operational Concept (JOC 2.0) and DODD 3000.07 on IW, the IWS Program continued the research and development path in order to conduct operational analysis, concept design, and pilot-project experimentation efforts in support of 2010 QDR and current NSS/NSCT lines of engagements.    Deployed an enhanced training capability and planned for transition to a program of record a counter- “green on blue” capability for ISAF and U.S. forces. This effort assisted warfighters in detecting and mitigating insider threat attacks in partner, COIN and contingency operations, which is a serious issue that undercuts efforts at training host nation security forces, one of the pillars of Irregular Warfare.   Continued to support an Advanced Situational Awareness Capability that includes instructor-led training and supporting publications for tactical unit leaders at the US Army Maneuver Center of Excellence (MCoE), Ft. Benning, GA.  This capability led to trained units achieving the highest IED discovery rates in the OEF theater and saving coalition lives. This capability was ultimately transitioned to the US Army MCoE and they currently seek to enhance this capability with the training to counter “green on blue” violence that was previously mentioned in a hybrid training course. Continued to support Project LEGACY, a capability that significantly improves host-nation police counterinsurgency and military intelligence capabilities. Conducted and completed a spiral effort of Legacy to provide training that institutionalizes within U.S. Forces and the Interagency the capability developed by the Legacy Program to deliver police/military investigative training to host nation security forces.  Conducted an assessment of the relevance and applicability of specialized Security Force Assistance doctrine and operational approach for environments outside Operation Enduring Freedom.  Continued to elicit and refine requirements for users within rapid assessment framework in order to successfully pair SOF and Interagency users with off the shelf, high performance technologies and novel capabilities that fulfill specific requirements to share and analyze operational data better and faster.   Continued to research and develop threat group assessments based on open source information that allows operators and decision makers to understand the threats associated within their various areas of operation globally and how these threat groups affect the global security of the US and its allies.  Continued to develop and expand an effort that integrates and fuses heterogeneous social media data for use in strategic and tactical operational planning and preparation of the battlefield with new end users and different support environments. This effort provides a real time data and analysis capability along with mentorship and the analytical tradecraft to understand and monitor critical events and sentiments in open source social media.  Continued to develop frameworks and training to better understand and implement Combatant Command (COCOM) -level Communication Activities.  Delivered Return on Investment Analytic Framework for the COCOM VOICE Program in order to assist in garnering quantifiable measurements of performance, measurements of effectiveness and methods of determining overall return on investment (ROI) of program dollars.  Additionally, this effort also developed training designed to equip decision makers and operators with the knowledge and skills necessary to properly utilize population data and avoid common traps and risks in order to assess and appropriately interpret the population research required in support of these Communications Activities. Conducted deep-dive research and analysis aimed at defining today’s and the near future’s typology of adversaries, their capabilities, intentions, use of terrain, weapons, technologies, proliferation schemes, U.S. technology and operational advantages adversaries will work to offset, and what the U.S. should be looking for to be better prepared when it faces off with these types of threats.  Assisted with further development and understanding of the US Marine Corps concept of the Intelligence Driven Combat, to include international partnership and exchanges with Israel.   Developed enhanced MISO/PSYOP capabilities in planning, targeting and execution for support to special and unconventional warfare mission requirements.  Researched and started development of enhanced mobile capabilities for assessing and surveying assault and landing zones to support small units conducting distributed operations in remote and austere environments (to include resupply/drop zones, refueling, and helicopter landing zones). Conducted research, development, operational analysis, and field experimentation of efforts intended to counter emerging and extant threats in the intersection of the digital-physical domains (such as understanding the usage of social media by transnational criminal organizations in order to predict changes in support and influence; measures of effectiveness of social media and understanding how to use this media for intended effects). 
Initiated the Secure Unclassifed Network (SUNet), which provided protected dynamic enclaves of capability for multi-agency users (Law Enforcement, Interagency, Defense, Coalition, and Foreign Nationals) in order to provide inter-organizational collaborative areas and enhanced capabilities of data upload, searching and sharing from headquarters down to smartphones, tablets or laptops.  Research and development of a non-material effort intended to better understand indirect and irregular threats currently facing the US, and how to implement effective measures against them. The studies and related activities undertaken for this project will fall under three broad lines of effort: 1) an analysis of indirect/irregular actions employed historically and how these capabilities may be applied to today’s threat environment; 2) an analysis of current and the evolving irregular threat environment; and 3) identification and analysis of which of the capabilities the US could apply to prevail against irregular/indirect threats now and in the future.
Initiated a research and development effort to assess the degree and quality of organizational learning, adaptation, and innovation in the field over the course of the deployment of specific units engaged in IW; provide an initial framework to speed up and enhance organizational learning in the field; and operationalize framework through instruction/education aids.</r2:Text>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Combating Terrorism Technical Support (CTTS) program identifies capabilities to combat terrorism and irregular adversaries and delivers these capabilities to U.S., interagency, and international users through rapid research and development, advanced studies, and technical innovation.  Projects are distributed among 10 mission categories, in line with the interagency Technical Support Working Group (TSWG): Advanced Analytics and Capabilities, Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosives; Improvised Device Defeat; Investigative Support and Forensics; Personnel Protection, Physical Security; Surveillance, Collection, and Operations Support; Tactical Operations Support;  Training Technology Development; and a new working group, Irregular Warfare and Evolving Threats.  The CTTS program is a diverse, advanced technology development effort that capitalizes on interagency and international participation to demonstrate the utility or effectiveness of technology when applied to combating terrorism requirements.  It includes technology capability development, proof-of-principle demonstrations in field applications, and coordination to transition from development to operational use.  CTTS manages approximately 450 individual projects in support of Defense, federal, state, local, and international customers and partners. 

The CTTS program justified in the R-2 exhibit identifies the projects fully or partially funded by Congressional appropriations for the CTTS program.  However, the Combating Terrorism Technical Support Office (CTTSO) develops technology and provides support using external funds provided by other DoD and other Federal Departments and International partnerships. These projects and support activities are not necessarily reflected in this justification R-2; but the number of activities do reflect positively on the trust and competence that CTTSO has earned throughout the Department and interagency to rapidly conduct critical RDT&amp;E and provide innovative products.  

In FY 2014, CTTS focused on DoD requirements that supported military forces in demanding or hostile environments such as Afghanistan, Yemen, Africa, the 

Philippines, Mexico, and Colombia; by rapidly developing and delivering leading edge products such as tactical sensors and unmanned vehicles, personal and physical protection, user friendly apps for analytical tools and reference guides, and weapons, sights, and ammo modifications.  Several of the highly successful products include Legacy human source information programs in Afghanistan and Mexico, the Lighthouse and PALANTIR information collection and analysis systems, the Enhanced Mortar Targeting System (EMTAS), and Insider Threat Situation Awareness Training. 

For U.S. federal, state and local law enforcement and first responders, CTTS improved personal protection equipment for chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high explosive protection; as well as developed apps for interactive reference data to assist in identifying and neutralizing threat agents in the field and in laboratories.  CTTS also hosted interagency and foreign partner information exchange seminars and capability exercises to share and enhance response techniques and procedures for first responders.  

FY15 plans for CTTS will continue to address combating terrorism requirements from Defense, federal, state, local, and international customers and partners at home and abroad.  As the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan accelerates, CTTS will continue to address force protection needs for the remaining forces.  Additionally, CTTS will increasingly address technology requirements requested from USSOCOM’s field components as they increase their regional operations tempo in other parts of the world. Special emphasis will be for the Theater SOF in Africa and to support Theater SOF in the Pacific in support of the National Strategy to shift focus towards the Pacific.  Specifically, CTTS will address personnel and physical security for small forces deployed to austere and hostile environments. In parallel, CTTS is increasing its support of the USMC as they reconstitute and improve the capacity and capabilities of the Marine Expeditionary Units.  Another area of increased emphasis that has become even more concerning will be the protection of U.S. personnel, to include State Department personnel in embassy and consulate locations overseas that need increased security.  

CTTS will continue to actively support the Department’s Homeland Defense mission at NORTHCOM, including Defense support of civil authorities, interagency coordination, Special Operations support, and security cooperation.  Consistent with that focus, this office will also work to address Department of Defense Security requirements for advanced technology and capabilities that will (1) enhance security along the U.S. Southwest Border and (2) proactively address improvised devices and other chemical, biological, nuclear and radiological threats in a domestic environment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Title>Irregular Warfare and Evolving Threats (IW/ET)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>U.S. Forces face a threat environment where irregular, state-sponsored and non-state hybrid and conventional adversaries armed with easy to employ precision weapons, global surveillance and networking will have the capability to undercut the operational and technical superiority of U.S. Conventional and Special Operations Forces. These evolving threats will progressively blur the boundaries between conventional and irregular warfare. Offering foresight about disruptions of this nature through rapid, adaptive demonstration of novel operational concepts so that concept developers can explore new models and capabilities before a conflict begins must be a primary goal.

The IW/ET subgroup develops new concepts and capabilities for warfighters and inter-agency partners who are confronting the complexity of the current operational environment, while simultaneously looking outward rather than inward to appropriately size, shape and develop their forces. In accordance with the QDR’s emphasis on preparation to defeat adversaries and succeed in a wide range of contingencies, IW/ET will engage in operational assessment, concept development, and independent validation of unique prototype capabilities to identify, confront and defeat evolving threats.</r2:Description>

This effort provided critical test and evaluation for operational deployment.   Continued research and development of a non-material effort intended to better understand indirect and irregular threats currently facing the US, and how to implement effective measures against them. The studies and related activities undertaken for this project fall under three broad lines of effort: 1) an analysis of indirect/irregular actions employed historically and how these capabilities may be applied to today’s threat environment; 2) an analysis of current and the evolving irregular threat environment; and 3) identification and analysis of which of the capabilities the US could apply to prevail against irregular/indirect threats now and in the future. Initiated research and development of a low-cost, effective and efficient method of extending or creating sustainable governance in large urban environments through relevant doctrine, training, technology and innovative partnerships.

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>The Foreign Comparative Testing (FCT) Program Element (PE) 0603133D8Z is recast with a focus on Pre-Engineering and Manufacturing Development (Pre-EMD) and Proof of Principle prototypes derived from evaluation of foreign equipment that will provide the United States Armed Services, Special Operations Command (SOCOM) and defense agencies, capabilities to counter emerging threats.  The program will increase its focus on foreign technology solutions that affordably extend the life of existing military platforms/capabilities and enhance interoperability with foreign partners and between services.  FCT’s broad reach across our allies and friendly foreign countries will enable development of innovative, cost effective, and potentially interoperable solutions for the Department of Defense, Multi-Service and Combatant Command (COCOM) priority requirements.  FCT also enables more effective competition between U.S. and foreign technologies.

In FY 2015, FCT funding from PE 0605130D8Z was realigned to PE 0603133D8Z for Budget Activity alignment and emphasis on prototyping.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The FCT program supports the warfighter by leveraging technologies and equipment from allied nations and coalition partners to counter emerging threats, thereby accelerating the United Sates acquisition process and lowering development costs.  FCT enhances interoperability, facilitates international collaboration, expands opportunities for prototyping to identify significant technology maturation, increases competition in innovation, and enables more efficient and affordable transition of technologies into acquisition programs of record.  Authorized by Title 10, U.S. Code, Section 2350a (g), the FCT program is managed by the Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD) Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Emerging Capability &amp; Prototyping(DASD (EC&amp;P)), Comparative Technology Office (CTO).

The FCT program is a catalyst for teaming and other business relationships between foreign and U.S. industries.  Many successful FCT projects result in the licensed production of the qualified foreign item in the United States.  Other nations recognize the long-term value of such practices for competing in the United States Defense market and the resultant strengthening of the "two-way street" in Defense procurement.  The result often means the creation of jobs and contributions to local economies throughout the United States.  To date, companies across 34 states benefited from FCT projects.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Title>Lightweight M3A1 Recoilless Rifle (Army)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The current M3 Carl Gustaf Recoilless 84 millimeter Rifle was introduced to U.S. forces in 1991.  The original version used a thin steel barrel liner containing the rifling, strengthened with a carbon fiber outer sleeve.  External steel parts were eventually replaced with aluminum alloys or plastics thereby reducing the weapon weight from 36 pounds to 21 pounds.  This M3A1 project will eliminate six pounds (28 percent) from the existing system by replacing the existing steel tube with a titanium alloy tube, and other various components (bolt, trigger, venturi, and ancillary parts) without changing the firing procedures, operations or ammunition.  Since the weapons’ operational characteristics will not be changed, this low risk approach will produce a lighter weight 84mm shoulder-fired weapon without going through a costly and time consuming process to test, qualify, and re-certify an entirely new modernized weapon system.  This is a continuing project previously funded in FY 2014 in PE 0605130D8Z.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The project will test and evaluate a Tank and Infantry Fighting Vehicle gunnery training system that wirelessly transmits live audio and video feeds of weapon systems data to a mobile monitoring station.  The MGLFMS enables instructors to evaluate crew functions, make instantaneous corrections, and provides recording capability for detailed after action reviews.  Foreign data has shown that training with this system significantly increases probability of gunnery crews placing first round on target.  The system also provides an essential tool for instructors to evaluate and make the necessary feedback to ensure the analytical abilities that encompasses all the gunnery skills required for accurate fire.  Several North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) allies currently train with this same equipment.  This is a continuing project which was previously funded during FY 2014 in PE 0605130D8Z.</r2:Description>

-Develop and Demonstrate Pre-EMD prototypes that address DoD strategic priorities.
-Develop and Demonstrate a prototype that informs/refines the acquisition process.

Measurable Outcomes:
-FCTs will demonstrate capability objectives within 24-36 months.
-In FY 2014, FCT had a transition rate of 64 percent for completed projects, exceeding the objective of 40 percent for demonstration programs.  With a shift from Program Element 0605130D8Z to Program Element 0603133D8Z and focus on countering emerging threats as opposed to current threats, the transition rate is expected to decrease but with anticipated impact being greater.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The mission of the Department of Defense (DoD)/Department of Energy (DOE) Joint Munitions Technology Development Program (JMP) is to develop new and innovative warhead, explosive, fuzing, and lifecycle technologies and tools to enable major improvements in conventional munitions.  The JMP supports the development and exploration of advanced munitions concepts and enabling technologies that precede Service-specific system engineering.  A Memorandum of Understanding signed in 1985 by DoD and DOE provides the basis for the cooperative effort and for cost-sharing the long-term commitment to this effort.  The JMP funds budgeted in this justification are matched dollar for dollar by DOE funds.  Through this interdepartmental cooperation, DoD’s relatively small investment leverages DOE’s substantial investments in intellectual capital and highly specialized skills, advanced scientific equipment and facilities, and computational tools not available within DoD.  Under the auspices of the JMP, the integration of DOE technologies with Joint and Individual Services’ needs has provided major advances in warfighting capabilities over many years and continues to play a crucial role in the exploration, development, and transition of new technologies needed by the Services.

The JMP seeks to develop technological advances in several munitions subject areas.  These include:  1) improved modeling and simulation tools for munitions design and evaluation, including evaluation of vulnerability and the design of insensitive munitions (IM), 2) novel experimental techniques and material property databases to support modeling and simulation, 3) higher power and safer explosives and propellants, 4) miniaturized, lower-cost, and higher reliability fuzes, initiators, power systems, and sensors, 5) design tools to enable development of higher performance warheads and weapons, such as penetrators, that are hardened against high impact loads, and 6) tools to assess the health and reliability of the munitions stockpile and predict lifetimes based on these assessments.  The supporting experimental research requires the development of new technologies related to the synthesis, processing, and characterization of advanced munition materials, components, and systems.  This involves energetic material research, new fuzing concepts, dynamic testing of munition materials, and advanced characterization including high-rate in-situ diagnostics.

The JMP is aligned with Department strategic plans and policies such as:

•  Munitions for contingency operations, particularly for the reduction of unintended collateral effects.
•  Reducing time and cost for acquisition of munitions.
•  Rapidly transitioning science and technology (S&amp;T) to support the warfighter in today’s conflicts.
•  Establishing future core capabilities and maintaining our national S&amp;T capabilities through joint investment and interagency cooperation and teaming.
•  Aiding in recruiting and retaining high-caliber scientists and engineers at DoD S&amp;T organizations.
•  Developing advanced munitions technologies to support the increased role of conventional weapons to deter and respond to non-nuclear attack, as described in the Nuclear Posture Review report.
•  Developing safer munitions that are compliant with IM standards to meet statutory and Department policy requirements.

The JMP has established a successful collaborative community of DoD and DOE scientists and engineers.  This community develops technologies of interest to both Departments within a structured framework of technical reviews and scheduled milestones.  The JMP is administered and monitored by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and reviewed annually by the Munitions Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), which is comprised of over 25 senior executives from the Army, Navy, Air Force, Special Operations Command, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, OSD, and DOE.  Projects are organized in eight Technology Coordinating Groups (TCG) that bring together the disciplines necessary to properly evaluate technical content, relevance, and progress.  The TCGs conduct semi-annual technical peer reviews of JMP projects and plans.  DoD Service laboratory technical experts lead each of the TCGs to ensure that the technologies under development address high-priority DoD needs.  The JMP also promotes more in-depth technical exchange via short-term visiting scientist and engineer assignments at both the DOE and the DoD laboratories.

The JMP has a long history of successful transitions and significant Return on Investment (ROI).

•  The JMP is the primary developer of high-performance structural mechanics computer codes used by DoD, and the primary source for transitioning these codes to the DoD.  JMP computational tools are critical to the development and support of DoD programs; a recent tabulation shows that well over 50 DoD programs have been supported by these DOE codes.  For FY 2014 it is projected by the High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP) that JMP-supported codes will have accounted for 82 percent of all HPCMP Central Processing Unit (CPU) hours, including virtually all HPCMP classified computing.  The total CPU hours represents an eight-fold increase from FY 2012.  The Department expects this heavy reliance on DOE codes to continue for several reasons, including: preference for using DOE codes because they are export-controlled; DOE codes are scalable, incorporate multiphysics, and run on massively parallel computer systems; and the Department can obtain source codes to modify for individual Service needs.
     -  A significant number of defense industrial contractors also use the DOE structural mechanics computer codes.
     -  CHEETAH, a standalone thermochemical computer code, is the most widely used code by DoD and defense contractors for predicting performance of energetic materials.
     -  The Army Armament Research, Development &amp; Engineering Center (ARDEC) has stated that the DOE computer codes are now routinely used to design all new warheads.  The use of these tools has reduced the number of validation tests required for each new warhead from about five to one with concomitant cost and time savings.
     -  The Army Research Laboratory has used DOE computer codes to develop and deploy new armor solutions to Iraq and Afghanistan with unprecedented speed.
•  New munitions’ case material and explosive fill technologies provide the warfighter with a lethal and low collateral damage capability.  These technologies have been transitioned to the Focused Lethality Munition variant of the Small Diameter Bomb, which is currently fielded.  The technologies were also the basis for a new GBU 129 weapon that has been developed to meet a Joint Urgent Operational Need requirement for a low-collateral MK-82 class weapon.  The GBU-129/B received the 2014 William J. Perry Award from the Precision Strike Association, recognizing significant contributions to the development, introduction, or support of precision strike systems.
•  The Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization (JIEDDO) has supported applications of JMP technologies, including:  compact synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems for counter-Improvised Explosive Device (IED) efforts; pre-deployment training of military personnel by DOE explosive experts on how to recognize feed stocks and processes for homemade explosives; and use of massively parallel, multiphysics computer codes to understand how explosive blast waves cause brain injury and how to mitigate these injuries.
•  The JMP-supported CTH and Sierra codes were used for the Air Force Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) Quick Reaction Effort (QRC), and the Air Force Research Laboratory Conventional Survivable Ordnance Package (CSOP).
•  An erosive initiator technology developed under the JMP has been transitioned to the Services for use in selectable output weapons and self-destruct capabilities.
•  A novel approach to controlling the sensitivity and therefore the initiability of explosives using microwave energy, as well two new, insensitive energetic materials have transitioned to development projects in the Joint IM Technology and Joint Fuze Technology Programs.
•  Reliability analysis tools were used by Army Missile Command to assess Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM), Advanced Medium Range Air to Air Missile (AMRAAM), and Tube-launched, Optically-tracked, Wire command data-linked guided Missile (TOW).
•  Robotic demilitarization processing systems were installed at several locations, including a system at Hawthorne Army Depot to recover copper shape charge liners, Comp A5, and grenade bodies. 
•  Characterization and analysis of the Army’s Excalibur fusible plug resulted in a savings of at least $2.000 million.

The JMP also works with the Defense Ordnance Technology Consortium (DOTC) and the National Armaments Consortium (NAC) of industrial suppliers to equitably and efficiently transition JMP technologies to defense industrial contractors.  In addition to the computer codes mentioned earlier, the JMP has transitioned case technology for low-collateral weapons, low-temperature co-fired ceramic technology for smaller, less expensive fuze electronic components, and erosive initiator technology for selectable effects weapons to defense industrial suppliers.

The integrated DoD and DOE efforts within the JMP are transitioning new munitions’ technologies to the Department and the defense industrial base through the advanced development process.  The JMP is a focal point for collaborative work by nearly 300 DoD and DOE scientists and engineers.  Technical leaders from both Departments consider the JMP a model of cooperation, both within their respective departments and between departments.  The highly challenging technical objectives of the 33 current JMP projects require multi-year efforts and sustained, long-term investments to achieve success.

The JMP projects are divided into five technical focus areas:  1) Computational Mechanics and Material Modeling, 2) Energetic Materials, 3) Initiators, Fuzes, and Sensors, 4) Warhead and Penetration Technology, and 5) Munitions Lifecycle Technologies.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Title>Energetic Materials (EM)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The goals of this technical focus area are to develop new EMs and supporting technologies to satisfy the competing requirements for smaller, more lethal, and safer munitions.  Work is primarily focused on explosives, gun and rocket propellants, and, to a lesser extent, pyrotechnics.  The projects include development of: 1) new EMs, including new molecules in a range of particle sizes and morphologies, 2) new EM formulations, 3) a fundamental understanding of energetic properties and performance, and 4) computational tools for analysis of performance and sensitivity.  New materials and formulations are developed with the recognition that costs must be reasonable, chemical feed stocks reliable, and manufacturing processes suitable for scale-up to production levels.

Both Federal statute and Department policy direct the development of safer, less sensitive munitions.  Making munitions less sensitive while maintaining explosive or propellant performance is a difficult challenge.  This goal is best attained through a combination of new EM development, EM characterization, and more sophisticated modeling and simulation tools.  It is cost prohibitive to qualify weapons for compliance with insensitive munitions requirements through testing alone.  A better, and in many cases the only means, to qualify these weapons is with the combination of analysis based on validated computational tools and a few well-designed tests.

The Department also needs munitions that provide selectable effects.  To achieve these effects, weapons designers need to thoroughly understand the performance of EMs used in both the main weapon fill and the initiation systems.  Distributed fuzing systems can provide selectable effects as well as safer munitions, but such complex, small-scale systems require more complete knowledge of EM detonation physics and in some cases, new EMs designed for this application.

The desire for smaller and lighter munitions is driven in large part by the increasing dependence on unmanned weapons platforms and to some extent by the need to reduce logistical burden, especially energy consumption.  New EMs are needed to meet the munitions weight and size requirements while maintaining lethality and safety.

The Department is working to increase the range and velocity of weapons and to develop weapons against hardened targets.  These applications subject EMs to high accelerations and shock loads.  To support the development of these new systems, we need to improve our ability to model EM under higher impact loads and to characterize relevant properties to determine their ability to survive in these aggressive environments.  We may also need to develop new, more robust EMs that survive impact loads while maintaining lethality and initiability.

                                    <r2:Title>Initiators, Fuzes, and Sensors</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The goals of this technical focus area are to develop new materials, components, diagnostic techniques, and modeling and simulation tools for fuzing systems.  Initiators, fuzes, and sensors must work reliably together to prevent unintended detonation, to correctly detect intended targets, and to initiate detonation when required.  Projects in this focus area support the Department’s needs to miniaturize fuzing systems.  Smaller systems are required for several reasons including: 1) compatibility with smaller and lighter weapons systems, 2) trading volume in munitions for other components such as additional explosives, higher energy and power density power sources, or enhanced guidance systems, 3) increasing reliability through redundancy, for example, using of two or more smaller initiating systems, and 4) upgrading existing sub-munitions with smarter and more reliable fuzing systems. 

The miniaturization of fuzing systems requires new material and components, new power systems, new diagnostic techniques, and improved modeling tools for microdetonics.  The Department also needs weapons systems with selectable effects, and these effects may be achieved with multi-point initiation systems.  Such systems are inherently more complex and require improved characterization of initiator materials and components, as well as more sophisticated modeling and simulation tools.  To attain greater precision and to avoid unintended collateral effects when weapons are used in the complex environment of counter-insurgency or counter-terrorist operations, target sensors must be reliable and provide high-fidelity discrimination.  Projects in this focus area are developing technologies to achieve this level of performance in compact packages.

The Department’s requirement to achieve more precise weapon effects with minimum collateral damage is supported by work on controlled fragmentation, non-fragmenting warhead cases, and multiphase blast explosives (MBX).  More recently, increases in performance and reductions in vulnerability are being achieved through improved warhead integration into munitions using a systems-oriented approach. 

The goals for penetrator weapons are to investigate, develop, and transition advanced technologies for the design, development, and performance assessment of the next generation of high performance, precision strike weapons.  This effort directly supports national initiatives to defeat hard and deeply buried targets, which are proliferating worldwide, and to deny/defeat weapons of mass destruction.  The work addresses high-velocity penetration into granular materials (sand and soil), penetration into advanced high-strength and ultra-high-performance concretes, new penetrator materials and designs, and non-inertial onboard instrumentation.

The specific projects in the warhead and penetration technology focus area are:

-  Multiphase blast munitions (MBX) technology.
-  Dynamic behavior of sand.
-  Integrated munitions modeling &amp; experimentation.
-  Modeling of strategic structures subject to ballistic impact or blast.
-  Concrete perforation and penetration modeling and experiments.
-  Explosive/metal interactions.

                                    <r2:Description>This focus area supports improving the Department’s ability to understand, measure, predict, and mitigate safety and reliability problems caused by materials aging and degradation in weapons systems.  Current stockpile assessment methods typically focus on addressing materials aging and reliability problems after they occur, rather than anticipating and avoiding future problems or failure mechanisms.  The overall objective of this work is to develop a toolset of computational models that are able to quantitatively predict materials aging processes and ultimately improve the long-term reliability of weapons systems, subassemblies, and/or components.  These objectives are achieved by:  identifying aging mechanisms, quantifying the rates at which those aging mechanisms occur, developing predictive models, and using these models to predict the munitions stockpile reliability.  An additional objective of this work is to develop technologies and methodologies to enable munitions health management and condition-based maintenance.

The specific projects in the munitions lifecycle technologies focus area are:

-  Predictive Materials Aging, including solder interconnect reliability, corrosion of electronics, and adhesive degradation.
-  Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) reliability.
-  Military use of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) electronics.
-  Complex system health assessment.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) directly supports the call for developing innovative capabilities to meet the emerging threats in the areas of Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2/AD) environments, missiles, advanced Integrated Air Defense Systems (IADS), surface warfare, warfare from under the sea, counter-terrorism, and counter-Weapons of Mass Destructions (WMD).  With cross-domain challenges in areas such as cyber, electronic warfare, space, and Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (ISR) outlined in Sustaining U.S. Global Leadership: Priorities for the 21st Century Defense.  The S&amp;T analytic assessments performed under this budget item will include the following activities:

-  Threat envelope assessments beyond intelligence community products for identifying gaps in U.S. capability for critical threats (Red teaming).
-  Independent assessment of critical capability and technology development (Red teaming).
-  Architecture development and evaluation to develop new U.S. capability (Blue teaming).
-  Experimentation campaigns to demonstrate relevant technologies in preparation for rapidly transitioning the capability, either directly to warfighters, or to acquisition programs (Blue teaming).

Due to the complexity of these capability gaps, the process for developing and executing these analytic assessments will span fiscal years and may have multiple phases.  The emerging nature of the problem sets makes identification of studies beyond the budget year unlikely.  Typically, the distribution of effort for studies, experiments and prototypes, and testing and integration will be roughly 30/40/30 percent.  The first step in the process is to study problems or gaps identified by threat assessments and develop possible solutions; the second step develops those possible solutions into plans for experiments and prototypes; and finally, selected experiments or prototypes may be pursued to more fully develop the solution(s) for operational testing and integration.  Implementation of this process could span a couple of years causing the portfolio to cascade from year to year with each effort moving through the phases of study, experiment, and test.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) directly supports the call for developing innovative capabilities to meet the emerging threats in the areas of Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2/AD) environments, missiles, advanced Integrated Air Defense Systems (IADS), surface warfare, warfare from under the sea, counter-terrorism, and counter-Weapons of Mass Destructions (WMD).  With cross-domain challenges in areas such as cyber, electronic warfare, space, and Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (ISR) outlined in Sustaining U.S. Global Leadership: Priorities for the 21st Century Defense.  The S&amp;T analytic assessments performed under this budget item will include the following activities:

-  Threat envelope assessments beyond intelligence community products for identifying gaps in U.S. capability for critical threats (Red teaming).
-  Independent assessment of critical capability and technology development (Red teaming).
-  Architecture development and evaluation to develop new U.S. capability (Blue teaming).
-  Experimentation campaigns to demonstrate relevant technologies in preparation for rapidly transitioning the capability, either directly to warfighters, or to acquisition programs (Blue teaming).

Due to the complexity of these capability gaps, the process for developing and executing these analytic assessments will span fiscal years and may have multiple phases.  The emerging nature of the problem sets makes identification of studies beyond the budget year unlikely.  Typically, the distribution of effort for studies, experiments and prototypes, and testing and integration will be roughly 30/40/30 percent.  The first step in the process is to study problems or gaps identified by threat assessments and develop possible solutions; the second step develops those possible solutions into plans for experiments and prototypes; and finally, selected experiments or prototypes may be pursued to more fully develop the solution(s) for operational testing and integration.  Implementation of this process could span a couple of years causing the portfolio to cascade from year to year with each effort moving through the phases of study, experiment, and test.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

SCO repurposes existing systems by developing alternative Concepts of Employment (CONEMP) and Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP) for their employment by the warfighter.  Concepts that provide capability improvements to Combatant Commanders are identified for accelerated prototype demonstration, and worked as joint projects with the Services to speed transition time for rapid fielding.  Low-Cost Payloads will leverage low cost, commercial, and often low technology options that do not conform to the typical DoD acquisition business model, but have the potential to disrupt and change warfighting capabilities by avoiding or creating technological surprise.  Due to the nature of these projects, specific applications and detailed plans are available at a higher classification level.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>To counter the United States’ historic technological advantage, nation-states and terrorists are increasingly developing asymmetric capabilities and systems that are enabled by the significant advances in globally-available commercial electronic components and devices.  These threats range from improvised devices being employed by terrorists that are constructed from commercially available electronic and industrial components to dedicated military systems that could be used in ways that diminish our technological advantage in conflicts with nation-states.  The rate at which these threats are appearing is accelerating and new threats are appearing quicker than traditional Department of Defense (DoD) requirements and acquisition processes can respond. 

The use of asymmetric devices is well understood by both nation-states and terrorists.  Using man portable air defense systems, mortars, and improvised explosive devices employing commercial electronic components, terrorists have attacked both air and ground forces, posing threats in any region due to their easy transportability.  Unmanned aircraft systems employing advanced commercial electronic components are proliferating and pose threats as both military capabilities and as potential weapons delivery mechanisms.  

The extreme consequences of technological surprise and the accelerating rate of appearance of new threats highlight the need to rapidly develop and field innovative Electronic Warfare (EW), Information Operations and EW/Cyber Convergence capabilities that can neutralize threats in fiscally and temporally responsive ways.  We must concurrently develop innovative technologies and approaches that will give us asymmetric advantages over potential adversaries.  

To proactively address the accelerating threat environment and restore the United States’ technological overmatch capabilities, the Joint Electronic Advanced Technology (JEAT) program’s overarching philosophy focuses on innovation to accelerate the pace of EW capabilities development.  This program element investigates means to rapidly mitigate new threats by integrating advanced commercial and military off-the-shelf technologies in innovative ways and rapidly demonstrate innovative technological capabilities that can be inserted into the Services’ Programs of Record with reduced risk.  JEAT efforts are based on three pillars: 1) Experimentation/Demonstration, 2) Advanced Technology Development/Verification, and 3) Innovative Technology Exploration.  

In FY 2016, two efforts were added by the Department to accelerate the fielding of vitally needed EW warfighting capabilities:  the Advanced EW Technology Maturation Project and the EW Enterprise Exploration and Innovation Project.

The Advanced EW Technology Maturation Project is a one-year effort to demonstrate modular, distributed, configurable EW technologies and systems designs that address requirements identified by the United States Marine Corps (USMC) and U.S. Army.  Additionally, technologies demonstrated in this effort will be transitioned to the USMC to enable an earlier transition of vital warfighting capabilities within the Intrepid Tiger II (IT2) FY 2017 Program of Record.  This effort will specifically mature counter-radar building blocks to provide new, vitally-needed EW capabilities for U.S. Army and USMC air and ground assets while mitigating blue-on-blue and co-site interference impacts. 

The EW Enterprise Exploration and Innovation Project is a four-year effort to (1) accelerate the development of innovative countermeasures to new classes of advanced threats that are being developed and fielded by potential adversaries and (2) provide innovative capabilities to counter anti-access/area denial threats posed by countries possessing modern, advanced integrated air defense systems.  Work area in (1) will enable direct technology transitions to the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy in ongoing Programs of Record.  Research in area (2) will enable earlier fielding, and will explore a variety of non-kinetic technologies, tools and techniques to include converged EW/Cyber approaches and battle management optimization and visualization technologies.  Five work units are included in this project:  Advanced Airborne Countermeasures Development, Advanced Defensive Countermeasures Development, Non-Kinetic Battle Management and Visualization Technology Development, Advanced EW and EW/Cyber Exploration and Development, and Ultra Wideband Receiver Development.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Asymmetric electronic threats enabled by significant advances in globally-available commercial electronic components and devices are proliferating at an alarming rate.  This project investigates means to rapidly mitigate new threats by integrating advanced commercial and military off-the-shelf technologies in innovative ways and rapidly demonstrate innovative technological capabilities that can be inserted into the Services’ Programs of Record with reduced risk.  Efforts concurrently develop innovative technologies and approaches that will give us asymmetric advantages over potential adversaries.

Three efforts currently comprise this project:  Experimentation/Demonstration, Advanced Technology Development/Verification, and Innovative Technology Exploration.  In FY 2015, we are adding a new effort, EW Enterprise Collaboration and Planning, that addresses selection, organization, oversight, and coordination of new and emerging Electromagnetic Spectrum (EMS) warfare concepts and related efforts within the EW and Countermeasures Office (EW&amp;C) in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (OASD(R&amp;E)).  In FY 2016, this area will be expanded to provide analysis and national and international coordination on emerging Information Operations and Electronic Warfare (EW)/Cyber Convergence topics. 

Experimentation/Demonstration (First effort:  Vigilant Hammer (VH)):

Experimentation/Demonstration efforts focus on experimenting with and demonstrating technologies and approaches to address compelling issues facing the warfighter. Our first Experimentation/Demonstration effort, VH, is a recurring multi-year, multi-agency, live, virtual, and constructive field experimentation venue of increasing complexity focused on advancing the state of the art for the detection, classification, geolocation and prosecution of electromagnetic signals of interest using both Department of Defense (DoD) and national resources.  VH is modeled after Joint Electronic Advanced Technology's (JEAT) highly successful BLACK DART, Trident Spectre, and Rotorcraft Aircraft Survivability Equipment Experiment (RASE) venues, and will include both scripted and free play scenarios intended to give participants an opportunity to explore the efficacy of existing and new technological capabilities and approaches to engage emerging EMS threats.  Engagement payloads will be developed and vetted in the Distributed Electronic Effects Development (DEED) laboratory discussed below.  Additional venues that address pressing warfighter concerns like advanced electro-optical threats and millimeter wave threats will be added in future years.

Advanced Technology Development/Verification (ATD/V) (Ongoing effort:  DEED):

ATD/V focuses on research to mature and assess emerging technologies to address compelling EW and converged EW/Cyber warfighter needs.  Our ongoing ATD/V effort, DEED, is a laboratory and developmental venue that matures and assesses emerging EW and converged EW/Cyber technologies to enable, e.g., more effective coordination of sensor and electronic attack capabilities to deliver multi-point, collaborative EW and cyber capabilities to warfighters.  DEED specifically seeks to identify and pair synergistic technologies to develop systems with capabilities that are greater than the sum of the individual parts.

Innovative Technology Exploration (Ongoing effort: Adaptive/Asymmetric Technology (A/AT)):

Innovative Technology Exploration encompasses a wide variety of efforts focusing on analyses and studies of emerging asymmetric threats for the Director, EW&amp;C.  Past work includes the Aircraft Survivability Equipment Joint Analysis Team, the Helicopter Survivability Task Force, and advanced analytic studies of the link budget associated with addressing highly advanced, agile threats.  Our ongoing effort in this area, A/AT, produces studies that are strongly supported by the Services and Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), and past studies have resulted in significant technology investments by DoD.  

EW Enterprise Collaboration and Planning (EW C&amp;P):

EW C&amp;P supports the activities of the Director, EW&amp;C related to the selection, organization, oversight, and coordination of new and emerging EMS warfare concepts and related efforts.  It includes efforts related to the identification, assessment, formulation of recommendations to address EW-related threat trends impacting sensor, seeker, communications and battle management technologies and countermeasures for these threats; programmatic and budget review and recommendations; and decision support to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (OUSD(AT&amp;L)) on selected programs of record including Critical Program Information standards, Foreign Disclosure advice, and Technical Signals Requirements.  This effort further solicits  and provides advisory information between OSD and the Joint Staff, Combatant Commands, Service sponsors and Research Engineers including oversight of an extensive variety of EW-related Research and Development (R&amp;D) activities within the department and world-wide.  EW C&amp;P efforts support all three JEAT pillars.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Emphasis will be placed on the creation of techniques and approaches that include distributed systems (primarily UAV based).  These technologies will be created by combining two or more existing components to produce a new and unique capability that provide more warfighting value than the sum of its parts.  Laboratory evaluation of these capabilities in the DEED laboratory will seek to integrate and quantify the benefits of the new approaches, and seek to ultimately prepare products for evaluation in venues like VH.   Access will be maintained to a small fleet of UAVs for the purpose of experimentation with distributed EW payloads when they prove to be mature enough for open air experimentation through work-ups in the DEED laboratory.</r2:Text>

This study pointed out the challenges of taking a conventional approach to defeating this type of system, and recommended that specific live evaluations occur to test alternative means of solving this very difficult problem.  Extensive coordination with the Naval Air Warfare Center’s Warfare Analysis Department enabled the formulation of plans to create modeling and analytics on very advanced electronic attack techniques and the effect that they will have in critical future warfighting engagements.</r2:Text>

New countermeasure capabilities are needed to address threats characterized by significantly expanded spectral and temporal coverage and resolution, increasingly complex and diverse waveforms, and have great agility.  Countermeasures are needed for both emitting (e.g., radars and communications) and non-emitting (e.g., passive radars and sensors and weapon seekers) threat systems.  Countermeasures are also needed to guarantee assured command and control and robust battle management capabilities in the face of advanced persistent electronic attacks by technologically advanced adversaries.  Five efforts will be initiated in FY 2016 to address EW Enterprise Exploration and Innovation: Advanced Airborne Countermeasures Development, Advanced Defensive Countermeasures Development, Non-Kinetic Battle Management and Visualization Technology Development, Advanced EW and EW/Cyber Exploration and Development, and Ultra Wideband Receiver Development.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>Historically, the Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (JCTD) Program has worked primarily with Combatant Commands (COCOMs) and Services to identify Department of Defense (DoD) priorities and accelerate development and demonstration of technical solutions to meet warfighter needs not being adequately addressed by the Services.  However, with the end of current conflicts there has been a strategic shift to enable introduction of new capability more affordably through employment of Pre-Engineering and Manufacturing Development (Pre-EMD) prototypes while addressing the strategic priorities of the Department, and the Chairman’s Risk Assessment in the following areas: Electromagnetic Spectrum Agility; Space Capability Resilience; Autonomous Systems and Multi-Domain Technologies; Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction; and Force Application.  

The shift in the JCTD Program will also result in a shift in Program metrics.  JCTDs supporting the DoD’s strategic priorities will tend to be longer and larger with increased emphasis on innovation, risk reduction, and affordability.  Overall, we envision initiating fewer yet more strategically decisive JCTD projects.  JCTDs will reinforce key partnerships across the Department, Services, other government agencies, select allies, and industry that allow for expedited development, deployment, and evaluation of capability solutions with potential to address some of the most pressing needs of the Department.  These JCTD partnerships will enable interdepartmental cooperation and capability development with the Departments of Homeland Security, State, Transportation, Justice, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.  

In FY 2015, Disruptive Demonstrations funding (P264) was transferred from the JCTD Program Element (PE) to a new PE 0603289D8Z (Advanced Innovative Analysis &amp; Concepts).</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The value and impact of the JCTD program is to cost-effectively address the Department’s strategic priorities to mitigate emergent threats, and address affordability and interoperability of Defense systems through Pre-EMD prototyping.  In FY 2014, the JCTD Program successfully completed the demonstration and transition of several JCTDs that addressed operational warfighting needs of the Department, providing affordable and sustainable solutions.  In addition, the program initiated several key prototyping efforts to address the strategic priorities of the Department.

Key values demonstrated by the JCTD program are:
•  The JCTD Program has a long history of providing enduring capabilities.  See “Section D.  Acquisition Strategy” for more details on transition.
•  Recent examples include: 
     1. A robust “detect and track” capability of "dark", i.e., non-emitting, maritime targets.  This is accomplished through automated data fusion of an existing suite of sensors supporting the Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) function.  This capability was successfully transitioned into the Sealink Advanced Analysis system at Office of Naval Intelligence and is now used by multiple agencies to provide a MDA capability.
     2. Counter-electronics High powered-microwave Advanced Missile Project (CHAMP) that demonstrated the capability of a missile with an integrated High Powered Microwave source to degrade, disrupt, or damage electronic systems.  The results are informing the acquisition system and will be used to address time sensitive capability shortfalls.
     3. Jetpack fifth to fourth supports Combatant Commanders' airborne gateway needs to distribute fifth Generation data to fourth Generation fighters by translating 5th Generation tactical data link messages into Link-16 messages that can be viewed by fourth Generation aircraft.  It is a critical force multiplier enabling 4th Generation aircraft to participate in a collaborative targeting environment that will be transitioning to our forces.
•  The JCTD Program enables coalition cooperative development by leveraging partner nation expertise and resources; approximately one-fifth of JCTD projects involve some degree of coalition partner participation.  As a result of successful past collaborations, the program now enjoys routine interactions with the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and the Republic of Korea. 
•  The JCTD Program also enables development and execution of interdepartmental cooperation projects with the Department of Homeland Security, State, Transportation, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.  

MEASURABLE OUTCOMES:  
•  JCTDs will demonstrate capability objectives within 24 - 48 months. 
•  The JCTD program achieved transition rates of the following:  70 percent transitioned to a new or existing Program(s) of Record, 24 percent transitioned to fieldable-prototypes (residual capabilities) sustained by non-JCTD funds in direct support of operations in theater.  In FY 2014, 17 of 18 completed JCTDs successfully transitioned.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>Historically, the Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (JCTD) Program has worked primarily with Combatant Commands (COCOMs) and Services to identify Department of Defense (DoD) priorities and accelerate development and demonstration of technical solutions to meet warfighter needs not being adequately addressed by the Services.  However, with the end of current conflicts there has been a strategic shift to enable introduction of new capability more affordably through employment of Pre-Engineering and Manufacturing Development (Pre-EMD) prototypes while addressing the strategic priorities of the Department, and the Chairman’s Risk Assessment in the following areas: Electromagnetic Spectrum Agility; Space Capability Resilience; Autonomous Systems and Multi-Domain Technologies; Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction; and Force Application.  

The shift in the JCTD Program will also result in a shift in Program metrics.  JCTDs supporting the DoD’s strategic priorities will tend to be longer and larger with increased emphasis on innovation, risk reduction, and affordability.  Overall, we envision initiating fewer yet more strategically decisive JCTD projects.  JCTDs will reinforce key partnerships across the Department, Services, other government agencies, select allies, and industry that allow for expedited development, deployment, and evaluation of capability solutions with potential to address some of the most pressing needs of the Department.  These JCTD partnerships will enable interdepartmental cooperation and capability development with the Departments of Homeland Security, State, Transportation, Justice, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.  

In FY 2015, Disruptive Demonstrations funding (P264) was transferred from the JCTD Program Element (PE) to a new PE 0603289D8Z (Advanced Innovative Analysis &amp; Concepts).</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The value and impact of the JCTD program is to cost-effectively address the Department’s strategic priorities to mitigate emergent threats, and address affordability and interoperability of Defense systems through Pre-EMD prototyping.  In FY 2014, the JCTD Program successfully completed the demonstration and transition of several JCTDs that addressed operational warfighting needs of the Department, providing affordable and sustainable solutions.  In addition, the program initiated several key prototyping efforts to address the strategic priorities of the Department.

Key values demonstrated by the JCTD program are:
•  The JCTD Program has a long history of providing enduring capabilities.  See “Section D.  Acquisition Strategy” for more details on transition.
•  Recent examples include: 
     1. A robust “detect and track” capability of "dark", i.e., non-emitting, maritime targets.  This is accomplished through automated data fusion of an existing suite of sensors supporting the Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) function.  This capability was successfully transitioned into the Sealink Advanced Analysis system at Office of Naval Intelligence and is now used by multiple agencies to provide a MDA capability.
     2. Counter-electronics High powered-microwave Advanced Missile Project (CHAMP) that demonstrated the capability of a missile with an integrated High Powered Microwave source to degrade, disrupt, or damage electronic systems.  The results are informing the acquisition system and will be used to address time sensitive capability shortfalls.
     3. Jetpack fifth to fourth supports Combatant Commanders' airborne gateway needs to distribute fifth Generation data to fourth Generation fighters by translating 5th Generation tactical data link messages into Link-16 messages that can be viewed by fourth Generation aircraft.  It is a critical force multiplier enabling 4th Generation aircraft to participate in a collaborative targeting environment that will be transitioning to our forces.
•  The JCTD Program enables coalition cooperative development by leveraging partner nation expertise and resources; approximately one-fifth of JCTD projects involve some degree of coalition partner participation.  As a result of successful past collaborations, the program now enjoys routine interactions with the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and the Republic of Korea. 
•  The JCTD Program also enables development and execution of interdepartmental cooperation projects with the Department of Homeland Security, State, Transportation, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.  

MEASURABLE OUTCOMES:  
•  JCTDs will demonstrate capability objectives within 24 - 48 months. 
•  The JCTD program achieved transition rates of the following:  70 percent transitioned to a new or existing Program(s) of Record, 24 percent transitioned to fieldable-prototypes (residual capabilities) sustained by non-JCTD funds in direct support of operations in theater.  In FY 2014, 17 of 18 completed JCTDs successfully transitioned.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>Kestrel Eye is a very small, 25 kilogram class satellite that provides “good enough” 1.5 meter resolution and visible imagery.  Imagery tasking and delivery is controlled directly by the Combatant Commander to ensure sufficient timelines for near real-time situational awareness and decision-making in the field.  The cost of less than $1.500 million enables an affordable constellation for persistence, near continuous converge between 45 degrees North/South.  The primary outputs and efficiencies are:  (1) finish one Block one “proof of concept” design; launch Block one Kestrel Eye and conduct on-orbit evaluation; and upgrade Block two design with propulsion system and improved telescope pointing using a star tracker.  The JCTD will build and launch three Block two design Kestrel Eye satellites.</r2:Description>

The prototype antenna is integrated onto a load-bearing belt with mission necessary enhanced features identified and addressed.  BWA also predicts greater performance and signal strength at several different positions versus current whip antennas, including the limiting prone position.  BWA replaces four current distinct whip antennas, totaling over five pounds, necessary to cover the same communication band.  BWA weighs three pounds creating a lighter load and increasing operator maneuverability by dispersing weight around the waist.  Radiation patterns for BWA will demonstrate lower radiation levels to the head compared to legacy antennas.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Title>Joint Biological Agent Decontamination System (JBADS)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>JBADS will provide biological decontamination by employing an innovative closed-loop, hot/humid forced air technique to significantly decontaminate the exterior/interior of a fully encapsulated aircraft.  The system provides a significant leap forward from the currently approved use of hot, soapy water without the corrosive properties inherent with commonly used biological disinfectants used for rolling stock but not permitted on aircraft.  This fully air-transportable green technique is designed for aircraft, however, the building block approach of the Thermal Decontamination Containment System allows for infinite configurations to encapsulate contaminated equipment in the future.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>This effort is comprised of three programs that support the entire JCTD Program, separate from the specific JCTD projects.  The three programs are (1) Unified COCOM Direct Support; (2) JCTD Pre-Transition; and (3) Program Integration Office for execution of select, classified projects.  (1) COCOM Direct Support:  The COCOMs are essential in specifying capability needs, project development, demonstration, assessment, and transition of JCTDs.  The JCTD Program provides direct support to COCOMs, enabling the COCOMs to provide an on-site JCTD manager, typically one to two full-time equivalents (FTEs).  (2) JCTD Pre-Transition:  In some cases, Service or Agency partner transition funding is not available for one to two years following the JCTD assessment phase due to Service or Agency commitments.  In such cases, where there is a clear transition and the need to sustain the capability for a short time prior to availability of Service or Agency transition funds the JCTD Pre-Transition fund may be used to meet that need.  (3) Program Integration Office:  A limited number of classified projects such as electronic miniaturization, electronic countermeasures, advanced mobile ad hoc network communications, and space situational awareness, which require enhanced security measures due to need-to-know and/or mission partner sensitivities, are managed within the Program Integration Office.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>LCMD Prototype is a ballistic missile defense system designed to counter current and emerging Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) and Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2/AD) threats.  LCMD is structured using a building block approach that first conducts a technology demonstration effort under the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense, Emerging Capability &amp; Prototyping (DASD (EC&amp;P)) to accelerate technology maturation.  The Concept of Operations (CONOPS) for the system has been formulated to integrate LCMD into the existing National Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) architecture and will prioritize the use of existing components and systems already fielded.  LCMD is not designed as a replacement to existing BMD systems, but rather as a lower cost complementary/augmentative component to forward-deployed BMD assets.  The LCMD capability will augment current BMD systems and mitigate threat vulnerabilities to U.S. personnel and strategic assets.  Initial LCMD architecture, specifications, performance and critical technologies were defined, analyzed, and tested in FY 2014 under the Emerging Capabilities and Technology Development Program Element (PE) 0603699D8Z.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Successful JCTDs can transition to acquisition via one of several methods:
-  The JCTD addresses a documented capability gap in an existing Program of Record.  The existing POR can acquire, further develop, sustain, and provide the capability under existing program documentation.
-  The capabilities address capability gaps that naturally fit with an existing POR, but program documentation addressing the new capabilities does not exist.  In these cases, existing POR documentation (such as the Capabilities Development Document or Capabilities Production Document) is revised to include the new capabilities from the JCTD, and the JCTD capabilities transition to the POR.
-  The capabilities address a current operational need without requiring POR changes.  In these cases, the JCTD capabilities may transition directly to operational use, with sustainment (operations and maintenance) funding arranged through the gaining command.  
-  The capabilities may be widely applicable commodity products, useful to many commands.  In these cases, the commodity products listed on General Services Administration schedule, and made available for purchase by any commands needing the capability, using procurement funds.
-  Results of JCTD are used to inform the research and engineering, acquisition, or requirements process.
-  JCTD demonstrates the art-of-possible and results are put on the shelf to meet future threats and operational needs.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Strategic Goals Supported:
-  Develop and demonstrate a prototype that fills a capability gap 
-  Demonstrate a capability to address a DoD key strategic gap 
-  Develop a prototype that informs the acquisition and requirements process 
-  Independent Assessment Capability
-  Successful Military Utility Assessment (MUA)

The majority of funding from this program element is forwarded to the Services/Defense Agencies that execute the individual JCTD projects.  

MEASURABLE OUTCOMES:  
•  JCTDs will demonstrate capability objectives within 24-48 months: 
•  The JCTD program achieved transition rates of the following:  70 percent transitioned to a new or existing Program(s) of Record, 24 percent transitioned to fieldable-prototypes (residual capabilities) sustained by non-JCTD funds in direct support of operations in theater.  In FY 2014, 17 of 18 completed JCTDs successfully transitioned.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>The "Disruptive Demonstrations" Program code was inserted to support development/demonstration of time-sensitive capabilities that address Secretary/Department Strategic Vectors, and Chairman’s Gap Assessment of capability shortfalls.  As a result, we anticipate less partner funding for those strategic investment areas and will have to rely on greater partner funding for other JCTD projects.  Overall we envision fewer JCTD projects that will be longer in duration.

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>The Department made the decision to sunset the initial thrust of this program in fiscal year (FY) 2014.  The program element (PE) has been refocused in FY 2016.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Currently fielded satellite communications (SATCOM), terrestrial, and Tactical Data Links (TDLs) would be adversely effected in operations in Anti-Access/Area-Denial (A2/AD) environments.  The primary threat is from sophisticated electronic warfare whose effects may be enhanced by other techniques.  Therefore, in FY 2016 the Network Communications Capability Program (NCCP) will return with a new focus that seeks to enable the development and deployment of Joint robust/resilient and assured communications.  The goal is to mitigate degradation across the operational tiers (strategic, operational, and tactical) and domains (nuclear, intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance [ISR], command and control [C2], etc.) to ultimately support the mission needs of Joint Functional Component Commanders (JFCCs), Joint Force Commanders (JFCs), and deployed forces. 

The DoD has large investments in TDLs that may have to operate in an A2/AD environment.  Examples include communications planning systems (across multiple domains and echelons), situational awareness capabilities with limited automation support for highly dynamic A2/AD environments, aerial networking technologies that create Beyond-Line-of-Sight(BLOS)communications, and networking backbone technologies for disruptive environments.  This research will develop new technology and exploit existing methodologies to ensure performance in A2/AD environments.  Additionally, this will enable standardization of military network communications capabilities across the Department.

Beginning in FY 2016, the Robust Tactical Data Links Modernization (RTDLM) project will specifically address the need for improvements in robustness and efficiency to the current Link-16, which is the primary data link deployed over 10,000 radios with United States (U.S.) and Allied militaries.  It will focus mainly on developing ways to improve the resiliency and range/reachability of the tactical data links lost due to conditions in an A2/AD environment.  This will include advanced and improved Link 16 waveform designs, receiver processing algorithms, and advanced data forwarding and routing overlay technologies as well as alternative antenna systems.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Department made the decision to sunset the initial thrust of this program in FY 2014. Tactical Mobile Networking, Spectrum Management Tools and Analysis, and Tactical Networking Evolution and Expansion projects completed the final tasks as listed below.

Currently fielded satellite communications (SATCOM), terrestrial, and Tactical Data Links (TDLs) would be adversely effected in operations in Anti-Access/Area-Denial (A2/AD) environments.  Therefore, in FY 2016 the Network Communications Capability Program (NCCP) will return with a new focus that seeks to enable the development and deployment of Joint robust and assured communications.  

Robust Tactical Data Links Modernization (RTDLM) – In a contested environment, especially when conducting forward operations, platforms face a significant electronic warfare threat.  Improvements in tactical communication systems for Joint airborne networking are required to mitigate advances in threat electronic warfare systems.  The RTDLM project will develop advanced technologies to address these needs, design and build prototype systems to verify the technology in operationally relevant environments against representative threats, and manage the migration and transition of these technologies to service platforms, radios, and other combat mission systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This program will address both the need for improvements to the current Link-16 data link and the need for advanced directional network systems for current and future advanced tactical fighters and unmanned systems.  This project will create effective networking in contested A2/AD environments.  Spectrum awareness and adaptive networking significantly mitigates the effectiveness of interference and retains reliable connectivity and C2.  The RTDLM project will develop and provide the framework, technologies, experimentation, and analytical efforts to support advances in DoD Tactical Data Links (TDLs).  It will develop and mature technologies to support direct transition of the algorithms, prototype implementations, waveform improvements, and system design improvements to radio, waveform, and weapon systems programs managed by each Military Department via fully instrumented field demonstrations and assessments.

Overall Goal: Increase communication and network performance (i.e. “Buy-Back” degraded capabilities) while improving robustness and availability of these communication waveforms and robust/resilient networks to adversary electronic warfare attack.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>The RDT&amp;E goal for Robust Tactical Data Links Modernization (RTDLM) is capability improvements that achieve 70% “Buy-Back” of the tactical data link range ratio and 80% of the area of operation lost in the A2/AD environment.

Achieve significant DoD savings for radio modifications or integration into new terminals (economies of scale), as Services share non-recurring development costs for common and successful Tactical Data Link enhancements.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Our military forces require resilient, reliable networks and computer systems to conduct effective operations.  However, the number and sophistication of threats in cyberspace are rapidly growing, making it critical to improve the cyber security of DoD networks to counter those threats and assure our missions.  This program focuses on innovative and sustained advanced development in both cyber security and computer network operations to mature new concepts to harden key network and computer components to include: designing new resilient cyber infrastructures; increasing the military’s ability to fight and survive during cyber attacks; disrupting nation-state level attack planning and execution; measuring the state of cyber security for the U.S. government; increasing our understanding of cyber as a war-fighting domain; and providing modeling and simulation of cyberspace operations to explore and exploit new ideas in cyber warfare for agile cyber operations and mission assurance, and protection of tactical networks, weapons systems and platforms.
 
The Cyber Advanced Technology Development program element (PE) was budgeted in the advanced technology development budget activity because it focused on the maturation of successful applied research results, and their development, into demonstrable advanced cyber security capabilities.  The Cyber Advanced Technology Development program built upon the results of matured applied research from the Cyber Applied Research PE (0602668D8Z), and other programs, to develop technology demonstrations for potential transition into capabilities that support the full spectrum of computer network operations.  These approaches included moving from cyber defense to cyber resilience by changing the defensive terrain of our existing digital infrastructure, identifying ways to raise the risk and lower the value of an attack from an advanced persistent cyber threat, and focusing on mission assurance metrics. 
 
The program focused on science &amp; technology (S&amp;T) to address joint problems in cyber defense and operations.  The focus of the research was on filling capability and technology gaps identified in the Cyber Community of Interest S&amp;T Roadmap, the 2013 Cyber S&amp;T Capability Gap Framework and other assessments conducted by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (OASD(R&amp;E)).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Cyber Advanced Technology Development program built upon, matured, and transitioned the results of successful applied research results from the Cyber Applied Research PE.  The link between the Cyber Applied Research and Cyber Advanced Technology Development PEs was intended to create a mechanism to take existing basic research results and mature them to the point of incorporation into technology demonstrations.  This program focused on science &amp; technology (S&amp;T) to address joint challenges in cyber defense and operations. The focus of the research was on filling capability and technology gaps identified in the Cyber Community of Interest S&amp;T Roadmap, the 2013 Cyber S&amp;T Capability Gap Framework and other assessments conducted by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (OASD(R&amp;E)). Progress and results are reviewed by the Cyber S&amp;T Community of Interest.
        
Beginning in FY 2013, the program expanded research in cyber command and control to provide warfighters and commanders new situational awareness, course of action analysis, cyber operational agility and cyber mission control.  This research included protection of tactical networks, weapons systems and platforms.  The six new technical thrust areas were:

                                    <r2:Description>Develop the ability to assess and control the cyber situation within a military mission context.  While the focus in cyber research is often placed on individual technologies, how these technologies work toward an effective mission is critical for the DoD.  The objective of Assuring Effective Missions presents technology challenges in the areas of Cyber Mission Control and Effects at Scale.  Cyber Mission Control covers the ability to orchestrate cyber systems to achieve an overarching mission goal.  To perform dynamic analysis of asset criticality and course of action analysis alternatives, there is a critical need for tools that can map information technology assets to missions and use modeling and simulation, or other techniques.  Inherent in Cyber Mission Control is the ability to automatically derive and fuse information about the characteristics of information technology systems in a manner that allows us to describe, analyze, observe, and control the operation of information technology components.  A key goal of this research area is to have tools that enable commanders to assess and direct different information technology maneuvers in conjunction with mission actions.  Effects at Scale encompass full spectrum challenges that intersect with cyber becoming a new full-fledged domain of warfare.</r2:Description>

There are two technical challenges associated with cyber modeling, simulation, and experimentation: 1) Cyber Modeling and Simulation and 2) Cyber Measurement.  Cyber Modeling and Simulation seeks to develop tools and techniques that enable analytical modeling and multi-scale simulation of complex cyber systems.  Cyber Measurement develops cyber experimentation and test range technology to conduct controlled, repeatable experiments, providing the ability to track the progress of cyber research investments in a quantitative fashion.  This area will explore new analytical methodologies, models, and experimental data sets to establish metrics to measure a system’s state of security, apply the scientific method to establish the foundations of a framework in which cyber security research can be conducted, to test hypotheses with measurable and repeatable results, and the quantitative experimentation and assessment for new cyber technologies.  These new methodologies will enable the exploration of modeling and simulation tools and techniques that can drive innovation in research. Additionally, these methodologies will aid in integrated experimentation by simulating the cyber environment with sufficient fidelity and integrating cyber modeling and simulation with the traditional modeling and simulation related to the kinetic domain.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Human Social Culture Behavior (HSCB) Modeling Program is a vertically integrated effort to research, develop, and transition technologies, tools, and systems to programs of record and users in need.  The Program exists to optimize U.S. forces’ ability to perform population-centric sensing, understand behaviors driven by social and cultural variables, and select effective courses of action in the full range of military operations.  Program research will enhance population-centric intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities for understanding the increasingly complex global environment to address national strategic challenges such as instability, aggression, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and violent extremism.  In three integrated program elements (PEs), the Program will conduct applied research, mature and demonstrate advanced technology, and develop transitionable methods, technology, tools and prototypes.  Work under PE 0603670D8Z is focused on developing and demonstrating general-use, cross-domain tools in two areas: computational modeling; and sociocultural behavior data collection, management, and dissemination.  Research will result in more effective cultural understanding in existing intelligence, influence operations, and operations planning systems; modeling capabilities for forecasting reactions to U.S./coalition actions; demonstration of strategic decision making tools that highlight political, religious, cultural, and related factors; tools and technologies enabling more widespread and effective use of sociocultural behavior models in operations and mission rehearsal; and toolsets that can be used as strategic decision making tools to account for sociocultural factors.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The Program has emphasized development of tools to support forecasting of instability.  In addition to refining and extending those tools, the Program is researching and developing comparable models and tools for analysis and forecasting of other events of interest.  Work in this area also includes modeling to support analysis of alternative courses of action (COA).  This is a challenging objective that requires research, development and integration of constituent technologies.  Integrate and demonstrate decision making support tools useful within programs of record and operational user analysis, planning and execution systems for political, religious, cultural and other factors.  Support specific operational planning tasks for selected government partners via limited technical demonstration in user settings.  In addition, working with operational partners HSCB Program models will be tested in realistic environments by representative users.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Defense-wide Manufacturing Science and Technology (DMS&amp;T), established within the Manufacturing Technology Program directed in Title 10 USC Section 2521, provides the Department with a comprehensive manufacturing program to achieve the strategic goals of focused technology, improved acquisition across the life cycles, and cost-effective logistics.  By designing for manufacturability early in development, anticipated results will have an impact on increasing reliability and decreasing the life cycle burden of weapon systems. The mission to anticipate and close gaps in defense manufacturing capabilities and drive significant system life cycle affordability benefits makes DMS&amp;T an increasingly important leveraging tool in the current budget environment.
			
DMS&amp;T will: 1) address manufacturing enterprise game-changing initiatives that are beyond the scope of any one Military Department or Defense Agency or platform and, 2) establish and mature cross-cutting manufacturing processes required for transitioning emerging technologies which impact the time lines, affordability, and productivity of acquisition programs and shorten the deployment cycle times.
			
The DMS&amp;T program is fundamental to a coordinated development process.  Concurrent development of manufacturing processes with the S&amp;T development enables the use of emerging technologies.  Key technical areas for investment for DMS&amp;T include Advanced Electronics and Optics Manufacturing, Advanced Materials Manufacturing, and Enterprise and Emerging Manufacturing.  Advanced Electronics and Optics addresses advanced manufacturing technologies for a wide range of applications such as sensors, radars, power generation, switches, and optics for defense applications.  Advanced Materials addresses advanced manufacturing technologies for a wide range of materials such as composites, metals, ceramics, nanomaterials, metamaterials, and low observables.  Enterprise and Emerging Manufacturing addresses advanced manufacturing technologies and enterprise business practices for defense applications.  Key focus areas include the industrial information infrastructure, advanced design/qualification/cost tools, supply network integration technologies and management practices, direct digital (or additive) manufacturing, machining; robotics, assembly, and joining.

Institutes for Manufacturing Innovation program funding is also included in this program element (first addressed in the FY 2015 President’s Budget). Technical innovation and leadership in manufacturing are essential to sustaining the foundations of economic prosperity to enable our military to maintain technological advantage and global dominance. To support these goals, Institutes for Manufacturing Innovation (IMI) will serve as regional hubs to accelerate technological innovation into commercial application and concurrently develop the educational competencies and production processes via shared public-private sectors.  The establishment of the IMIs, supported by resources from multiple U.S. Government agencies, will spur industry cost-share for manufacturing innovation and quickly develop a pathway for technology-focused regional hubs for collaboration among government, industry, and academia that will meet critical government and Warfighter needs. The concept of these institutes is described in the President’s National Science and Technology Council report by the Advanced Manufacturing National Program Office entitled, “National Network for Manufacturing Innovation: A Preliminary Design,” published in January 2013.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The DMS&amp;T program has a two-pronged approach: 1) technology initiatives and 2) specific single projects.  Technology initiatives, in collaboration with the Joint Defense Manufacturing Technology Panel (JDMTP) and industry, identify and develop investment strategies to advance the manufacturing processes needed to support the specific technology.  Above-the-shop-floor investments focus on new manufacturing processes that have potential to significantly improve manufacturing efficiencies. Single specific projects address investment opportunities not associated with selected technology initiatives and enable the program to respond to urgent, compelling manufacturing needs and provide seed funding to more high risk-high payoff technologies.
 			
Data calls are launched through two methods to identify technology initiatives and single specific issues requiring investment.  One method is through the JDMTP.  The JDMTP is comprised of the ManTech Directors from the Services, Defense Logistics Agency, and Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD).  The call is distributed through the ManTech Directors to the four JDMTP sub panels: Metals Processing and Fabrication Subpanel, Composites Processing and Fabrication Subpanel, Electronics Processing and Fabrication Subpanel, and Advanced Manufacturing Enterprise Subpanel. Potential candidates are evaluated by the JDMTP based on criteria set forth in the call and announcements, and then down-selected for further development prior to final selection.  The other method is through Broad Agency Announcements to industry.  Priority is given to investments that support affordability and producibility of critical enabling manufacturing technologies that cut across multiple platforms.  Investments also balance defense priorities in specialty materials, electronics, propulsion and power, and manufacturing processes including "above the shop floor" (lean and business technologies facilitating interoperable manufacturing).  Final projects are selected by the OSD ManTech Director, considering input from the JDMTP and Director of Manufacturing, and as approved by Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense, Manufacturing and Industrial Base Policy (MIBP).  Technology initiatives and projects are executed at the Component level.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>P350 is a new project number in this budget cycle.  Funding for the Institutes for Manufacturing Innovation was reported in the FY 2015 President's Budget in P680, and has now been extracted for clarity.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Technological innovation and leadership in manufacturing are essential to sustaining the foundations of economic prosperity to enable our military to maintain technological advantage and global dominance. To support these goals, Institutes for Manufacturing Innovation (IMIs), each led by non-profit 501(c) entities, will serve as regional hubs to accelerate technological innovation into commercial applications and concurrently develop the educational competencies and production processes via shared public-private sectors.  Collaborative execution and funding by the Departments of Defense (DoD), Energy (DOE), and Commerce (DoC), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the National Science Foundation (NSF) to support the establishment of these IMIs will spur industry cost-share for manufacturing innovation and quickly develop a pathway for technology-focused regional hubs for collaboration among government, industry, and academia that will meet critical government and Warfighter needs. The concept of these institutes is described in the President’s National Science and Technology Council report by the Advanced Manufacturing National Program Office entitled, “National Network for Manufacturing Innovation: A Preliminary Design,” published in January 2013.

Each of the six DoD-led IMIs addressed in this budget is expected to be self-sustaining, without reliance on federal sustainment funding, by the end of the cooperative agreement (CA) period between the federal government and the non-profit-led consortium.  This CA period is typically for five years, with the option to extend the agreement up to two years for the benefit of DoD projects, technical achievement, etc., to fully leverage the minimum 1:1 cost share.  All subsequent (post-CA) federal funding provided to any IMI will be on a specific project basis by the requirements generators, either within or external to DoD.

Each of the six DoD-led IMIs is intended to: 
1) Bring together industry, universities and community colleges, federal agencies, and state and local governments and organizations to create regionally-based but nationally-impactful public-private partnerships underpinning the formation of sustainable manufacturing innovation ecosystems
2) Accelerate innovation to bridge the gap between Research and Development (R&amp;D) and deployment of technological innovations in domestic production of goods
3) Invest in industrially relevant manufacturing technologies with broad applications, accelerating innovation within DoD and across all manufacturing sectors to increase U.S. competitiveness
4) Provide shared assets to help companies access cutting-edge capabilities and equipment 
5) Create an unparalleled environment to educate and train students and workers in advanced manufacturing skills
6) Focus on maturing the associated manufacturing technologies from Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL) 4 to 7

The first and second year of each of these new non-profit business entities is devoted to creating a sustainable business model, with follow-on refinement through the final year, including: growing the membership of each Institute as appropriate; initiating revenue streams (e.g., membership fees, training and workforce development, certification and licensing, etc.); establishing provisional Executive Board and Technical Advisory committees to execute the business of each institute; finalizing Intellectual Property plans; developing technology roadmaps to inform investment strategies; opening industrial commons to provide for shared resource facilities available to all institute members; initiating workforce training programs in each technology area; establishing complementary relationships between IMIs; analyzing the U.S. and Global industrial base in partnership with other government agencies to build upon the institute portfolio and address critical requirements; and further developing national technology roadmaps.

Each established Institute for Manufacturing Innovation was selected through a competitive process.  The executing DoD Service published a formal solicitation for proposals for each IMI, describing extensive proposal evaluation criteria. Non-Profit Organizations and Universities were eligible to bid, and each bidder formed a broad consortium of industry and academic partners for its proposal team. The executing DoD Service used a team of government experts to evaluate each proposal against the evaluation criteria and selected a winning consortium.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>Additive manufacturing (i.e., “3D printing”) is a process of joining materials to make objects from 3D model data, usually layer upon layer, as opposed to subtractive manufacturing methodologies such as traditional machining. The mission of the IMI is to accelerate additive manufacturing technologies to the U.S. manufacturing sector and increase domestic manufacturing competitiveness. Advanced additive manufacturing will benefit the DoD by enabling lifecycle cost savings and enhanced capabilities, including moving toward “focused logistics” – getting the right part in the right place in just the right time – for wartime and humanitarian missions using local supply chains. This IMI was established in 2012, with cooperative agreement funding contribution included in this budget through FY 2016.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>The Emerging Capabilities Technology Development (ECTD) Program Element (PE) supports a shift in focus throughout the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Emerging Capability &amp; Prototyping (DASD (EC&amp;P)) to producing risk-reducing prototypes and demonstrations of emerging technologies coordinated through interagency and joint partnerships.  ECTD will support the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research &amp; Engineering (ASD(R&amp;E)) under the Mitigating New and Emerging Threats priority area with longer-term, mission-focused capability development that crosses functional domains to enhance Warfighter adaptability and resilience.  The office will execute projects in collaboration with government labs, academia, and industry that target specific mission capability gaps identified by the Combatant Commands (COCOMs), the Joint Staff and senior leadership in the Office of the Secretary of Defense.

In FY 2015, Disruptive Demonstrations (Project P369) funding was transferred from PE 0603699D8Z ECTD to PE 0603289D8Z (Advanced Innovative Analysis and Concepts).</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The ECTD funding supports projects that reduce the technology risk of emerging capabilities by advancing proof of principle prototypes in support of near and mid-term operational engagements and stability operations.  The framework is guided by the ASD(R&amp;E), DASD(EC&amp;P) and the Rapid Reaction Technology Office's science and technology objectives and focus areas.  With an emphasis on interagency and joint partnerships, ECTD develops initiatives to produce capability options that anticipate and inform formal joint and interagency requirements and acquisition processes.  Individual projects generally span one to three years, typically at a cost of less than $4.000 million, and are demonstrated and released in spirals within the project timeline.  The ECTD Program focuses on rapid prototyping of emerging technologies including electromagnetic spectrum-agile capability options, multi-domain, autonomous systems, counter-weapons of mass destruction, and dismounted soldier systems.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>Low Cost Missile Defeat (LCMD) is a ballistic missile defense system designed to counter current and emerging Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) and Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2/AD) threats.  LCMD is structured using a building block approach that first conducts a technology demonstration effort under the DASD (EC&amp;P) to accelerate technology maturation.  The Concept of Operations (CONOPS) for the system has been formulated to integrate LCMD into the existing National Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) architecture and will prioritize the use of existing components and systems already fielded.  LCMD is not designed as a replacement to existing BMD systems, but rather as a lower cost complementary/augmentative component to forward-deployed BMD assets.  The LCMD capability will augment current BMD systems and mitigate threat vulnerabilities to U.S. personnel and strategic assets.</r2:Description>

                                            <r2:Text>Thunderstorm Spirals 14-1, 14-2, 14-3 and 14-3A planning began in late FY 2013.  All FY 2014 Spirals capitalized on the lessons learned from previous spirals with special emphasis on information sharing; mitigating barriers to information sharing and evaluating prototype technologies.  Spiral 14-1 was a stand-alone threat convergence analyses designed to explore existing and nascent technology in an effort to expose threats to our national security; specifically those described as "Black Swan" events.  Spiral 14-2 was a Distributed Tabletop effort that focused on countering chemical and biological Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) in a maritime environment and served as a precursor to the 14-3 Field Demonstration.  The Spiral 14-3 field demonstration took place in the southeast United States.  Key operational partners included the Joint Interagency Task Force South (JIATF-S), United States Coast Guard (USCG), Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI), National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), National Intelligence-Geospatial Agency (NGA), Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), Joint Program Executive Office (JPEO) for Chemical and Biological  Defense, and Special Operations Command (SOCOM).  Spiral 14-3A was an adjunct effort in partnership with the Edgewood Chemical Biological Center (ECBC).  Four chemical/biological detection technologies that showed exceptional promise in Spiral 14-3 were invited to ECBC to evaluate their systems in a more realistic environment.  In FY 2014, Thunderstorm demonstrated a total of 55 technologies and transitioned eight technologies to operational end users.  In addition, five of the technologies have informed follow-on research and development investment and another five have informed the development of agency tactics, techniques and procedures.</r2:Text>

                                    <r2:Description>This portfolio will focus on cost-effective, mission-focused projects to design, develop, and deliver technology prototypes of cutting edge multi-domain, autonomous systems to meet the Department’s goal to drive innovation in aviation, space, maritime and ground combat systems.  Autonomous systems range from software to aid the intelligence analyst in processing, exploitation and dissemination, through very complex autonomous air systems networked in tandem with unmanned ground or undersea vehicles.  The technologies associated with autonomy are multiplying:  from sensors that can understand the environment, to software algorithms that can make a decision or seek human assistance.  Through autonomy, the DoD will reduce the manpower required to safely conduct missions.  Multi-domain, autonomous systems developed and demonstrated through this focus area will seek to enhance the capabilities of unmanned systems to enable missions across air, sea, land and space environments and advance the state-of-the-art in cooperative behaviors among autonomous systems, such as Unmanned Aircraft Systems, Unmanned Ground Combat Vehicles, Unmanned Underwater Vehicles, and Unmanned Surface Vessels.  These prototypes will be delivered to joint and Service users to evaluate operational capabilities under realistic conditions and against current adversaries or anticipated threats.  Potential venues for prototype assessment include the Stiletto Maritime Demonstration Program, Thunderstorm integration exercises and the Joint Experimental Range Complex (JERC).  Knowledge and experience gained through those demonstrations will help develop new warfighting concepts and inform requirements and technical feasibility of future acquisition programs.  Development of advanced autonomous systems prototypes will involve partnerships with industry and academia and permit operational users to gain insight into future technology-enabled strategies and tactics.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>This focus area for FY 2015 and FY 2016, in anticipation of emerging needs, will include the development and advancement of prototype technologies that focus on the detection and interdiction of chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and high yield explosives threats.  Projects may include techniques and methodologies that improve detection sensitivities, persistent Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), tagging and tracking technologies, data analysis tools, and global situational awareness.  Efforts will support the DoD’s Strategy for Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction by developing and demonstrating active and passive defenses that address both known threats and potential surprises in adversaries’ Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) technology and employment methods, particularly those that could present challenges to existing countermeasures.  The constant evolution of WMD materials, tactics, and technologies calls for the development of flexible and innovative solutions that leverage the full range of DoD and interagency tools and capabilities.  Capabilities that support these tasks include detection; modeling; detailed operational planning; and analysis of materials, precursors and agents that may be related to a proliferation activity, an adversary’s developmental or fielded capability or the actual use of WMD.  Prototypes developed in this focus area will be delivered to joint and Service users to evaluate operational capabilities under realistic conditions and against current adversaries or anticipated threats.  Potential venues for prototype assessment include assets such as Thunderstorm integration exercises and the Joint Experimental Range Complex (JERC).

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Congress established the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) in 1990 (10 U.S.C. Section 2901-2904) to address Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of Energy (DOE) environmental concerns.  It is conducted as a DoD program, jointly planned and executed by the DoD, DOE, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), with strong participation by other Federal agencies, industry, and academia.  SERDP`s objective is to improve DoD mission readiness and environmental performance by providing new scientific knowledge and cost-effective technologies in the areas of Environmental Restoration, Munitions Response, Resource Conservation and Climate Change, and Weapons Systems and Platforms.  SERDP does this by addressing high priority DoD environmental technology requirements.  SERDP enhances military operations, improves military systems` effectiveness, enhances military training/readiness, sustains DoD’s training and test ranges and installation infrastructure, and helps ensure the safety and welfare of military personnel and their dependents by eliminating or reducing the generation of pollution and use of hazardous materials and reducing the cost of remedial actions and compliance with environmental laws and regulations.  As a secondary benefit, SERDP helps solve significant national and international environmental problems.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Congress established the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) in 1990 (10 U.S.C. Section 2901-2904) to address Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of Energy (DOE) environmental concerns.  It is conducted as a DoD program, jointly planned and executed by the DoD, DOE, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), with strong participation by other Federal agencies, industry, and academia.  SERDP`s objective is to improve DoD mission readiness and environmental performance by providing new scientific knowledge and cost-effective technologies in the areas of Environmental Restoration, Munitions Response, Resource Conservation and Climate Change, and Weapons Systems and Platforms.  SERDP does this by addressing high-priority DoD environmental technology requirements.  Technologies developed by SERDP enhance military operations, improve military systems’ effectiveness, enhance military training/readiness, sustain DoD’s training and test ranges and installation infrastructure, and help ensure the safety and welfare of military personnel and their dependents by eliminating or reducing the generation of pollution and use of hazardous materials and by reducing the cost of remedial actions and compliance with environmental laws and regulations.  As a secondary benefit, SERDP helps solve significant national and international environmental problems.  The keys to a growing list of SERDP technological successes are the ability to respond aggressively and proactively to priority defense environmental needs; the pursuit of world-class technical excellence; and an emphasis on constant technology transfer.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Joint Warfighting Program (JWP) is a pivotal resource that synchronizes two Department-wide domains, military requirements and acquisition, with shared analyses and actionable assessments.  JWP supports analyses for customers including joint command staffs, the Joint Staff, and OSD elements responsible for oversight of Components equipping forces for joint missions. The account underwrites limited-scope analyses, experiments, and partnerships that define joint capability gaps and develop actionable requirements for follow-on acquisition efforts.  This program element plays a major role in portfolio assessments aiming to identify critical gaps between Service-generated capabilities and suggest affordable solutions. JWP funds venues for demonstration of emergent technology-based prototypes that enable joint customers to draft requirements based on realistic understanding of feasible solutions.  JWP specifically aims to assist joint-end-users by analyses that identify essential capability improvements as actionable joint military needs expressed as specific Key Performance Parameters (KKPs) and Key System Attributes (KSAs).  These analyses and assessments deliver independent perspectives on ways to align Service and Agency investments and potential solutions for capability gaps created by evolving threats not aligned to single Component missions.  Though a relatively modest program, JWP is consistently cited by joint combatant commanders’ staffs as the seminal infusion of funding that spawned insightful demonstrations, theater centers of excellence, mission essential capability modifications and strategic concepts.  JWP also underwrites staff analyses in the Acquisition, Technology &amp; Logistics staff of the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD).  Working with Service, OSD and joint command counterparts, the AT&amp;L staff performs portfolio assessments focusing on warfighting environments ten to twenty years ahead.   

Typical projects funded with JWP include translation of capability gap assessments into actionable military needs statements, identification of candidate solutions via experimentation, translation of solution concepts into field demonstrations, and remedy of joint capability gaps in partnership with Defense agents for doctrine changes and technology development.  JWP resources dedicated to direct support joint commands provides analytic expertise not normally allocated via formal staffing billets.  In this activity, JWP underwrites small grants to invigorate employment of experimentation and analysis, to formulate strategies to resolve joint capability gaps, and to stimulate participation in the Department enterprises for joint experimentation and joint capability development.  JWP resources also support Mission Area Portfolio Assessments (MAPA), and the development of tools supporting joint analytic efforts.

The balance of JWP funds contributes resources to examination of potential remedies for joint mission capability gaps.  These early assessments of potential capability gap solutions can accelerate engineering development, subsequent field experiments, and capability demonstrations in field conditions.  This segment of JWP often represents the first effort to define alternative solutions across the range of Doctrine, Organization, Training, Material, Leadership and Personnel-Facilities.  The resources sustain a small segment of civilian operation research analysis (currently hosted by the Institute for Defense Analysis – IDA and the Naval Postgraduate School - NPS).  Administered by the Joint Operations Support (JOS) division within OSD’s AT&amp;L organization, JOS works closely and continuously with joint customers around the world.  Analytic project selection is undertaken in consultation with the OSD staffs serving AT&amp;L and Policy and with elements of the Joint Staff.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:Text>-Conducted the Joint Interagency Field Experiment (JIFX) in partnership with the Naval Post Graduate School to enable Combatant Command staffs to better define capability requirements.
-Conducted in JIFX three, week-long, field experiments focused on emerging technologies with over 120 individual experiments engaging more than 800 participants from industry, academia, Non-Government Organizations (NGOs), all services, 8 of 9 CCMDs  and other government agencies to include Departments of Homeland Security (co-sponsor), State, Energy, Justice, Health and Human Services and  Transportation.
-Conducted in JIFX general technology assessments of all experiments and provided the results to CCMDs (and other federal entities upon request) in the form of published technical reports available on the JIFX website or from the Defense Technical Information Center. This information provides the CCMDs in the requirements process and limited objective experiments. Evaluation data for individual experiments was shared with the technology provider and early indications are that more than 75% of these organizations change their products based on this government feedback.
-Conducted in JIFX detailed cyber and Radio Frequency (RF) vulnerability assessments of 23 emerging technologies providing thorough and realistic potential adversarial assessment of a single technologies and a system-of-systems early in the technology development cycle.  This information was provided to CCMDs in the form of technical reports for use in requirements development and is available for acquisition decision-making. Early data suggests that more than 90% of these technology providers change their products based on this feedback.
-Initiated development of a risk evaluation strategy for cyber effects to inform FY16 Platform Resilience and Mission Assurance analytical agenda.
-Developed a cyber-vulnerability mitigation strategy typology that complements DoD's Risk Management Framework. 
-Examined mission priorities and criticality of systems (weapon systems and tactical communications systems) based on Department planning scenarios as a precursor for evaluating cyber resilience.
-Initiated alignment of cyber effects to missions to determine potential risk, opportunities, impacts and implications as a precursor to inform cyber resilience roadmaps.
-Completed a review of analytical approaches being used (or could be used) to identify key cyber terrain in both fielded weapon systems and systems at various stages in the acquisition process.</r2:Text>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Software is a key to meeting the Department of Defense's (DoD’s) increasing demand for high-quality, affordable, and timely national defense systems.  Systemic software issues are significant contributors to poor program execution, and reliance on software-intensive mobile and net based products and systems has been increasing (for example (e.g.), Joint Tactical Radio System, USS ZUMWALT (DDG-1000), Joint Strike Fighter, F-22, and Army Modernization).  As stated in the 2010 National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences report entitled Critical Code, “It is dangerous to conclude that we are reaching a plateau in capability and technology for software producibility.”  The report notes that software is “…unconstrained by traditional physical engineering limitations…” and what we can accomplish is derived “…from [the] human intellectual capacity to conceptualize and understand systems….”  With growing global parity in software engineering, the DoD must maintain leadership to avoid strategic surprise.  The Software Engineering Institute (SEI) Program Element (PE) addresses the critical need to research, develop, and rapidly transition state-of-the-art software technology, tools, development environments, and best practices to improve the engineering, management, fielding, evolution, acquisition, and sustainment of software-intensive DoD systems.  The SEI’s program of work coordinates across the Department through Reliance 21, the overarching framework of the DoD’s Science and Technology (S&amp;T) joint planning and coordination process.  This PE directly benefits these DoD S&amp;T Communities of Interest (COI): Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I); Autonomy; Cyber; and Engineered Resilient Systems.  Additionally, this PE benefits every COI to some degree due to the ubiquitous nature of software.  This PE also leverages expertise in government, industry, and academia to enable the development of joint-Service capabilities.

Software is more pervasive than ever and computer programs are growing in size and complexity.  Designing, managing, and securing integrated, complex, and large-scale mission-critical systems are abilities that the DoD and the Defense Industrial Base have not yet mastered.  To address this, the PE funds research and development within the SEI Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) and, to access particular expertise, in the Services, industry, and academia.

The SEI FFRDC is the DoD’s dedicated source for software research and development.  It is an institute which enables the exploitation of emerging software technology by bringing engineering, management, and security discipline to software acquisition, development, and evolution.  The SEI FFRDC focuses on software technology areas judged to be of the highest payoff in meeting defense needs.

Private sector investment has created rapid advances in information technologies, but the pace of transition to DoD applications is often very slow or the commercial applications do not meet DoD unique needs, e.g., high assurance software or large-scale integrated systems.  The DoD needs to create opportunities to discover emerging technologies, to evaluate their potential to fit DoD needs, and where appropriate, conduct critical tests of the technologies under DoD conditions.  The Software Producibility Initiative, project P783, works across the Services, industry, and academia to research and transition software science and tools that address the capacity to design, produce, assure, and evolve software-intensive systems in a predictable manner while effectively managing risk, cost, schedule, quality, and complexity.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Software Engineering Institute (SEI) Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) was established in 1984 as an integral part of the Department of Defense’s (DoD’s) initiative to identify, evaluate, and transition software engineering technologies and practices.  The SEI maintains unique software research and program support capabilities in a space where the Defense Industrial Base and academia cannot as readily address challenges.  The mission of the SEI is to provide DoD with technical leadership and innovation through research and development to advance the practice of software engineering and technology.  The Institute works across Government, industry, and academia to improve the state of software engineering from the technical, acquisition, and management perspectives.  The SEI engages in research and development of critical software technologies and tools, and collaborates with the larger software engineering research community.  It facilitates rapid transition of software engineering technologies into practice, and evaluates emerging software engineering technologies to determine their potential for improving software-intensive DoD systems.  Since its inception, the SEI has helped to transform the fields of software engineering and acquisition, network security, real-time systems, software architectures, and software-engineering process management.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Shortcomings in software development often lead to schedule slippage, cost growth, and mission compromise.  These shortcomings can frequently be traced to software development technologies which are not capable of addressing the scale and complexity of the software needed in today’s systems.  The Software Producibility Initiative seeks to conduct an integrated program of research from applied research through demonstration and evaluation to advance the state-of-the-art in the producibility of software for DoD systems, particularly those systems characterized by high complexity, need for robustness, information assurance, real-time performance, and physical distribution.  The Initiative maintains a portfolio of work relevant to the Warfighter and DoD needs by periodically evaluating technology development efforts, retiring those that are under performing, and starting new efforts based on risk-reward priority.  The Initiative demonstrates new underlying software technology and tools in various domains, e.g., Networks, Modeling and Simulation, Avionics, Signals Intelligence, where DoD can benefit and enhance the transition paths for the underlying technology.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>The Quick Reaction Special Projects (QRSP) Program Element has been recast with a focus on producing risk-reducing prototypes designed to address priority Combatant Command (COCOM) threats.  QRSP efforts will support the Department’s goal to provide a hedge against technical uncertainty by leveraging insights gained through mission-focused efforts and by fostering collaboration among government laboratories, academia, and commercial research.  The QRSP portfolio will develop technology that anticipates adversaries’ capabilities through short-term, innovative science and engineering initiatives.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The QRSP Program Element develops risk-reducing prototypes and conducts demonstrations designed to address immediate COCOM needs.  QRSP efforts support the Department’s goal to provide a hedge against technical uncertainty by supporting the development of potentially game-changing capabilities and by fostering collaboration among other government agencies, DoD laboratories, academia, and the commercial sector.  QRSP enables the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (USD (AT&amp;L)) to respond to emergent DoD issues and time-sensitive threats by selecting projects within the year of execution.  These efforts field new capabilities at low cost in short time-frames, inform the requirements process, and inject innovative technologies into programs of record.  The QRSP Program supports four major project codes that expedite development and transition of new capabilities to the warfighter.  These projects are:  1) Quick Reaction Fund (QRF); 2) Rapid Reaction Fund (RRF); 3) Joint Rapid Acquisition Cell (JRAC) support; and 4) Strategic Multi-Layered Assessment (SMA) support.  Focus areas align to DoD science and technology priorities, including counter anti-access/area denial; counter weapons of mass destruction; low-cost precision engagement; counter-electronic warfare; and autonomous systems.

The QRF Program objectives are to develop prototypes in response to emergent conventional warfare needs that take advantage of breakthroughs in rapidly evolving technologies.  The QRF is executed by the Rapid Reaction Technology Office (RRTO).  Examples of the types of projects that are envisioned include:  force protection projects to enhance anti-access and area denial capabilities, undersea offensive capabilities, and broad electronic warfare capabilities.  The QRF initiates projects during the execution year and focuses on maturing technologies critically needed for the COCOMs.  QRF projects are typically 12 months in duration and produce prototypes for demonstration and evaluation.  The QRF consistently exceeds the transition objective of 40 percent for demonstration programs (DoD Strategic Objective 3.5.2D).
 
The RRF program objectives, executed by the RRTO, are to develop prototypes to counter emerging irregular warfare threats, anticipate adversaries’ exploitation of new technologies and accelerate the delivery of effective and affordable capabilities to the warfighter.  RRF initiatives support the DoD Research and Engineering Enterprise mission to develop, demonstrate, assess, and rapidly field innovative concepts and technologies that supply critical capabilities to meet time-sensitive operational needs.  RRTO leverages technology developed outside of the DoD in the commercial sector, academia, international arenas, as well as small businesses and non-traditional sources, to address DoD needs as identified by COCOM, Military Service organizations, other Defense organizations, and interagency partners.  Typical RRF programs are six to 18 months in duration and aim to mature a capability to demonstration.  The RRF consistently exceeds the transition objective of 40 percent for demonstration programs (DoD Strategic Objective 3.5.2D).       

The JRAC Program objectives focus on responding to Joint Urgent Operational Needs (JUONS) and Joint Emerging Operational Needs (JEONS) that have been submitted by COCOMs and validated by the Joint Staff.  In addition, the JRAC’s objectives are to manage the delivery of capabilities as requested by the COCOM in a time frame acceptable to the COCOM.  Efforts, in most instances, utilize contingency and other rapid acquisition authorities.

The SMA cell’s objective is to support all COCOMs, Joint Force Commanders, and other government agencies by assessing complex operational/technical challenges, which require multi-agency and multi-disciplinary approaches.  With input from across the United States Government, academia, and the private sector, the SMA cell develops solution options to Joint Staff/COCOM-generated challenging problems and informs senior leadership.  Each assessment is initiated at the request of COCOM senior leadership.  Priorities for SMA Cell programs are set by the Joint Staff Deputy for Operations.  Products are typically generated within six months and directly contribute to the decision-making process of the Joint Staff/COCOM’s senior leadership.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Quick Reaction Special Projects (QSRP) Program supports four separate projects that provide rapid funding to expedite development and transition of new prototypical technologies to the warfighter.  The QSRP Program provides the flexibility to mitigate emerging threats and addresses needs that arise outside the two-year budget cycle. 

The Quick Reaction Fund (QRF) Program provides the Services, components, Combatant Commands (COCOMs), and force providers opportunities to capitalize on technologies that are at a relatively high level of technical maturity and to rapidly field-test promising new proof of principle prototypes that can have immediate impact on military operations.  QRF initiatives are limited to those that will deliver a prototype application within 12 months of being funded.

The QRF Program focuses on projects that have the potential to address conventional, disruptive, catastrophic, and irregular threats.  More specifically, initiatives that serve to maintain a technical advantage over potential adversaries and reduce technical risk barriers in the following interest areas:  counter anti-access and area denial capabilities; base protection; electromagnetic bandwidth and spectrum enhancement; persistent intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; newly emerging national threats; directed energy capabilities; low-cost precision engagement capabilities; operational field demonstrations; unmanned and robotics systems; counter weapons of mass destruction capabilities; and counter-electronic warfare technologies.  

In FY 2015 and FY 2016, the QRF Program will continue to identify and fund new projects and prototypes that respond to critical operational needs and emerging threats.  Current and future efforts that show significant effectiveness can be leveraged by additional investments in order to accelerate transition to operational forces.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>The Department of Defense (DoD) has developed a Trusted Systems strategy that is based upon mission assurance, comprehensive protection planning, industry standards, and advancing the state of practice and DoD capability to identify and mitigate HW/SW vulnerabilities through techniques and tools, and creation of needed new HW/SW assurance technology.  This project provides research and development focus to advance capabilities that can be made available to current and future programs in acquisition, operational systems and legacy systems, and infrastructure.

This Quick Reaction Fund (QRF) effort directly supports the 2014 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) Section 937 and adds to current Department work implementing requirements in NDAA 2013 Section 933.  It provides funding for the Department’s capabilities to augment and federate existing HW/SW assurance expertise, capabilities and facilities within the Services and Agencies, to address existing gaps, as well as emerging threats and vulnerabilities.  The resulting federation will assess and prioritize critical mission vulnerabilities to malicious software, supply chain exploit, and related cyber vulnerabilities, prioritize the use of best practice in Hardware/Software (HW/SW) vulnerability assessment, tested tools, proven processes, then promulgate findings and know-how.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Quick Reaction Special Projects (QSRP) Program supports four separate projects that provide rapid funding to expedite development and transition of new prototypical technologies to the warfighter.  The QSRP Program provides the flexibility to mitigate emerging threats and addresses needs that arise outside the two-year budget cycle.  

The Rapid Reaction Fund (RRF) is fully executed through the Rapid Reaction Technology Office (RRTO).  RRTO was established to accelerate the development and transition of high-potential science and technology (S&amp;T) projects into operationally useful prototypes in the execution years.  The RRTO:  leverages the Department of Defense (DoD) S&amp;T base and those of the other federal departments, academia, and industry; stimulates interagency coordination and cooperation; accelerates the fielding of prototypical capabilities and concepts to counter emerging threats; and, provides feedback to the S&amp;T community to guide long term developmental strategies.  With projects supporting each Department/Combatant Command (COCOM) priorities with a global perspective, RRTO anticipates adversaries' exploitation of technology, including available and emerging commercial capabilities.  Prototypes delivered by RRTO provide cost effective capabilities to operational users faster than the typical acquisition cycle.

In prior years, RRTO has explored methods and approaches of persistent surveillance for counter-insurgency; developed alternate power sources for sensors and systems; provided low-cost capabilities for small-footprint operations; expanded human, social, and cultural knowledge; increased small unit situational awareness; advanced the interface between law enforcement and military operations; developed advanced biometrics and forensics capabilities; supported denied area operations; performed strategic multi-layer assessments; and, established an innovation outreach cell that facilitates better interactions with small companies developing emerging technologies that do not normally do business with the DoD.   

In FY 2016, RRTO will continue to explore new and emerging capabilities to support irregular warfare operations in support of the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology &amp; Logistics), the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering), and the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (Emerging Capability &amp; Prototyping) goals.  With project selection occurring during the execution year, the RRTO's potential focus areas for FY 2016 projects include:  capabilities to operate in denied areas; navigation in Global Positioning System-denied environments; persistent Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) architectures; ISR sensors; global warming’s impact on operations in the Arctic; novel power sources for unmanned vehicles; interface of law enforcement and military operations; commercial product vulnerabilities and applications; biometrics and forensics science and technology; autonomous operations; data processing, exploitation and dissemination; cyber security; exploitation of new and emerging cell phone technologies; counter-proliferation initiatives; strategic communications and multi-layer assessments; and, non-traditional approaches to leverage innovative businesses.   

The typical length of an RRTO project falls within a six to 18 month range in order to more effectively respond to the Warfighter.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>ISR sensors span a wide range of sensing modalities and generally produce very large data sets that are difficult to analyze in a cluttered environment.  Efforts in this area will develop better sensors and tools to more effectively analyze or visualize ISR data.  Projects include improved surveillance sensors, tools to facilitate analysis of large data sets, methods to harvest meaningful intelligence from open and classified sources, and establishment of more effective processing, exploitation, and dissemination capabilities to facilitate integration of new and existing systems.  Projects in this area generally involve high risk and have high potential reward; and, are not being addressed by other organizations.  Projects will also explore technologies to improve ISR in denied areas.  ISR projects will also evaluate methods of increasing the effectiveness of ISR architectures to maximize the capability delivered to the user and to reduce the amount of human analyst manpower required to produce actionable intelligence.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The SMA Cell conducted an effort starting in FY 2014 at the request of U.S. Pacific Command (USPACOM) to provide an analytical capability to identify areas of strategic risk and opportunity in the Asia-Pacific region over the next two decades.  Specifically, these analytical capabilities enabled USPACOM to examine future political, security, societal, and economic trends; identify where U.S. strategic interests are in cooperation or conflict with Asian and other interests worldwide, in particular, the East China Sea; and to leverage opportunities when dealing with Asian countries in a “global context.”</r2:Description>

Using a variety of methodologies and disciplinary approaches, the research teams for this project built a qualitative and quantitative framework for understanding the drivers of conflict and convergence in the Asia-Pacific region.  Project teams used content analysis, historical comparison, expert elicitation, and quantitative modeling to identify key variables that influence conflict and cooperation.  These analyses informed the development of a systems dynamic model and decision support tool.  The overall objective of the suite of projects contained in this effort was to inform USPACOM decision makers in the development of intermediate and long-term strategies to manage risk and engage opportunities in the Asia-Pacific region.  In addition to the insights provided by each project team, the projects also informed a systems dynamic model and decision support tool for COCOMs.  These assessments are intended to be combined with unclassified (e.g., academic, subject matter expert, open source, etc.) input not generally found in U.S. government work.</r2:Text>

They provide an increased understanding of potential future security environments and their implications for Palestinian security sector reform.  The SMA team will conduct a multi-disciplined review of USSC questions and provide to the USSC staff a series of insights and recommendations that will enable them to derive a rich contextual understanding of the socio-political, social-cultural, security, and economic dynamics of the region.  The cell will also continue to actively work with the COCOMs and the Joint Staff to identify challenging problems that are not within the traditional areas of DoD expertise.  These problems will be in direct support of the COCOMs and may include areas such as:  counter terrorism; transnational criminal organizations; counter weapons of mass destruction (state and non-state); counter global or regional social and cultural assessments; regional stability assessments; and, individual state or national level deterrence studies.</r2:Text>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Anti-access/Area-denial (A2/AD) threat requires detailed modeling and simulation based analysis to support weapon system and operational capability development.  This effort will focus on generating operational scenario and system analyses, identifying specific analytic limitations, developing the technical analysis plan, and implementing the plan.  These analyses will be acquisition-centered net analyses of the end-to-end blue (US and Allies) capabilities compared to specific red (potential adversary) capabilities focused on identifying the most promising technologies for application to A2/AD problems.  The analyses will address acquisition specific questions such as: can an existing system be leveraged and/or can a group of capabilities be combined in different ways to improve the overall effectiveness of US systems?  This office works closely with the Joint Staff, the Military Departments, Combatant Commands, and other Government entities.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This new Program Element (PE) was created to better align the following efforts previously funded in other PE’s: (1) the Modeling and Simulation Management Office project was transferred from PE 0603832D8Z; (2) the Systems Engineering Research Center (SERC), previously funded in PE 0605142D8Z; and (3) the Engineered Resilient Systems effort, previously funded in PE 0602251D8Z, Applied Research for the Advancement of S&amp;T Priorities.  These three activities have been re-aligned to this new PE, Engineering Science and Technology, in order to address Defense Research and Engineering priorities to advance engineering state of the practice, and address complex defense systems challenges through development of engineering capabilities to improve acquisition quality.  Engineering science and technology, including modeling and simulation (M&amp;S), systems engineering (SE) research, and engineering capabilities for resilience, supports the cost-effective acquisition of complex systems in support of the full range and scope of Department of Defense (DoD) missions and operations.

M&amp;S is a key enabler of DoD capabilities; underpins innovative solutions meeting real-world national security challenges; acts as a force multiplier; saves resources; and saves lives.  The DoD Modeling and Simulation Management Office (MSMO), designated by the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (USD(AT&amp;L)) to be the focal point and advocate for DoD M&amp;S, enhances the DoD M&amp;S Enterprise by (1) enabling cooperation and collaboration in identifying, developing and sustaining modeling and simulation solutions; and (2) promoting technology solutions, including common M&amp;S architectures, standards, and services that improve interoperability, reuse, and cost effectiveness of DoD M&amp;S.

SERC is a University Affiliated Research Center (UARC) established in 2008 as a strategic resource to further systems research and increase its impact on the Department’s ability to meet its mission.  Greatly improved SE methods, processes and tools are essential to the DoD strategy to field systems that are agile, affordably sustainable, flexible, and ready for a full range of contingencies in the face of declining budgets and a shrinking workforce.  The SERC consists of a network of 23 research universities from across the U.S. that work collaboratively to bring the best talent in the nation to bear on DoD’s systems engineering research problems.

Engineered Resilient Systems (ERS) addresses the need for achieving more affordable and mission-resilient warfighting systems designed within a shorter time frame by conducting research and development and new concepts for implementing an integrated suite of modern computational engineering tools, modeling capabilities, and tradespace assessment and visualization tools within an architecture aligned with acquisition and operational business processes.  These integrated tools will operate within a framework that supports data-driven decision-making in an innovative environment that enables advanced knowledge management and multi-community collaboration, including data retention and lessons learned.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Engineered Resilient Systems (ERS) addresses the need for achieving more affordable and mission-resilient warfighting systems designed within a shorter time frame.  ERS research and development focuses on new concepts for implementing an integrated suite of modern computational engineering tools, models, simulations and related capabilities, and tradespace assessment and visualization tools within an architecture aligned with acquisition and operational business processes.  These integrated tools will operate within a framework that supports data-driven decision-making in an innovative environment that provides advanced knowledge management, including data retention and lessons-learned, and enables multi-community collaboration.  ERS leverages multi-fidelity physics-based models developed by the S&amp;T community to inform the acquisition decision process (e.g., increased/easier utilization of High Performance Computing, web-based analysis with large data sets, and lifecycle cost sensitivity analysis).  These new computational and model-based frameworks adapt advanced design and modeling approaches from Government, industry, and academia to enable our Nation to affordably deliver warfighting capability.

This effort continues execution of the ERS efforts previously funded in PE 0602251D8Z, Applied Research for the Advancement of S&amp;T Priorities and builds upon earlier initial work for the purpose of achieving the goals set forth in the ERS DoD Community of Interest Roadmap.  It is also fully coordinated and aligned with the work in Army PE 0603734A, Military Engineering Advanced Technology (Project T08).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Test and Evaluation/Science and Technology (T&amp;E/S&amp;T) Program seeks out and develops test technologies to stay in pace with evolving weapons technologies.  This program is critical to ensure that the Department of Defense (DoD) has the ability to adequately test the advanced systems that will be fielded in the future.  To meet this objective, the T&amp;E/S&amp;T Program performs the following activities:
• Exploits new technologies and processes to meet important test and evaluation (T&amp;E) requirements.
• Expedites the transition of new technologies from the laboratory environment to the T&amp;E community.
• Leverages industry advances in equipment, modeling and simulation, and networking to support T&amp;E.
Additionally, the T&amp;E/S&amp;T Program examines emerging T&amp;E requirements resulting from Joint Service initiatives to identify T&amp;E technology needs and develop a long-range roadmap for technology insertion.  The program leverages and employs applicable applied research efforts from the highly developed technology base in DoD laboratories and test centers, other government agencies, industry, and academia to accelerate development of new test capabilities.  This program provides travel funds for T&amp;E/S&amp;T program oversight, special studies, analyses, and strategic planning related to test capabilities and infrastructure.
The T&amp;E/S&amp;T Program aligns with the S&amp;T Communities of Interest (COI) to prepare the T&amp;E community to test warfighting capabilities that emerge from priority S&amp;T investments.  The T&amp;E/S&amp;T Program is funded within the Advanced Technology Development Budget Activity because it develops and demonstrates high payoff technologies for current and future DoD test capabilities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>High-speed/hypersonic weapons are being developed to ensure the continued military superiority and strike capability of the United States including freedom of movement and freedom of action in areas protected by anti-access/area denial defenses.  Current weapon system demonstrations and technology development programs include high-speed and hypersonic air-breathing missiles, maneuvering reentry and boost-glide weapons, hypersonic gun-launched projectiles, and air-breathing space access vehicles.  These systems require development of conventional and high-speed turbine, ramjet, scramjet, and combined cycle engines; high temperature materials; thermal protection systems (TPS); and thermal management systems.  
  The High Speed Systems Test (HSST) project addresses test technology needs including propulsion, aerodynamic and aerothermal testing, so the test community has the technology to support the required test scenarios for concepts under development in the science and technology (S&amp;T) community.  The technology developments within the HSST project align with the Department of Defense (DoD) S&amp;T priority investments.  As such, the HSST project is developing, validating and transitioning advanced test and evaluation (T&amp;E) technologies for ground test, open-air range flight test, and advanced computational tools, along with instrumentation and diagnostics systems for use in both ground tests and flight tests of high speed systems.
  The HSST project develops technologies to enable robust, accurate, and timely T&amp;E of these future weapon systems.  DoD acquisition regulations require weapon systems to undergo a thorough T&amp;E process to detect deficiencies early and to ensure system suitability and survivability.  However, the extreme environments in which these weapons operate preclude accurate determination of their performance and operability with today’s T&amp;E assets.  Current national test capabilities have deficiencies in data accuracy, flight condition replication and simulation, test methods, productivity, modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) fidelity, and range safety.
  The HSST mission is to address these national test capability gaps by providing test technology solutions that will enable high-speed and hypersonic weapon systems to be successfully developed through accurate, robust, and efficient T&amp;E.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:Text>The HSST project continued to advance ground and flight test technologies, techniques, instrumentation and modeling and simulation capabilities required for the development of high speed air-breathing propulsion and boost-glide weapons.

  In FY 2014, progress was made toward addressing the two most significant technology shortfalls in current hypersonic aero propulsion ground test capabilities: clean air heat addition (i.e. non-vitiated air) and variable Mach number test capability.  Current production ground test facilities create the high temperature propulsion system inlet conditions necessary for air-breathing scramjet engine testing by burning fuel in the facility airflow supplied to the engine inlet for operation.  As demonstrated by an HSST FY 2011 test, the resulting vitiated air has different gas properties than clean air found in the atmosphere and thus is not representative of what the vehicle would experience during flight.  This significantly affects the engine’s performance and operability in the test environment resulting in erroneous flight performance predictions.  Variable Mach number capability is required to “fly the mission” and determine the critical transient operability effects throughout the flight envelope.  Incorporation of component technologies, previously developed by the T&amp;E/S&amp;T program, were initiated into a small-scale, clean air, true temperature, variable Mach number 4.5-7.5 aero propulsion test facility, called the Hypersonic Aeropropulsion Clean Air Testbed (HAPCAT).  Completion of this facility will demonstrate that component technologies have reached Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6, provide an on-going test asset to the DoD, and reduce risk for construction of a full-scale facility.  Significant progress was made this year in Phase I of the facility development including design enhancements and fabrication of the combustion cooler, installation, checkout and activation of the clean air regenerative storage heater, associated support systems, instrumentation and controls required for facility operation. The exhaust air ejector system was activated to provide longer facility run times. Design efforts for subsequent phases progressed including the critical design of the air delivery system. Another FY 2014 effort examined the incorporation of advanced morphing ceramic components for hypersonic ground test facilities into the design of common facility nozzle and ducting hardware to achieve a variable Mach number capability and variable inlet distortion patterns representative of flight-like inlet systems.  Critical design of the morphing ceramic components direct-connect nozzle and distortion generator components and integrated system was completed. Fabrication of the direct-connect component fabrication was started and freejet nozzle design concepts were evaluated. This technology promises to provide a significant advantage over current rigid, stationary facility hardware by providing a “first-ever” realistic variable Mach flight distortion simulation test capability, while reducing costs and increasing productivity.
  Large scale scramjet engine test techniques accomplishments included continued progress in determining the capability of existing ground test facilities and methodologies to evaluate and develop large-scale hypersonic propulsion systems.  Following the successful completion of the benchmark HSST freejet test series utilizing an advanced hydrocarbon fueled missile scale scramjet in a larger facility, the semi-freejet test configuration testing was initiated in a smaller facility. Upon completion of the final direct connect phase of the project, the resulting analysis comparing tests between the larger and smaller facilities will allow the optimized utilization of existing facilities and define the size and type of investments needed for future large-scale scramjet vehicle development and reduction of flight test and acquisition risks.  Another task, that researched improved high speed test techniques, examined the unique and extensive set of ground and flight test data collected by the X-51 program for use in the development of advanced techniques for high speed engine design, development and testing. This effort documented the test techniques used and analyzed how the test data was utilized in the engine development process so that lessons learned and important test technology gaps could be identified. The work resulted in completion of the first ever in-flight mass capture and thrust uncertainty assessment conforming to the U.S. National Uncertainty Standard. 
  An arc heater flow quality aerothermal test technology development made significant progress toward independently-powered spin-coil technologies to control the physical characteristics of the spinning arc column, and its attachment location and duration on electrode surfaces.  This effort will improve the service lives of the electrodes and improve hypersonic nozzle flow quality.  The conceptual design of the spin coil was completed, and spin coil power supply requirements were specified. Improved computational and numerical simulation models were completed involving magnetic field and arc column interactions with the air flow in the heater necessary to investigate advanced designs and allow for efficient parallel computing of the simulations.  The HSST project initiated research that will provide better determination of surface heating, viscous drag, and boundary layer growth and transition effects upon hypersonic vehicle performance.  Experimental results will be used to validate state of the art prediction tools and measurements of boundary layer transition (BLT) mechanisms. Design and fabrication of hypersonic vehicle models were completed for the BLT efforts.
  An autonomous flight safety system test technology developed by HSST to assure destruction of an errant hypersonic vehicle under test was transitioned to the Operationally Responsive Space (ORS) Office. The first prototype successfully flew onboard the ORS-3/Minotaur I rocket.  Compared to traditional man-in-the-loop systems, autonomous flight safety system provides wider flight corridors, over the horizon flight coverage, reduced infrastructure, remote launch site capability, and improved mission assurance; thereby maximizing safety while reducing flight test costs.  Another HSST flight test technology transitioned, demonstrating advanced parameter identification maneuvers during the fourth X-51 flight.  Post-test analysis confirmed that this proven optimization technique enables the acquisition of much more vehicle aero performance data in less time and fewer flights than traditional techniques, thus reducing the costs for future development systems.  Progress continued toward the development of a ground based, portable high altitude light detection and ranging (LIDAR) atmospheric sensing system to measure atmospheric conditions (density, temperature, pressure, wind speed/direction, O2 content) along a hypersonic vehicle’s flight path.  Design, fabrication, and implementation of all components into a portable system were completed.  Calibration, system validation testing, and a full demonstration in support of the Advanced Hypersonic Weapon flight test were accomplished. This technology will be a significant advancement over current technologies, improving the accuracy of determining atmospheric conditions at high altitudes needed for assessing the performance and operability of air-breathing missiles and boost-glide vehicles during development.
  Progress was made in advanced high speed system ground and flight test instrumentation.  A prototype real gas force measurement balance system with high stiffness and frequency response to make measurements in hypervelocity flows with test times of 1-2 milliseconds was developed. The balance system was calibrated and a rigorous uncertainty analysis was performed.  This will substantially increase the accuracy of high Mach force measurements that are required to evaluate and improve models of air chemistry in design and prediction codes. Development of an advanced system to measure gas properties in high speed flows was completed utilizing lasers operating in the mid-infrared spectrum along with advanced transmit and receive optical fiber systems.  Two of the non-intrusive flow measurements developments for hypersonic test facilities systems, which significantly lower gas property measurement uncertainty, were fabricated and transitioned to DoD facilities.  The calibration and measurement uncertainty analysis of the HSST-developed non-intrusive laser hygrometer system was completed.  A high temperature shear stress sensor was successfully tested in a DoD hypervelocity wind tunnel and on a scramjet engine forebody inlet ramp.  A mid-infrared thermal imaging technique effort was initiated.  This technique will permit quantitative thermal imaging of hypersonic model surface flow for high enthalpies without capturing flow field emissivity effects that can shroud surface temperature imaging.  
  Advances were achieved in the development of state-of-the-art modeling and simulation tools.  Beta testing by a broad spectrum of the hypersonic community continues for an advanced three-dimensional stability and transition analysis for hypersonic boundary layer code and hypersonic nozzle characteristics based grid generation code.  The code was used to support the design of a DoD hypersonic wind tunnel nozzle and a Graphical User Interface (GUI) was developed. The code was also used for development of the HSST variable Mach number nozzle and distortion generator. The advanced code was used during a hypervelocity test at Arnold Engineering Development Center (AEDC) to analyze and predict the characteristics and extent of boundary layer transition on the test article surface resulting from variations in nose bluntness, unit Reynolds number, and angle of attack. An improved Computed Tomography Method (CTM) algorithm capable of constructing more complex flow field patterns for optical absorption measurements was developed.  The algorithm creates two-dimensional spatial maps of exhaust gas properties from multi-line-of-sight tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy measurements for verifying code predictions and for determining combustion efficiency for turbine and scramjet engines.  This development takes advantage of increased processing speed, higher accuracy and increased computational efficiency to greatly increase the diagnostic value of measurements from miniature, robust tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy gas diagnostic sensor systems, which are now used for engine ground and flight testing. A project was initiated to develop a transient thermal analysis software toolset to support T&amp;E of hypersonic vehicle Thermal Protection System (TPS) aerothermal and ablation response to high speed, high temperature flow in ground and flight test environments. A real-gas model capability was incorporated into the software flow field solver.  The vitiation effects computational fluid dynamics study was completed. The study determined the ability of the Wind-US 3.0 computational fluid dynamics code to aid in the developmental test and evaluation of complex high speed/hypersonic propulsion systems and facilities utilizing existing HSST scramjet engine test data sets.</r2:Text>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Weapon systems have become increasingly complex in recent years, resulting in the need for significantly more data to be passed among these systems, and between the systems and our test infrastructure.  A vast amount of data must be collected, transmitted, and analyzed, which requires a large amount of radio frequency (RF) spectrum resources.  However, the amount of RF spectrum designated to support test and evaluation (T&amp;E) is decreasing, most notably due to reallocation of spectrum for commercial use.  The combination of decreasing RF spectrum and increasing data requirements results in an urgent need to develop test technologies that maximize the use of spectrum resources for Department of Defense (DoD) T&amp;E operations.
  The L and S frequency bands are the traditional spectrum allotted for military T&amp;E use.  The explosive need for spectrum in the commercial sector has resulted in reallocation of portions of these bands to industry.  To compensate, DoD is now authorized to use the C-Band spectrum which offers numerous benefits, including a three-fold increase in available bandwidth, but C-Band comes with technical challenges.  Most notably, our current test infrastructure for telemetry is not designed to accommodate C-Band.  Technologies are required to implement innovative techniques that efficiently facilitate our use of C-Band without a major overhaul to our national test infrastructure.  For instance, commercial telemetry transmitters operate in C-Band but do not have the form factor (size and weight) or rugged packaging to survive airborne test applications.
  Traditional telemetry applications employ streaming telemetry where data is moved one-way from the instrumented system under test to our test infrastructure.  Modern network based telemetry capabilities, like those being developed by the Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program (CTEIP) integrated Network Enhanced Telemetry (iNET) effort, enable more robust, efficient bidirectional transfer of data.  DoD’s strategy is to create technologies for streaming telemetry capability in C-Band, opening up legacy L- and S-Bands for networked telemetry, and researching the feasibility of using higher frequency bands to augment telemetry operations.
  The Spectrum Efficient Technology (SET) project is developing test technologies that enable more efficient use of legacy telemetry bands and expansion into non-traditional areas of the RF and optical spectra at DoD test ranges.  The technology development efforts within the SET project have been prioritized to align with Department of Defense guidance on science and technology priority investments. As such, the SET project is focusing on growing data requirements of warfighting systems and the limited availability of spectrum for testing.  The SET project is structured to develop test technologies to advance range communications, networked telemetry capabilities, and enhanced management of spectrum at DoD test ranges.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:Text>The SET project developed technologies to meet networked telemetry requirements and performed risk reduction for CTEIP telemetry improvement projects. A networked data recorder was developed to provide risk reduction in support of the CTEIP iNET development and subsequently tested in the CTEIP iNET Integration Laboratory.  Technology enabling the dynamic reconfiguration of transmitted test data over a telemetry network was further matured.  Technology to improve the efficiency of a telemetry network utilizing the advanced Shaped Offset Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (SOQPSK) modulation scheme continued.  Development of a multi-band transceiver operating in the L/S/C-Band spectrum employing multiple advanced waveforms continued.  SET continued an effort to autonomously analyze collected telemetry data and based on priority, select which data to transmit over the telemetry network.  Additionally, SET matured several efforts to improve the performance of telemetry data links.  SET continued efforts to improve the performance of a serial streaming telemetry link in a multipath environment by developing a sync marker for the telemetry data.  This technology will enable analysis of the data in the event of a data dropout and permit filling in of gaps in transmitted data.  Development of a telemetry transceiver capable of dynamically reconfiguring the data modulation scheme based on telemetry link conditions continued.  
  Development of a non-blocking Ethernet switch for airborne platforms was completed, demonstrated, and transitioned to support the deployment of a networked telemetry system. This technology will serve as the network backbone which will tie all onboard instrumentation together with the onboard test data transmitter.
  The SET project investigated techniques to expand telemetry operations into non-traditional spectrum bands by characterizing multipath effects in a range of terrestrial and atmospheric environments. A technical investigation into the telemetry link performance of the C-Band versus S-Band spectrum for a missile test mission was completed and the performance results transitioned to the test ranges.  The C-Band telemetry antenna technology developed under this effort was initially transitioned to Naval Air Warfare Center – Weapons Division, China Lake; however, the technology is extensible, enabling its widespread use across the Major Range and Test Facility Base.  SET continued efforts to develop airborne phased array antenna technology to enable flexible scheduling of the T&amp;E spectrum by incorporating both the traditional L/S bands and recently permitted C-Band frequencies.  Some of these technologies will reduce the technical risk associated with beam steering in the C-Band frequencies, reduce the amount of infrastructure modifications needed to implement a C-Band telemetry capability, and provide over-the-horizon data connectivity to test large-footprint weapons, such as long range missiles.
  The SET project completed the development of a three dimensional channel model tool for modeling and simulation of telemetry channels in various environments.  This tool provides higher fidelity simulations for use in researching the effects of terrain, environments, and various other factors on telemetry channels.  This tool was transitioned to the Edwards Air Force Flight Test Center to support pretest analysis of mission flight profiles.  
  The SET project initiated an effort to develop digital beam forming and steering technologies for an airborne phased array antenna. This technology will significantly reduce the system complexity for an airborne phased array antenna, providing savings in terms of size, weight, power consumption, and airframe modifications on the test platform.  Additionally, SET initiated several technical investigations to expand telemetry operations into non-traditional spectrum bands.  SET initiated an effort to investigate the use of the higher frequency Ka-Band and Ku-Band for telemetry links.  This investigation will determine the performance characteristics of the bands and determine the ideal operating frequencies for telemetry purposes.  Additionally, SET initiated a technical investigation to explore the use of directional optical links for telemetry purposes.</r2:Text>

Development of a telemetry transceiver capable of dynamically reconfiguring the data modulation scheme based on telemetry link conditions will continue.  
  Phased array antenna technology utilizing the L/S/C-Band frequencies will continue to be matured to enable flexible spectrum scheduling and alleviate technical risk associated with tracking and beam steering in the C-Band. An effort to develop digital beam forming and steering technologies for an airborne phased array antenna will be completed, tested, and transitioned to the CTEIP program to support the development of an over-the-horizon telemetry capability. Additionally, SET will initiate efforts to develop phased array technology for use on the ground as well as in airborne applications.  The high directionality of phased array antenna technologies will enable spectrum spatial reuse techniques for more effective spectrum scheduling.  The SET project will initiate efforts to develop an airborne multiband transceiver to support networked telemetry, increase spectrum scheduling efficiency, improve efficiency in ground telemetry and antenna systems, and support data transmission in L/S/C-bands. 
  Several technical investigations to expand telemetry operations into non-traditional spectrum bands will be completed and the results provided to the test ranges.  The technical investigation into the use of the higher frequency Ka/Ku-Bands for telemetry operations will be completed, providing analysis and recommendations on ideal operating frequencies within those spectrum bands. The technical investigation into the use of optical links to support telemetry operations will be completed. 
  SET will initiate efforts to develop schemes to manage and provide access to telemetry links that are comprised of both contiguous and non-contiguous blocks of spectrum in the upper C-band.  This portion of spectrum allocated for T&amp;E is highly non-contiguous due to sharing with satellite and television uplinks in the spectrum band.  SET will initiate an effort to develop spectrum management tools to optimize use of the available RF spectrum bands.</r2:Text>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>In order to establish dominance in the modern battlespace, our offensive and defensive electronic warfare systems must be capable against advanced radio frequency (RF) directed threats and electro-optic (EO) guided threats, which include infrared (IR) guidance.  Ensured dominance in these areas requires more robust test and evaluation (T&amp;E) with technologies that are rapidly adaptable to changing threats. 
  Readily available, IR seeking, man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS) are difficult to detect and pose an imminent and lethal threat to military aircraft of all types.  Our ability to counter such threats is essential to owning the battlespace in theater.  Therefore, the ability to test missile warning systems (MWS), hostile fire indicators, IR countermeasures (IRCM), and advanced threat sensors is critical to our national defense. Additionally, a new generation of enemy RF missile seekers is both currently fielded and in further development, requiring a correspondingly new generation of test technologies to test the latest countermeasures.  The T&amp;E community is required to test IRCM and RF countermeasure systems in a repeatable manner with ground-truth data before and after integration into warfighting systems.  Without new test technologies, the Department of Defense (DoD) will be unable to perform adequate T&amp;E of advanced warning and countermeasure systems.
  The technology development efforts within the Electronic Warfare Test (EWT) project have been prioritized to align with DoD guidance on science and technology priority investments.  As such, the EWT project is focusing on the test needs in both the EO, including IR, and the RF threat domains.  Additionally, development of core test technologies in this area can be leveraged to meet other EO and RF test requirements, such as in fire control systems; intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) sensors, and weapon seekers.
  The EWT project develops test technologies to stimulate IRCM and RF system sensors through the high-fidelity simulation of scenes viewed by the sensors.  Stimulation can be as simple as testing to see if a system under test responds to an image or as complex as simulating complex battle space phenomena to measure the response of a system under test in a more relevant, cluttered scenario.  Simulations and stimulations are used at open air ranges and in installed system test facilities (ISTF), and in hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) test beds.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

EWT completed the final optics assembly for a laser based mid-wave IR (MWIR) two–color simulator source. The EWT project continued development of a hyperspectral imaging projector, which will allow characterization and testing of hyperspectral imaging cameras used for ISR.
  The EWT project continued an effort to develop a breadboard technology to produce high-fidelity electronic counter-countermeasures (ECCM) radar signal processing techniques that employ sophisticated waveforms with algorithms, such as adaptive filtering.  This test technology development addresses a need, which is identified by the CTEIP-sponsored Tri-Service Electronic Warfare Test Capabilities Study.  The technology will improve testing against modern surface-to-air missile threats. Moreover, EWT continued efforts to develop a surrogate missile technology for testing of missile warning sensors.</r2:Text>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Advanced Instrumentation Systems Technology (AIST) project addresses the test technology gaps resulting from emerging weapon systems that need to be tested at Department of Defense (DoD) open air ranges, undersea ranges, installed systems test facilities, hardware-in-the-loop laboratories, and measurement test facilities.  Instrumentation requirements for systems under test are increasing exponentially for new weapons systems.  Vehicle-borne and warfighter-wearable instrumentation packages are required.  This instrumentation is for sensing and collecting critical performance data; determining accurate time, space, position information (TSPI)and attitude information; interfacing with command and control data links; monitoring and reporting system-wide communications; recording human operator physical and cognitive performance; and storing and transmitting data.
  The technology development efforts within the AIST project have been prioritized to align with DoD guidance on science and technology (S&amp;T) priority investments, particularly in support of human systems, engineered resilient systems, and countering weapons of mass destruction.  The AIST project is focused on supporting technology developments for advanced TSPI instrumentation (especially with limited or no availability of the Global Positioning System (GPS)), advanced sensors, advanced energy and power systems for instrumentation, non-intrusive instrumentation, mitigating range encroachment issues, and measuring warfighter physical and cognitive performance.  
  The AIST project addresses requirements for miniaturized, non-intrusive instrumentation suites with increased survivability in harsh environments.  Such instrumentation is an urgent need because minimal space is available to add instrumentation to new or existing weapon systems subsequent to their development; furthermore, additional weight and power draw for instrumentation can adversely affect weapon system signature and performance.  Instrumentation for humans-in-the-loop, such as dismounted warfighters, must not adversely affect performance, induce artificiality in the test environment, nor create operational burden.  New technologies can be exploited to integrate small, non-intrusive instrumentation into emerging platforms during design and development, and, in some cases, into existing platforms.  This class of instrumentation will provide critical system performance data during test and continuous assessment throughout a system’s lifecycle.  Technology developed under AIST can also benefit training and combat missions by enabling a continual feedback loop between the developer, training staff, operators and commanders.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:Text>The warfighter must conduct military operations in diverse environments to include urban, mountainous, and densely forested locations.  Consequently, a continued major thrust for FY 2014 included the development of test technologies to support collection of TSPI for warfighter systems (manned or unmanned), particularly in GPS-denied or degraded environments, such as in urban canyons and tunnels.  Efforts to test systems that operate in a GPS-denied environment included technology that employs a layered system of sensors leveraging collaborative navigation, existing radio frequency (RF) ranging technology, and a Doppler velocimeter to achieve more precise TSPI under GPS-impaired conditions.  Development has been completed and a user demonstration conducted at an urban training site, achieving sub-meter accuracy (~0.6 meter), both indoor and outdoor. 
  An inertial tracking system for dismounted warfighters continued in development; the system employs boot-mounted sensors to provide sub-meter geolocation over GPS-denied durations of greater than 2 hours.  A re-design of the distance measuring radios was completed; algorithms were implemented; and the ability to geolocate a dismounted warfighter conducting activities over two hours of free movement in the absence of GPS was demonstrated.  
  Efforts continued to develop technology to measure projectile position and attitude (six degrees of freedom) of high-velocity, spinning projectiles (at accuracies that significantly exceed the system under test guidance system).  This technology will provide continuous estimation of the state description of a projectile (three components of position and orientation) through the duration of projectile flight via accurate and rapid RF range observations between the projectile and ground-based components.  Successful shock and spin testing have been completed; synchronization and scheduling are being optimized.  The AIST project continued to develop a system to measure warfighter indoor location (GPS-denied environment) at sub-meter accuracies using ambient amplitude modulation (AM) radio broadcast signals.  AM signal propagation during day and night was evaluated at an urban training range; data was collected at a variety of urban range structures noting centimeter accuracy within a prison structure.  Efforts continued to develop technology that provides a seamless transition between outdoor and indoor environments to accurately track systems under test using modified GPS receivers, relayed GPS signals, and multilateration; this included work on reducing multipath effects.  Results to date indicate that other filters and other sensors e.g., an inertial measurement unit (IMU) integrated into the system can potentially provide an overall TSPI solution with sub-meter accuracies. 
  In support of other instrumentation solutions, an electro-releasable attachment technology development effort continued.  This included investigation of new adhesive formulations that employ an electrically releasing foil patch to allow attachment of sensors to non-conductive, painted surfaces of aircraft and other combat vehicles.  Such technology would significantly reduce the time to restore the system under test to its operational configuration.  Development of the foil patch focused on improving operating temperature range and adhesion strength in preparation for environmental testing (e.g., resistance to lightning strike) and end-to-end field testing at air and ground test activities.  
  The AIST project continued development of a fiber-optic instrumentation suite to integrate into test projectiles for measurement of magnetic field strength in the harsh environment of the Navy electromagnetic railgun (EMRG). Full-up testing with three EMRG shots at the Naval Surface Warfare Center-Dahlgren Division was conducted, achieving a significant benchmark by successfully measuring, for the first time, magnetic field strengths in an EMRG-launched projectile at 15-20 kG forces.  Additional tests are planned at higher energy levels. 
  The AIST project developed algorithms and methods for automated detection and classification of marine mammal vocalizations from ocean floor range sensors (e.g., hydrophones) to allow the Navy to conduct critical test and evaluation (T&amp;E) events without adversely impacting marine mammal populations. Testing has been successfully conducted at undersea ranges and a baseline classifier for 6 marine mammal species is currently running real-time, range-wide at the Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center, Pacific Range Missile Facility, and the Southern California Offshore Range.  This test technology supports the Navy’s Integrated Comprehensive Monitoring Program (ICMP) ensuring adherence to the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA). Additional classifiers have been developed or improved and will be integrated into marine mammal monitoring nodes and transitioned to the Navy’s major undersea ranges.
  To support the needs of test ranges that conduct arena testing for weapon systems, AIST continued developing technology that uses passive imaging to characterize munition warhead fragment size, velocity, and distribution.  This technology will significantly reduce set-up times and data analysis costs of current warhead arena test techniques.  
  The AIST project continued to develop technology that accurately provides dynamic measurements of warfighter body posture, and head and weapon orientation using fiber optic shape sensing integrated into a body suit to be worn under the uniform Shape accuracies for component and system measurements were over 99 percent accurate in laboratory testing; angle accuracies were well within 1 degree of the truth.  A single channel breadboard system was demonstrated, displaying real-time dynamic shape data on a human test subject, producing similar accuracy results observed in laboratory settings.  
  Development of technology to assess warfighter cognitive states continued.  Accomplishments included developing an integrated dry electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional near infrared (fNIR) sensor system capable of simultaneous measurement of brain electrical activity and blood oxygen level; an unobtrusive headset for test subjects; mental workload assessment software; and verification of system functionality.
  An effort continued to investigate means to mitigate the impacts of wind energy system interference on test range radars.  AIST evaluated four mitigation approaches to minimize the effects of wind turbines with the goal of reducing their effects by 60-70dB; a combination of the top three mitigation approaches is estimated to provide approximately 63dB performance improvement of T&amp;E range radars in the presence of wind turbine interference.  Efforts continued to assess and leverage microsystems technology under development at universities, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), and government laboratories.  These efforts will provide significant advances to T&amp;E of modern war fighting systems.</r2:Text>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Department of Defense (DoD) is exploring the military utility, safety, and suitability of directed energy weapons.  A robust test capability to assess directed energy weapons is essential to understanding their effectiveness and limitations, including determining their effectiveness in performing counter improvised explosive device (C-IED) operations.  Such assessments will depend upon knowledge acquired through the test and evaluation (T&amp;E) of directed energy technologies and testing of operational concepts.  Directed energy weapon technologies, primarily consisting of high energy lasers (HEL) and high powered microwaves (HPM), are outpacing available test capabilities.  Traditional test techniques for evaluating conventional munitions (with flight times ranging from seconds to minutes) are not sufficient for the T&amp;E of directed energy weapons that place energy on target instantaneously.  Consequently, new test technology solutions are needed to ensure that adequate developmental, live-fire, and operational test capabilities are available when directed energy programs are ready to test.
  Directed energy system and component testing requires three principal assessments:  (1) energy or power on target; (2) the effects on the target; and (3) the propagation of the directed energy to the target through the atmosphere.  In addition, the vulnerabilities of DoD systems to directed energy threats are required to be characterized, such as those requirements captured in Military Standard (MIL-STD)-464C.  Equally as important, current test capabilities do not provide the detailed data required to understand U.S. directed energy system performance and effects.
  The technology development efforts within the Directed Energy Test (DET) project have been prioritized to align with DoD guidance on science and technology priority investments.  As such, the DET project is developing the technologies necessary for quantitative assessment of United States (U.S.) HEL and HPM performance, as well as the vulnerability of DoD weapon systems to enemy directed energy threats.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:Text>The DET project completed development of target board sensors to assess HEL energy on large targets.  Similar work on HEL energy sensors for small targets such as mortars and rockets continued under two parallel efforts, with preliminary design completed.  The system components were shocked tested.
  The DET project completed two efforts to develop an HEL test planning tool providing a probabilistic based glint hazard analysis tool for assessing risks to personnel, aircraft, and sensors. 
  Fabrication continued on a prototype adaptive optics system designed to be readily adaptable to telescopes at DoD test facilities.  The test technology will allow improved imaging of an HEL spot on a remote target.  Regarding HEL atmospheric propagation, development of a light detection and ranging system (LIDAR) to measure atmospheric profiles along a slant path adjacent to the HEL beam propagation path continued.  The laboratory demonstration and testing of the sub-systems completed. This technology simultaneously measured profiles for three parameters: optical turbulence, water vapor content, and aerosol attenuation.  Measuring these profiles will enable understanding of how atmospheric effects distort HEL beam propagation.  A maritime version of this technology continued with completion of a preliminary design review.
  Testing of electric and magnetic field sensors continued in support of electromagnetic railgun (EMRG) T&amp;E with development of new techniques to reduce noise on these measurements; these techniques increased the quality of data obtained to benchmark railgun development codes.  DET developed a prototype miniature differential current measurement system that measures the current at nodes in a target circuit, allowing analysis of HPM effects at sub-component level. DET also developed a proof-of-concept voltage probe with bandwidths up to 100 MHz, allowing non-intrusive voltage measurements in HPM engagements.  These probes are also useful for C-IED applications. 
  The DET project completed design of an advanced radome that will allow more reliable operation of the White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) HPM Wide Band Threat Source over all 5 bands of operation, enabling more robust, cost effective testing of U.S. systems against HPM threats. Development of a compact hard tube vircator (CHTV) to cover two frequency bands of interest continued.  The CHTV development will result in an HPM source for testing in-chamber HPM effects, which at certain frequencies, is a gap in current MIL-STD-464C testing.
  The DET project initiated a study of options for technology replacement of the WSMR fast burst reactor for sources that simulate nuclear weapon prompt radiation output (neutron radiation) for survivability testing of U.S. systems.  The driver of this effort is a more cost effective means of creating neutron radiation.</r2:Text>

DET will continue efforts to characterize beam propagation through the atmosphere including those in the maritime environment to support emerging needs of the Navy. 
  Initiatives to achieve very small, non-intrusive current and voltage sensors to measure HPM effects inside a target will be continued.  These technologies will be transitioned to at least two locations to demonstrate the flexibility of these approaches.  A small, minimally intrusive data acquisition device with a wide bandwidth to complement that of the non-intrusive electric and magnetic field sensors will be completed.
  An effort to develop an HPM source for use in a chamber to address survivability of munitions in an HPM environment will be continued.
  The new study investigating technologically viable, more cost effective alternatives to provide the neutron radiation required for nuclear survivability testing will be continued.</r2:Text>

This includes efforts to characterize the performance of HEL systems as they test against small targets such as rockets, missiles, artillery, and unmanned aerial vehicles.
  In the HPM area, measuring the actual cause of HPM effects on electronics will be addressed by measurement of electrical currents within the wires and chips of the electronic targets. DET will also look at new technologies to further address gaps in the availability of sources for MIL-STD-464C testing.</r2:Text>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Net-Centric Systems Test (NST) project is pursuing test technologies to emulate multi-Service, Joint, and coalition net-centric operations in a system of systems test and evaluation (T&amp;E) environment.  Additionally, the NST project develops technologies to analyze and evaluate the increasingly massive amounts of structured and unstructured data generated by complex net-centric tests.  The technology to conduct T&amp;E on net-centric systems is challenged by sensor platforms, command and control systems and weapon platforms that support the kill chain in a Joint operation.  These systems must be evaluated for their ability to provide an accurate, timely transfer of data (e.g., target tracks, weapons allocation, mission tasking and situational awareness) as the data passes among different systems of Service and coalition participants.  
  The NST technologies advance test automation (test planning, test execution, test control, and analysis) that enable the virtual integration of Department of Defense (DoD) weapon laboratories and open air ranges.  Using models and simulations along with hardware-in-the-loop laboratories, the effectiveness of Joint missions can be assessed in terms of system-of-systems interoperability and effectiveness in executing Joint mission operations, including testing of weapons and command and control systems accessing and providing information to the Global Information Grid. Furthermore, many of the warfighting capabilities being developed to support net-centric military operations are software-intensive and test technologies must be developed to fully characterize these systems. 
  Also included are technologies to support the testing and agile environment associated with Engineering Resilience Systems, a high-priority S&amp;T area for the Department. The technology development efforts within the NST project have been prioritized to align with DoD guidance on science and technology (S&amp;T) priority investments, particularly in measuring “Data to Decision” techniques in warfighting capabilities.  Ultimately, the NST portfolio enables the T&amp;E community to “test like we fight” by replicating net-enabled, Joint mission operations within a T&amp;E environment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The resulting technologies will support DoD remote authentication T&amp;E needs and next generation multi-level security T&amp;E capabilities.  Additionally, the NST project developed technologies to support the measurement and analysis of the net-centric test environment including technologies that support enterprise level test execution assessment and control. The NST project developed an architecture-driven mission effectiveness planning and visualization technology to support Design of Experiments-based end-to-end assessments. Moreover, NST developed an effectiveness measures framework that includes new TENA object model definitions that enable automated T&amp;E planning and a real-time analysis tool.  Development of a distributed policy-based access control capability for the TENA middleware completed.  This technology showcased end user authentication, enforcement of the defined access control policy prior to joining the TENA execution, and the automatic distribution of the required certificates, keys, and login tokens. The NST project began development of technologies that apply automated analysis of large net-centric systems data sets using cloud computing technologies. 
  Development began on technologies that will provide an acoustic propagation model to provide sufficient fidelity to test torpedo performance operating in a range dependent propagation environment.  This technology will provide a real-time simulation/emulation system for testing torpedo sonar systems in multiple bathometry, biological and threat environments.</r2:Text>

Technology developments will focus on semantic analysis of large data sets, including structured and unstructured data sets. These technology developments will include the ability to process unstructured test data into a structured format for use by data-to-decision algorithms.
  The NST project will develop technologies that mitigate data biases introduced by the test infrastructure.  Multi-Level Security (MLS) and Cross Domain Solution (CDS) technologies will be investigated with the goals of improving the automation of preparing test data for analysis as well as facilitating automated sharing of information across all security enclaves.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Unmanned and Autonomous Systems (UAS) support every domain of warfare.  They operate in space, in air, on land, on the sea surface, undersea and in subterranean conditions to support a vast variety of missions.  The emergence of unmanned systems brings a host of revolutionary capabilities that will profoundly influence warfare.  The Unmanned and Autonomous Systems Test (UAST) project addresses current and emerging challenges associated with the test and evaluation (T&amp;E) of these critical warfighting capabilities.  The technology developments within the UAST portfolio have been prioritized to align with Department of Defense (DoD) guidance on science and technology priority investments, particularly in assessing autonomy.  As such, the UAST project is developing test technologies to simulate, stimulate, instrument, measure, and assess autonomous systems’ ability to perceive its environment, process information, adapt to dynamic conditions, make decisions, and effectively act on those decisions in the context of mission execution.
  The UAST project will provide the test technologies to effectively measure performance and characterize risk, thereby increasing warfighter trust in autonomous systems.  Current DoD test capabilities and methodologies are insufficient to address the testing of increasingly autonomous units and teams of unmanned systems operating in unstructured, dynamic, battlespace environments.  Furthermore, advancements are being made in developing collaborating system-of-autonomous-systems, working in concert as a swarm or pack and in close proximity with humans.  New test technologies are needed to stress the collective set of autonomous systems under realistic conditions, predict emergent behavior of autonomous systems, emulate the complex environment, and assess mission performance of these highly coupled and intelligent systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:Text>The UAST project focused on predicting and assessing the autonomy functions of unmanned and autonomous systems through ongoing technology developments.  Efforts continued to develop technology to virtualize test sites into ultra-high-fidelity, real-time simulators. The goal is to facilitate verification, assessment, and evaluation of UASs in a realistic, risk free, highly measureable, statistically significant manner prior to field test.  The UAST project built automated tools to test the robustness of black-box UASs in unexpected operating scenarios. The technology feeds inputs that trigger software bugs to find vulnerabilities without costly field testing.  The test technology was developed and implemented as a prototype to enable black box system automated autonomy architecture stress testing, with a focus on UAS software and the interfaces of the core components without requiring source code.  The approach is agnostic to the specific component interface.  This technology provided testers with a perspective of system performance and a previously unavailable prediction of behavior. This automated stress testing tool was initially transitioned and integrated into the development and T&amp;E processes for the Autonomous Mobility Appliqué System (AMAS), a multiplatform kit that integrates low-cost sensors and control systems onto U.S. Army and Marine Corps tactical vehicles to assist drivers or enable autonomous operation in convoys. Additionally, the UAS stress test tool was used on the Autonomous Aerial Cargo/Utility System (AACUS), an Naval prototype that explores advanced autonomous capabilities for reliable resupply/retrograde and, in the long term, casualty evacuation. In both cases, the UAST project stress testing technology identified failure modes before they were triggered in the field. Development continued on technology for test infrastructure that combines synthetic and actual forces to produce a realistic, real-time, interactive autonomous vehicle test environment. This technology is also being developed to provide safe testing assurances via on-board safety monitoring.
FY 2015 Plans: 
Work on virtualizing test sites will complete and transition to T&amp;E agencies as will the stress testing tool.  Development of technology that combines synthetic and actual forces to produce a realistic, real-time, interactive autonomous vehicle test environment will continue.  New efforts will focus on investing in test technologies supporting the near term challenges identified in the 2013 – 2038 DoD Unmanned Systems Integrated Roadmap, such as, integrating DoD unmanned systems within the National Airspace and safely operating unmanned aerial systems within our national ranges.  The UAST project will further explore test technologies to meet the challenges of testing autonomy by leveraging advances made in the standardization of UAS architectures, functional components, and interfaces. UAST will initiate research in the area of autonomous system test planning to develop technologies which develop the most salient test plans for maritime, air, and ground-based autonomous systems and enable test ranges to identify the degree of regression testing required for autonomous systems upon changes to the hardware and software.</r2:Text>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Department of Defense (DoD) ability to use cyberspace for rapid communication and information sharing in support of operations is a critical enabler of DoD military missions.  Advancements in utilizing cyberspace are outpacing the technologies needed for test and evaluation (T&amp;E).  The Cyberspace Test Technology (CTT) project develops advanced technologies and methodologies to test and evaluate DoD capabilities and information networks to defend and conduct full-spectrum military operations across cyberspace.  Current cyberspace T&amp;E capabilities are insufficient to support the continual experimental, contractor, developmental, operational, and live-fire testing requirements of warfighter systems operating in cyberspace.  Many of the test tools and infrastructure items required for systems in cyberspace will need advancement and maturation of various nascent test technologies.  The CTT project will address test technology shortfalls in cyberspace testing, including planning cyberspace tests, creating representative cyberspace threats and test environments, executing cyberspace tests, and performing cyberspace test analysis and evaluation.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The basic mission of this program element is to fund innovation to improve the Department of Defense’s (DoD) operational effectiveness via targeted operational energy science and technology (S&amp;T) investments. It contains two projects.
 
P455, the Operational Energy Capability Improvement Fund (OECIF), incentivizes S&amp;T to promote long term change in DoD capabilities so they are better aligned with the Operational Energy Strategy. OECIF generally fosters innovation to improve operational energy performance and has two key mission aspects. First, to develop, demonstrate and transition into use operational energy technologies and practices that will improve DoD military capabilities and/or reduce costs. Second, to establish within the military Services sustainable, institutional capacity to continue to research, develop and adopt operational energy innovations. OECIF funds serve as “seed money” to start or consolidate promising operational energy programs to be sustained by the Services; accordingly, OECIF generally emphasizes supporting or establishing programs, rather than one-off projects.
 
P456, the Hybrid Energy Storage Module (HESM), co-sponsored by ASD(R&amp;E) and ASD(OEPP), develops advanced energy storage technologies to maximize performance and reliability, and enable future high power weapons and sensor systems on legacy and next generation vehicles, aircraft and ships. The goals of HESM are to (1) demonstrate energy storage systems with high power and energy densities, scalable to all power levels that reduce total logistics demand, increase platform ability to sustain operations during engagement, and (2) reduce maintenance. Once demonstration is complete, this technology will be sustained by the Services and used to extend the operational performance and safety for these applications beyond the hybrid storage module baseline design configuration. This program is closely coordinated with the Advanced Management and Protection of Energy-storage Devices (AMPED) program of the Department of Energy's (DOE) Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Operational Energy Capability Improvement Fund (OECIF)
 
Description: The basic mission of the OECIF is to fund innovation that will improve DoD operational effectiveness via targeted S&amp;T investments. As Defense-Wide funding, it incentivizes S&amp;T to promote long term change in DoD capabilities so they are better aligned with the Operational Energy Strategy. OECIF generally fosters innovation to improve operational energy performance and has two key mission aspects.  First, to develop, demonstrate and transition into use operational energy technologies and practices that will improve DoD military capabilities and/or reduce costs. Second, to establish within the military Services sustainable, institutional capability to continue to research, develop and adopt operational energy innovations. OECIF funds serve as “seed money” to start or consolidate promising operational energy programs to be sustained by the Services; accordingly, OECIF generally emphasizes supporting or establishing programs, rather than one-off projects.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:Text>The expeditionary outpost energy load reduction focus and Waste to Energy (W2E) programs begun in FY12 were continued. The Advanced, Energy Efficient Shelter Systems for Contingency Basing (AEESS) program performed full prototype technical evaluations in Kuwait and Guam.  The Super Energy Efficient Containerized Living Unit (SuperCLU) program tested and verified improved CLUs and split system Environmental Control Units (ECU), expeditionary air conditioners, at multiple military facilities. The Innovative Cooling Equipment (ICE) program received 9K, 18K, 36K and 60KBTU improved ECUs that were successfully tested to show energy savings from 16 to 54%.  The Navy Expeditionary Technology Transition Program (NETTP) explored and proved the concepts of two dehumidification membranes and continued development of two waste heat based ECUs and a Stirling engine based ECU.  The Transformative Reductions in Operational Energy Consumption (TROPEC) program assessed a collection of energy efficiency and man portable systems in summer testing. In the W2E program with the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP), four designs were prototyped, tested and component improvements begun. 
 
The operational energy consortia programs begun in FY13 also progressed.  The Engineered Surfaces Materials and Coatings for Drag Reduction program identified additional legacy fleet drag reduction technologies - non-structural Outer Mold Line (OML) "add-ons" with potential to reduce drag penalties of pylon and winglet integration on C-17 aircraft, the Air Forces largest fuel consumer.  A BAA was issued to establish a consortium-like team to pursue other drag reduction technologies, with emphasis on non-traditional technology providers.  The Energy Efficient Outpost Modeling Consortium (EEOMC) established initial optimization models for the Energy Resource Planning Tool and identified key parameters for a baseline commander dashboard application.  An executive level energy education course was developed to aid the shift to an energy aware culture. The Tactical Microgrid Standards Consortia (TMSC) established three working groups of Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) drawn from the Services. Five major gaps in existing microgrid standards were identified and the program developed plans to address them. The Soldier and Small Unit Power (Soldier Power) program established a government steering committee from the requirements, S&amp;T and acquisition communities, and formulated the next generation Soldier Power and Energy architecture.
 
Six new programs were selected to begin in FY14 to improve analytical methods for considering operational energy in DoD planning and management processes above the platform/engineering level. The Marines will develop the Expeditionary version to the Synthetic Theater Operations Research Model (STORM-E) to explicitly incorporate energy issues for an expeditionary force at the campaign level. OECIF funding will augment and deepen the work of the Army’s Operational Energy Analysis Task Force (OEATF) program, supporting work in data, scenarios and modeling tools.  The Joint Deployment Energy Planning and Logistics Optimization Initiative (J-DEPLOI) program will fold operational energy considerations into the Joint Operational Planning Process (JOPP) at Pacific Combatant Command (PACOM).  The Comprehensive Operational Energy Toolkit (COE Toolkit) program will develop tools to examine the mission level effects of attacks on energy supplies at and in route to air bases.  The Energy Integration and Interoperability (Energy I&amp;I) program will fold energy considerations into a kill chain analysis technique for the Navy.  The Capability Assessment and Modeling for Energy Logistics (CAMEL) program, led by the Air Force Research Lab (AFRL), will develop operational energy analysis tools for the mobility air force, including airlift, air to air refueling, and cost benefit analysis. With better methods and tools for understanding the burdens and vulnerabilities imposed by operational energy and how it affects our military effectiveness, planners and decision makers will be able to make better informed choices.</r2:Text>

AEESS plans to hold cold weather demonstrations in Ft Greely, Alaska and Ellsworth AFB and hot weather demonstrations in Holloman AFB of improved shelter systems.  SuperCLU is currently testing the improved CLUs and split system ECUs in Guam and Florida, and plans to test at Camp Lemonnier, Djibouti in February and the Philippines in May.  The ICE program will conduct capability demonstrations and testing of the improved 9K, 18K, 36K and 60KBTU ECUs at CERDEC and the Army’s TECD-4a demonstration. NETTP will demonstrate Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 for two waste heat powered ECUs and a five ton cooling Stirling ECU. TROPEC will perform another set of lab and field assessments, and will continue its shift toward funding by other DoD users.  The W2E program will be testing with a variety of surrogate waste streams in order to mimic real world contingency base operations and the prototype system designs will be improved and developed for potential demonstration validation efforts.
 
The consortia programs will progress.  The TMSC program will work closely with the technical sub-groups and other consortium members to start developing draft standards where commercial power systems standards are not adequate for the tactical environment. EEOMC’s Energy Resource Planning Tool will be enhanced with increased time steps, load generation tool development and completion of sub-modules describing photovoltaic and battery systems. Soldier Power will develop and evaluate intelligent power management approaches, low power demand soldier electronics technologies, high power/energy density power generation and energy storage systems, and actionable non-materiel recommendations to reduce the Soldier Power operational energy burden.  The Engineered Surfaces Materials and Coatings Drag Reduction program will quantify benefits on C-17 aircraft by the addition of non-structural OML "add-ons" to reduce drag associated with pylon and winglet integration. In addition, the program will establish a consortium-like team, hold a workshop to inform technology providers of program requirements and goals, and fund the most promising drag reduction technologies.  
 
The analytical method programs selected and started in FY14 will ramp up.  The STORM-E program will transition the STORM database to the Pacific theater, address additional/alternative data requirements and identify evolving analytical focus and data requirements for campaign-level assessments of operational energy to inform STORM-E Roadmap.  The OEATF program will begin developing the scenarios, data, and simulation capability to assess operational energy across a range of operational environments.  The J-DEPLOI program will analyze the Joint Operational Planning Process's (JOPP) current logistical capacity and vulnerability planning gaps, assess over two dozen existing defense information technology tools to determine the best architecture and database candidates for an operational energy insertion method, and select the best fit to address those gaps.  The COE Toolkit program will develop tools to examine evolving weapons and targeting impacts against a variety of energy related targets.  The Energy I&amp;I team will begin planning for Valiant Shield 2016 and actively employ the Energy I&amp;I analytical methodology within the Navy.  The CAMEL program will develop and/or leverage modeling, simulation, and analysis (MS&amp;A) solutions to close airlift and air refueling mission gaps.  
 
The new FY15 programs will significantly expand on-going collaboration with DOE under the Advanced Vehicle Power Technology Alliance.  The primary emphasis will be improving the energy efficiency/range and, hence, the military capability from DoD’s legacy tactical ground vehicles.  This effort might cover such technologies and topics as electrification of auxiliaries, engine controls, drive trains, and lightweighting. In addition, a Marine and Army program to demonstrate energy harvesting technology at the company level and improve the data on actual duty cycles of dismounted troops’ equipment will also begin; this will complement the Soldier Power consortia program begun in FY13.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:Text>The consortia programs will continue.  TMSC, with the support of DoD, DOE, NIST, IEEE and other professional societies will review and revise draft standards. EEOMC’s Energy Resource Planning Tool will implement additional user-selectable parameters reflecting geographic location and mission duration, and initiate hardware testing and integration into the Virtual Forward Operating Base system.  The Soldier Power program will conduct integration and field testing of integrated soldier power and data management systems, reduced power demand soldier electronics, and high power/energy density power generation and energy storage technologies. The Engineered Surfaces for Drag Reduction program will mature the best candidate drag reduction technologies and conduct flight tests as appropriate.
 
The analytical methods programs will also continue.  STORM-E will incorporate Spiral 1 into the USMC analytical environment for Expeditionary Force 21 (EF 21) and perform studies with the Pacific theater scenarios to refine EF 21 operational concepts.  The OEATF program will complete the development of the OE analytic capabilities, conduct validation and verification of the simulations, and provide the capability to the user community.  J-DEPLOI will develop user-defined requirements for and a prototype of an IT tool to be used by joint operational planners to address any non-materiel changes in tactics and procedures required, and assess results against JOPP modification objectives.  The COE Toolkit program will develop tools to track the logistics of the energy network and interdiction of energy resources in route to a base.  The Energy I&amp;I program will roll out the Energy I&amp;I Analytical Methodology to the USAF to develop a joint sea and air effects/kill chain approach.  The CAMEL program will execute analyses focusing on aerial refueling missions and identify MS&amp;A capability and data gaps specific to the operational burdens of various capabilities. 
 
The effort begun in FY15 to improve the energy efficiency of DoD’s legacy tactical ground vehicles, in collaboration with DOE, will continue to ramp up. The Marine/Army energy harvesting program will focus on system of system integration with heavy emphasis on incremental field evaluations building to the final company level trial. 
 
New programs starting in FY16 will reflect a continuing shift within OECIF from an emphasis on contingency bases to one of mobile platforms.  Given OECIF’s on-going work on energy efficient ground vehicles, improving the energy efficiency of sea or air platforms will be of primary interest.  Of particular interest could be reducing the loads, including hotel loads, on such platforms. The focus of such new programs may also reflect input from various communities of interest within DoD - such as Energy and Power, Ground and Sea Platforms, and Air Platforms - and the results from OEPP’s oversight of the research programs of the Services and any developing gaps identified by OEPP.</r2:Text>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Systems program is researching, developing, integrating, testing, deploying, operating, and maintaining a CWMD situational awareness system.  This system will enable a comprehensive, global capability for situational awareness of threats from WMD as well as global efforts to counter those threats.  This system will foster a shared understanding of the CWMD operating environment and support decision making for operations and activities by the U.S. government and its partners.  The CWMD mission space is characterized by immense amounts of information, such as the characteristics and location of WMD-related facilities and materials, personnel and expertise, and dual-use technologies.  The CWMD Systems program comprises next-generation advanced information technologies, coupled with small fusion cells, to locate, gather, access, share, and visualize this WMD-relevant information to facilitate collaboration and decision-making. These solutions will revolutionize CWMD knowledge management, providing decision makers and operational personnel a dynamic, holistic view of the global CWMD operating environment.

The diversity and complexity of the CWMD mission requires an integrated approach toward capability development, based on a systems perspective that links strategic objectives with interrelated tasks and associated capabilities. The CWMD mission is intertwined with counter-terrorism and homeland defense and hence system development must leverage and integrate complementary technologies developed to support other mission areas. The CWMD Systems program also will enable international collaboration in countering WMD by breaking down unnecessary data stove-pipes and by enabling the U.S. Government and its partners to access and share knowledge.

This program also responds to the strategic needs outlined in the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review, the Department of Defense (DoD) Strategy for Countering WMD, the FY2016-2020 Defense Planning Guidance, and capability requirements approved by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council. The CWMD Systems program will develop and field a global CWMD situational awareness capability to meet the needs of Combatant Commands, the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Staff, the Services, and Defense Agencies.  Other U.S. Government Departments and Agencies will be able to utilize this capability to support their mission needs and collaborate with the Department of Defense. This program is designed to leverage existing DoD resources and proven approaches to achieve its goals and rapidly deliver an operational capability. 

The CWMD Systems portfolio is supported by two RDT&amp;E program elements (0303310D8Z for research, development, testing and evaluation of advanced materiel and non-materiel solutions, and 0607310D8Z for upgrades or improvements to fielded systems), as well as an Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) line (ORC 2531) for program sustainment and administrative costs associated with analyses, oversight, and portfolio management.     

This Program Element can fund travel to support the requirements of this program.

This appropriation will finance work, including manpower, performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant arrangement with the government who conduct research (systematic study directed toward fuller scientific knowledge or understanding of the subject studied), development (systematic use of the knowledge and understanding gained from research, for the production of useful materials, devices, systems, or methods, including the design and development of prototypes and processes) and test and evaluation efforts.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Planning Guidance, and capability requirements approved by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council. The CWMD Systems program will develop and field a global CWMD situational awareness capability to meet the needs of Combatant Commands, the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Staff, the Services, and Defense Agencies.  Other U.S. Government Departments and Agencies will be able to utilize this capability to support their mission needs and collaborate with the Department of Defense. This program is designed to leverage existing DoD resources and proven approaches to achieve its goals and rapidly deliver an operational capability. 

The CWMD Systems portfolio is supported by two RDT&amp;E program elements (0303310D8Z for research, development, testing and evaluation of advanced materiel and non-materiel solutions, and 0607310D8Z for upgrades or improvements to fielded systems), as well as an Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) line (ORC 2531) for program sustainment and administrative costs associated with analyses, oversight, and portfolio management.
   
The CWMD Systems program is researching, developing, integrating, testing, deploying, operating, and maintaining a CWMD situational awareness system.  This system will enable a comprehensive, global capability for situational awareness of threats from WMD as well as global efforts to counter those threats.   This system will foster a shared understanding of the CWMD operating environment and support decision making for operations and activities by the U.S. government and its partners.  The CWMD mission space is characterized by immense amounts of information, such as the characteristics and location of WMD-related facilities and materials, personnel and expertise, and dual-use technologies.  The CWMD Systems program comprises next-generation advanced information technologies, coupled with small fusion cells, to locate, gather, access, share, and visualize this WMD-relevant information to facilitate collaboration and decision-making. These solutions will revolutionize CWMD knowledge management, providing decision makers and operational personnel a dynamic, holistic view of the global CWMD operating environment.  

The diversity and complexity of the CWMD mission requires an integrated approach toward capability development, based on a systems perspective that links strategic objectives with interrelated tasks and associated capabilities. The CWMD mission is intertwined with counter-terrorism and homeland defense and hence system development must leverage and integrate complementary technologies developed to support other mission areas. The CWMD Systems program also will enable international collaboration in countering WMD by breaking down unnecessary data stove-pipes and by enabling the U.S. Government and its partners to access and share knowledge.

This program also responds to the strategic needs outlined in the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review, the Department of Defense (DoD) Strategy for Countering WMD, the FY2016-2020 Defense Planning Guidance, and capability requirements approved by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council. The CWMD Systems program will develop and field a global CWMD situational awareness capability to meet the needs of Combatant Commands, the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Staff, the Services, and Defense Agencies.  Other U.S. Government Departments and Agencies will be able to utilize this capability to support their mission needs and collaborate with the Department of Defense. This program is designed to leverage existing DoD resources and proven approaches to achieve its goals and rapidly deliver an operational capability.

This Program Element can fund travel to support the requirements of this program.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) addresses the need to defend and deter against weapons of mass destruction (WMD) threats and to safeguard personnel; prevent unauthorized access to equipment, installations, material, and documents; and to safeguard the foregoing against espionage, sabotage, damage, and theft.  This program oversees advanced engineering development throughout DoD for an integrated and systemic RDT&amp;E approach for countering nuclear threats and nuclear and conventional physical security technology and systems.  The funding has been centralized in this Defense-wide PE since the early 1990s and represents a substantial portion of all DoD physical security RDT&amp;E funding.  Priorities for this PE RDT&amp;E efforts are driven by inputs from Quadrennial Defense Review guidance, Combatant Command and Service requirements, analysis reports such as “Protecting the Force:  Lessons from Fort Hood," January 2010, the Integrated Unit, Base, and Installation Protection Cost Benefits Analysis, Multi-national Work Plans established through the Nuclear Security Summit process, and DoD Directive 5210.41, Security Policy for Protecting Nuclear Weapons-directed requirements and associated security deviation reports.  

Under this integrated approach, funds are used to provide advanced component development and prototypes for the Department in seven capability areas:  (1) Detection and Assessment; (2) Access Controls; (3) Installation and Transport Security; (4) Storage and Safeguards; (5) Prevention; (6) Decision Support Systems; and (7) Analytical Support.  This program will evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment.  The projects under the Program Element either (a) lead to Programs of Record which can transition to Program Element 0604161D8Z for systems development and demonstration (SDD); (b) become technology insertions into existing programs; or (c) advance to being a certified Commercial/Government off-the-shelf product.  The PE initiatives are coordinated by the Physical Security Enterprise and Analysis Group.  This group is responsible for avoiding duplication of effort and when applicable ensure systems integration and promote interoperability and sustainability.  

This PE can fund travel to support the requirements of this program.

This appropriation will finance work, including manpower, performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant
arrangement with the government who conduct research (systematic study directed toward fuller scientific knowledge or understanding of the subject studied),
development (systematic use of the knowledge and understanding gained from research, for the production of useful materials, devices, systems, or methods, including the design and development of prototypes and processes) and test and evaluation efforts.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) addresses the need to defend and deter against weapons of mass destruction (WMD) threats and to safeguard personnel; prevent unauthorized access to equipment, installations, material, and documents; and to safeguard the foregoing against espionage, sabotage, damage, and theft.  This program oversees advanced engineering development throughout DoD for an integrated and systemic RDT&amp;E approach for countering nuclear threats and nuclear and conventional physical security equipment (PSE) technology and systems.  The funding has been centralized in this Defense-wide PE since the early 1990s and represents a substantial portion of all DoD PSE RDT&amp;E funding.  Priorities for this PE RDT&amp;E efforts are driven by inputs from Quadrennial Defense Review guidance, Combatant Command and Service requirements, analysis reports such as “Protecting the Force:  Lessons from Fort Hood," January 2010, the Integrated Unit, Base, and Installation Protection Cost Benefits Analysis, Multi-national Work Plans established through the Nuclear Security Summit process, and DoD Directive 5210.41, Security Policy for Protecting Nuclear Weapons-directed requirements and associated security deviation reports.  

Under this integrated approach, funds are used to provide PSE advanced component development and prototypes for the Department in seven capability areas:  (1) Detection and Assessment; (2) Access Controls; (3) Installation and Transport Security; (4) Storage and Safeguards; (5) Prevention; (6) Decision Support Systems; and (7) Analytical Support.  The projects under the Program Element either (a) lead to Programs of Record – which can transition to Program Element 0604161D8Z for systems development and demonstration (SDD); (b) become technology insertions into existing programs; or (c) advance to being a certified Commercial/Government off-the-shelf product.  The PE initiatives are coordinated by the Security Policy Verification Committee and the Physical Security Equipment Action Group.  These groups work together to avoid duplication of effort and when applicable ensure systems integration and promote interoperability and sustainability.  

This PE can fund travel to support the requirements of this program.

This appropriation will finance work, including manpower, performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant
arrangement with the government who conduct research (systematic study directed toward fuller scientific knowledge or understanding of the subject studied),
development (systematic use of the knowledge and understanding gained from research, for the production of useful materials, devices, systems, or methods, including the design and development of prototypes and processes) and test and evaluation efforts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Nuclear forensics is the thorough collection, analysis and evaluation of radiological and nuclear material in a pre-detonation state and post-detonation radiological or nuclear materials, devices and debris, as well as the immediate effects created by a nuclear detonation.  The ability to identify the source of nuclear material from radioactive debris is critical to our national defense and security. Swift and accurate forensic and attribution (identification) capabilities are vital to developing an appropriate national response to a nuclear event and preventing future attacks in a timely manner.

Nuclear Terrorism is one of the most significant and pressing threats identified by national leadership.  A credible nuclear forensics program is essential to preventing nuclear terrorism by deterring nations from sponsoring nuclear terrorism.  During the Deputy Management Advisory Group process shortfalls and resources to close these gaps were identified and supported by the Deputy Secretary of Defense.  The purpose of this program is to develop systems such as ground based Prompt Diagnostic sensors and Particulate Airborne Collection Systems to provide timely and accurate information to national leadership in the area of Nuclear Forensics. 

Per DoDI 2060.04 OSD AT&amp;L NCB is the program lead for the Department of Defense in Nuclear Forensics.  NCB represents DoD interests in all areas of nuclear forensics but focuses heavily on post-detonation applications due to Presidential guidance assigning the department the lead role in develop, providing, and maintaining post detonation Nuclear Forensics capability.  

This PE can fund travel to support the requirements of this program.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>(U) The Environmental Security Technology Certification Program (ESTCP) demonstrates and validates the most promising innovative environmental and energy technologies that target DoD's most urgent needs.  Technologies selected are projected to provide a return on the investment through cost savings and improved efficiencies. The program responds to: (1) Congressional concern over the slow pace of remediation of environmentally polluted sites on military installations, (2) Congressional direction to conduct demonstrations specifically focused on emerging new technologies, and (3) the need to improve defense readiness by reducing the drain on the Department's operation and maintenance dollars caused by environmental restoration, waste management, and the cost of energy.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>(U) The Environmental Security Technology Certification Program (ESTCP) demonstrates and validates the most promising innovative environmental and energy technologies that target DoD's most urgent needs.   Technologies selected are projected to provide a return on the investment through cost savings and improved efficiencies. The program responds to: (1) Congressional concern over the slow pace of remediation of environmentally polluted sites on military installations, (2) Congressional direction to conduct demonstrations specifically focused on emerging new technologies, and (3) the need to improve defense readiness by reducing the drain on the Department's operation and maintenance dollars caused by environmental restoration,waste management, and the cost of energy. Preference for demonstrations is given to technologies that have successfully completed all necessary research and development objectives, and address the highest priority DoD requirements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:Text>Funds were invested in energy projects that constitute the Installation Energy Test Bed Initiative. The test bed program validates and tests the operational cost and performance of innovative energy technologies in a real-world integrated building environment so as to reduce risk, overcome the barriers to deployment, and facilitate wide-scale deployment.  The DoD test bed program exploits the Department's existing built infrastructure to test energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies. In FY 2014 ESTCP solicited proposals in two areas: 1) Smart and Secure Military Installation Energy Management and 2) Advanced Building Energy Management and Control.  It is a distributed test bed designed to evaluate energy technologies under the varied climatic conditions and building types DoD manages. The test beds key elements are: 1) competitive selection of new technologies, 2) systematic and consistent evaluation to determine performance, operational readiness and life cycle costs, and 3) development of guidance and design information for future deployment across installations.  This process has been developed, piloted, and validated through previous Congressional funding. Information on existing demonstrations can be found at www.serdp-estcp.org.</r2:Text>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Under the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict (OASD SO/LIC), the Humanitarian Demining Research and Development (HD R&amp;D) program element develops, demonstrates and validates new technologies for DoD-supported nations to detect and clear landmines and unexploded ordnance (UXO), and to contribute to US military countermine R&amp;D.  The HD R&amp;D Program works closely with the Geographical Combatant Commands (GCC) and the Humanitarian Demining Training Center (HDTC) to identify, develop and implement mine/UXO detection and clearance technologies; speed improvements to technologies used by U.S. forces in support of USG operations; reduce the threat to host nation population and US forces; reduce insurgent access to explosives (landmines and UXO); enhance mine action capacity of non-governmental organizations and mine action centers in mine-affected countries; and provide engagement opportunities for DoD personnel in mine-affected countries. 

Evaluations of HD R&amp;D Program-developed technologies in actual minefields are conducted by host nation demining partners (foreign military, non-governmental organizations and mine action centers) and provide valuable data for US military countermine R&amp;D and next generation HD technology developments while directly contributing to world-wide mine and UXO clearance.  Since 1995 the program has fielded technologies for 172 evaluations in 37 countries, including Vietnam, Cambodia, Solomon Islands, Iraq and Afghanistan.  The program’s technologies have cleared 26 million sq meters of the world’s toughest minefields; found or destroyed 133,000 mines and UXO; and provided 350,000 mine/UXO disposal charges with 40 tons of explosive recovered from stockpiles and abandoned munitions in PACOM.

New technology requirements and areas of emphasis are identified and validated at a biennial Requirements Workshop held by OASD SO/LIC.  The Requirements Workshop involves representatives from Department of State (DOS), GCCs and mine-affected nations.  The program element’s work is consistent with the Department of Defense’s strategic guidance to address instability and reduce the demand for significant US force commitments to stability operations; with DODI 3000.05 to foster security, economic security and development, and build indigenous capacity; and with § 407 and CJCSI 3207.01C to reduce the social, economic and environmental impact of landmines, unexploded ordnance and small arms ammunition.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Following a rapid prototyping strategy, the program emphasizes the use/modification of existing, commercially-available items and components to build functional prototype equipment suited for humanitarian demining operations.  This approach is required due to the immediate need for new demining technologies in the face of ongoing U.S. forces and host nation citizen casualties in mine-affected countries.  The program evaluates prototype equipment by acquiring it off-the-shelf from industry using competition to the extent possible, by leveraging ongoing countermine R&amp;D efforts in other U.S. and foreign R&amp;D activities, and by taking advantage of extensive in-house fabrication capabilities at the Army's Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Division (NVESD).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Long Term Strategies:  Obtain adequate funding to support critical shortfalls; prioritize proposals that are deemed acceptable and allocate funding accordingly; and establish outreach programs to leverage institutional knowledge and expertise.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Current U.S. military strategy and the global security environment make coalition warfare and multinational operations fundamental features of the U.S. national security strategy. Coalitions provide a broad base of technological, operational, and logistical support for military operations and ease the U.S. financial and manpower burdens associated with meeting military goals and objectives. U.S. strategic guidance confirms that coalitions and relationships with international partners are high priorities for the nation and the Department of Defense.

The Coalition Warfare Program (CWP) responds to this guidance by supporting DoD organizations that:  1) work with foreign partners to collaboratively address strategic technology gaps for current and future missions; 2) develop interoperability solutions for coalition operations; and 3) develop and strengthen defense relationships. CWP is the only Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) program with this mission. CWP supplements a U.S. Government proponent’s funding for cooperative efforts, ensuring U.S. funds are sufficient to complete the engagement with the foreign partner(s).  When CWP funds are used to help fund a cooperative project, that project leverages technical and financial contributions of the foreign partner(s) and speeds up the development and delivery of technical solutions to the warfighter.  In its fourteen-year history, CWP has leveraged $4 of foreign partner funding and $3 of other U.S. Government funding for every $1 CWP has invested in cooperative projects. 

CWP funding enables DoD project teams to move a technology into the next stage of development or to complete and transition a technology to operational forces. These projects may also form the basis for future cooperation with international partners.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The purpose of this program is to develop a comprehensive capability to prevent and mitigate corrosion and its effects on Department of Defense (DoD) weapon systems and infrastructure.  Corrosion severely impacts system and facility reliability, readiness and safety, and consumes a disproportionate amount of material and labor hours for repair and treatment of corrosion damaged systems and facilities.  The cost of corrosion across the DoD has been estimated at over 23 billion each year. The impact and cost of corrosion are so pervasive that Congress enacted Public Law 107-314 Sec: 1067 [portions codified in 10 U.S.C. 2228]: Prevention and mitigation of corrosion of military infrastructure and equipment.  This legislation requires that DoD develop a long-term corrosion strategy to include establishment of a coordinated R&amp;D program with transition plans.  The legislation also requires that DoD designate a responsible official or organization to oversee a corrosion prevention and mitigation program.  The responsibilities of the Director, Corrosion Policy and Oversight and the Military Department Corrosion Prevention and Control Executives were further delineated in DODI 5000.67 "Prevention and Mitigation of Corrosion on Military Equipment and Infrastructure" of 01 February 2010.
 
The Deputy Secretary of Defense designated the Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics) (PDUSD(AT&amp;L)) as the DoD Corrosion Executive in May 2003.  The DoD Corrosion Executive subsequently established a Corrosion Control and Oversight office to implement the program.  Subsequently, in accordance with Section 371 of the 2008 National Defense Authorization Act, the Under Secretary of Defense (USD(AT&amp;L)) designated a Director, Corrosion Policy and Oversight to perform the duties of the DoD Corrosion Executive with responsibilities as described in the 2008 NDAA legislation.  A major responsibility of the Director, Corrosion Policy and Oversight is to select high payoff research and development projects that promise to prevent or mitigate corrosion and significantly reduce the total cost of corrosion along with the adverse impact of corrosion effects on weapon system and infrastructure operational capability.  This office chartered a Corrosion Prevention and Control Integrated Product Team (CPCIPT) that has selected and funded Operation and Maintenance projects for each Fiscal Year (FY) commencing in FY 2005. However, the DoD CPCIPT has determined that the biggest payoff in corrosion prevention and mitigation will come from investing in up-front prevention technologies, materials, and processes to leverage downstream cost avoidance in corrosion maintenance and repair.  Likewise, development of improved predictive and prognostic techniques can eliminate unseen failure and reduce unnecessary maintenance and repair costs.  Thus, technology development, demonstration, and transition projects have been selected and funded since FY 2006.   In addition, the University Corrosion Collaboration (now the Technical Corrosion Collaboration (TCC)) was formed as a collaboration between universities, academies and research laboratories, focused on corrosion technology research and development to provide solutions to long-term, complex corrosion prevention and control problems, including metallic-non-metallic interactions, advanced surface coatings and treatments for non-traditional use of materials . This advanced corrosion research has been funded since FY 2008 and performed by teams from TCC participating organizations.

In FY 2009, the Military Departments assigned corrosion executives and began submitting reports to Congress on inserting corrosion planning into the acquisition process. The FY 2011 NDAA added a requirement for the DoD to report the amount of funds requested in the preceding year budget for each planned project or activity, as compared to the funding required for each project or activity.  These funds provide a portion of the funds used to implement associated corrosion control projects and activities.

These projects address critical corrosion issues in both Department of Defense infrastructure as well as warfighting systems.  A number of low-risk, high-payoff technologies promise to vastly improve the service life and significantly reduce the maintenance costs of storage tanks and other mission support facilities essential to maintain support for the warfighter.  Each of the services has identified important projects that vastly increase operational readiness and reduce operations and maintenance costs.  All services are studying corrosion inhibitors that improve reliability and life of electrical and avionics equipment.  Likewise, an array of highly effective, rapid cure coatings that are easy to apply and can forestall corrosion for many years on aircraft and ships are being developed.  Other vital projects being considered include sealants, wash down systems, sensors and prognostic technologies that have joint service applications and potential to prevent and mitigate corrosion and its effects over a wide range of systems.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The purpose of this program is to develop a comprehensive capability to prevent and mitigate corrosion and its effects on Department of Defense (DoD) weapon systems and infrastructure.  Corrosion severely impacts system and facility reliability, readiness and safety, and consumes a disproportionate amount of material and labor hours for repair and treatment of corrosion damaged systems and facilities.  The cost of corrosion across the DoD has been estimated at over 23 billion each year. The impact and cost of corrosion are so pervasive that Congress enacted Public Law 107-314 Sec: 1067 [portions codified in 10 U.S.C. 2228]: Prevention and mitigation of corrosion of military infrastructure and equipment.  This legislation requires that DoD develop a long-term corrosion strategy to include establishment of a coordinated R&amp;D program with transition plans.  The legislation also requires that DoD designate a responsible official or organization to oversee a corrosion prevention and mitigation program.  The responsibilities of the Director, Corrosion Policy and Oversight and the Military Department Corrosion Prevention and Control Executives were further delineated in DODI 5000.67 "Prevention and Mitigation of Corrosion on Military Equipment and Infrastructure" of 01 February 2010.
 
The Deputy Secretary of Defense designated the Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics) (PDUSD(AT&amp;L)) as the DoD Corrosion Executive in May 2003.  The DoD Corrosion Executive subsequently established a Corrosion Control and Oversight office to implement the program.  Subsequently, in accordance with Section 371 of the 2008 National Defense Authorization Act, the Under Secretary of Defense (USD(AT&amp;L)) designated a Director, Corrosion Policy and Oversight to perform the duties of the DoD Corrosion Executive with responsibilities as described in the 2008 NDAA legislation.  A major responsibility of the Director, Corrosion Policy and Oversight is to select high payoff research and development projects that promise to prevent or mitigate corrosion and significantly reduce the total cost of corrosion along with the adverse impact of corrosion effects on weapon system and infrastructure operational capability.  This office chartered a Corrosion Prevention and Control Integrated Product Team (CPCIPT) that has selected and funded Operation and Maintenance projects for each Fiscal Year (FY) commencing in FY 2005. However, the DoD CPCIPT has determined that the biggest payoff in corrosion prevention and mitigation will come from investing in up-front prevention technologies, materials, and processes to leverage downstream cost avoidance in corrosion maintenance and repair.  Likewise, development of improved predictive and prognostic techniques can eliminate unseen failure and reduce unnecessary maintenance and repair costs.  Thus, technology development, demonstration, and transition projects have been selected and funded since FY 2006.  In FY 2009, the Military Departments assigned corrosion executives and began submitting reports to Congress on inserting corrosion planning into the acquisition process. The FY 2011 NDAA added a requirement for the DoD to report the amount of funds requested in the preceding year budget for each planned project or activity, as compared to the funding required for each project or activity.  These funds provide a portion of the funds used to implement associated corrosion control projects and activities.
 
These projects address critical corrosion issues in both Department of Defense infrastructure as well as warfighting systems.  A number of low-risk, high-payoff technologies promise to vastly improve the service life and significantly reduce the maintenance costs of storage tanks and other mission support facilities essential to maintain support for the warfighter.  Each of the services has identified important projects that vastly increase operational readiness and reduce operations and maintenance costs.  All services are studying corrosion inhibitors that improve reliability and life of electrical and avionics equipment.  Likewise, an array of highly effective, rapid cure coatings that are easy to apply and can forestall corrosion for many years on aircraft and ships are being developed.  Other vital projects being considered include sealants, wash down systems, sensors and prognostic technologies that have joint service applications and potential to prevent and mitigate corrosion and its effects over a wide range of systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Acquisitions are accomplished in three categories including projects, research opportunities, and activities as described in the DoD Corrosion Prevention and Mitigation Strategic Plan.

Projects are funded jointly by CPO and the Military Departments and are led by subject matter experts at the Military Department laboratories.  CPO issues a call for proposed project plans in April and projects are submitted in June.  The project plan format is contained in the DoD Corrosion Prevention and Mitigation Strategic Plan.  The Corrosion Prevention and Control Integrated Project Team (CPCIPT) receives project plans and engages an evaluation panel to review proposed projects and make recommendations regarding project selection.  Projects are also evaluated using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to rank projects by relative efficiency.  DEA factors include project performance period, ratio of OSD funding to Service funding, return-on-investment (ROI), degree to which the proposed technology addresses high-cost corrosion problems, potential benefits, joint service applicability, and probability of transition.  Upon acceptance and approval of the projects, funding is distributed to the Military Departments by Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request (MIPR) based on funding priorities associated with the evaluation process results.  Project execution is monitored through submission of quarterly quad charts and by conducting an annual review.   

Research opportunities are funded through the Technical Corrosion Collaboration (TCC).  A call for white paper proposals is issued by CPO through an existing U.S. Air Force Academy (USAFA) Broad Agency Announcement (BAA).  Submissions are evaluated by a technical panel chaired by the Deputy Director, CPO.  Evaluation factors include quality of proposed research, potential impact on DoD corrosion problems, level of student involvement, and proposed collaboration between the research institutions and DoD laboratories.  Projects are ranked by the selection panel and funded based on merit and available funds.  Research institutions receive funds for the TCC through the establishment of cooperative agreements with USAFA.  Research execution is monitored through submission of quarterly quad charts and by conducting an annual review.   

Activities are those work efforts associated with the Working Integrated Product Teams (WIPT) under the CPCIPT and include policy, training, specifications and standards, metrics, science and technology, facilities, and communication and outreach.  WIPT Leads submit funding requirements associated with their annual tactical plan submission to CPO.  The proposed activities are prioritized by CPO and funded based on merit and available funds.  Activities are accomplished by both government and contractor personnel.  Funds are transferred to government personnel through the MIPR process.  Funds are transferred to contractor personnel through competitively awarded contracts including the multiple-award Blanket Purchase Agreement held by CPO.  Progress on activities is reviewed tri-annually at meetings of the CPCIPT.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Strategic Capabilities Office (SCO) identifies, analyzes, demonstrates, and transitions game-changing applications of existing and near-term technology (and other U.S. Government capabilities) to shape and counter emerging threats.  Currently focused on the Asia-Pacific Rebalance, SCO combines capability innovation with concepts of operation and information management to develop novel concepts often crossing Service, Defense-Intelligence, and multi-classification divides.  This helps to solve critical national security challenges in partnership with the Services, Defense Agencies, Combatant Commands (COCOMS), Joint Chiefs of Staff, Intelligence Community, and the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD).  SCO analyzes, demonstrates, and red-teams these concepts on an accelerated time frame to enable subsequent programmatic decisions on alternative capabilities that have greater mission impact and lower cost.

The Advanced Innovative Technologies Program Element (PE) contains projects that include in-depth analysis to determine technical and operational performance and risk, component and subsystem-level prototyping and testing to reduce risk, and operational demonstrations to prove concept viability prior to subsequent programmatic decisions.  Due to the nature of these projects, specific applications and detailed plans are available at a higher classification level.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                    <r2:SummaryExplanation>The program changes are threefold: a continuation of the Land-Based Rail Gun (LBRG) program which had two-year funding (FY 2014 and FY 2015); the
expansion of LBRG to include Land-based and Sea-based powder guns; and the addition of three new projects for SCO. 
1) Funds are provided to both continue the LBRG efforts that began in FY 2014 and expand the program to include Land-based and Sea-based Powder Guns.  This combined program will demonstrate closing the fire control loop between existing sensors and prototype projectiles launched from Railgun and existing powder guns, including Navy's Mk-45 five inch Naval gun and the Army's Paladin 155 millimeter (mm) self-propelled howitzer powder guns.  
2) The Sea Dragon project will integrate an existing weapon system into an existing Navy platform to demonstrate a cost-effective offensive weapon system capability.
3) The Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Payloads project will leverage existing low-cost payloads by integrating them with UAVs (e.g. micro-UAVs) capable of autonomous swarming behaviors.
4) The Sea Mob project, in partnership with the Office of Naval Research (ONR), will develop a group of Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) capable of cooperative swarming behaviors.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Strategic Capabilities Office (SCO) identifies, analyzes, demonstrates, and transitions game-changing applications of existing and near-term technology (and other U.S. Government capabilities) to shape and counter emerging threats.  Currently focused on the Asia-Pacific Rebalance, SCO combines capability innovation with concepts of operation and information management to develop novel concepts often crossing Service, Defense-Intelligence, and multi-classification divides.  SCO helps to solve critical national security challenges in partnership with the Services, Defense Agencies, Combatant Commands (COCOMS), Joint Chiefs of Staff, Intelligence Community, and the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD).  SCO analyzes, demonstrates, and red-teams these concepts on an accelerated time frame to enable subsequent programmatic decisions on alternative capabilities that have greater mission impact and lower cost.

The Advanced Innovative Technologies Program Element (PE) contains projects that include in-depth analysis to determine technical and operational performance and risk, component and subsystem-level prototyping and testing to reduce risk, and operational demonstrations to prove concept viability prior to subsequent programmatic decisions.  Due to the nature of these projects, specific applications and detailed plans are available at a higher classification level.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Title>Land-Based Rail Gun (LBRG) and Land-Based and Sea-Based Powder Guns</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The title of Land-Based Rail Gun (LBRG) has been expanded to account for the inclusion of “Land-and-Sea-Based Powder Guns”, to further enhance base defense capabilities in this PE.  The existing Navy Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Sea-based Railgun program will be leveraged into LBRG and powder gun analysis, prototyping, and experimentation.  Cost-effective, large magazine base defense will be demonstrated by closing the fire control loop between existing sensors and prototype projectiles launched from Railgun and existing powder guns including the Navy’s Mk-45 five inch Naval gun and the Army’s Paladin 155 mm self-propelled howitzer.  To facilitate this, the program will integrate powder guns, the Railgun launcher, power, projectile, and sensor so that projectiles may be command guided during a series of flight tests.  These tests will verify performance and lethality results from modeling and simulation.  Testing will conclude by demonstrating projectile fly-out and control, sensor tracking of projectiles, communication from sensor to projectile, integrated guidance, navigation and control, culminating in FY 2016 live-fire, closed-loop launches from a 20 mega-joule (MJ) Railgun and powder gun, and live-fire tests against live targets in FY 2017.  The intended end-state is a prototype system that retires risks to allow transition of gun based defense to partners: the Missile Defense Agency, the Navy, and, or the Army.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>SCO, in partnership with the Office of Naval Research (ONR), is developing a group of Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) capable of cooperative swarming behaviors.  Building on the successful ONR funded USV swarm demonstration in August 2014, this project seeks to demonstrate the ability to generate common situational awareness among USVs and the communications required for sustaining cooperative behaviors.  More complex demonstrations are planned over the next several years to prove utility of swarming USVs for multiple missions.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Department of Defense (DoD) Unmanned Systems Common Development program is a joint effort to develop and demonstrate common standards, architectures, and technologies that address unmanned systems’ issues across all Military Services.  The intent is to increase interoperability and effectiveness by promoting cooperative development of solutions that are applicable across all unmanned systems.  This effort will initially focus on addressing DoD unmanned aircraft system (UAS)integration into the National Airspace System (NAS) and a demonstration of a common, interoperable ground station architecture and associated interface standards. While UAS initially will be the primary focus, interoperability among all unmanned and manned systems is the long-term goal.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Global Hawk and Triton, as well as other Group 3-5 UAS, need a sense-and-avoid (SAA) capability as an alternate means of compliance to Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 91.111 and Part 91.113, requirement to see-and-avoid other aircraft.  The Air Force is leading the effort to develop an ABSAA system that is suitable to support operations within US and foreign national airspace. The RQ-4 Global Hawk, MQ-4C Triton, MQ-1B Predator, MQ-1C Gray Eagle, and MQ-9 Reaper all have a requirement for SAA capability and will leverage the technology being developed by the Air Force. The Army is leading the development of a GBSAA system using existing technology to provide a near-term solution for improved airspace access, both for terminal operations and for operations/training within the GBSAA system's coverage area (e.g., Gray Eagle at El Mirage, Shadow operations at Cherry Point).
 
This joint funding also supports development of common operating concepts, standards, modeling and simulation, and technology to enable DoD UAS to routinely access the national and international airspace systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This program provides joint funding to accelerate the development of SAA technology and standards to enable UAS to routinely access the national and international airspace systems.  This program also develops UAS airspace integration requirements and standards, as well as supports the modeling, simulation, and operational analysis needed to validate the systems and standards.  In FY 2013 ABSAA and GBSAA efforts transitioned to the Services.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Human Social Culture Behavior (HSCB) Modeling Program is a vertically integrated effort to research, develop, and transition technologies, tools, and systems to programs of record and users in need.  The Program exists to optimize U.S. forces’ ability to perform population-centric sensing, understand behaviors driven by social and cultural variables, and select effective courses of action in the full range of military operations.  Program research will enhance population-centric intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities for understanding the increasingly complex global environment to address national strategic challenges such as instability, aggression, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and violent extremism.  In three integrated program elements (PEs), the Program will conduct applied research, mature and demonstrate advanced technology, and develop transitionable methods, technology, tools, and prototypes.  Work under PE 0604670D8Z will create transition ready software tools that will help intelligence analysts, operations analysts, operations planners, wargamers, and others represent, understand, and forecast sociocultural behavior at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels.  This program focuses on maturing, hardening, and validating human, social, culture, and behavior modeling software for transition to meet the needs of the warfighter, integration into the architectures of existing programs of record, and/or maturing software via open architectures to allow broad systems integration.  The Program provides a development to product transition pathway for sociocultural models, tools, and capabilities to rapidly meet immediate and emerging warfighter needs.  The work supports the testing, validation, and transition of model-based technology into existing and developing systems in coordination with Program Executive Offices or Program Managers, Combatant Commanders, Joint and Service organizations, warfighters in need, and other transition customers.  The Program will mature sociocultural relevant data and tools to provide essential sociocultural understanding and forecasting capabilities at the strategic, operational and tactical levels.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Program will create transition-ready software tools that will help intelligence analysts, operations analysts, operations planners, wargamers, and others represent, understand, and forecast sociocultural behavior at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels.  The Program focuses on maturing, hardening, and validating human, social, culture, and behavior modeling software for transition to meet the needs of the warfighter, integration into the architectures of existing programs of record, and/or maturing software via open architectures to allow broad systems integration.  The Program provides a development to product transition pathway for sociocultural models, tools, and capabilities to rapidly meet immediate and emerging warfighter needs.  The work supports the testing, validation, and transition of model-based technology into existing and developing systems in coordination with Program Executive Offices or Program Managers, Combatant Commanders, Joint and Service organizations, warfighters in need, and other transition customers.  The Program will mature sociocultural relevant data and tools to provide essential forecasting capabilities at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>Funds will be used for research and development in the key areas defined by the Army, Navy, Air Force and various Agencies/Programs within the Office of the Secretary of Defense.  Investments are targeted to defense requirements within the budget year of execution.  For example, in FY 2011-FY 2012, the emphasis was on responding to urgent operational issues in support of ongoing global operations, including Afghanistan.  In FY 2013-FY 2014, requirements migrated to supporting better buying power, providing an avenue for technology innovation and refresh for legacy defense acquisition programs. 
Some capabilities enabled to date include: 1) the Army Advanced Combat Surveillance Kit, a lightweight, low-power sensor for unattended, localization and tracking of dismounts and vehicles in challenging operational environments;  2) the Navy's Port Security Barrier Intrusion Detection System, which uses an optic-electronic alarm and software system that monitors gates to ensure threats cannot exploit undetected gaps;  3) the Air Force Lightweight Tactical Suitcase Portable Receive Suite, which enables deployed military forces to access global broadcast systems for satellite imagery, weather info, map data, classified and unclassified intelligence; and 4) the US Special Operations Command's Multi-Missile Common Launch Tube, which doubles the number of targets that can be engaged from the same platform, with increased precision that minimizes collateral damage.</r2:Text>

FY2015 funds will be distributed evenly between the services (Army, Navy, Air Force) and the 4th estate agencies.</r2:Text>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) addresses the need to defend and deter against weapons of mass destruction (WMD) threats and to safeguard personnel; prevent unauthorized access to equipment, installations, material, and documents; and to safeguard the foregoing against espionage, sabotage, damage, and theft.  This program oversees advanced engineering development throughout DoD for an integrated and systemic RDT&amp;E approach for countering nuclear threats and nuclear and conventional physical security technology and systems.  The funding has been centralized in this Defense-wide PE since the early 1990s and represents a substantial portion of all DoD physical security RDT&amp;E funding.  Priorities for this PE RDT&amp;E efforts are driven by inputs from Quadrennial Defense Review guidance, Combatant Command and Service requirements, analysis reports such as “Protecting the Force:  Lessons from Fort Hood,” January 2010, the Integrated Unit, Base, and Installation Protection Cost Benefits Analysis, Multi-national Work Plans established through the Nuclear Security Summit process, and DoD Directive 5210.41, Security Policy for Protecting Nuclear Weapons-directed requirements and associated security deviation reports.  

Under this integrated approach, funds are used to provide system development and demonstration for the Department in seven capability areas:  (1) Detection and Assessment; (2) Access Controls; (3) Installation and Transport Security; (4) Storage and Safeguards; (5) Prevention; (6) Decision Support Systems; and (7) Analytical Support. The program will develop systems that are producible, supportable, and affordable and to demonstrate system integration, interoperability, and utility prior to full-rate production.  The projects under the PE become technology insertions into existing programs or advance to being a certified Commercial/Government off-the-shelf product.  The PE initiatives are coordinated by the Physical Security Enterprise and Analysis Group.  This group is responsible for avoiding duplication of effort and when applicable ensure systems integration and promote interoperability and sustainability.  

This PE can fund travel to support the requirements of this program.

This appropriation will finance work, including manpower, performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant
arrangement with the government who conduct research (systematic study directed toward fuller scientific knowledge or understanding of the subject studied), 
development (systematic use of the knowledge and understanding gained from research, for the production of useful materials, devices, systems, or methods, including the design and development of prototypes and processes) and test and evaluation efforts.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The Radiological Detection System will provide a ruggedized Radiation Detection, Indication, and Computation for real time gamma radiation monitoring and low energy x-ray, beta, alpha, and neutron detection.

The Joint Personal Dosimeter will provide a joint solution to increase capability and reduce life-cycle costs.

Both systems will address Operation TOMODACHI lessons learned for common, interoperable equipment with adequate sensitivity and common units of measure.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) was established to develop and demonstrate technologies and applications that advance conventional prompt global strike (CPGS) warfighting capabilities. The program uses a national team with participation from the Services, Agencies, national research laboratories, and further involvement of competitive industry.  Program emphasis is on demonstrating component and subsystem technology maturity with risk reduction initiatives highlighted by flight tests.  The program funds the design, development, and experimentation of boosters, payload delivery vehicles (PDVs), non-nuclear warheads, thermal protection systems, guidance systems, test range modernization, and mission planning and enabling capabilities. To support these development activities, the program procures modeling and simulation capabilities, ground testing, command and control interfaces, test range support, and launch system infrastructure.  Additionally, expert resources address strategic policy and treaty issues.  Program timing will be driven by the outcome of flight and ground test events as well as DoD budgets.  In FY 2016, as in previous years, funding for the individual Service initiatives will be contingent upon their abilities to execute and achieve satisfactory progress towards project goals as determined by the CPGS portfolio manager.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>This sub-project develops technologies and applications that could lead to a system with the following characteristics: effects on targets in a very short-period of time from execution order; non-ballistic flight over the majority of the flight path; positive control from launch to impact; adequate cross-range/ maneuverability to avoid overflight issues; controlled stage drop over Broad Ocean Area.  This sub-project also oversees development of non-nuclear warhead technologies to defeat time-sensitive targets for near and longer-term CPGS applications.  The technologies developed will have cross-Service and cross-concept applicability and will be developed through close coordination among DoD components. This activity will support both ground and flight tests, and provide all national data to inform a potential acquisition program.
The objectives of this sub-project are to: 
- Assess boost-glide technologies in light of ground and flight test events and associated modeling and simulation.
- Analyze the military utility of multiple, 3-axis stabilized vehicles performance with respect to thermal protection materials, aerodynamics and control surfaces, navigation, guidance, control (NG&amp;C), boosters, and weapons performance.
- Assess the feasibility of producing an affordable solution to fill the CPGS capability gap.
- Continue systems definition/engineering/development of integrated weaponized payload delivery vehicles and subsystems in order to identify and reduce risks and mature technologies for a potential extended range acquisition program.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) was established to develop and demonstrate technologies and applications that advance conventional prompt global strike (CPGS) warfighting capabilities. The program uses a national team with participation from the Services, Agencies, national research laboratories, and further involvement of  industry.  Program emphasis is on demonstrating component and subsystem technology maturity with risk reduction initiatives highlighted by flight tests.  The program funds the design, development, and experimentation of boosters, payload delivery vehicles (PDVs), non-nuclear warheads, thermal protection systems, guidance systems, test range modernization, and mission planning and enabling capabilities. To support these development activities, the program procures modeling and simulation capabilities, ground testing, command and control interfaces, test range support, and launch system infrastructure.  Additionally, expert resources address strategic policy and treaty issues.  Program timing will be driven by the outcome of flight and ground test events as well as DoD budgets.  In FY 2016, as in previous years, funding for the individual Service initiatives will be contingent upon their abilities to execute and achieve satisfactory progress towards project goals as determined by the CPGS portfolio manager.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>This sub-project will test and evaluate alternative booster and delivery vehicle options and will assess the feasibility of producing an affordable solution to fill the CPGS capability gap.  It will mature technologies that could lead to advanced systems with the following characteristics: effects on targets in a very short-period of time from execution order; non-ballistic flight over the majority of the flight path; positive control from launch to impact; adequate cross-range/maneuverability to avoid over flight issues; and controlled stage drop over Broad Ocean Area.  The technologies developed will have cross-Service and cross-concept applicability and will be developed through close coordination among DoD components.  This activity will support both ground and flight tests, and provide all national data to inform a potential acquisition program.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) was established to develop and demonstrate technologies and applications that advance conventional prompt global strike (CPGS) warfighting capabilities. The program uses a national team with participation from the Services, Agencies, national research laboratories, and further involvement of  industry.  Program emphasis is on demonstrating component and subsystem technology maturity with risk reduction initiatives highlighted by flight tests.  The program funds the design, development, and experimentation of boosters, payload delivery vehicles (PDVs), non-nuclear warheads, thermal protection systems, guidance systems, test range modernization, and mission planning and enabling capabilities. To support these development activities, the program procures modeling and simulation capabilities, ground testing, command and control interfaces, test range support, and launch system infrastructure.  Additionally, expert resources address strategic policy and treaty issues.  Program timing will be driven by the outcome of flight and ground test events as well as DoD budgets.  In FY 2016, as in previous years, funding for the individual Service initiatives will be contingent upon their abilities to execute and achieve satisfactory progress towards project goals as determined by the CPGS portfolio manager.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

In FY 2016, as in previous years, funding for the individual Service initiatives will be contingent upon their abilities to execute and achieve satisfactory progress towards project goals as determined by the CPGS portfolio manager.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Exportability Features (DEF) Program is a result of a USD(AT&amp;L) sponsored legislative proposal for authorities to better prepare warfighting systems for non-US use. This program funds activities to support identification of major defense acquisition programs for possible export, and the planning for design and incorporation of exportability features during research and development of these programs. Features include, but are not limited to, technology and engineering design activity such as capability differentials, anti-tamper, system assurance, and software assurance. Activities include the development of program protection strategies for the program; the design and incorporation of exportability features into the system; implementation of exportability requirements onto contracts; and research, development, test, and evaluation activities. 

Defense exportability features play a critically important role in United States Government/DoD efforts to build partnership capacity.  Funds support building joint and coalition environments by enabling the export of DoD systems to a wide range of partner nations, resulting in improved security and interoperability.  In addition to the operational benefits, by providing these resources up front, then collecting ‘fair share’ non-recurring cost recoupment, the United States and partner nations will save significant resources by more efficiently designing and producing exportable U.S. systems. 

Funding is increased in FY 2016 to support an expansion of the number of designated systems included in the Defense Exportability Pilot Program and the greater costs of designing in technology protection.  A number of designated systems participating in the DEF Pilot Program in FY16 will continue defining and implementing DEF ‘best practices’ related to designing and developing technology protection in the areas of program management, system engineering, and technology protection measures in the DoD acquisition process. Failure to consider export variant designs early in the acquisition process results in increased costs, delayed delivery, and higher risk of  sensitive technology compromise due to ad-hoc sales late in production.  Early development of export variants including systems design approaches to integrate adequate domestic and exportable anti-tamper (AT) protection and differential capability (DC) requirements to lower production costs, increase quality and timely deliveries to allies and friends, and enhance US industry share of the global marketplace.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Defense Exportability Features (DEF) Program is a result of a USD(AT&amp;L) sponsored legislative proposal for authorities to better prepare warfighting systems for non-US use. This program funds activities to support identification of major defense acquisition programs for possible export, and the planning for design and incorporation of exportability features during research and development of these programs. Features include, but are not limited to, technology and engineering design activity such as capability differentials, anti-tamper, system assurance, and software assurance. Activities include the development of program protection strategies for the program; the design and incorporation of exportability features into the system; implementation of exportability requirements onto contracts; and research, development, test, and evaluation activities. 

Defense exportability features play a critically important role in United States Government/DoD efforts to build partnership capacity.  Funds support building joint and coalition environments by enabling the export of DoD systems to a wide range of partner nations, resulting in improved security and interoperability.  In addition to the operational benefits, by providing these resources up front, then collecting ‘fair share’ non-recurring cost recoupment, the United States and partner nations will save significant resources by more efficiently designing and producing exportable U.S. systems.  Incorporation of defense exportability features in initial designs can help control costs throughout the product life cycle.  

Funding in FY 2016 to support systems included in the Defense Exportability Pilot Program that are used to define and implement DEF ‘best practice’ program management, system engineering, and program protection measures in the DoD acquisition process. Failure to consider export variant designs early in the acquisition process results in increased costs, delayed delivery, and higher risk of  sensitive technology compromise due to ad-hoc sales late in production.  Early development of export variants including systems design approaches to integrate adequate domestic and exportable anti-tamper (AT) protection and differential capability (DC) requirements to lower production costs, increase quality and timely deliveries to allies and friends, and enhance US industry share of the global marketplace.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The focus for FY 2015 for the DEF pilot program will be to execute feasibility studies from selected DEF Pilot Programs that have yet to receive DEF funding, and to conduct follow-on DEF design studies on designated DEF pilot programs.  As with the FY 2014 programs, FY 2015 feasibility studies will define the required actions for identifying the feasibility of DEF for programs and beginning DEF designs on select designated programs, and to assess the potential costs of those actions.  OUSD (AT&amp;L) will continue to engage with program offices through the Military Departments, and to serve as a liaison among the program offices, the Military Departments, and other Technology Security and Foreign Disclosure offices to facilitate the feasibility studies.  For pre-MS A and B systems, the DEF feasibility studies will be addressed in the Acquisition Strategy and the Program Protection Plan (PPP).  For Post-MS B platforms, when there is already a contract in place, OUSD (AT&amp;L) will work with the program managers and contracting officers to implement the necessary contractual modifications to ensure that the feasibility studies are executed.</r2:Text>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Department’s budget focuses on institutionalizing and financing our capabilities to fight the wars we are in today and the scenarios we are most likely to face in the years ahead, while at the same time mitigating risk and providing for contingency operations. It also includes a fundamental overhaul of the DoD’s approach to procurement, acquisition, and contracting.  As such, the complex details of budgeting and tracking of funds become increasingly critical to senior leader decision making and to provide accountability to the taxpayer.  Incorporating information technology toward current and emerging business processes manifesting into a state-of-the art system of systems will result in increasing efficiencies, timely diagnostics, and reducing lifecycle costs to maintain, sustain and repair.

Today, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense Comptroller OUSD(C) and the Cost Analysis and Program Evaluation (CAPE) use various distinct automated systems (Comptroller Information System (CIS), Program Resource Collection Process (PRCP), Supplemental Resource Collection Process (SRCP), Budget Exhibits Generator and Standard Data Collection System (SDCS)) to formulate, justify, and execute DoD budgets.  These six or more systems interact with at least several computer-based systems controlled by external organizations and agencies.  These systems manage very similar financial information, yet each uses its own scheme for representing information.  Much of the information managed by these systems is redundant.  Cross-system data representations and redundancies make it difficult to exchange and to reconcile information.  The capabilities provided by Comptroller systems, in some cases, fail to deliver services needed by its users, or fail to operate in ways that complement current and emerging business practices.  They fail to give executives information in a comprehensible form, making it difficult to draw conclusions.  Data disparities and functional redundancy make these systems more costly to maintain than they need to be.

There is a critical need for the development of a state-of-the-art information technology system to modernize and replace multiple, antiquated legacy systems and processes used to formulate, justify, present and defend the entire Department of Defense Budget in the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) (OUSD(C)) to meet Title 10 and Title 31 mission and reporting requirements.  The Comptroller’s plan for mitigating the deficiencies and capability gaps associated with current systems is development of the Next Generation Resource Management System.  

This initiative exploits emerging technology, processes, trends, capabilities, and techniques to incorporate state-of-the-art information technology enabling the ability, agility, and level of fidelity to collect, process, administer and report resource management data and to automate business processes within a more robust analytical environment within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) OUSD(C). Funded efforts will improve the timeliness of resource management reviews and decisions for senior leaders and Congress.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Defense-wide Electronic Procurement Capabilities is designed to provide an avenue for the development of increased e-business capabilities
critical to meet the enterprise-wide needs of the procurement community. The requirement for increased ebusiness capabilities may result from statute, regulation or internal control requirements.  This program provides opportunities for the introduction of innovative, time-saving, and cost-saving technologies into procurement processes across the Department. This RDT&amp;E PE provides resources to conduct software development and testing on new or modified e-business applications to ensure mature system development, integration and demonstration of production representative systems and capabilities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:Text>Continued funding will be used to continue development of an end to end paperless reconciliation process for Government Furnished Property (GFP); continued development of a data standard for warranty information; ensure that contract systems are modified to send data to personnel and readiness systems to account for logical and physical access to DoD systems; and to implement a fraud and misuse data mining detection capability for purchase cards in DoD.  These funds will also be used to develop an initial end to end purchase request data standard process (including intergovernmental transactions).  Additionally, these funds will support development of contingency contracting and financial management business tools for the warfighter that are currently in an immature development stage, or do not exist and to implement initiatives/tools in theater. PB14 adjustments/reductions to include SBIR/STTR were taken in the amount of .525M from the original President's Budget.</r2:Text>

These funds will also be used to strengthen existing vendor identification systems in DoD to combat counterfeiting and cyber intrusion.  Moderate risk will be taken in reducing efforts to support continued development of contingency contracting and financial management business tools for the warfighter that do not exist, rather funds will focus on improving tools currently in immature development stages, and implement those initiatives/tools in theater.  Funds will also focus on developing enterprise mapping capabilities to streamline existing procure to pay exchanges and achieve efficiencies through data standards and auditability in partnership with the Comptroller.</r2:Text>

Low risk adjustments were taken in shifting focus to automating simple contract closeout, and business intelligence capabilities and to mitigate fiscal reductions. Efficiency Reductions for PB16 were taken along with additional PB16 adjustments to a total of 2.205M from the original President's Budget.</r2:Text>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>A key part of DoD’s strategy to meet its energy goals is to develop an energy information management environment that will enable the Services and OSD to track energy production and usage across the real property portfolio.  Information on energy usage is critical for day-to-day management and accountability, troubleshooting building systems, and planning for capital investments.  These funds will support the development and procurement of an enterprise-wide energy data warehouse that will be integrated with existing and future real property systems.  AT&amp;L has already conducted a comprehensive requirements analysis for this prospective warehouse using funds provided through the now-disestablished Business Transformation Agency.  We have defined a standard set of energy information management requirements and are now assessing and planning which information management technologies (future and current) will best support them.  Funding is required to keep this project on track and ensure that the DoD-wide energy management data environment becomes a reality.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Real Property inventory fulfills requirements of Execuitve Order for DOD to achieve and maintain real property accountability.  This is critical both from  audit readiness and program management perspectives.  New policies are in place, but business systems must be modified to support data requirements.  This funding is used to determine requirements for the Department's Real Property inventory records as well as to develop and procure an enterprise wide data warehouse that will be integrated with existing and future energy and real property systems.  This warehouse will collect, maintain, and report on the inventory and assist the Components to implement inventory requirements, including data accuracy and completeness.  Without funding the components will return to services agency centric processes that do not allow for total DOD accountability.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This funding supports Defense Planning Guidance (DPG) directing the Department of Defense (DoD) components to develop guidelines and procedures for a comprehensive readiness reporting system that evaluates readiness on the basis of the actual missions and capabilities assigned to the forces. The Defense Readiness Reporting System (DRRS) establishes a capabilities-based, adaptive, near real-time readiness information system for the DoD. This system is being designed to measure the readiness of military forces and supporting infrastructure to meet missions and goals assigned by the Secretary of Defense. DRRS hosts information and applications used to support the Geographic and Functional Combatant Commanders.

The transformation of readiness reporting into a new, more comprehensive system presents a number of significant challenges. First, there are thousands of new potential reporting entities to include in DRRS, such as Combatant Commands, Joint Task Forces, Services, Active and Reserve component units, installations, depots, ports, and major elements of the industrial base. These entities must not only define and implement reporting based on specific readiness metrics, but they must make their readiness status continuously available in near real time to DRRS. Second, the shift from resource centric readiness reporting to a mission/ capabilities based reporting system oriented towards the National Military Strategy (NMS) makes substantially more complex demands on readiness reporting. DRRS allows the Department to assess readiness globally based on our integrated ability to project and sustain a mix of constructed forces in simultaneous engagements. Finally, the challenges associated with sourcing and evaluating the readiness of our forces engaged in on-going real operations mean that force managers need applications that will query the entire Department for suitable, available organizations to meet current needs. The need for these applications and the underlying data are a top priority for the DRRS project.

The realization of DRRS requires integrating a host of key technologies in order to achieve an information system that supports distributed, collaborative, and dynamic readiness reporting in addition to continuous tool-based assessment. The primary technical goal is the creation of a highly reliable and securely integrated readiness data environment to leverage and extend current readiness information systems. This system is based on intelligent agents, dynamic databases, semantic middleware, and publish/subscribe concepts; providing a logically uniform view into the multiple databases and information sources that feed DRRS. Through this type of advanced information environment, the DRRS dramatically expands the range of readiness information available to manage the force. This environment supports a suite of analysis tools that allow users to explore the consequences of readiness deficiencies in terms of the ability to generate forces and assess transportation feasibility as it pertains to specific scenarios. These tools and tool suites harness the power of the information environment to make possible the kind of quick-turnaround, excursion-driven readiness assessment that is at the heart of DRRS.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Department and acquisition reform initiatives call for top down, national security strategy-driven capabilities-based planning. Department of Defense (DoD) Instruction 5000.02 and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 3170.01 promulgate capabilities-based requirements and acquisition processes. The JSAD program enables collaborative efforts to achieve these goals with a focus on Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAPs). These efforts include warfighting capability-based analyses; assessments of joint capability areas and joint integrating concepts; development of system-related data; integrated roadmaps to support acquisition investment decisions; and assessments of MDAPs in a capability area context.  Activities in the JSAD project are divided into three areas:  (1) capability-based analysis; (2) roadmaps; and (3) support tools and guidance. Capability-based analysis provides analysis of the different technology, functionality, and integration impacts of systems on warfighting capability.  Acquisition roadmaps guide systems development and associated investment plans.  JSAD support tools and guidance initiatives develop systems data, and tools, exploit modeling and simulation and architecture efforts to improve DoD’s overall assessment capability.  These efforts guide the development and improve the testing and fielding of integrated systems of systems in order to achieve Joint mission capabilities.  The Department has also undergone an institutional reorientation or shift in emphasis from organization-specific to enterprise-wide approaches. This means:  (1) horizontal integration within the Department and unity of effort through greater interagency collaboration; (2) engaging in a coordinated and portfolio-based approach to planning, programming, budgeting and execution; and (3) significant reforms at the governance, management and execution levels.  To accomplish this direction, there needs to be a focused goal and concerted emphasis on shifting from systems acquisition to capabilities-based portfolio management (or portfolio systems acquisition).  This program enables collaborative efforts to implement the QDR direction outlined above in order to achieve portfolio systems acquisition goals.  The program is broken up into two focus areas (Portfolio Management and Reform Initiatives).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Departments 2005 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) laid out the need for an institutional reorientation or shift in emphasis from organization-specific to enterprise-wide approaches.  This meant:  (1) horizontal integration within the Department and unity of effort through greater interagency collaboration; (2) engaging in a coordinated and portfolio-based approach to planning, programming, budgeting and execution; and (3) significant reforms at the governance, management and execution levels.  The Department’s 2010 QDR report further addressed reforming how we buy, noting that the conventional acquisition process is too long and too cumbersome to fit the needs of the many systems that require continuous changes and upgrades - a challenge that will become only more pressing over time. The Department will improve how it matches requirements with mature technologies, maintains disciplined systems engineering approaches.  To accomplish this direction, there needed to be a focused goal and concerted emphasis on shifting from acquisition of individual systems to portfolio management (or portfolio systems acquisition).  This program enables collaborative efforts to implement the QDR direction outlined above and to achieve portfolio systems acquisition goals and to develop and implement acquisition reform initiatives.  The program is broken up into two focus areas (Portfolio Management and Reform Initiatives) and consolidates work previously performed under various other Program Elements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Since its inception in FY 1990, this program element has been used to fund the development of critically needed, high priority Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) capabilities for joint/multi-Service requirements.  The Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program (CTEIP) uses a corporate investment approach to combine Service, Defense, and other government agencies T&amp;E needs, maximize opportunities for joint efforts, and avoid unwarranted duplication of test capabilities.  CTEIP focuses investments on projects that will have high productivity returns on investment.  Projects under the CTEIP Program Element (PE) support two basic tasks: investments to improve the test capabilities base (Joint Improvement and Modernization (JIM) projects) and development of near-term solutions to test capability shortfalls in support of ongoing operational test programs (Resource Enhancement Project (REP)).

    The JIM funds critically needed T&amp;E investments in the major functional areas of: air combat; armament and munitions; Command, Control Communication, Computer and Intelligence (C4I) and networks; common range instrumentation; electronic combat; land combat; sea combat; space combat; target systems; and test environments.  Examples of project subject matter include: highly accurate time-space-position information, network enhanced telemetry, miniaturized flight safety systems, realistic urban test environments, ground testing for hypersonic systems and satellites, and end-to-end testing of infrared countermeasure systems.  CTEIP continues as the focal point for fostering common architectures throughout the test and training communities to enhance the sharing of resources and links between test and training ranges.

   CTEIP has provided special focus to institutionalize the use of modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) as a practical test tool; to link ranges through internetting to enhance inter-range and inter-Service cooperation and resource sharing; and, to ensure development and acquisition of common instrumentation necessary for a more efficient test infrastructure.

   Analyses of alternative solutions are conducted for each investment project to validate T&amp;E requirements, to define integrated support systems, and to determine overall cost effectiveness of the proposed test investments.  The use of Department of Defense (DoD)-wide criteria for requirement validation, prioritization, and risk assessment ensures an effective test resource investment program.

The REP funds development of near-term solutions for critical ongoing operational tests supporting decisions on major, high priority defense acquisition programs.  These unanticipated operational test (OT) capability requirements arise from several sources such as a new threat system identified during OT planning, acquisition of foreign military assets that are critical in determining weapon system operational effectiveness, short timelines between system design maturity and scheduled OT, and emerging technologies and test requirements resulting from operational concept changes mandated by Congress or Director, Operational Test &amp; Evaluation (DOT&amp;E), or system-of-systems testing.  Funding these activities under the CTEIP provides the opportunity to coordinate and integrate these near-term test requirements with the total DoD test and evaluation investment planning, and ensures their availability and legacy for other programs that may have similar testing requirements.

   This Research Category 6.4 PE includes special studies, analyses, and strategic planning related to test capabilities and infrastructure, and supports the development and application of proven technologies to provide major test and evaluation capabilities required to meet DoD component weapon system test requirements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Joint Mission Environment Test Capability (JMETC) program was established for the purpose of implementing the Department’s strategy to move to an enterprise-centric, distributed test capability that results in acquisition systems fielded with enhanced joint capabilities, reduced program costs, and improved acquisition timelines.  The JMETC program implements the infrastructure capabilities defined in the Department of Defense’s “Testing in a Joint Environment Roadmap” to provide acquisition program managers a robust nation-wide capability to “test like we fight.”  JMETC provides a persistent, distributed test and evaluation (T&amp;E) capability; supporting system development, interoperability testing, and cyber testing; that otherwise would not be readily available to Service/Component acquisition programs.  The JMETC program is funded within the Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) Management Support Budget Activity because it is intended to provide test capability in support of RDT&amp;E programs. By linking distributed facilities, JMETC allows acquisition programs to efficiently evaluate their warfighting capability in a realistic joint mission environment.  This enables a customer-defined joint mission test environment for systems engineering and testing, extensible to training and experimentation, in a timely and cost effective manner.

On October 1, 2012, the Under Secretary Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (USD(AT&amp;L)) directed Test Resource Management Center (TRMC) to take responsibility for operations and resources of the National Cyber Range (NCR).  TRMC undertook management oversight of the NCR, including all operational activities and sustainment of resources, transitioning it from a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Science &amp; Technology project to an operational capability supporting cyber test, experimentation, and training events. The NCR mission is to provide secure facilities, technology, processes, and workforce to rapidly create hi-fidelity, mission representative cyberspace environments and facilitate integration/federation of cyberspace T&amp;E infrastructure in support of the TRMC Mission.  In FY-14 the NCR demonstrated robust operational capability supporting 20 different events for a diverse set of customers including US Cyber Command, Joint Staff J-7, Director, Operational Test &amp; Evaluation (DOT&amp;E) and US Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR). The NCR was critical to the successful execution of CyberFlag 14-1, CyberGuard 14-1, 14-2 and 14-3 and just completed CyberFlag 15-1 in the 1QFY15. In 3QFY14 the NCR team executed the first Cybersecurity Developmental Test &amp; Evaluation (DT&amp;E) event supporting a Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP), the MQ-4C Triton Program. In the 1QFY-15 the NCR executed a second MDAP Cybersecurity DT&amp;E Event in support of the P-8A Increment Three. In FY-15, a Systems of Systems Cybersecurity DT&amp;E Event will be conducted involving triton, the P-8A and Tactical Mobile (TACMobile) Program. Additional events are planned in support of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE), F-35 (Re-programming Center West) Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC) Mission Space (JMS) Program and other acquisition and operational customers. Concurrent with these NCR Events are engineering activities to sustain and upgrade NCR Computing Resources, improve the automated software tool suite and improve operational capabilities to satisfy increasing customer demand.      

The Test Resource Management Center (TRMC) is the Department’s lead for the JMETC program, the National Cyber Range, and oversees both their development and operations.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The JMETC mission is to provide an enterprise-level, persistent capability for linking distributed facilities, enabling Department of Defense (DoD) customers to develop and test warfighting capabilities in a Joint Context. JMETC provides a test infrastructure consisting of the components necessary to conduct Joint distributed test events by cost-effectively integrating live, virtual, and constructive (LVC) test resources that are configured to support the users' needs.  The JMETC program provides its customers a support team to assist with JMETC products and the conduct of distributed testing.  JMETC’s institutional funding builds, maintains, and operates the JMETC infrastructure and pays for persistent availability of national connectivity for testing; data communications middleware; identification and development of interface standards; common software tools and components; and a reuse repository.  JMETC Program funding also provides JMETC program management, facilities, equipment, operating costs, and special studies and analysis related to distributed test capabilities and infrastructure.  Key attributes of the JMETC include:  persistency; interoperability; reuse; various combinations of distributed capabilities (reconfigurable infrastructure to meet customer requirements); modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) linkage; Live-Virtual-Constructive (LVC) test resource integration; and distributed test support to satisfy both Service and Joint needs.  System engineering, training, and experimentation all benefit from a corporate JMETC developed for T&amp;E.  JMETC has grown from four sites in 2007 to 77 sites, 12 peering points to other networks, and an additional 12 planned sites.  JMETC will reduce the cost and time to plan and prepare for distributed joint testing by providing a readily-available, persistent connectivity with network security accreditation support, common integration software for linking sites, and accredited test tools for distributed testing. To support its customers, JMETC also provides extensive expertise in planning, preparing for, and executing the infrastructure for distributed test events.  In the past year, JMETC has used this expertise and infrastructure to support over 65 customer events.
Additionally in FY 2013, the JMETC PE was funded to develop and build the Regional Service Deliver Points (RSDP).  The RSDPs are a set of distributed computing and storage platforms designed to efficiently meet DoD capacity and capability demands for distributed and cyber test and evaluation (T&amp;E) requirements as part of the Test Resource Management Center (TRMC).  They provide services (i.e. traffic generation, simulation, instrumentation, visualization, and integrated event management), a scalable architecture to increase capacity and capabilities as needed by the user community, a flexible and adaptable infrastructure to support users requirements which are prone to frequent change, and to deliver cost and performance efficiencies (virtualization, rapid reconstitution).  At a high-level architecture view, the RSDP adds enterprise compute and storage resources as well as a platform for distributed and cyber T&amp;E tools and services at multiple classifications necessary to create high fidelity, operationally representative virtual environments, previously unavailable.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>In FY 2013, responsibility for the National Cyber Range (NCR) was given to the Test Resource Management Center (TRMC) and subsequently put under the Joint Mission Environment Test Capability (JMETC) management team.  The NCR was funded in FY 2013 through funds provided by Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), Director, Operational Test &amp; Evaluation (DOT&amp;E), Assistant Secretary of Defense (Research &amp; Engineering)(ASD(R&amp;E)) reprogramming, and the TRMC investment programs.  In FY 2014, the NCR was funded from the JMETC Program Element.  The NCR provides secure facilities, technology, processes, and workforce to rapidly create hi-fidelity, mission representative cyberspace environments and facilitate integration/federation of cyberspace test and evaluation (T&amp;E) infrastructure in support of the TRMC Mission.  It supports a diverse user base and accommodates a wide variety of event types (R&amp;D, Developmental Test &amp; Evaluation (DT&amp;E), Operational Test &amp; Evaluation (OT&amp;E), Security Control Assessor (SCA)  Compliance, Defensive Cyber Operations (DCO), Offensive Cyber Operations (OCO), Tactics, Techniques Procedures (TTP) Development, Forensics/Malware Analysis) and communities (research, systems engineering, testing, operations, training, etc.).  The NCR has the capability to support up to 4 concurrent events at different classification levels using Multiple Independent Levels of Security (MILS) architecture.  It is accredited to operate at TS//SI-G/TK/HCS-P//SAR.  In support of a variety of customers, the NCR has emulated complex (Red/Blue/Gray) operationally representative network environments at a scale up to ~50K high-fidelity virtual nodes.  The NCR can operate in conjunction with other ranges through remote connectivity via JMETC connectivity infrastructure.  The NCR’s Test Automation Tools minimize human error, enable verification of test environment, ensure repeatable results and can reduce event timelines from weeks/months to hours/days.  Range assets can be sanitized after exposure to malicious attacks/malware to restore exposed systems to a known, clean state.

The JMETC-funded National Cyber Range allows acquisition programs and operational forces to efficiently evaluate their cyber warfighting capability in a realistic joint mission environment.  This enables a customer-defined joint mission test environment for systems engineering and testing, extensible to training and experimentation, in a timely and cost effective manner.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

In FY-14 the NCR demonstrated robust operational capability supporting 20 different events for a diverse set of customers including US Cyber Command, Joint Staff J-7, DOT&amp;E and NAVAIR. The NCR was critical to the successful execution of CyberFlag 14-1, CyberGuard 14-1, 14-2 and 14-3. In 3QFY14 the NCR team executed the first Cybersecurity DT&amp;E event supporting an MDAP Acquisition Program, the MQ-4C Triton Program. The NCR was utilized at 82% of available capacity for FY 2014. In the 4QFY14 and 1QFY15 the NCR was utilized at 98% of available capacity.   

- Completed the NCR tools study to evaluate NCR tools for expansion for enterprise use. The NCR Test Specification Tool should be modified to receive input from multiple formats and sources and then output in a standard data format to make it usable on all Cyber Ranges. Near term focus was Interoperability with the RSDPs.  

- Completed plans to sustain the NCR Security Posture in accordance with the DIA Approved POA&amp;M. Work will commence in 1QFY15 to be completed by the end of the quarter.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program is a key source of funding for the Office of the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Staff to manage studies, analysis, management, and technical support efforts strategically to improve and support policy development, decision making, management and administration of DoD programs and activities. Studies and analysis will examine current and alternative policies, plans, operations, strategies and budgets, providing essential means for managing and responding to the ever-changing complex international, political, technological, economic, military, and acquisition environments in which national security planning decisions are made.  Independent analyses from subject matter experts are instrumental for senior defense planners in making informed choices regarding requirements for force planning and strategic deployment of assets taking into account technological challenges and resource constraints, and there is a strong need to incorporate the effects of operational analysis in force planning assessments. With the expanding complexities of security threats in the geopolitical environment, the need for objective analysis and forward looking planning for the mid and long-term is vital.

This program conducts approximately seventy-five actions per fiscal year to support a wide variety of national security goals of the Department and is designed to encourage a collaborative research approach among the components of OSD and the Joint Staff.  The research and study projects supported by this program are closely integrated with the strategic goals of the Department of Defense.  The focus of studies varies across a wide spectrum including weapons systems cost analysis, strengthening and leveraging alliances, human resource and military personnel management, examination of innovative technologies, application of technology to operational doctrine, and many other issues of emerging importance.  Most of the actions are long to intermediate-range in outlook, and the program allows organizational leaders to plan and guide their research toward meeting their highest-priority goals and other high-level guidance such as executive branch performance management objectives, the Quadrennial Defense Review, and the National Security Strategy of the United States of America.

In following the program efficiencies guidance of the Secretary of Defense, the scope of studies and analyses has been limited as necessary in order to focus upon issues of the highest strategic importance to the Department of Defense while continuing to make every effort to support requirements from legislative direction.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

The FCTs enhance interoperability, facilitate international collaboration, expand opportunities for prototyping and enable more efficient and affordable transition of technologies into acquisition programs of record.  Authorized by Title 10, U.S. Code, Section 2350a(g), the FCT program is managed by the Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD), Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (DASD) Emerging Capability &amp; Prototyping (EC&amp;P), Comparative Technology Office (CTO).  The FCT projects are sponsored by the Department, Services and U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM).  Evaluation processes for project selection include a detailed review to confirm the proposed item addresses valid requirements, a thorough market survey, and development of a viable acquisition strategy.  

The FCT program is a catalyst for teaming and other business relationships between foreign and U.S. industries.  Many successful FCT projects result in the licensed production of the qualified foreign item in the U.S. Other nations recognize the long-term value of such practices for competing in the U.S. defense market and the resultant strengthening of the "two-way street" in Defense procurement.  The end result often translates to the creation of jobs and contributions to local economies throughout the United States.  To date, companies across 34 states benefited from FCT projects.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The DASD(SE) develops policies and guidance for (1) the use of systems engineering principles and best practices; (2) the use of systems and software engineering planning and contracting approaches to enhance reliability, availability, and maintainability on major defense acquisition programs (MDAPs); (3) the systems engineering plans (SEPs) for MDAPs including software, and systems engineering considerations in support of lifecycle management and sustainability; and (4) the inclusion of provisions relating to systems engineering and reliability in requests for proposals.  The DASD(SE) reviews and approves the SEP for each MDAP, and monitors and reviews the systems engineering and development planning activities of MDAPs and other defense acquisition programs, as directed by the Secretary of Defense or the USD(AT&amp;L).  Based on the DASD(SE)’s continuous program engagement, the DASD(SE) advises and makes recommendations to the Secretary of Defense and the USD(AT&amp;L) regarding systems engineering, development planning and the execution of these activities.  As a member of the Defense Acquisition Board (DAB), the DASD(SE) provides independent assessments of defense acquisition program’s systems engineering, development planning, technical execution, and risk.  The DASD(SE) also provides input on the inclusion of systems engineering requirements as part of the Joint Requirements Oversight Council's process for joint military requirements, to include developing specific inputs relating to each capabilities development document.

The DASD(SE) issues guidance to, and consults with, the Services and Agencies with respect to systems engineering in the Department.  DASD(SE) provides advocacy, oversight, and guidance to elements of the acquisition workforce responsible for systems engineering, development planning, lifecycle management and sustainability functions, and developing policies and guidance for the integration of specialty engineering functions.  

The DASD(SE) periodically reviews the organizations and capabilities of the military departments with respect to systems engineering, development planning, and lifecycle management and sustainability, and identifies needed changes or improvements to such organizations and capabilities.  The DASD(SE) prepares and submits an annual report to Congress on systems engineering activities and effectiveness.

This PE includes efforts by the office of the DASD(SE) in implementing the Department’s Trusted Defense System Strategy.  Specifically, the PE will develop and mature the critical sub discipline of systems engineering - system security engineering and the Comprehensive Program Protection Planning process that implements a risk-based approach to protection of critical technology, components, and information in acquisition programs.  This includes study and maturation of policy, guidance, and School of Science and Engineering (SSE) discipline fundamentals such as engineering methods, tools, and best practices.  These activities will be promulgated in defense acquisition as a fundamental element of DASD(SE) systems engineering and technical reviews.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Department of Defense (DoD) must address cyber security and supply chain risks to DoD networks, weapons systems, and information stored and processed on both DoD and Defense Industrial Base (DIB) unclassified networks that support DoD programs.  Increased reliance on the internet as a vehicle for sharing information, globalization of the supply chain, and advanced persistent threats (APTs) that can evade commercially available security tools and defeat generic security best practices, drive the need for better and smarter program protection planning and execution.  Comprehensive Program Protection Planning links high level policies and practical expertise to specific acquisition practices, systems engineering activities, and risk reduction activities.  Through this initiative the Department will pilot activities with the DIB to reduce risks in sharing and storing critical program information, better understand and mitigate supply chain risks, improve program protection planning, and improve and streamline program protection engineering.  Activities carried out support implementation of DoD Directive 5200.44 Trusted Systems and Networks with the use of proven mitigation techniques and tools, the ongoing refinement of risk management processes, and creation of needed technology.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The purpose of the Nuclear Matters program is to sustain the U.S. nuclear deterrent posture, counter nuclear threats, and to develop nuclear and conventional physical security equipment. The funds for this program are used to support research, development, test and evaluation efforts as well as studies and analyses for nuclear weapons security; use control; nuclear weapons stockpile safety, survivability and performance; countering nuclear threats and office management.  Funds are also used to develop and implement plans for stockpile transformation; infrastructure analyses and assessments; DoD-NNSA Nuclear Weapons Council activities, as mandated by Title 10 USC, section 179; radiological and nuclear emergency response efforts; and management of international programs of nuclear cooperation, particularly with respect to enhancing international nuclear safety and security and office management.  Nuclear Matters is also responsible for policy development and implementation for personnel reliability; nuclear weapons, nuclear command and control, and special nuclear materials security; use control; nuclear weapons transportation; physical security equipment; countering nuclear threats; and nuclear and radiological incident response.

This Program Element can fund travel to support the requirements of this program.

This appropriation will finance work, including manpower, performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant arrangement with the government who conduct research (systematic study directed toward fuller scientific knowledge or understanding of the subject studied), development (systematic use of the knowledge and understanding gained from research, for the production of useful materials, devices, systems, or methods, including the design and development of prototypes and processes) and test and evaluation efforts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

There's increased risk, absent nuclear testing, in assuring long-term safety and reliability of today’s aging stockpile—the legacy warheads left over from the Cold War.  Today’s nuclear weapons complex is not sufficiently “responsive” to technical problems in the stockpile, or to potential emerging threats.  The task is to ensure the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile and supporting infrastructure, meets long-term national security needs.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Defense Architecture Support includes development, analysis, testing and evaluation of DoD IT Enterprise and solution architecture products.  This work includes improvements to processes that support the Department’s enterprise architecture (EA) registry, catalog and navigation map called the DoD Architecture Registry System (DARS). DARS serves as the Department’s primary catalog of architecture data holdings and provides users the ability to register holdings metadata and search, retrieve, and use DoD architecture data in federated architecture data repositories across DoD.  It provides a key component of the Department’s net-centric data management capability by federating EA data across the Department.  It also enables alignment of program architecture components with the Federal Enterprise Architecture Business Reference Model - consistent with OMB directives for exhibit 300s - via the DoD Business Reference Model.  DARS implements a federated search capability and metadata catalog that will interoperate with the Department’s Net-Centric Enterprise Discovery Service and enterprise content metadata catalog.  Architecture metadata is searchable using the DARS federated discovery web service.  The discovery search results provide links to architecture data that is retrievable based on user roles and access permissions.  Implementations are accessible on both the NIPRNET (unclassified) and SIPRNET (Collateral Classified).  Key features of the DARS program focus on: (1) Making architecture data visible, accessible, trusted, understandable, and interoperable (2) enabling reuse of validated architecture data to build “composite” integrated architectures; (3) enabling architecture analysis; and, (4) integrating architecture data into the DoD mainstream decision-making processes.  The Department of the Air Force, Army, and Navy CIO’s are collaborating in the development of DARS federation web services via the Federated Joint Architecture Working Group under the auspices of the DoD Enterprise Architecture Summit to ensure DoD-wide access to and usability of all components of the composite DoD enterprise architecture model.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The NMO serves as the single point of contact within the Department for policy, long-range plans, programs and budget, integrated mission advocacy, and management of decision-maker capabilities.  NMO’s objective is to ensure capabilities are in place to provide complete and timely situational awareness and decision tools for senior decision-makers.  Additionally, the NMO assists the DoD CIO as the Executive Agent and primary OSD advocate for the White House Military Office with oversight of a wide range of DoD command and control and communications (C3) assets and oversees the efforts of the Services and Agencies in the design, integration, and deployment of critical and sensitive C3 capabilities.  Three overall areas of focus include: 1) National Senior Leader C3 Systems, National Security/Emergency Preparedness (NS/EP), DoD support to Civil Authorities; Continuity of Government (COG); 2) Nuclear C2, Integrated Missile Defense, Tactical Warning, Global Strike; and 3) Cyber Mission Indications and Warnings.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The ISR Metrics Initiative has developed, expanded, and enhanced a prototype framework to ingest and process asset allocation, requirement, tasking and post-mission artifacts and has collected sensor data and analyst intelligence products in order to provide semi-automated assessments for CENTCOM/Joint Intel Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Assessments (CCJ2-ISRA) analysts. Through the use of state-of-the-art semantic processing and advanced techniques in computer data analysis, human-generated semi-structured employment artifacts have been compared to collected sensor data in order to adjudicate the collection effectiveness across required time, area, and intended utility for multiple sensor modalities. Resultant metrics and associated metadata have been stored in an enterprise database, which can be exported to support both current and future analyses. 

The S&amp;T Advisor provides expert engineering and technical assessments on a wide range of ISR topics, establishes and maintains interfaces with the senior scientific and technical directorates within USD(I), the military services and the Combat Support Agencies and integrates ISR Operations technology roadmaps with related program plans and initiatives.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>(U) The SBIR/STTR Program is executed in three phases. The purpose of Phase I is to determine, insofar as possible, the scientific technical and commercial merit, and feasibility of ideas submitted under the SBIR/STTR Program. Phase II awards are made to firms that have been awarded a Phase I contract on the basis of the results of their Phase I effort and the scientific, technical, and commercial merit of the Phase II proposal. Phase II is the principal research or research and development effort and is expected to produce a well-defined deliverable prototype. Phase III SBIR/STTR efforts derive from, extend or conclude Phase I or Phase II efforts, and are not funded with SBIR/STTR funds. Under Phase III, companies participating in the SBIR/STTR Program are expected to obtain funding from the private sector and/or non-SBIR/STTR government sources to develop the prototype into a viable product or non-R&amp;D service for sale in military and/or private sector markets.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The DoD Office of Small Business Programs is tasked with providing Departmental SBIR/STTR policy guidance, oversight and implementation and therefore requires program element (PE) 0605790D8Z to fund these administrative activities. In addition to funding costs for program administration, coordination and execution, PE 0605790D8Z funds essential elements of the SBIR/STTR Program that are required by law including: 
(1) Coordinate and execute the administrative portions of the DoD SBIR/STTR Programs including the development of technical topics, preparation of SBIR/STTR R&amp;D solicitations and receipt of proposal responses; 
(2) Maintain and modify automated processes across the entire SBIR/STTR lifecycle including the development and maintenance of information systems and software required for the measurement, evaluation, and effective management of the Department's SBIR/STTR Programs; 
(3) Implement an aggressive outreach program including the execution of two National conferences and outreach to small technology companies, potential investors in such companies, SDBs, WOSBs, Institutions of Higher Learning, underrepresented states, and others, to facilitate participation in the SBIR/STTR Programs; 
(4) Coordinate oversight, collect results, track execution and provide reporting of Phase II technology transition in the DoD SBIR Commercialization Readiness Program (CRP); and 
(5) Prepare all reports mandated by law and policy.</r2:Description>

Specifically, DoD OSBP provided policy guidance and program oversight for the execution of 19 DoD Component SBIR/STTR budgets.   Additional accomplishments include:
(1) Coordinated and executed all required administrative functions of the DoD SBIR/STTR Programs including the development of technical topics, preparation of SBIR/STTR R&amp;D solicitations, and receipt of proposal responses; 
(2) Developed new DoD outreach and commercialization Program Management Plans (PMP); initiated a DoD outreach working group targeted at increasing SBIR/STTR outreach to underrepresented states;
(3) Created and implemented new SBIR/STTR automated waivers, forms and notifications system; created and documented new and existing SBIR/STTR processes such as transition benchmarking, topic generation and solicitation process efficiencies which resulted in a reduction of this timeline by 125 days annually;
(4) Standardized transition planning tools and processes to increase the rate of transition of SBIR/STTR developed technologies into Programs of Record (POR) and fielded systems;
(5) Conducted a gap analysis for missing, congressionally required statistical data; incorporated new data collection fields and worked closely with Small Business Administration (SBA) to ensure those fields were included in the annual SBIR and STTR reports to Congress.</r2:Text>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD(R&amp;E)) is the principal staff advisor to the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (USD(AT&amp;L)) and the Secretary and Deputy Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (R&amp;E) matters.  In this capacity, the ASD(R&amp;E) has the responsibility to conduct analyses and studies; develop policies; provide technical leadership, oversight and advice; make recommendations; and issue guidance for Department of Defense (DoD) R&amp;E programs.  Additionally, the ASD(R&amp;E) provides technical support to the USD(AT&amp;L) on R&amp;E aspects of programs subject to review by the Defense Acquisition Board, to include assessments of technology maturity consistent with DoD acquisition policy.  The mission of the DoD R&amp;E program is to create, demonstrate, prototype, and apply technology that enables affordable and decisive military superiority.  Pursuing the R&amp;E mission requires attention to:  (1) identification and development of new technological opportunities; (2) insertion of new technologies into warfighting systems and operations; and (3) management and evaluation of the effectiveness of technology programs.  This program element (PE) provides mission support to the Office of the ASD(R&amp;E) (OASD(R&amp;E)) covering a wide range of studies and analysis in support of the R&amp;E program and it impacts to the Department's decision to fund Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) efforts.  

The PE provides funding for the Defense Laboratory Office within the ASD(R&amp;E).  The Defense Laboratory Office advocates and invests in the DoD laboratory system in three areas:  (1) facilities and infrastructure; (2) quality of workforce; and (3) global insight of critical or strategic technologies important to the Department and the Nation.

The PE provides engineering, scientific, and analytical support to the ASD(R&amp;E) in its responsibility for direction, overall quality, and content of the science and technology (S&amp;T) program.  Ensures that the technology being developed is affordable and minimizes system development risk.  The Defense Technology Analysis program conducts assessments and analysis, to ensure maximum utilization of research and development funds, to accomplish the overall objectives of the S&amp;T program.  Funds are required for technical, analytical and management support, equipment and supplies, travel, and publications.

The DoD's key expertise for reviewing and guiding R&amp;E programs resides in the ASD(R&amp;E).  The ASD(R&amp;E) staff augment their responsibilities through their connections to technology experts in various fields throughout academia, industry, and government.  The Defense Support Teams project supports the directed responsibilities by building teams of technology experts to conduct program technical assessments.  The teams analyze the key engineering problem areas and offer adjustments in the development and test plan; alternate technical approaches; or new technologies that could enable successful development.  The teams provide unbiased reviews and gather advice from the Nation's leading technical experts.

The PE provides funding for Critical Technology Assessments within ASD(R&amp;E).  Critical Technology Assessments provide the technical reference guidance in support of development and implementation of DoD technology security policies on international transfers of defense related goods, services, and technologies.  The program provides an ongoing assessment and analysis of global goods and technologies; determines significant advances in the development, production, and use of military capabilities by potential adversaries; and determines goods and technologies being developed worldwide with potential to significantly enhance or degrade U.S. military capabilities in the future.  

This PE also provides funding for the Data Vulnerability Tiger Team to establish a joint analysis capability to conduct comprehensive assessments of unclassified information losses, engaging acquisition and intelligence sources to determine consequences and appropriate preventative/mitigation actions.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Most DoD technical information resides on unclassified networks where it is at risk of being targeted for cyber espionage campaigns.  Protecting DoD unclassified controlled technical information is a high priority for the Department and is critical to preserving intellectual property and competitive capabilities of our national industrial base.  To maintain full confidence in our systems, the Department must also assess the effect the loss of this information has on our warfighting capabilities.  DoD contractors who produce or access controlled technical information must incorporate security standards on their networks, and report cyber-intrusion incidents that result in the loss of this information.  These requirements are important, but insufficient in the face of a determined adversary.  The Department must take steps to understand the impacts of losses and rethink how we safeguard our capabilities.  This information, while unclassified, includes data and intellectual property concerning defense systems requirements, concepts of operations, technologies, designs, engineering, systems production and component manufacturing.

This project supports protection of unclassified controlled technical information and analysis of losses to determine consequences and appropriate requirements, acquisition, programmatic, and strategic courses of action.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides for the assessment of the Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&amp;E) efforts of each Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP), Major 
Automated Information System (MAIS), and Special Interest (SI) acquisition programs as designated by USD(AT&amp;L).  It also provides for the assessment of DT&amp;E capabilities of the Military Departments and DoD Components, oversees the Test &amp; Evaluation (T&amp;E) career field of the defense acquisition workforce, develops policy and guidance for the conduct of DT&amp;E within DoD, and produces the annual DT&amp;E report to Congress.  Specific activities include the following:

- Work with MDAP/MAIS/SI Program Managers, Chief Developmental Testers, and Lead DT&amp;E Organizations to develop a comprehensive DT&amp;E strategy that supports acquisition decision milestones.  Ensure that the test strategy beginning at Milestone A, is documented in the Test and Evaluation Master Plans (TEMPs).  The Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (DASD) DT&amp;E also approves or disapproves the developmental test and evaluation plans in the TEMPs.
- Coordinate with the Director of Systems Engineering (SE) to ensure that the DT&amp;E activities of the DoD are fully integrated into, and consistent with, the SE and development planning processes of the Department.
- Provide formal DT&amp;E Assessments prior to major milestone decisions to inform the acquisition decision-makers on the readiness of programs to release the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Request For Proposal (RFP) pre Milestone B, and begin production, Milestone C, with the goal of reducing discovery of performance issues later in the acquisition cycle. 
- Participate in Nunn-McCurdy certification review teams.
- Develop policy and guidance to ensure efficient and effective DT&amp;E across DoD, including policy and guidance for developmental testing of interoperability and

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program supports the Office of the Director, Cost Assessment &amp; Program Evaluation (CAPE).  It funds assessments that help to resolve budget and programmatic issues across the full range of the Department’s activities.  Projects that support this effort help to inform the leadership on program alternatives, capability concept development, design and cost, the appropriate balance of capabilities across the force, and also to identify how well the Department’s expenditures are meeting its goals, and how well the force can implement the Defense strategy.

This program provides for analytical research across a spectrum of  issues and concerns.  The research agenda is focused on near to long-term problems identified by the Secretary of Defense, and addresses difficult and complex questions linked to program alternatives for current and future capabilities and forces in order to enhance the senior leadership's deliberations and decision-making.

This program provides the scientific and technical engineering services needed for research studies in the development of models and simulations and the evaluation of current analytical tools and scientific methods used to evaluate and assess weapons systems and warfighting capabilities for warfighting environments and scenarios, and related force structure.  Deliverables from this program will include reports, briefings, and analyses designed to illuminate critical issues facing the Department.  Outcomes include recommendations for new modeling techniques, programmatic alternatives, and scenario development.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The following metrics are based on the ROI of RDT&amp;E investments and provide assessment to meeting:
1) operational requirements for OPSEC capabilities, 2) technical requirements for successful engineering, and 3) programmatic requirements for sustaining RDT&amp;E
successes across the Department:

-- Seventy percent of evaluations and tests on engineered prototypes and next generation capabilities address Combatant Command and/or DoD Component requirements. The remaining thirty percent serve as the pivot to improve service level operational capabilities or to address alternate technologies. 
- One hundred percent of completed prototype development includes affiliated specifications, architecture, raw material inventories and documentation. They are maintained in a centralized database repository used to support feedback and future efforts.
- Fifty percent of prototypes and next generation capabilities transition into DoD Component Program Management Offices and Program Executive Offices to fulfill DOD urgent needs, while the remaining fifty percent are reviewed for alternative operational utility and sent to the appropriate Service or Agency for application.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

• Adhere to guidance outlined in DoD 5000, Directive 7, Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), and FAR Supplement Policies and Procedures.
• Acquire and sustain MILDEC capabilities, systems, tools, products and services through a disciplined, yet agile, process that ensures information related capabilities are available for Department of Defense (DoD) components.
• Sustain an acquisition process that is responsive and responsible to internal and external customers and stakeholders.
• Continue to support the warfighter’s need for capabilities that dominate today’s dynamic, networked battlespace by providing governance, oversight and strategy across the DoD for the planning and execution of MILDEC activities.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>RDT&amp;E Performance metrics are among the metrics used to establish the baseline and assess progress toward revitalization of MILDEC capabilities and capacities across the Department of Defense’s assigned responsibilities. The following metrics are based on the ROI of RDT&amp;E investments and provide assessment to meeting:
1) operational requirements for MILDEC capabilities, 2) technical requirements for successful engineering, and 3) programmatic requirements for sustaining RDT&amp;E
successes across the Department:

Performance metrics are measured through an increase of MILDEC capability and capacity as demonstrated by the following:
- Seventy percent of evaluations and tests on engineered prototypes and next generation capabilities address Combatant Command and/or DoD Component requirements. The remaining thirty percent serve as the pivot to improve service level operational capabilities or to address alternate technologies. 
- One hundred percent of completed prototype development includes affiliated specifications, architecture, raw material inventories and documentation. They are maintained in a centralized database repository used to support feedback and future efforts.
- Fifty percent of prototypes and next generation capabilities transition into DoD Component Program Management Offices and Program Executive Offices to fulfill DOD urgent needs, while the remaining fifty percent are reviewed for alternative operational utility and sent to the appropriate Service or Agency for application.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>These programs support readiness of the joint force by creating a Joint Training Environment to replicate the complex and changing operational environment.  The funding increase beginning in FY 2015 represents planned growth and internal reprogramming decisions to accelerate development of a cloud-enabled joint training environment.  These investments directly support defense strategic guidance and enhance joint warfighting readiness by building training capabilities that support the operational readiness of the force.  The elements associated with this coordinated effort consist of:

- Joint National Training Capability (JNTC)
- Joint Simulation System (JSS)
- Joint Knowledge Development &amp; Distribution Capability (JKDDC)
- U.S. Forces Korea Training &amp; Exercise Support (USFK)
- Air Force Joint National Training Capability (JNTC)
- Navy Joint National Training Capability (JNTC)

JNTC:  The mission of the Joint National Training Capability (JNTC) program is to advance joint capabilities and interoperability by concentrating on emerging joint training requirements through collective training experiences using a managed set of globally distributed capabilities and activities. The program resources Service and SOF joint training and enabling capabilities that improve interoperability and realism of tactical and operational joint training between the Services and USSOCOM. JNTC enables joint collective training for Combatant Commands and Services by developing relevant joint training content and ensuring global distributed access. The enabling capabilities support the Services and USSOCOM in their requirement to provide trained and ready forces in support of Combatant Command operational requirements. This program will focus efforts on improving, rather than consuming, readiness and create a ready surge force consistent with Chairman’s guidance.

JSS:  The Joint Simulation System (JSS) provides a low cost, distributed or deployable, web-based joint training capability with a small technical and operator footprint.  The JSS funding provides warfighters with joint simulations and tools that enhance and enable Joint training across Services, Combatant Commands, Combat Support Agencies, NATO and multinational partners. The Joint simulations and tools provided by JSS funding are critical enablers that support the delivery of trained, capable, and interoperable joint forces.  JSS’s intent is to maintain a capability to share simulation environments with coalition partners.

JKDDC:  Joint Knowledge Development &amp; Distribution Capability (JKDDC) Joint Knowledge Online (JKO) is the JS J7 program of record for online joint training that implements and operationalizes the OSD T2 JKDDC.  JKO directly supports the CE2T2 program by developing, delivering, tracking, and reporting online training for Combatant Command exercises; Combatant Command required training; doctrinally based Joint Operations Core Curriculum; multinational, coalition, IA training; and OSD required training (externally funded).  JKO also expends funding for leading edge technology review, market research, and integration to directly enhance specific aspects of the training capability as required for J7 support to Combatant Commanders. JKO satisfies all requirements necessary to provide the CE2T2 stakeholders with a distributed learning capability and access to web-based training content.

USFK:  FY 2015 is the last year for dedicated funding within the overall program.  The U.S. Forces Korea (USFK) Training &amp; Exercise Support program develops simulations capable of satisfying all joint exercise training requirements in the Korean Theater of Operations.  Interoperability with the Republic of Korea-developed Korean Simulation System (KSIMS) is a critical and unique requirement of this USFK RDT&amp;E program.  This solution will be capable of interoperating in a common battle space that realistically represents the operating environment to all levels of training audiences -- tactical to strategic -- in Korean theater exercises.  While supporting USFK’s specific requirements, this solution will contain enhancements that will benefit other combatant commander training programs that use the aging Joint, Live, Virtual, and Constructive (JLVC) simulations and the emerging JLVC 2020 simulations.  

Air Force JNTC:  The Air Force JNTC funding provides a focused upgrade to develop models for space-based capabilities for integration into the JLVC environment.  The Air Force supports development of cross-domain solutions that enable the integration of systems with disparate security requirements, and significantly increases the training audience to additional joint and coalition participants.  

Navy JNTC:  These funds enable the Navy to develop unique maritime capabilities that integrate JLVC elements into a seamless joint training environment. The Navy program activities include conducting research, development, test and evaluation, and cross-service architecture certification on joint-capable systems.  Additionally, the program develops cross-domain architectures for U.S. and Coalition Forces and ensures sister service modeling/simulation and instrumentation efforts follow a unified standard.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Investment in the Joint National Training Capability (JNTC) program will enable Service and Combatant Commands to train as they operate.  The net funding increase in FY 2015 is planned growth to accelerate development of the cloud-enabled joint training environment.  The funding requested continues development of exercise Scenario Management Tools and services that support planning and execution of joint training, and continued maturation of a single integrating architecture for Joint Training.  Funding supports the development of cloud-enabled modular training application services.  Program intent is to reduce dependence on touch labor, and mitigate the impact of reductions in operation and sustainment funding.  Focus must be maintained to deliver operationally relevant training environments and respond to changes in the warfighter’s operational environment.  JNTC enables the Department of Defense to be responsive to the warfighters’ pace of changing operational concepts, threat environments, and best practices. In FY 2016, this investment expands access for Service and Combatant Command trainers to plan and execute joint training.  Funds support improved relevance and realism of training by providing capabilities that replicate the contemporary and future operating environment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Title>Joint National Training Capability (JNTC)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>JNTC provides the technical standards, architecture (blueprint), and development processes required to integrate/link joint training programs.  The Joint Training Environment is envisioned as an integrated network of training sites and nodes, and accessible joint training and force development services.  By leveraging existing training programs and initiating specific actions, JNTC develops credible opposing force capabilities and expanded access to assets typically unavailable to the training audience.  This enhances the integration of joint training objectives into Service training events.  Funding in this account supports the technical integration of Joint and Service modeling and simulation training capabilities.  Technical integration enables selective aggregation of training audiences at the Combatant Command, Joint Task Force, and Component Command Headquarter levels.  The funding supports modernization of the Joint Training Environment (JTE) to increase warfighter access to automated training enablers (through web-based and cloud capabilities). 

The Adaptive Training Capability Program (ATCP) is a subordinate component of JNTC that enables the Joint Force to be responsive to the warfighters’ pace of changing operational concepts, threat environments, and best practices.  ATCP funding advances joint capabilities and interoperability by addressing emerging joint training requirements through a managed set of globally distributed JLVC enablers.  ATCP funding promotes joint context to Service training programs and joint enablers supporting Combatant Command training requirements and CJCS High Interest Training Items identified in the Chairman’s Annual Training Guidance.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>RDT&amp;E development efforts are evaluated based on performance metrics.  This ensures the Joint Force Trainer capabilities development effort synchronizes with warfighter requirements.  Performance metrics include, but are not limited to; time, money, realism, and fidelity as defined below:

• Time – Will the effort enable the Joint Force Trainer to prepare and execute training more timely than current capabilities allow?
• Cost – Will the effort enable the Joint Force Trainer to prepare and execute training at a more effective and efficient cost than current capabilities allow?
• Realism – Will the effort enable the Joint Force Trainer to create a training environment that is closer to the real world environment than current capabilities allow?
• Fidelity – Will the effort enable the Joint Force Trainer to create more detailed capabilities in the training environment than current capabilities allow?

• The Navy will produce one Navy Training Baseline (NTB) software release to include documentation; will design and implement upgrades to Joint Semi-Automated Forces (JSAF) consistent with approved requirements and CRs and document the effects of JSAF capabilities (robustness) and stability.  Will design, implement, test, and integrate NTB enhancements in accordance with requirements.

• For JSAF, Joint Simulation BUS (JBUS) reliability, scalability, and tactical control, the Navy will continuously update the Common Operational Picture (COP) during large scale JLVC exercises.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense-wide Industrial Base Analysis and Sustainment (IBAS) program element, directed by Title 10 USC Section 2508, provides the Department with a comprehensive ability to support the monitoring and assessment of the industrial base, address critical issues in the industrial base relating to urgent operational needs, support efforts to expand the industrial base and address supply chain vulnerabilities.  This program maintains or improves the health of critical and fragile defense industry capabilities that are at risk of being lost but are needed at present and/or have verified future requirements in support of the National Defense Strategy.  The goal of the program is to avoid loss of critical capabilities and resultant reconstitution costs, where affordable and innovative mechanisms are available to the producers in the interim.


Criteria for project selection will include factors such as 1) identifiable path of preservation, transformation or innovation between an existing capability and a capability with a very high probability of being needed in the short to medium term (&lt; 5 years); 2) loss of the capability is likely in the absence of the proposed project; 3) analysis showing that the project results in a lower overall cost to the department than if capability is developed from scratch when needed; and 4) preference is given to projects supporting multiple programs or services with multiple beneficiaries.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                    <r2:SummaryExplanation>FY 2016 baseline program increased with Department priorities.

The $4.680M increase from FY2015 to FY2016 is an increase for Space Sector Sustainment.  The funding is targeted to maintain active Mercury-Cadmium-Telluride (MCT) detector production (and the capability to surge) to meet the needs of National Security Systems in the Missile and Space Sectors.  This MCT project leverages Defense Manufacturing Science and Technology (DMST) work to qualify MCT projects.

The FY 2016 funding request was reduced by $2.207M to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>OSD Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (AT&amp;L) investments under this program are informed by the Department's Sector by Sector, Tier by Tier (S2T2) program for industrial base analysis directed by Title 10 Section 2503 and carried out by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (Manufacturing and Industrial Base Policy) (DASD (MIBP)).  Periodic S2T2 assessments under this program, directed by Title 10 Section 2505, and other assessments collaboratively identify elements of the industrial base where current acquisition programs will not invest enough in production and/or research to support the minimum sustaining rate that would keep critical capabilities viable.  While industrial base risks identified through these assessment tools are to be mitigated primarily through direct engagement with military departments, agencies, and industry, exceptional cases will require defense-wide intervention via investment accounts, often in collaboration with multiple Services and agencies, to ensure adequate industrial capability to support future defense needs.

This funding is a key tool for addressing supply chain risks and diminishing manufacturing sources.  Investments are prioritized though a careful analysis at every tier of the supply chain according to a numerical scale of the risk-area's fragility and criticality.  Fragility examines characteristics that make a specific product or service likely to be disrupted;  criticality examines characteristics that make a specific product or service difficult to replace if disrupted.  These concepts underpin AT&amp;L’s core mission and inform critical investment, budgetary, and programmatic decision-making.

S2T2 fragility and criticality assessments are applied across the DoD enterprise to identify and prioritize industrial base niches requiring additional investment by DoD.  The purpose of investment is to sustain essential industrial production and design team capabilities.  Projects will focus on high impact industrial base sectors with a combination of defense-specific requirements and low, limited or declining production.  The focus areas are 1) missiles and munitions, 2) space, and 3) other defense-specific capabilities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Butanetriol (BT):  This project developed a qualified domestic source for BT, a solid rocket fuel precursor chemical, precluding the necessity of procurement from a prohibited foreign source.  Since 2008, DoD’s projected requirements have shrunk to levels that substantially change the business case for development of new domestic source.  To re-enable the business case and develop a permanent domestic industrial base, DoD funded a project to close the gap between the new and old business cases.

Advanced Solid Rocket Propulsion:  To support future missile interceptor missions, advanced kill vehicle thrusters for high precision and long duration missions are required.  This is a defense-unique industrial base niche.  In order to maintain this capability and avoid the loss of skills and intellectual capital, the Department is currently executing a project to develop high precision attitude control.</r2:Text>

Fuzes:  Business case analysis has found production for Electronic Arm and Safe Device (EASD) fuzes to be very fragile.  To mitigate this risk the business case is being improved by expanding the use of EASD fuzes to multiple missiles.  Project funding will be used to perform the work necessary to enable the fuze to be used on additional missiles.

Another project will preserve the manufacturing capability for Low Energy Exploding Foil Initiators (LEEFI) used in a variety of DoD missile programs in anticipation of shutdown by the U. S. supplier.

Thermal Batteries:  Because of declining production for missiles, the demand for thermal batteries is also declining and production is falling below minimum sustaining rates.  Project funding will be used to lower minimum sustaining rates to match demand by developing production improvements, improved technologies, and cost efficiencies.</r2:Text>

This funding provided resources to cover a one-time FY 2014 funding gap.

A number of unique radiation hardened products from a sole source supplier highly likely to be used by a number of future programs have completed development but require final space qualification.  The supplier cannot fund this at their own expense.  Without funding to perform space qualification work, the products will not be ready for use when needed and the supplier is highly likely to leave the business.  Funding will be used to perform final space qualification work and avoid the much higher cost of developing replacement products with an alternative supplier.</r2:Text>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Systems program is researching, developing, integrating, testing, deploying, operating, and maintaining a CWMD situational awareness system.  This system will enable a comprehensive, global capability for situational awareness of threats from WMD as well as global efforts to counter those threats.  This system will foster a shared understanding of the CWMD operating environment and support decision making for operations and activities by the U.S. government and its partners.  The CWMD mission space is characterized by immense amounts of information, such as the characteristics and location of WMD-related facilities and materials, personnel and expertise, and dual-use technologies.  The CWMD Systems program comprises next-generation advanced information technologies, coupled with small fusion cells, to locate, gather, access, share, and visualize this WMD-relevant information to facilitate collaboration and decision-making. These solutions will revolutionize CWMD knowledge management, providing decision makers and operational personnel a dynamic, holistic view of the global CWMD operating environment.  

The diversity and complexity of the CWMD mission requires an integrated approach toward capability development, based on a systems perspective that links strategic objectives with interrelated tasks and associated capabilities. The CWMD mission is intertwined with counter-terrorism and homeland defense and hence system development must leverage and integrate complementary technologies developed to support other mission areas. The CWMD Systems program also will enable international collaboration in countering WMD by breaking down unnecessary data stove-pipes and by enabling the U.S. Government and its partners to access and share knowledge.

This program also responds to the strategic needs outlined in the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review, the Department of Defense (DoD) Strategy for Countering WMD, the FY2016-2020 Defense Planning Guidance, and capability requirements approved by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council. The CWMD Systems program will develop and field a global CWMD situational awareness capability to meet the needs of Combatant Commands, the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Staff, the Services, and Defense Agencies.  Other U.S. Government Departments and Agencies will be able to utilize this capability to support their mission needs and collaborate with the Department of Defense. This program is designed to leverage existing DoD resources and proven approaches to achieve its goals and rapidly deliver an operational capability. 

The CWMD Systems portfolio is supported by two RDT&amp;E program elements (0303310D8Z for research, development, testing and evaluation of advanced materiel and non-materiel solutions, and 0607310D8Z for upgrades or improvements to fielded systems), as well as an Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) line (ORC 2531) for program sustainment and administrative costs associated with analyses, oversight, and portfolio management.

This Program Element can fund travel to support the requirements of this program.

This appropriation will finance work, including manpower, performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant arrangement with the government who conduct research (systematic study directed toward fuller scientific knowledge or understanding of the subject studied), development (systematic use of the knowledge and understanding gained from research, for the production of useful materials, devices, systems, or methods, including the design and development of prototypes and processes) and test and evaluation efforts.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Systems program is researching, developing, integrating, testing, deploying, operating, and maintaining a CWMD situational awareness system.  This system will enable a comprehensive, global capability for situational awareness of threats from WMD as well as global efforts to counter those threats.  This system will foster a shared understanding of the CWMD operating environment and support decision making for operations and activities by the U.S. government and its partners.  The CWMD mission space is characterized by immense amounts of information, such as the characteristics and location of WMD-related facilities and materials, personnel and expertise, and dual-use technologies.  The CWMD Systems program comprises next-generation advanced information technologies, coupled with small fusion cells, to locate, gather, access, share, and visualize this WMD-relevant information to facilitate collaboration and decision-making. These solutions will revolutionize CWMD knowledge management, providing decision makers and operational personnel a dynamic, holistic view of the global CWMD operating environment.  

The diversity and complexity of the CWMD mission requires an integrated approach toward capability development, based on a systems perspective that links strategic objectives with interrelated tasks and associated capabilities. The CWMD mission is intertwined with counter-terrorism and homeland defense and hence system development must leverage and integrate complementary technologies developed to support other mission areas. The CWMD Systems program also will enable international collaboration in countering WMD by breaking down unnecessary data stove-pipes and by enabling the U.S. Government and its partners to access and share knowledge.

This program also responds to the strategic needs outlined in the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review, the Department of Defense (DoD) Strategy for Countering WMD, the FY2016-2020 Defense Planning Guidance, and capability requirements approved by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council. The CWMD Systems program will develop and field a global CWMD situational awareness capability to meet the needs of Combatant Commands, the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Staff, the Services, and Defense Agencies.  Other U.S. Government Departments and Agencies will be able to utilize this capability to support their mission needs and collaborate with the Department of Defense. This program is designed to leverage existing DoD resources and proven approaches to achieve its goals and rapidly deliver an operational capability. 

The CWMD Systems portfolio is supported by two RDT&amp;E program elements (0303310D8Z for research, development, testing and evaluation of advanced materiel and non-materiel solutions, and 0607310D8Z for upgrades or improvements to fielded systems), as well as an Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) line (ORC 2531) for program sustainment and administrative costs associated with analyses, oversight, and portfolio management.     

This Program Element can fund travel to support the requirements of this program.

This appropriation will finance work, including manpower, performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant arrangement with the government who conduct research (systematic study directed toward fuller scientific knowledge or understanding of the subject studied), development (systematic use of the knowledge and understanding gained from research, for the production of useful materials, devices, systems, or methods, including the design and development of prototypes and processes) and test and evaluation efforts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

•  Performed research and analyses regarding the development of standards and associated Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) protection methods -- with respect to people-process-technology-metrics for SCRM, Hardware, Software, and a Lifecycle Cybersecurity Risk Management administration.

•  Developed and initiated a 5-week  iCollege SCRM elective course at the National Def. University.

•  Along with OUSD AT&amp;L, developed a proof-of-concept Adversary Threat Model that purposes to inform the DoD’s Risk Management Framework (RMF) to address cybersecurity in complex systems acquired by the US Government.  This Adversary Threat Model will inform the RMF and the Program Protection Plans, and aims to improve cybersecurity in the design and development of acquisition program test plans. 

•  Supported developing the capability of assessing of potential cyber threats to major weapon systems and tactical communication systems, to include the identification of gaps and requirements for better understanding of advanced threats in the acquisition and integration of commercial and customized technologies into critical systems, and development of proposed courses of action and countermeasures.

•  Developed draft DoD security control and assessment guidance and procedures in support of NIST special publications to better enable certification and accreditation reciprocity, standardized testing, and compliance validation across the DoD.  

•  Continued to evolve and refine the DoD Cloud and Mobile Device Strategy and Roadmap, to include policy and IA capabilities, necessary to support "end-to-end" IA capability for the Joint Information Environment (JIE), and for mobile enterprise services such as discovery, collaboration, messaging, mediation, data tagging, and other services.

•  Conduct Cyber Security program reviews with mission partners to address program implementation, resourcing issues, and requirements definition and refinement.

•  Developed, coordinated, and maintained Cyber metrics for reporting to DoD-CIO, DCMO and other organizations as necessary.

•  Developed various policy directives, instructions, and guidance documents on cybersecurity workforce, cross domain, network defense, and integrating cybersecurity throughout the acquisition life-cycle.

•  Initiated a more robust acquisition oversight process via updated acquisition policies/guidance to reflect integrated life-cycle cybersecurity risk management concepts and the on-going implementation of supply-chain-risk-management key practices and test and evaluation processes across DoD.

•  Supported development of the architecture and engineering of cloud computing and core data center security requirements for DoD, and synchronized Cloud security processes across DoD, and with other mission partners, and developed an initial command-and-control process model for commercial cloud implementation in coordination with other Fed Agencies.

•  Supported development of a charter document as part of a strategic plan for information security and continuous monitoring of DoD networks and systems.

•  Developed a plan to effectively implement and integration recommendations of existing computer network defense, public-key-infrastructure, and related initiatives applicable to migrating to a Joint Information Environment (JIE).</r2:Text>

•  Develop and implement strategies for successful defenses and operations in the event of sophisticated cyber adversaries and large-scale cyber incidents.

•  Develop, refine, and implement a Joint Information Environment single security architecture strategy, and the related strategic metrics and enhanced analytical capabilities.

•  Conduct research to develop means of assessing and prioritizing supply-chain threats and responses, for training regarding threats and risks, and for program protection plans to address supply-chain risks, to help ensure implementation of consistent protection practices from supply chain exploitation and attack within/by individual procurements of materiel and services on which the DoD systems, networks, and missions depend.

•  Support development and implementation of a more robust governance mechanism to minimize supply chain risks across the DoD components and activities.

•  Develop an overarching international standard, or an improved integrated family of existing standards, for improving supply-chain-risk-management.

•  Develop the means for improved mission assurance, mitigation analyses, and vulnerability detection via hardware and software testing, and for acquisitions that are better integrated with informed threat prospects.

•  Continue to develop and publish supportive standards, guidance, and processes on the web-based Knowledge Service, for the continual reauthorization and cyber strengthening of information systems, and in satisfaction of requirements mandated by OMB Circular A-130.

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The acquisition, management, and contracting strategy involves the following:
• Adhere to guidance outlined in DoD 5000, Directive 7, Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), and FAR Supplement Policies and Procedures.
• Acquire and sustain MILDEC capabilities, systems, tools, products and services through a disciplined, yet agile, process that ensures information related capabilities are available for Department of Defense (DoD) components.
• Sustain an acquisition process that is responsive and responsible to internal and external customers and stakeholders.
• Continue to support the warfighter’s need for capabilities that dominate today’s dynamic, networked battlespace by providing governance, oversight and strategy across the DoD for the planning and execution of MILDEC activities.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>RDT&amp;E Performance metrics are among the metrics used to establish the baseline and assess progress toward revitalization of MILDEC capabilities and capacities across the Department of Defense’s assigned responsibilities. The following metrics are focused on the ROI of RDT&amp;E activities and provide assessment to meeting:
1) operational requirements for MILDEC capabilities, 2) technical requirements for successful engineering, and 3) programmatic requirements for sustaining RDT&amp;E
successes across the Department:

Performance metrics are measured through an increase of MILDEC capability and capacity as demonstrated by the following:

- Seventy percent of evaluations and tests on engineered prototypes and next generation capabilities address Combatant Command and/or DoD Component requirements. The remaining thirty percent serve as the pivot to improve service level operational capabilities or to address alternate technologies. 
- One hundred percent of completed prototype development includes affiliated specifications, architecture, raw material inventories and documentation. They are maintained in a centralized database repository used to support feedback and future efforts.
- Fifty percent of prototypes and next generation capabilities transition into DoD Component Program Management Offices and Program Executive Offices to fulfill DOD urgent needs, while the remaining fifty percent are reviewed for alternative operational utility and sent to the appropriate Service or Agency for application.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Critical Infrastructure Program (DCIP) is a Department of Defense (DoD) risk management program that seeks to ensure the availability of assets critical to DoD missions. These include DoD and non-DoD, domestic and foreign infrastructures essential to planning, mobilizing, deploying, executing, and sustaining United States military operations on a global basis.  Through identifying Defense Critical Assets, assessing them to determine vulnerabilities, incorporating specific threat and hazard information and analysis, and visually displaying relevant infrastructure data and analysis, DoD will be positioned to make risk management decisions to ensure the appropriate infrastructure is available, when needed, to support DoD missions.

Specifically, DCIP works with the Combatant Commands (CCMD) to determine the mission capability requirements and coordinates with the Military Departments, Defense Agencies, DoD Field Activities, and Defense Sector Lead Agents (DISLA) to identify and prioritize defense critical infrastructure required to support assigned mission essential tasks. DCIP also works with mission and asset owners to identify vulnerabilities and apply appropriate remediation and mitigation measures. DCIP leverages the DISLA inputs to identify the specific functions, systems, assets (DoD and non-DoD owned), and interdependencies within the Defense Sector infrastructure networks that support the identified critical missions. Each DISLA, as identified in DoDD 3020.40 “DoD Policy and Responsibilities for Critical Infrastructure”, represents one of ten (10) functional areas that provide support to the CCMDs and asset owners. These functional areas are as follows:  defense industrial base (DIB); financial services; DoD Information Networks (DODIN); health affairs; intelligence; logistics; personnel; public works; space; and transportation.  

In addition, DCIP manages specific analytic efforts to identify inter- and intra-dependencies DoD has on the critical commercial infrastructure supporting identified missions.  Specific analytic efforts are focused within six (6) commercial infrastructure areas:  energy (electric power, natural gas); chemicals; transportation; communications; water; and petroleum, oil, lubricants (POL).

For each functional area and commercial infrastructure area, DCIP examines specific vulnerabilities to DoD missions and develops remediation and mitigation options, incorporating unique analytic insights from engineering and industry best practices to reduce the risk to missions.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>Request supports the Long Term Competitions (LTC) program which is an analytical effort chartered to provide the DoD senior leadership with an understanding of key long-term developments and dynamics in specific areas of the global security environment, and to develop competitive strategies for their consideration as the Department seeks to address these long term challenges.  The LTC Program will provide rigorously analyzed competitive strategy recommendations to these senior DoD leaders, and will require the support of organizations and experts outside of government to deliver the highest quality analysis, concepts and recommendations.  Funding for the LTC program will be used to: bring outside experts into Task Force working groups and strategy review teams; contract studies; support wargaming and workshops; conduct analytical studies of key developments and dynamics, and their impact on the future security environment and U.S. military capabilities in that environment; and explore new approaches to addressing key analytical requirements.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Funds will be used to provide technical analysis, systems engineering and capability management oversight of programs, projects, initiatives and activities to maximize the Department’s return on investment in information technology resources and affect a comprehensive approach for assessing and procuring critical information systems from initial design, through development to capability delivery in support of improved systems performance and military operations. Emphasis is placed on the information transport, information assurance/cyber security, network and spectrum management, command and control (C2) applications, systems and services, information sharing capabilities, commercial mobile devices (CMD), applications and infrastructure, and enterprise services activities focused on the development, integration, testing and technical assessment of capabilities and applications in joint and coalition warfighter support environments.  Resources support collaborative efforts to demonstrate the interoperability and performance requirements of command, control, communication, computing network, and Information Infrastructure (C4II) capabilities and programs.  This program is funded under Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development.  

     This project provides the resources necessary to implement net centric processes and authoritative analytic methods that provide the capability to synchronize interdependent C4II capabilities across all layers (ground, air, space) of the joint information environment (JIE) architecture, to forecast and achieve a balance in supply and demand for network capacity, and field effective capabilities more rapidly and efficiently as an enabler for C4II capabilities applications and services.  Resources are required to transform current networks and information infrastructure into an operationally unified and architecturally diverse joint information environment that will provide end-to-end communications transport layer, computing networks, and mission application capabilities that are optimized and integrated with all other joint capability areas with a focus on the tactical edge faced with disconnected, intermittent, and latency (DIL) environments.  There will be technical assessments, modeling and simulation, and analysis of the Joint space communications layer, Joint aerial network layer, contested communications on the move, Position Navigation and Timing (PNT), C2 mission applications, commercial mobile devices, and information sharing capabilities.  These funds provide the capability for the warfighter to manage and deconflict radio frequencies through ground, air, and space communication networks.  The funds will be used to develop and synchronize information assurance capabilities with other joint information environment capabilities to provide secure access to information and services (e.g. Cryptographic Modernization Management plan).  

     In addition, funding will continue to be used to support the Defense Information System's Agency's (DISA) and Services' interoperable improvement efforts and processes in the development of common standards and protocols.  This effort includes initiating the Joint Interoperability Enhancement Process (IEP) that allows operators, engineers, and program managers to verify capabilities and identify issues in a design with Joint /Allied units prior to system fielding, or with fielded systems to identify required systems changes for systems upgrade planning.  DISA and the Joint Forces Combatant Command lead the effort to transform the current standards and interoperability management tools to a common set of Joint network-enabled standards to ensure adherence to the Global Information Grid (GIG) enterprise-wide technical baseline and for implementation of future Tactical Data Link (TDL) capabilities. These joint standards, protocols, and processes will be used for implementation and testing to ensure the TDL capabilities are synchronized with the development and integration timelines of other planned network-enabled Global Information Grid (GIG) initiatives.  The threats to the networking waveforms and the Joint NC migration will also be looked at in cooperation with the Intelligence agencies.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Performance was monitored on a monthly basis via Program Reviews, Current Expenditures, Estimated Future Expenditures and Cost/Schedule Adherence.  Research and Development provided increased intelligence information sharing capabilities in support of US and coalition forces utilizing the US BICES and NATO virtual networks within the Afghanistan theater and provided increased database information via Distributed Common Ground System - Army.  Provided an increase in intelligence disciplines (Imagery Intelligence, Signal Intelligence and potential Human Intelligence) in support of US and Allied/Coalition forces that currently is very limited to the warfighter.  Increased intelligence advanced analytics tools will be migrated from Joint Intelligence Operations Center-IT and DI2E developments and will significantly increase the timeliness of intelligence and bring US BICES/NATO Special Operations Forces Headquarters/NATO Intelligence Fusion Center capabilities into the current technology baselines.  Developed and provided a federated TNE that incorporates the Asian Pacific Intelligence Information Network being developed to support the National Defense Strategy as we transition out of Afghanistan and into the Pacific.  Provided multi-level security intelligence bi-laterals and multi-laterals to meet Combatant Commander Integrated Priority Lists.  Developed the Coalition Partner Network for CENTCOM, the Coalition Information Exchange Network for SOUTHCOM, and the Coalition Partner Network for EUCOM and AFRICOM.   Developed the US BICES connections with these bi-lateral and multi-lateral federated TNEs that make up the US BICES-X Enterprise Network in support of Commander SOCOM requirements for conventional and coalition operations as the US migrates into other Combatant Command regions.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Assessment and Analysis - Whether it can easily be adapted or adjusted to meet the current or projected capabilities gap for Allied or Coalition Intelligence Information Sharing and for the Intelligence integration into the Future Mission Network.  
Realism – Allows exploration of new environments and capabilities through participation in exercise environments that utilize bi-lateral and multi-lateral intelligence enterprise solutions such as US BICES-X.
Advancement - Increases the current capabilities for the sharing of intelligence information and determines if it actually adds functionality in support of Combatant Commanders requirements through exercises such as Unified Vision, Enterprise Challenge, and the MAJIIC (multi-sensor aerospace ground joint intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance interoperability coalition) exercises. 
Utility - Whether it can be integrated into the existing national or multinational architectures in a timely and cost effective manner and the extent to which it increases the discovery and dissemination of intelligence information to the Allies or Coalition forces.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>
