                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Projects 090/DX8. The M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) is a full spectrum, combat proven, all weather, 24/7 lethal and responsive, precision strike weapon system that fully supports more deployable, affordable and lethal, Brigade Combat Teams (BCT), Fires Brigades, Modular Forces, and Joint Expeditionary Forces.  The HIMARS launcher is a C-130 transportable, wheeled, indirect fire, rocket/missile launcher capable of firing all rockets and missiles in the current and future Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) Family of Munitions (MFOM) and Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) Family of Munitions (AFOM) engaging targets with precision out to ranges of 300 kilometers. HIMARS satisfies the Army's digitization requirements by interfacing with the Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) fire support command and control system. The HIMARS product improvement program provides funding for research, development test, and integration efforts necessary for incorporation of advanced automotive, armor, armament, life cycle enhancements, system hardware and software technologies, including Common Operating Environment (COE) and Network Integrated Evaluation (NIE), obsolescence mitigation, reliability improvements and decreasing the logistics footprint.  This effort includes performing technical assessments, concept studies, and risk reduction efforts for incorporation of future requirements.  The HIMARS product improvement program maintains compliance with Intra-Army Interoperability and Digital Communications.  HIMARS was deployed to Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and is still supporting Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) with great success by both US Army and Marine Corps units.

Project 093. MLRS is a full spectrum, combat proven, all weather, 24/7 lethal and responsive, Precision Strike weapon system that is organic/assigned to Fires Brigades supporting BCT.  The MLRS launcher provides critical missile precision strike, operational shaping fires, counterfire, and close support destructive and suppressive fires.  The launcher is complimented by the MFOM to include the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS), engaging targets up to 60 kilometers (km).  AFOM munitions are capable of engaging targets up to a range of 300 km.  The MLRS product improvement program provides funding for research, development, test and integration efforts necessary for incorporation of advanced automotive, armament and system hardware and software technologies, including COE and NIE, obsolesence mitigation, reliability improvements, and decreasing the logistics footprint.  This effort includes performing technical assessments, concept studies, and risk reduction efforts for incorporation of future requirements.  The MLRS product improvement program maintains compliance with intra-army interoperability and digital communications via joint variable message format. 

Projects 784/78G. GMLRS rockets are surface-to-surface artillery rockets fired from the MLRS and HIMARS launchers.  GMLRS rockets provide 24/7, all-weather precision fires to engage both area and point targets at short, medium, and long ranges.  

The GMLRS Program consists of three separate increments: GMLRS Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munition (DPICM) cluster munition to engage area or imprecisely located targets; GMLRS Unitary utilizes a 200 lb high explosive warhead to engage point targets with limited collateral damage; and GMLRS Alternative Warhead (AW) is being developed as a non-cluster munition to replace GMLRS DPICM.  GMLRS DPICM Production was terminated in response to the June 2008 Department of Defense (DoD) Cluster Munitions Policy.  GMLRS Unitary is currently in full rate production.  GMLRS AW is currently in the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase and scheduled to enter full rate production in FY2015.  The GMLRS AW rocket is 90% common with the Unitary variant.

Project DZ8. The Army G-3/5/7 has directed that GMLRS Increment 4 change its name to Long Range Precision Fires (LRPF) to better reflect the solution as an Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) replacement versus a follow-on increment to the GMLRS program.

No FY15 funds are requested.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The MLRS product improvement program conducts concept studies to support obsolescence mitigation, automotive updates, and hardware/software enhancements.  Development efforts underway include Enhanced C2 and efforts supporting interoperability certifications, information assurance compliance, IAC, and mitigating obsolescence of the Fire Control System through the FCS-U effort.  The IAC effort enhances the level of crew protection. A contract was awarded following a competitive bid process (full and open competition) to ensure best value for the government. The FCS-U is driven by the need to mitigate obsolete electronic components that are being sustained through life of type purchases. These purchased components will be exhausted, thus requiring an update to the design.  This update to the design will preserve current and future capability of firing the complete set of MLRS family of munitions per the Operational Requirements Document (ORD). The FCS-U development effort began in FY13, utilizing the industrial Engineering Services contract that was previously sole source awarded.  Contract efforts include finalizing design, testing, and qualification of the FCS-U with scheduled completion in FY15.  Government activities to close out government efforts to continue in FY16. PDR occured in FY13 and CDR will occur in 4Q FY14.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>Beginning in FY2015, Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) will have its own separate Program Element, 0205778A, to include Projects EG2 (GMLRS Alternative Warhead) and EG3 (Guided MLRS), previously under Program Element 0603778A Project Codes 78G and 784, respectively.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The United States (U.S.) Army is funding the development of the Guided Mulitple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) Alternative Warhead (AW) increment under the 78G-GMLRS AW project code.  GMLRS AW is being developed as a non-cluster munition to replace GMLRS Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munitions (DPICM) and service the same area and imprecisely-located targets.  GMLRS DPICM Production was terminated in response to the June 2008 Department of Defense (DoD) Cluster Munitions Policy.

The GMLRS AW increment completed Milestone B (MS B) on February 19, 2012 and is currently in the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase.  The three-year EMD contract was awarded on March 30, 2012.  Funding was requested in FY2013 for the second year of the EMD contract and for other government and contracted EMD activities to include engineering developmental testing and the Critical Design Review (CDR).  GMLRS AW is scheduled for a combined Milestone C (MS C) and Full Rate Production (FRP) Decision in FY2015 and Initial Operational Capability (IOC) in FY2016.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) is a full spectrum, combat proven, all weather, 24/7 lethal and responsive, precision strike weapon system that fully supports more deployable, affordable and lethal, Brigade Combat Teams, Fires Brigades, Modular Forces, and Joint Expeditionary Forces.  The HIMARS launcher is a C-130 transportable, wheeled, indirect fire, rocket/missile launcher capable of firing all rockets and missiles in the current and future Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) Family of Munitions (MFOM) and Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) Family of Munitions (AFOM) engaging targets with precision out to ranges of 300 kilometers.  HIMARS satisfies the Army's digitization requirements by interfacing with the Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) fire support command and control system.  The HIMARS product improvement program provides funding for research, development, test and integration efforts necessary for incorporation of advanced automotive, armor, armament, life cycle enhancements, system hardware and software technologies, including Common Operating Environment (COE) and Network Integrated Evaluation (NIE), obsolescence mitigation, reliability improvements, and decreasing the logistics footprint.  This effort includes performing technical assessments, concept studies, and risk reduction efforts for incorporation of future requirements.  The HIMARS product improvement program maintains compliance with intra-army interoperability and digital communications.  HIMARS was deployed to Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and is still supporting Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) with great success by both US Army and Marine Corps units.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Army G-3/5/7 has directed that Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) Increment 4 change its name to Long-Range Precision Fires (LRPF) to better reflect the solution as an Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) replacement versus a follow-on increment to the GMLRS program.

The United States Army is funding the development of the LRPF under the DZ8-LRPF project code.  LRPF is being developed as a non-cluster munition to provide Joint Force Command with a 24/7 all weather 300 kilometer long-range fires capability without placing aircraft and crews at risk. 

The LRPF program currently has a Material Development Decision (MDD) scheduled for 1QFY14 with a tentative Milestone (MS) A scheduled for 2QFY15.  Funding is being requested for in FY2016 to award Technology Maturation/Risk Reduction (TM/RR) contracts.  LRPF will be developed via full and open competition carrying two or more contractors through the TM/RR Phase.  LRPF is scheduled for a MS B in FY2018 and MS C in FY2021.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Logistics Information Warehouse (LIW) has been designated by the Secretary of the Army as the primary system for the accessing, acquiring, and delivery of materiel data.  This includes data from all sources designated as Authoritative, as well as, system derived data and appropriate reference data.  This data will be used in support of materiel sourcing and distribution and other Materiel Enterprise missions.  It enables Command visibility of business intelligence and resulting metrics for critical logistics components enabling enterprise-level analytics to be performed in support of the equipping mission within the Army's Force Generation (ARFORGEN) processes. LOGSA and its LIW suite of products and services provide the Army community with vital logistics data necessary for the planning, conducting and sustainment of war fighting capability worldwide. The LMI-DST directly supports Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) by linking available equipment to the Generated Force model. Specifically, LMI-DST synchronizes an Army authoritative Demand Signal for manning, equipping,services &amp; infrastructure and authoritative resourcing (money) information, resulting in an accurate prediction of a ready and properly equipped force.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Logistics Information Warehouse (LIW) is designated as the Army's authoritative materiel data repository. BENEFITS: As chartered by the Secretary of The Army, LIW will provide enterprise-accepted and trusted information for analysis, aggregation, and reuse in support of the Lead Materiel Integrator (LMI) mission. As an Army enterprise-level repository and retrieval system to facilitate accurate choices and rapid decision making. Specifically, LIW will provide all required data structured in a way that allows for querying and reporting; e.g., equipment authorizations, equipment on-hand, new procurement schedules, RESET production schedules and in-transit visibility from origin and distribution to final destination, in support of the information needs of the Army Materiel Command (AMC) and other command logistics managers. This includes data from all sources designated as authoritative, as well as system derived data and appropriate reference data. This data will be used in support of materiel sourcing and distribution and other Materiel Enterprise missions. LIW enables visibility of business intelligence and resulting metrics for critical logistics components enabling enterprise-level analytics to be performed in support of the equipping mission within the Army's ARFORGEN processes. LIW supports the tenants of Mission Command by logistically empowering the Commander to successfully integrate and synchronize logistics information with warfighter functions in time and space to maximize potential for mission success. ADDITIONAL CAPABILITIES: LIW provides the data and custom business intelligence environment to enable Command-specific analysis and presentation of business intelligence displays to satisfy unique command management requirements.
The Common CBM Data Warehouse (CCBMDW) is requesting RDT&amp;E funds to develop a web interface that will allow users from RDECOM, the LCMC's, and the PEO's/PM to query, select, retrieve individual sensor files from the data base and designate a delivery mechanism (SFTP, HTTPS, Data service) in order that they can receive the selected files.  This is a new capability that will replace the current manual method where an analyst calls LOGSA and request a data extract from the CCBMDW be sent to their location via pre-arranged methods.  The new Web Interface will also serve as a platform to enable the user to extract individual data fields from the sensor files that are stored in the CCBMDW in the Army Bulk CBM Data (ABCD) format and download the individual data fields as opposed to the whole file or bundle of files.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The LMI DST Version 5 is a development effort to meet the Secretary of the Army intent in designating the Army Materiel Command as the Lead Materiel Integrator and the Logistics Information Warehouse (LIW) as the authoritative repository of Logistics domain data.  The LMI DST integrates logistics domain data from the LIW with materiel demand requirements from the Readiness Enterprise to enable automated decision support for equippers throughout the Army.  In August 2011, a sole-source contract was awarded to Pro Model Corporation to leverage their COTS modeling and simulation capability, the ProModel Application Framework, to develop the Lead Materiel Integrator Decision Support Tool, which is a GOTS product.  Versions 1-3 were developed and released in six-month sprints under Pro Model.  In January, 2013, the effort was moved under LOGSA's Information and Technology Services Contract, under which the latest version (V4) was released in June 2013.  Requirements for additional major version releases are vetted and approved by a General Officer Steering Committee, comprised of representatives from ACOMs, ASCCs, and DRUs, and chaired by AMC HQ.  Base year funding supports new development requirements approved by the GOSC.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Software Improvement (modification) for threat evolution:   Performs necessary analysis and development efforts to maintain PATRIOT system effectiveness against evolving threat technologies and specific threat capabilities.  This effort identifies evolving threats and threat characteristics that might present a challenge to PATRIOT's current capabilities and develops initial concepts to maintain system effectiveness relative to these threats.  

Upper-Tier Debris Mitigation (UTDM):  Implements algorithms to mitigate system impacts of debris from Upper Tier intercepts associated with operating in the Ballastic Missile Defense System (BMDS) environment.  Debris from Upper Tier intercepts can cause significant radar loading effects and the potential for erroneous engagements and missile wastage on debris.

Radar Digital Processor (RDP) Development:  Incorporates improvements to mitigate radar hardware obsolescence, improves Reliability, Availability and Maintainability (RAM) and improves performance of the PATRIOT Radar Set against evolving threat sets.  This program includes the implementation of Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) Mode 5 Level 1 / Level 2, and a Non-Cooperative Target Recognition (NCTR) Combat ID technique to mitigate potential fratricide risk, and the development of CONOPS to incorporate the new Combat ID capabilities into system operation.  The RDP also provides the necessary radar processing capability to support follow-on EDP Tasks 6 and 7 to counter emerging threats and provide data necessary to support migration to IAMD.  The RDP is a pre-requisite for migration to an IAMD Netted Sensor.

RDP Waveform Suite:  Develops a comprehensive set of waveforms in the RDP to improve PATRIOT radar capabilities against current and evolving threats, including support to Task 6 and 7 efforts, and also implements advanced data collection enabled by the RDP to support further system improvements.  The RDP implementation allows significant radar waveform improvements necessary to counter evolving threats.

SIPRNet/NIPRNet Access Point/Troposcatter (SNAP/TROPO):  Provides hardware interfaces to support extended range communications within the battalion (TROPO) and Force Operations interfaces to satellite for access to SIPR/NIPR worldwide communication networks. 
 
THAAD/PATRIOT Interoperability:  Implements improvements to THAAD/PATRIOT Interoperability and addresses Joint Defense Network (JDN) deficiencies that impact Tactical Ballistic Missile (TBM) battle management and force/engagement operations.  Efforts will be concentrated on joint, collaborative force operations (defense design and planning) and enhanced Tactical Digital Information Link - Joint (TADIL J) interoperability. 
 
Advanced Electronic Counter Measures (AECM):  This task investigates the implications of advanced technology Digital Radio Frequency Memory (DRFM) available on airborne platforms that enables new ECM techniques which could adversely affect Air and Missile Defense System effectiveness.   

Internet Protocol Commo Phase 1 Force Modification:  Replacement of the current KG-194A encryptors in PATRIOT requires redesign of the basic PATRIOT shelter communications architecture to incorporate new hardware which interfaces the existing Integrated Digital Operator Control System (IDOCS) to new KIV-7M encryptors and provides an IP base backbone for range extension and over the air IP communications tunneling for Force Operations message traffic without impacting the Engagement Operations traffic.

Task 2:  Implements improved ground system and interceptor capabilities (PATRIOT Advanced Capability-2 / Guidance Enhanced Missiles(PAC-2/GEM), PATRIOT Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3), and Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) to counter stressing TBM threats.
 
Task 6:  Software improvements enhance discrimination of higher altitude TBM Re-entry Vehicles (RVs) from associated objects to support the full engagement capabilities of the interceptor. Longer-range detection and track, and improved high-altitude discrimination are required to achieve the required lethality performance against the RV and to mitigate missile wastage against separation debris.  This task leverages the signal processing capabilities of the RDP, and supports the high altitude engagements required by the PATRIOT Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) and PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) missiles.

Task 7:  Software improvements analyze existing and evolving TBM countermeasures and their effects on PATRIOT system effectiveness.  Develop concepts to address countermeasure effects and ensure the PATRIOT system maintains its effectiveness.   Develop detailed system requirements to implement concepts; design/code/test software implementation leveraging RDP, Modernized Adjunct Processor (MAP), Enhanced Weapons Control Computer - Emulator (EWCC-E) and Flight Solution Computer - Redesign (FSC-R) processing capabilities.

Combat ID Enhancements:  Develop and implement improvements to the RDP-C Combat ID capabilities and additional NCTR technique to further mitigate misclassification and fratricide risk, and to provide the Warfighter with improved situational awareness.

Common Warfighter-Machine Interface (CWMI):  Leverage modern manstation capabilities to implement CWMI concepts to improve training commonality and cost-efficiency, and to provide better situational awareness.

PAC-3 Launch on Remote (LOR) is a software upgrade to the PATRIOT ground and missile systems that extends the capability of the PATRIOT system to engage Tactical Ballistic Missiles (TBM).  LOR utilizes targeting data from existing fire control radars such as THAAD AN/TPY-2 and AEGIS AN/SPY-1 to launch a PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) missile against challenging TBM threats before the PATRIOT radar can detect the incoming target.  This allows for a significantly expanded PATRIOT defended area against TBMs when using the MSE missile and the Radar Digital Processor.

Flat Panel Array Concept Development:  This task provides studies for initial concepts and performance capabilities related to the implementation of an Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) transmitter/antenna into the PATRIOT radar.  These assessments are needed to refine user community expectations and requirements, and to prepare a viable set of requirements to support a competitive modernization competition.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The design objective of the PATRIOT system was to provide a baseline system capable of modification to cope with continuing threat evolution.  This program minimizes technological risks and provides a means of enhancing system capability through planned upgrades of deployed systems.  The PATRIOT Product Improvement Program upgrades the PATRIOT system to address operational lessons learned, enhancements to joint force interoperability and communications, and other system performance improvements to provide overmatch capability against the emerging threat.  Upgrades are implemented through individual hardware and software materiel changes and fielded incrementally. This program encompasses several changes which will require the use of a variety of acquisition methods to develop, test, procure and field.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Joint Land Attack Cruise Missile Defense Elevated Netted Sensor System (JLENS) is a supporting program of the Army and Joint Integrated Air and Missile Defense, providing persistent, over the horizon surveillance and fire control quality data on Army and Joint networks enabling protection of the U.S. and coalition forces as well as geopolitical assets from Cruise Missiles, Aircraft, Unmanned Air Vehicles, Tactical Ballistic Missiles, Large Caliber Rockets, and Surface Moving Targets.

A JLENS Orbit consists of two systems: a fire control radar system and a wide-area surveillance radar system. Each radar system consists of a separate 74-meter tethered aerostat, mobile mooring station, radar and communications payload, processing station, and associated ground support equipment. The systems are designed to work together, but can operate independently. The JLENS Orbit is transportable by road, rail, sea and air.

JLENS uses advanced sensor and networking technologies to provide persistent, 360-degree, wide-area surveillance and precision tracking of Land Attack Cruise Missiles and other types of Air Breathing Threats. This information is distributed via joint service networks and provides fire control quality data to Surface to Air missile systems such as Army Patriot and Navy Aegis, increasing the weapons' capabilities by allowing systems to engage targets normally below, outside or beyond surface based weapons' field of view. JLENS also provides fire control quality data to fighter aircraft allowing them to engage hostile threats from extended ranges, and contributes to the development of a single integrated air picture.

JLENS Product Office (JPO) demonstrated the system's operational capability with the Weapon Systems Evaluation Program (WSEP) exercise using JLENS with an United States Air Force (USAF) operational aircraft and Norwegian Advanced Surface to Air Missile System (NASAMS) to track and neutralize targets in August 2013.

Guidance from the Senate Appropriations Committee - Defense (SAC-D) congressional marks language requires that the JLENS Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) parent funding line be divided between two separate funding lines, Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) and Combatant Command (COCOM) Exercise, which are summed under the parent funding line. The EMD line will be funded at $60.000 million and the COCOM Exercise line will be funded at $23.406 million for a total of $83.406 million in Fiscal Year (FY) 2014. This guidance was not reflected in the FY 2015 President's Budget, and The Army Budget Office will not separate these funding lines in the P&amp;R Form database until the FY 2016 President's Budget submission.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Joint Land Attack Cruise Missile Defense Elevated Netted Sensor System (JLENS) is a supporting program of the Army and Joint Integrated Air and Missile Defense, providing persistent, over the horizon surveillance and fire control quality data on Army and Joint networks enabling protection of the U.S. and coalition forces as well as geopolitical assets from Cruise Missiles, Aircraft, Unmanned Air Vehicles, Tactical Ballistic Missiles, Large Caliber Rockets, and Surface Moving Targets.

A JLENS Orbit consists of two systems: a fire control radar system and a wide-area surveillance radar system. Each radar system consists of a separate 74-meter tethered aerostat, mobile mooring station, radar and communications payload, processing station, and associated ground support equipment. The systems are designed to work together, but can operate independently. The JLENS Orbit is transportable by road, rail, sea and air.

                            <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>This is a supporting program of the Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) architecture.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Joint Land Attack Cruise Missile Defense Elevated Netted Sensor System (JLENS) Operational Requirements Document (ORD) calls for initial fielding to Block I requirements (tethered aerostat platforms for Fire Control and Surveillance radars), followed by fielding of Block II (untethered platforms for Fire Control and Surveillance radars), and Block III (both radars on a single untethered platform). There is currently no funding beyond Block I.  

On 28 Jun 05, the Defense Acquisition Board (DAB) approved the JLENS program for entry into Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) as recommended by the Army Acquisition Executive. The DAB elected to maintain oversight of JLENS as an Acquisition Category (ACAT) 1D program as stated in the Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) signed on August 5, 2005.

On 24 May 2012, the Acting Defense Acquisition Executive (DAE) signed the JLENS Nunn-McCurdy (NM) ADM certifying the restructured JLENS Program, and signed a memorandum rescinding the Milestone B approval for the JLENS program, granted on August 5, 2005.  The ADM directs the Army to restructure the JLENS program to consist of two EMD orbits; complete scheduled EMD test and evaluation to include the Naval Integrated Fire Control-Counter Air demonstration, Limited User Test, Developmental Test 2, and Developmental Test 3 that concludes in 4th Quarter Fiscal Year 2013 (4QFY2013); and to assist in site selection and planning for the employment of one JLENS orbit to support an operational Continental United States based exercise when a location is determined and orders are approved by the National Command Authority.  Letters were provided to Congress notifying them that the NM review was complete and program was certified and restructured as detailed above.

The Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) reviewed the results of the Army's 60 Day Deep-Dive employment assessment of JLENS for Homeland Defense.  The JROC concurs with the proposed JLENS employment to Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD for an operational exercise duration Fiscal Year 2014-2017.

The JLENS Acquisition Program Baseline (APB) was reset by the Nunn-McCurdy Process in accordance with 10 U.S.C. § 2435(d). The proposed APB was signed by the Army Acquisition Executive (AAE) on 10 July 2013 and the DAE on 8 August 2013. The new APB reclassifies JLENS as an ACAT IC program and removes all Nunn-McCurdy unit cost breaches and reporting requirements.

Guidance from the Senate Appropriations Committee - Defense (SAC-D) congressional marks language requires that the JLENS Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) parent funding line be divided between two separate funding lines, Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) and Combatant Command (COCOM) Exercise, which are summed under the parent funding line. The EMD line will be funded at $60.000 million and the COCOM Exercise line will be funded at $23.406 million for a total of $83.406 million in Fiscal Year (FY) 2014. This guidance was not reflected in the FY 2015 President's Budget, and The Army Budget Office will not separate these funding lines in the P&amp;R Form database until the FY 2016 President's Budget submission.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>AFATDS Increment 2 is the automated Command and Control (C2) system (0203728A) for the ground Fires Warfighting Function. AFATDS Increment 2 will permit the management and targeting analysis of the collective and coordinated target acquisition data, effective selection of munitions-target pairing from indirect fire weapons (land and sea based), as well as fixed and rotary wing aircraft against targets located throughout an area of operations.  AFATDS Increment 2 will develop a new software architecture by providing three distinct applications to support role-based functionality: Fire Support, Fire Control, and Fire Direction. It leverages the Common Operating Environment (COE) and Command Post Computing Environment (CP CE) products and capabilities. AFATDS Increment 2 provides a less complicated AFATDS software package to the Warfighter and is fully compliant with the Joint Command and Control Common User Interface (JC2 CUI) architectures. 

Project DU5 funds development of AFATDS Increment 2. Decomposition of the baseline software (AFATDS version 6.8.1) will be required prior to development of the code for AFATDS Increment 2 (version 7.0). A software development contract will be awarded to develop the Fires Common Core, the foundation upon which the three functional applications will operate. Contracting actions will be completed in FY2015 to award multiple software development contracts for the primary functions of the software: Fire Control; Fire Direction; and Fire Support. A contract for software integration may also be necessary, subject to the completion of the analysis for the development of the contracting strategy. The Fires Common Core software development activity will begin in FY2015, in order to allow developers of the other three applications to subsequently initiate their development.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>There are two developmental efforts that are being executed concurrently on this budget item. They are Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System Increment 1 (AFATDS Inc 1)203728A and Network Assisted Global Positioning System (GPS) for Precision Fires.  

AFATDS Increment 1 provides Army, Navy, and Marine Corps automated fire support command, control and communications and functions as the land component's automated Fire Support Command and Control (FSC2) system.  AFATDS is used in the Fires Warfighting Function to plan, execute, and deliver lethal and non-lethal fires within the overall Mission Command and Control (MC2) enterprise. The system interoperates and integrates with: over 80 different battlefield systems from Army, Marine Corps, Navy, and Air Force; and the German, French, Turkish, and Italian fire support command and control systems.AFATDS fuses the essential situational awareness data, intelligence information and targeting data, in near real time, in order to effectively manage target selection and target engagement in accordance with the Maneuver Commanders guidance and priorities and to safely execute against friendly situational picture.  AFATDS pairs targets to weapons to provide optimum use of fire support assets and timely execution of fire missions.  AFATDS automates the planning, coordinating, and controlling of all fire support assets (field artillery, mortars, close air support, naval gunfire, attack helicopters, offensive electronic warfare, fire support meteorological systems, forward observers, and fire support radars).  AFATDS automatically implements detailed commander's guidance in the automation of operational planning, movement control, targeting, target value analysis, and fire support planning. AFATDS is being used in operations in Afghanistan. Project 322 funds development of AFATDS Version 6.8.1. AFATDS 6.8.1 fires capabilities are being enhanced to meet JADOCS ground fires requirements in order to remove JADOCS from the ground forces inventory. With the completion of AFATDS Version 6.8.1, the program office will complete the AFATDS Increment 1 development and will start the Increment 2 development in 4Q FY2014.  Final engineering reviews will be conducted and Government Confidence Testing, Information Assurance testing, and Certification testing will be completed.   

Network Assisted GPS for Precision Fires is a developmental effort to improve performance of GPS-guided munitions (0203728A).  It requires pre-launch loading of target location and sufficient GPS satellite-related data at the weapon platform level to enable flight path and delivery of precision capable fires.  This hot start capability allows for rapid post-launch time-to-first-fix of GPS signal and maximum utilization of Precision Guided Munition (PGM) maneuver authority to ensure required target engagement performance.  This is especially critical for short flight times and steer-early solutions such as mortar and cannon based PGMs.  Local GPS Satellite visibility challenges due to vertical terrain/complex environment issues during normal combat operations can prohibit precision capable fires when using GPS Satellite data generated exclusively at the firing weapon platform (0203728A).  A system-of-systems Network Assisted GPS capability will be developed, integrated, and validated to overcome local GPS Satellite masking problems through the sharing of sufficient timely required GPS Satellite data via Wide-Area Network (WAN) and Local-Area Network (LAN) based materiel solutions that effectively and efficiently leverage mature technologies and taxpayer investments of existing acquisition programs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>AFATDS Increment 2 is the automated Command and Control (C2) system for the ground Fires Warfighting Function. AFATDS Increment 2 will permit the management and targeting analysis of the collective and coordinated target acquisition data, effective selection of munitions-target pairing from indirect fire weapons (land and sea based), as well as fixed and rotary wing aircraft against targets located throughout an area of operations.  AFATDS Increment 2 will develop a new software architecture by providing three distinct applications to support role-based functionality: Fire Support, Fire Control, and Fire Direction.  It leverages the Common Operating Environment (COE) and Command Post Computing Environment (CP CE) products and capabilities.  AFATDS Increment 2 provides a less complicated AFATDS software package to the Warfighter and is fully compliant with the Joint Command and Control Common User Interface (JC2 CUI) architectures.  

AFATDS Increment 2 will provide three distinct applications–Fire Support, Fire Control, and Fire Direction–that communicate with other systems via the Army's Lower Tactical Internet and Warfighter Information Network Tactical (WIN-T) communications network.  AFATDS Increment 2 will leverage the Command Post Computing Environment's common core database and core system functions/management that resides on the battle command server.  Using the web-based tools, the Brigade Combat Team (BCT) commander and his Fires staff can access other command centers via search wizards over WIN-T and internet gateways to the Global Information Grid (GIG). AFATDS Increment 2 will meet the operational need to provide Fires data to a central database repository within the BCT.  That repository will be accessible using web services or web-enabled search wizards to locate information within a BCT, adjacent BCTs or higher headquarters, thus supporting unified battle command.  AFATDS Increment 2 will be used to actively plan offensive operations and exploit electronic attack weapon systems through the use of planning tools for lethal and non-lethal effects and the status and readiness of the systems that can best support the commander's intent.  AFATDS Increment 2 will provide the supported maneuver commander the capability to plan, coordinate, rehearse, and execute integrated networked fires.  Networked fires include lethal and non-lethal platforms.  Net-centricity will enable the BCT commander to view targets that adjacent BCTs have encountered or engaged in their area of operations.  This capability enables the commander to:  exploit under-tasked air support assets; view/task weapons platforms based on coordinated command-supported relationships; and search target data files and repositories for enemy patterns that can be used in targeting and planning.

Project DU5 funds development of AFATDS Increment 2. Initial AFATDS Inc 2 (version 7.0) development entails decomposing the AFATDS Increment 1 (v6.8.1) baseline.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>AFATDS Increment 2 development supports the use of Interim DoDI 5000.02 (November 2013) systems acquisition instruction for Information Technology (IT) acquisition programs (using the IT Box requirements construct).  AFATDS Increment 2 capabilities will be developed over three distinct software versions - Versions 7.0, 7.1 and 7.2. AFATDS v7.0 will modernize and re-architect the AFATDS software to align with the requirements of the Inc 2 CDD. The Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) issued a memorandum in June 2011 approving the Capability Development Document (CDD) for AFATDS Increment 2. The JROC validated the Key Performance Parameters, assigned oversight authority to the Fires Center of Excellences Fire Support Command and Control Tactical Software Governance Board, and set a funding ceiling.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Joint Automated Deep Operations Coordination System (JADOCS) software provides joint fire support management, and common operational picture (COP) capabilities.  JADOCS complements the Mission Command architecture with joint and collaborative capabilities that can be employed and tailored based on the unit mission and operational situation.  JADOCS software provides integration between multiple joint command and control (C2) systems of the uniformed services involved in the targeting process at US Air Force (USAF), US Navy (USN), and US Marine Corps (USMC) Air Operations Centers (AOCs), Marine Expeditionary Forces (MEFs), Fleet Maritime Operations Centers (MOCs), and staff sections at the regional Combatant Commands (COCOMs), Special Operations Command (SOCOM), and Army Battlefield Coordination Detachments (BCDs), Army Service Component Commands (ASCC), Corps and Divisions. 

Project F19 funds cability maintenance for v1.0.5.2 and begins development of JADOCS Version 2.0 which is the final version of JADOCS to be developed with new functionality.  JADOCS V2.0 is required to incorporate critical Joint requirements into JADOCS.  These requirements include modification and updates for joint interfaces, updates to databases, and creation of non kinetic fires targeting.  JADOCS V2.0 development is slated to be performed by a government developer with work beginning in FY2014.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Joint Automated Deep Operations Coordination System (JADOCS) began as a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency technology demonstration, and has evolved through a series of Army-led Joint Advanced Concept Technology Demonstrations (ACTDs), culminating in a joint and combined deployed operational capability. The Vice Chief of Staff of the Army approved JADOCS for acquisition program status under the Capabilities Development for Rapid Transition (CDRT) process. The approved JADOCS Capability Production Document (CPD) dated 16 April 2012, documents the current JADOCS threshold capabilities that are in the field today. As the lead agency for managing JADOCS capabilities within the Department of Defense, the Fires Center of Excellence, tailored the JADOCS CPD to incorporate Field Artillery tasks not included in the currently fielded version (v 1.0.5.1) of the software. JADOCS retirement will occur when system capabilities are individually or collectively incorporated into Army, Service, or Joint programs or are no longer needed as determined by its multi-Service users. 

JADOCS Inc 1 is a software only development effort that will produce JADOCS v2.0 software, which will resolve technical requirements generated by the Joint Services that align with the CPD capabilities. JADOCS v2.0 will be the last major version of JADOCS software and will be the follow-on version to the development and fielding of the JADOCS 1.0.5.2 software versions. JADOCS v2.0 will be interoperable with AFATDS Increments 1 and 2.

The current fielded version of JADOCS software is 1.0.5.1. The targeting and fires functionality of this version are being incorporated into the AFATDS v6.8.1 software baseline. The fielding of the AFATDS v6.8.1 software (planned for Fiscal Year (FY) 15) will represent the initial merge of the JADOCS/AFATDS capabilities. This software will be provided to users to evaluate AFATDS software's ability to adequately perform the functions provided by the JADOCS software. Any changes, improvements, or further enhancements identified by the Services will be made to the AFATDS software. The JADOCS Joint fires and targeting features will continue to be incorporated into the AFATDS software and will be provided to users with the initial fielding of AFATDS Inc 2, v7.0 software (planned to start in FY18 timeframe). JADOCS v2.0 software (planned for fielding in the 4QFY17 timeframe). Users will continue to use JADOCS v2.0 until AFATDS v7.0 meets the total Joint Users requirements (expected with the full fielding of AFATDS v7.0 in FY18). 

Program Executive Officer, Command, Control, Communications -Tactical (PEO C3T) signed the JADOCS Milestone C Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) on 2 December 2013. The ADM approved MS C and authorized entrance into the Production and Deployment phase. The ADM also approved the acquisition strategy, APB and established the MS C exit criteria.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>Project code EF6 (JADOCS) and EF8 (AFATDS Incr I) were previously funded under AFATDS PE 0203726A (PB2014 BLIN 161).  

Project code EF7 - PFED Increment 2 is a new start in PB2015 ($3.505 million) to justify Pocket-sized Forward Entry Device (Increment 2) software development.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>There are three developmental efforts that are being executed concurrently: Joint Automated Deep Operations Coordination System (JADOCS) (project code EF6); Pocket-sized Forward Entry Device (Increment 2) (project code EF7); and Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) (Increment 1) (project code EF8).

Joint Automated Deep Operations Coordination System (JADOCS) software provides joint fire support management, and common operational picture (COP) capabilities.  JADOCS complements the Mission Command architecture with joint and collaborative capabilities that can be employed and tailored based on the unit mission and operational situation.  JADOCS software provides integration between multiple joint command and control (C2) systems of the uniformed services involved in the targeting process at US Air Force (USAF), US Navy (USN), and US Marine Corps (USMC) Air Operations Centers (AOCs), Marine Expeditionary Forces (MEFs), Fleet Maritime Operations Centers (MOCs), and staff sections at the regional Combatant Commands (COCOMs), Special Operations Command (SOCOM), and Army Battlefield Coordination Detachments (BCDs), Army Service Component Commands (ASCC), Corps and Divisions. Project EF6 funds development of JADOCS Version 2.0 which is the final version of JADOCS to be developed with new functionality.  JADOCS V2.0 is required to incorporate critical Joint requirements into JADOCS.  These requirements include modification and updates for joint interfaces, updates to databases, and creation of non kinetic fires targeting.  JADOCS V2.0 development is slated to be developed by a government agency with work beginning in FY2014.

The Pocket-sized Forward Entry Device (PFED) Increment 2 will be a software only application that operates on the existing Nett Warrior End User Device (EUD).  It will provide the dismounted Forward Observer (FO) and Fire Support Teams (FISTs) the capability and functionality to accurately and rapidly locate ground targets and enable the Nett Warrior Ensemble to digitally process a Call For Fire; linking the sensor to the shooter with an efficient integration of multiple acquisition programs. PFED Increment 2 aligns with the Army's Fires and Effects Concept of Operation and describes how fires and effects contribute to Networked Fires as part of the combined arms teams in Army, Special Operations Forces (SOF), and Joint operations.  PFED Increment 2 answers the Mobile Handheld Computing Environment requirement that all handheld applications reside on the Nett Warrior End User Device. PFED Increment 2 will provide Category 1 target mensuration via Precision Fires Imagery enabling the effective use of new precision munitions.  Project code EF7 funds the evolutionary software development of this handheld Fires Command and Control (C2) system.

AFATDS Increment 1 provides Army, Navy, and Marine Corps automated fire support command, control and communications and functions as the land component's automated Fire Support Command and Control (FSC2) system.  AFATDS is used in the Fires Warfighting Function to plan, execute, and deliver lethal and non-lethal fires within the overall Mission Command and Control (MC2) enterprise. The system interoperates and integrates with: over 80 different battlefield systems from Army, Marine Corps, Navy, and Air Force; and the German, French, Turkish, and Italian fire support command and control systems.  AFATDS fuses the essential situational awareness data, intelligence information and targeting data, in near real time, in order to effectively manage target selection and target engagement in accordance with the Maneuver Commanders guidance and priorities and to safely execute against friendly situational picture.  AFATDS pairs targets to weapons to provide optimum use of fire support assets and timely execution of fire missions.  AFATDS automates the planning, coordinating, and controlling of all fire support assets (field artillery, mortars, close air support, naval gunfire, attack helicopters, offensive electronic warfare, fire support meteorological systems, forward observers, and fire support radars).  AFATDS automatically implements detailed commander's guidance in the automation of operational planning, movement control, targeting, target value analysis, and fire support planning. AFATDS is being used in operations in Afghanistan.  Project EF8 funds development of AFATDS Version 6.8.1. AFATDS 6.8.1 fires capabilities are being enhanced to meet JADOCS ground fires requirements in order to remove JADOCS from the ground forces inventory. With the completion of AFATDS Version 6.8.1, the program office will complete the AFATDS Increment 1 development and will start the Increment 2 development in 4Q FY2014.  Final engineering reviews will be conducted and Government Confidence Testing, Information Assurance testing, and Certification testing will be completed.  Full materiel release of the software will be completed in 3Q FY2015 and universal fielding and training of the software will be conducted.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Joint Automated Deep Operations Coordination System (JADOCS) began as a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency technology demonstration, and has evolved through a series of Army-led Joint Advanced Concept Technology Demonstrations (ACTDs), culminating in a joint and combined deployed operational capability. The Vice Chief of Staff of the Army approved JADOCS for acquisition program status under the Capabilities Development for Rapid Transition (CDRT) process. The approved JADOCS Capability Production Document (CPD) dated 16 April 2012, documents the current JADOCS threshold capabilities that are in the field today. As the lead agency for managing JADOCS capabilities within the Department of Defense, the Fires Center of Excellence, tailored the JADOCS CPD to incorporate Field Artillery tasks not included in the currently fielded version (v 1.0.5.1) of the software. JADOCS retirement will occur when system capabilities are individually or collectively incorporated into Army, Service, or Joint programs or are no longer needed as determined by its multi-Service users. 

JADOCS Inc 1 is a software only development effort that will produce JADOCS v2.0 software, which will resolve technical requirements generated by the Joint Services that align with the CPD capabilities. JADOCS v2.0 will be the last major version of JADOCS software and will be the follow-on version to the development and fielding of the JADOCS 1.0.5.2 software versions. JADOCS v2.0 will be interoperable with AFATDS Increments 1 and 2.

The current fielded version of JADOCS software is 1.0.5.1. The targeting and fires functionality of this version are being incorporated into the AFATDS v6.8.1 software baseline. The fielding of the AFATDS v6.8.1 software (planned for Fiscal Year (FY) 15) will represent the initial merge of the JADOCS/AFATDS capabilities. This software will be provided to users to evaluate AFATDS software's ability to adequately perform the functions provided by the JADOCS software. Any changes, improvements, or further enhancements identified by the Services will be made to the AFATDS software. The JADOCS Joint fires and targeting features will continue to be incorporated into the AFATDS software and will be provided to users with the initial fielding of AFATDS Inc II, v7.0 software (planned to start in FY18 timeframe). JADOCS v2.0 software (planned for fielding in the 4QFY17 timeframe). Users will continue to use JADOCS v2.0 until AFATDS v7.0 meets the total Joint Users requirements (expected with the full fielding of AFATDS v7.0 in FY18). 

Program Executive Officer, Command, Control, Communications -Tactical (PEO C3T) signed the JADOCS Milestone C Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) on 2 December 2013. The ADM approved MS C and authorized entrance into the Production and Deployment phase. The ADM also approved the acquisition strategy, APB and established the MS C exit criteria.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Pocket-sized Forward Entry Device (PFED) Increment 2 will be a software only application that operates on the existing Nett Warrior End User Device (EUD).  It will provide the dismounted Forward Observer (FO) and Fire Support Teams (FISTs) the capability and functionality to accurately and rapidly locate ground targets and enable the Nett Warrior Ensemble to digitally process a Call For Fire; linking the sensor to the shooter with an efficient integration of multiple acquisition programs. PFED Increment 2 aligns with the Army's Fires and Effects Concept of Operation and describes how fires and effects contribute to Networked Fires as part of the combined arms teams in Army, Special Operations Forces (SOF), and Joint operations.  PFED Increment 2 answers the Mobile Handheld Computing Environment requirement that all handheld applications reside on the Nett Warrior End User Device. PFED Increment 2 will provide Category 1 target mensuration via Precision Fires Imagery enabling the effective use of new precision munitions.  

Project code EF7 funds the evolutionary software development of this handheld Fires Command and Control (C2) system.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>On 29 January 2014, the Army Acquisition Executive (AAE) signed the Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) approving the PFED Increment 2 Materiel Development Decision (MDD). The Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) officially approved entry into the acquisition management system at the Technology Development phase as an Acquisition Category (ACAT) III program with the Program Executive Officer (PEO), Command, Control and Communications-Tactical (C3T) as the Materiel Developer and Milestone Decision Authority.

PFED Increment 2 leverages an Army Science and Technology investment by transitioning a software application that has been developed and used in proponent experimentation events. Upon a successful Milestone B, this software application will be transitioned to PM Mission Command, the assigned project manager, to conduct all Army developmental and operational test and evaluation requirements.  Upon approval for Software Materiel Release, PM Mission Command will work together with PM Soldier Warrior to integrate the software application on Nett Warrior End User Devices (EUDs) and field to units based on the Nett Warrior fielding schedule.  Training on the PFED Increment 2 software will be conducted by PM Mission Command as units are fielded the capability.  Sustainment of the fielded software is the responsibility of PM Mission Command.

The PFED Increment 2 CPD was approved as an "Information Technology (IT) Box" requirement. As such, evolutionary development of the software will continue in order to meet emerging requirements that fall within the bounds of the approved IT Box.  PM Mission Command will continue to manage this aspect of software development, to be conducted by a Government organization. PM Mission Command will continue to work in tandem with PM Soldier Warrior to field and train future versions of the software, as described above.  Likewise, sustainment of future software versions will continue to be managed by PM Mission Command.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>There are two developmental efforts that are being executed concurrently on this budget item. They are Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) and Network Assisted Global Positioning System (GPS) for Precision Fires.  

AFATDS Increment 1 provides Army, Navy, and Marine Corps automated fire support command, control and communications and functions as the land component's automated Fire Support Command and Control (FSC2) system.  AFATDS is used in the Fires Warfighting Function to plan, execute, and deliver lethal and non-lethal fires within the overall Mission Command and Control (MC2) enterprise. The system interoperates and integrates with: over 80 different battlefield systems from Army, Marine Corps, Navy, and Air Force; and Coalition Forces fire support command and control systems.  AFATDS fuses the essential situational awareness data, intelligence information and targeting data, in near real time, in order to effectively manage target selection and target engagement in accordance with the Maneuver Commanders guidance and priorities and to safely execute against friendly situational picture.  AFATDS pairs targets to weapons to provide optimum use of fire support assets and timely execution of fire missions.  AFATDS automates the planning, coordinating, and controlling of all fire support assets (field artillery, mortars, close air support, naval gunfire, attack helicopters, offensive electronic warfare, fire support meteorological systems, forward observers, and fire support radars).  AFATDS automatically implements detailed commander's guidance in the automation of operational planning, movement control, targeting, target value analysis, and fire support planning. AFATDS is being used in operations in Afghanistan. Project 322 funds development of AFATDS Version 6.8.1. AFATDS 6.8.1 fires capabilities are being enhanced to meet JADOCS ground fires requirements in order to remove JADOCS from the ground forces inventory. With the completion of AFATDS Version 6.8.1, the program office will complete the AFATDS Increment 1 development and will start the Increment 2 development in 4Q FY2014.  Final engineering reviews will be conducted and Government Confidence Testing, Information Assurance testing, and Certification testing will be completed.  Full materiel release of the software will be completed in 3Q FY2015 and universal fielding and training of the software will be conducted. 

Network Assisted GPS for Precision Fires is a developmental effort to improve performance of GPS-guided munitions.  It requires pre-launch loading of target location and sufficient GPS satellite-related data at the weapon platform level to enable flight path and delivery of precision capable fires.  This hot start capability allows for rapid post-launch time-to-first-fix of GPS signal and maximum utilization of Precision Guided Munition (PGM) maneuver authority to ensure required target engagement performance. This is especially critical for short flight times and steer-early solutions such as mortar and cannon based PGMs. Local GPS Satellite visibility challenges due to vertical terrain/complex environment issues during normal combat operations can prohibit precision capable fires when using GPS Satellite data generated exclusively at the firing weapon platform. A system-of-systems Network Assisted GPS capability will be developed, integrated, and validated to overcome local GPS Satellite masking problems through the sharing of sufficient timely required GPS Satellite data via Wide-Area Network (WAN) and Local-Area Network (LAN) based materiel solutions that effectively and efficiently leverage mature technologies and taxpayer investments of existing acquisition programs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>The Stryker Program is submitted under a new Program Element for the FY 2015 President's Budget.  The previous program element was 0603653A, project C03 and C51, Advanced Tank Armament System (ATAS.)</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Army has approved engineering change proposals for the Abrams, Bradley and Stryker programs to restore lost platform capability and host inbound technologies.  

This Program Element (PE) corrects vehicle deficiencies identified in Army operations; continues technical system upgrades to include the integration of applicable technologies on ground systems; addresses needed evolutionary enhancements to tracked combat vehicles; and develops technology improvements which have application to or insertion opportunities across multiple Ground Combat Systems vehicles.  This PE provides combat effectiveness and Operating and Support (O&amp;S) cost reduction enhancements for the Abrams tanks, Bradley Fighting Vehicles and Stryker Family of Vehicles (FOVs) through a series of product improvements.

The strategy for Abrams and Bradley will focus on incrementally delivering capability to the warfighter to meet both near-term limitations as well as mitigating gaps and maintaining combat overmatch in the future.  This effort was approved by the Army Acquisition Executive in 3Q FY 2011.  

The Abrams M1A2 SEP V2 and M2/M3A3 Bradley Fighting Vehicles are at or exceed Space, Weight, and Power-Cooling (SWaP-C) limitations.  In order to host and restore lost platform capability, the Abrams Tank and Bradley Fighting Vehicle programs will execute a series of Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) to support the current embedded systems and to facilitate integration of technologies currently in development under other existing Programs of Record.  The ECPs are not intended to exceed the operational capability outlined in current system requirements documents, but rather to ensure that the existing system performance is not further degraded and that Army mission equipment packages can be integrated on the Abrams and Bradley Platforms.

Stryker Improvement program (EE2), will enable the Stryker Family of Vehicles (FOV) to host the future network without further degrading vehicle performance.  The upgrade will increase available electrical power while ensuring adequate mechanical power, weight margin, and cooling.  Combined with an in-vehicle network, this will ensure the FOV can host the future network while retaining its protection and mobility.  Funding in FY 15-19 supports continued development engineering efforts on the Stryker Engineering Change Proposal (ECP).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The M2/M3A3 Bradley Fighting Vehicle is at or exceeds Space, Weight, and Power-Cooling (SWAP-C) limitations. To restore lost platform capability and to host other Army Existing Programs of Record, the Bradley Fighting Vehicle program shall execute a series of Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs). ECP 1 improves vehicle's track and suspension while ECP 2 improves the power train and electrical system to enable the A3 fleet to host inbound technologies from Army Program of Records, including Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) and Joint Battle Command – Platfom (JBC-P). The ECPs are not intended to exceed the operational capability outlined in current system requirement documents, but rather to ensure that the existing system performance is not further degraded and that Army mission equipment packages can be integrated on the Bradley platform. ECP2 development effort will lead to a production start in FY17.  A separate integration effort begins in FY14 for an underbelly armor kit for improved survivability against blast threats.  Additionally, Improved FLIR (IFLIR) integration effort will begin in FY16 that will replace the current second generation FLIR for increased lethality through improved target acquisition capability.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Product Manager Bradley will execute an Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) reestablishing Space, Weight, Power and Cooling (SWAP-C) to facilitate integration of technologies being developed under existing Programs of Record (POR). The proposed ECP will restore lost capability, not to exceed operational envelopes outlined in current approved requirement documents. The ECP is scheduled to field in FY 2018 to address powerpack and electrical power upgrades, which will enable the vehicle to host Army directed inbound technologies with no further performance degradation to the vehicle. This ECP development will be executed on a sole source cost plus incentive fee contract to the current platform Original Equipment Manufacturer. Integration of the Improved Forward Looking Infrared (IFLIR) sights will be executed through a sole source cost plus contract with the Bradley Original Equipment Manufacturer beginning in FY16. The IFLIR system will be developed by Project Manager, Night Vision/Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and Target Acquisition (PM NV/RSTA) and be provided to Product Manager Bradley as a Horizontal Technology Integration effort.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

Replaces the Army's Armored Personnel Carrier (M113) Family of Vehicles (FoV). The Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV) is a materiel solution to support the Armored Brigade Combat Team (ABCT) across the Spectrum of Conflict by replacing five mission roles currently performed by the M113 Family of Vehicles (FOV) and integrating the current M113 FOV Mission Equipment Package (MEP) to a Military Vehicle Derivative (MVD).</r2:Description>

                                            <r2:Text>The Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) validated the Capabilities Development Document (CDD) on 16 Mar 2013. The Defense Acquisition Executive (DAE) approved the AMPV Acquisition Concept on 12 Feb 2013 and authorized release of a draft Request for Proposal (RFP) to industry on 21 Mar 2013. Product Manager (PdM) AMPV also held an Industry Day on 22 - 24 of April 2013 to support a competitive acquisition approach. Following the industry day, PdM AMPV revised the performance specification and acquisition strategy based on industry feedback. PdM AMPV held a Defense Acquisition Board (DAB) on 13 Aug 2013 for final release of the RFP to industry. The DAE directed the Army to re-evaluate the EMD schedule, LRIP contract and RAM Growth Curve.  Changes based on this direction resulted in the plan to release another draft RFP to industry on 26 Sep 2013.</r2:Text>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Stryker Modernization will enable the Stryker FOV to host the future network without further degrading vehicle performane.  The upgrade will increase available electrical power while ensuring adequate mechanical power, weight margin, and cooling.  Combined with a digital backbone, this will ensure the FOV can cost the future network while retaining its protection and mobility.  Funding in FY15-19 supports continued development engineering, prototype build and testing efforts on the Stryker Engineering Change Proposal (ECP).  Funding for this effort was previously funded in Program Element 0603653A/Project C51 and Project C03 (FY13).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Stryker ECP effort will buy back the vehicle space, weight, and power margin lost due to the addition of numerous kits in response to eleven years of war (20-combat rotations &amp; 30+ million total miles), in order to allow integration of the future network (as directed by VCSA in August 2011) without further degrading the performance of the platform.  In May 2012, Phase I (Design) of the Stryker ECP program was approved, permitting preliminary design and integration efforts on both the Flat Bottom (FB) and Double-V Hull (DVH) variants (completed).  In March 2013, Phase II approved upgrading the mechanical power, electrical power generation, chassis upgrades and the in-vehicle network for the DVH vehicles.  ECP Phase II contract awarded in Novermber 2013, continues development engineering, prototype build test and evaluation.  The Phase III (Production) decision point will determine the production requirements of the technologies selected in Phase II.  Beginning in FY15, PE Number 0203735A/Project EE2 funds the Stryker ECP program, which was originally funded by PE Number 0603653A/Project C03 (FY13) and Project C51 (through FY14).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Tactical Mission Command (TMC) is a suite of products and services that provide commanders and their staff executive decision making capability in a collaborative environment, planning tools, and Common Operational Picture (COP) management and other maneuver functional tools.  TMC satisfies requirements and capabilities identified in the Maneuver Control System (MCS) Good Enough Operational Requirements Document (ORD) and MCS 6.4 Capability Production Document (CPD) which includes Army migration to Department of Defense (DoD) net-centric environment.  The overarching capability includes a user-defined COP with integrated Command and Control (C2) and Situational Awareness (SA), map-centric collaboration, Army Battle Command System (ABCS) and other enabling system interoperability, data management, and enterprise services.  The suite of products include Command Post of the Future (CPOF), Command Web, Battle Command Common Services (BCCS), and Command Post Client (CPC), that provides the consolidate server and services infrastructure for systems supporting Army Battle Command from Battalion to Army Component Command, Battalion and Above Joint Convergence with the Marine Corps, and Tactical Web Portal for Knowledge management. TMC products and services are compliant with the joint technical architecture.  In addition, this project funds the development of a collaborative Mission Command (MC) environment for ABCS to operate more efficiently and effectively.  The MC environment will serve as a common foundation for functionality development and support by converging onto a common architecture and infrastructure.  MC Convergence/ Common Operating Environment (COE) development and integration will significantly enhance the ability of commanders and staff to effectively conduct collaborative mission planning and execution across a range of operations and spectrum of conflict.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>In accordance with the Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) requirements document approved in 2008, entitled Mission Command Essential Capability, software capability will be developed in 2-year increments as capability sets designed to deploy specified Mission Command Essential Capabilities to operating force commanders and their integrated battle staffs.
This strategy accounts for subsequent Army directives for Mission Command (MC) convergence and migration to the Army Common Operating Environment (COE); designed to optimize opportunities for improved interoperability among the Army Mission Command systems and applications, to capture the benefits of competition where possible, to reduce application and system redundancy, to ensure the rapid integration of new capability into warfighter systems,  to increase operational efficiency, reduce the physical footprint, and reduce logistics support and training requirements. The products developed under this funding line is an integral part of the Army Mission Command System of Systems.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The CH-47 Chinook is the only heavy lift helicopter for the Army and is an essential element of the current Army Aviation master plan.  This program funds improvements to the CH-47F System that include: T55-GA-714A engine control and component upgrades to increase power to support emerging 6K/95 requirements, continued development and testing of the Advanced Chinook Rotor Blades (ACRB) which will provide increased lift in high/hot conditions and reduce O&amp;S costs. Production of the ACRB will begin in FY 2017.  Funding also initiates advanced flight control and drive train component improvements to improve aircraft performance.  Development of requirements specifications, studies and risk reduction prototyping are also part of this effort.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The H-60L Digital BLACK HAWK is designed to update the existing H-60L analog architecture to a digital infrastructure enabling the upgraded aircraft to have a similar Pilot-Vehicle Interface (PVI) to the H-60M.  The program will address current capability gaps and meet operational requirements by employing an evolutionary acquisition approach to leverage mature technologies that have been successfully integrated on other military aircraft.  The program will reduce obsolescence and increase commonality and interoperability by installing a digital cockpit, bussing and upgrading the communication/identification suite, improving navigation guidance, and integrating Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE), digital moving map, and Joint Variable Message Format (JVMF) messaging.

The Improved Turbine Engine Program (ITEP) develops, tests, and qualifies the next generation turboshaft engine.  The Improved Turbine Engine (ITE) replaces the existing T700 engine design originated in the 1970's and meets the operational requirement of 6K/95.  The ITE will fit inside the existing engine bays of the Black Hawk and Apache Helicopters and provides a significant power enhancement of up to fifty percent (total of 3,000 shaft horsepower) with increased fuel efficiency.  Additional benefits include improved design life, enhanced reliability, lower maintenance cost and restored capability lost due to aircraft weight growth, without increasing the logistics footprint.  The program consists of system engineering and program management,detailed design engineering, design assurance, hardware manufacturing and testing, component and module level development and testing, system level testing and qualification, as well as integration into the airframe. 

FY 2014 funds system engineering/program management, continuing component testing, and initial airframe integration efforts.  All funding for ITEP for FY 2015 and beyond is located in Project Element (PE) 0203744A - Project EB1.  UH-60L Digital will remain in Project 504.  FY 2014 H-60L Digital ($17.3M)  funded within PE 0203744A.  Funds required for systems engineering/program management and preliminary hardware and software development leading to up to program readiness for preliminary design review

FY 2015 UH-60L Digital funds hardware and software development as well as prototype support. Tasks include Preliminary Design Review and Critical Design Review and commencement of the first aircraft build.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The FY 2015 budget request for Apache Block III (AB3) will fund the non-recurring engineering (NRE), development, and testing work associated with the planned remanufacture and new build of 690 Apache aircraft in the Block III configuration (deliveries began in Oct 2011).  The AB3 program consists of two Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAP), AB3A Remanufacture and AB3B New Build.  This project also addresses obsolescence and reliability challenges and provides increased combat capability to the aircraft.  Upgrades include: Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Level III-IV Control, Improved Situational Awareness, Upgraded Communications Suite, Improved Drive and Propulsion Systems, Improved Targeting Capability, Increased Computer Processing Capability and Speed, Improved Navigation Systems, and Improved Diagnostics and Maintainability.  Upgrades are integrated as incremental block modifications.  The program addresses operational shortfalls identified during real-world combat missions and meets Longbow Apache Capability Production Document (CPD) requirements for modernization.     

Funds will also provide for the development, integration and testing of the Modernized Rocket Launcher (MRL) with digital launcher electronics.

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The NRE will encompass subsystem integration and will utilize existing test aircraft, incorporate the technical insertions, and initiate appropriate qualification and operational flight-testing. The Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) effort includes a total quantity of 51 aircraft, with deliveries completing in December 2013.  These 51 LRIP aircraft will be used for operational testing, First Unit Equipped (FUE), and training base fielding. 

In Oct 2010, a contract for Apache Block III Lot 1 (8 aircraft) was awarded to initiate LRIP.  In April 2012, additional options for Lot 2a (16 aircraft), Lot 2b (19 aircraft) and Lot 2c (8 aircraft) were definitized.

In early 2012, the existing Engineering Manufacturing Development (EMD) effort was modified to incorporate development and testing to support the AB3 Lot 4 and Lot 6 production configurations.

In FY14, a contract for Apache Block III Lot 3, initiating Full Rate Production, is planned with options for Lot 4 and will continue to a total of 690 remanufactured and new build aircraft.

Training device concurrency will be maintained with each technical insertion. The EMD effort is managed as Cost Reimbursable.  Production efforts will be awarded as Firm Fixed Price (FFP) and include the Advance Procurement requirements.

In FY13, FY14, and FY15 MRL NRE will encompass US Government (USG) design of the Hydra Launcher Electronics Assembly (LEA), modification of the M261 launcher, launcher fabrication, and launcher testing.

Multi-year authority may be requested for the out years.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The budget line provides for Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE), development of supplemental type certificates (STC) and associated testing, and integration of all Army fixed wing aircraft to provide Communications, navigation and Surveillance (CNS), Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE), and Department of Defense (DoD) mandated safety equipment to meet current and evolving international and Army standards. FY 2015 Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) dollars in the amount of $0.819 million provides funding for developmental NRE for aircraft modifications to CNS, ASE, and integration of Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) Mission Equipment Packages (MEP).  The increased performance will permit the Army fixed wing aircraft to operate in compliance with other existing and emerging regulations.  As requirements for new avionics equipment continue, aircraft delays and airspace exclusions are likely for aircraft not properly equipped. Upgrade of communication and aircraft modifications will assure worldwide deployability for those required to deploy. This budget line will also provide funding for studies, evaluations and Analysis of Alternatives to support emerging Army fixed wing requirements for product improvements to support the Army fleet.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Improved Turbine Engine Program (ITEP) develops, tests, and qualifies the next generation turboshaft engine.  The Improved Turbine Engine (ITE) replaces the existing T700 engine design originated in the 1970's and meets the operational requirement of 6K/95.  The ITE will fit inside the existing engine bays of the Black Hawk and Apache Helicopters and provides a significant power enhancement of up to fifty percent (total of 3,000 shaft horsepower) with increased fuel efficiency.  Additional benefits include improved design life, enhanced reliability, lower maintenance cost and restored capability lost due to aircraft weight growth, without increasing the logistics footprint.  The program consists of system engineering and program management,detailed design engineering, design assurance, hardware manufacturing and testing, component and module level development and testing, system level testing and qualification, as well as integration into the airframe.

For FY 2014 and prior, all funding for ITEP was contained in PE 0203744A – Aircraft Modifications/Product Improvement Programs, Project 504.  FY 2015 funding provides for ITEP Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) contract award, and initial component design,and initial platform/engine integration trade studies.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Horizontal Battlefield Digitization is a strategy that allows warfighters, from the individual soldier and platform to echelons above corps, to share critical situation awareness (SA) and command and control (C2) information. It conducts analysis and evaluation of new information technologies, concepts, and applications of integrated management activities to meet the dynamic Army acquisition technology requirements. The strategy applies digital information technologies to acquire, exchange, and employ data throughout the operational environment, and provides a clear and accurate common operational picture for leaders at all levels. This timely sharing of information significantly improves the ability of commanders and leaders to quickly make decisions, synchronize forces and fires, and increase the operational tempo.  Digitization is a means of realizing a fully integrated C2/SA capability to the platoon level, including interoperability links with joint and multi-national ground forces. The major efforts included in the program element are: 1) Integration and synchronization of the Army's interoperability efforts, coordination of interoperability efforts between joint and multi-national forces, and the synchronization of combat material and training efforts to develop Army information technologies. 2) Systems engineering and integration of hardware and software interfaces between and across the warfighting functions and across multiple Program Executive Offices, providing System of Systems (SOS) capabilities that satisfy warfighter requirements and enable the execution of mission operations by providing one Common Operational Picture (COP)/Common Tactical Picture (CTP). 3) Support fielding of integrated systems to Active and Reserve Components (USARNG and USAR) in accordance with Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN). 4) Support of the the Army Equipping Enterprise System (AE2S) integration of the Force Development Investment Information System (FDIIS), Army Flow Model (AFM), and the Continuing Early Validation (CEaVa) programs into a single integrated system. This supports the Army's Equipment Modernization Strategy, Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) and consolidates capabilities to gain efficiencies. IAW the National Defense Authorization Act 804 and support of OSD's reports to Congress, the Army is poised to implement the "Agile Business Process" that will result in an iterative and incremental approach to software development and hardware/software capability integration.  This process will improve effectiveness in the identification, assessment and acquisition of capability solutions for the Army.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

FY15 Adjustments to Budget Years:  Funds for the development of the Avenger Product Improvement Program (PIP) addresses modernization and added capability.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Project 038 Avenger Product Improvement Program (PIP):  The Avenger Air Defense System is a lightweight, highly mobile surface-to-air missile and gun weapon system mounted on a High Mobility Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV).  The system employs a canopied turret consisting of a gunner position, two gyro-stabilized missile launcher pods containing four STINGER missiles each, a Forward Looking Infrared Receiver (FLIR), a Laser Range Finder (LRF), an Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) system, and a very high rate of fire .50 caliber machine gun.  The gun system is used against ground targets and to cover the Stinger missile dead-zone.  Avenger is capable of day, night and adverse weather operations, can be transported by UH-60L Blackhawk helicopter or C-130 aircraft, is air-droppable and can shoot on the move.  The system can also be operated by remote control from a protected position up to 50 meters away from the fire unit.  

The Avenger system is operated by a two-man crew to counter Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs), cruise missiles, attack helicopters, and high performance fixed wing/rotary wing aircraft. The system fills the line-of-sight rear component of the Forward Area Air Defense (FAAD) system.

These funds are provided for the Avenger PIP to address modernization and added capability. Avenger will remain in the force through the Fiscal Year (FY) 30 timeframe according to the Long Range Investments Requirements Analysis. Avenger fills a capability gap which will be permanently filled by the Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment 2 Intercept (IFPC2-I) which is fully fielded in FY30. The Avenger Fire Control Computer (AFCC) will undergo software and hardware upgrades that will enable the system to handle increased targeting capability realized with the latest version of the Forward Area Air Defense (FAAD) early warning system and ensure the system meets the latest Information Assurance (IA) requirements, upgraded analog to digital vehicle intercommunication system and Mode 5 cooperative target identification functions. 

Project DT5 Stinger Product Improvement: The Stinger Block I missile is an advanced, fire-and-forget, short-range, man-portable, air defense weapon system.  Stinger's mission is to provide the force with low-altitude air defense against fixed and rotary wing aircraft, unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and cruise missiles (CM).  Stinger employs an infrared (heat seeking)/ultraviolet seeker to guide to the target.  Stinger Block I has extensive infrared counter-countermeasure capabilities and can engage targets from any aspect to include head-on.  The missile utilizes a high-explosive, hit-to-kill warhead.  Stinger can be fired from the shoulder or from a variety of platforms to include vehicles, helicopters and UAS.  The missile is delivered as a certified round and requires no field testing or maintenance.  

The Stinger Product Improvement provides design, development, test and integration of a Proximity Fuze into the existing Stinger Block I missiles. The Proximity Fuze will improve system effectiveness against the evolving UAS threat. Unmanned Aerial System Defense (UAS-D) is a requirement of the Operational Requirements Document (ORD) for the Stinger Guided Missile System and validated by the Deputy Chief of Staff, G-3/5/7, Current and Future Warfighting Capabilities Division (DAMO-CIC) in memo dated 28 May 2013.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Stinger Block I missile is an advanced, fire-and-forget, short-range, man-portable, air defense weapon system.  Stinger's mission is to provide the force with low-altitude air defense against fixed and rotary wing aircraft, unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and cruise missiles (CM).  Stinger employs an infrared (heat seeking)/ultraviolet seeker to guide to the target.  Stinger Block I has extensive infrared counter-countermeasure capabilities and can engage targets from any aspect to include head-on.  The missile utilizes a high-explosive, hit-to-kill warhead.  Stinger can be fired from the shoulder or from a variety of platforms to include vehicles, helicopters and UAS.  The missile is delivered as a certified round and requires no field testing or maintenance.  

The Stinger Product Improvement provides design, development, test and integration of a Proximity Fuze into the existing Stinger Block I missiles. The Proximity Fuze will improve system effectiveness against the evolving UAS threat. Unmanned Aerial System Defense (UAS-D) is a requirement of the Operational Requirements Document (ORD) for the Stinger Guided Missile System and validated by the Deputy Chief of Staff, G-3/5/7, Current and Future Warfighting Capabilities Division (DAMO-CIC) in memo dated 28 May 2013.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>In Fiscal Year (FY) 12 the Stinger Based Systems (SBS) Product Office utilized Picatinny Arsenal to award a Proximity Fuze (Prox Fuze) development contract for the design, development, test and integration of a Proximity Fuze into existing Stinger Block I missiles.  The Proximity Fuze will improve system effectiveness against the evolving Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) threat. UAS Defense (UAS-D) is a requirement of the Operational Requirements Document (ORD) for the Stinger Guided Missile System and validated by the Deputy Chief of Staff, G-3/5/7, Current and Future Warfighting Capabilities Division (DAMO-CIC) in memo dated 28 May 2013.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS) is the United States (U.S) Army's primary 24/7, all-weather, and surface-to-surface artillery precision missile used by current and future Combatant Commanders to shape the battlefield with long-range fires against hard and soft stationary targets in open, complex, and urban environments. This effort will not build any new missiles or add to the overall inventory.   Block (Blk) 1 missiles currently have warheads (WHs) that are non-compliant with the 2008 Department of Defense (DoD) policy on cluster munitions (CM).   The modification program will take expired Blk 1 assets which have reached the end of their service life and reset to the contracted 10 year service life.  Under this modification effort, a policy compliant WH will replace the existing M74 bomblets and also replace electronics and propellants.  The Stockpile Reliability Program (SRP) will supply additional data to support extending the service life.  This effort effectively brings the expired inventory back into service, while meeting the DoD CM Policy, to engage imprecisely located/area targets up to 300 kilometers (km).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Environmental Information Technology Management (EITM) Program is an Office of the Secretary of Defense sponsored program that was assigned to the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army for Environment, Safety and Occupational Health as the Department of Defense (DoD) Executive Agent by the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics in 2001.  The DoD Directive 4715.1E defined EITM mission is to ensure efficient use of enterprise environment, safety and occupational health (ESOH) corporate information management processes by providing and sustaining requirement-driven ESOH corporate data management, Congressional-reporting and public outreach tools to the DoD, and other DoD stakeholders.  Funding provided for this program will allow EITM to develop a Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Installations and Environment directed Chemical Management Enterprise Information Integration capability that will allow Army net-centric hazardous material and ESOH 2.0 NetCentric data management capabilities per the Secretary of the Army Directive 2009-03 "Army Data Management" and DoD Directive 8320.2 "Data Sharing in a Net-Centric Department of Defense."  Prior to funding being committed, Army and DoD environmental information technology stakeholders meet to determine which high priority EITM interface requirements need upgrades to incorporate new security and other information technology requirements.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The PATRIOT system includes a family of hardware and software interceptors (GEM, PAC-2, PAC-3/MSE) and Ground Support Equipment.  The system is required to continue evaluating the engagement envelope defended area for the fielded application.  As software and hardware improvements are developed there is a continuing need for system level modeling, simulations, and tests.  Modeling and Simulation allow for performance assessment against all threats that would not be possible in flight tests due to cost, target and range constraints.  Flight testing is periodically required for validation of the Modeling and Simulation as well as satisfying ATEC/DOTE requirements of segment improvements. 



PATRIOT is an integral part of the overall Air and Missile Defense (AMD) Architecture and enables the incremental fielding of the system capability for Army Air and Missile Defense Battalions.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The design objective of the PATRIOT system is to provide an element of an integrated Ballistic Missile Defense system capable of being modified to cope with the evolving threat.  This strategy minimizes technological risks and provides a means of enhancing system capability through planned upgrades of deployed systems.  PAC-3 system development efforts further improve system capabilities against emerging and reactive threats.  The PAC-3 Missile Program focuses on developing, fabricating and testing the high velocity, hit to kill, surface to air missile and associated ground support equipment to provide essential increases in battle space, accuracy, lethality and firepower to counter and destroy evolving air defense threats.  The missile performance is demonstrated through a series of flight tests and modeling and simulation activities.  The PAC-3 MSE program evolves the PAC-3 system providing extended ranges, insensitive munitions enhancements, and greater logistical flexibility.  The PAC-3 MSE will be fielded to U.S. PATRIOT units.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Projects EG2/EG3. GMLRS rockets are surface-to-surface artillery rockets fired from the Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) and High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) launchers.  GMLRS rockets provide 24/7, all-weather precision fires to engage both area and point targets at short, medium, and long ranges.  

The GMLRS Program consists of three separate increments: GMLRS Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munition (DPICM) cluster munition to engage area or imprecisely located targets; GMLRS Unitary that utilizes a 200 lb high explosive warhead to engage point targets with limited collateral damage; and GMLRS Alternative Warhead (AW) that is being developed as a non-cluster munition to replace GMLRS DPICM.  GMLRS DPICM Production was terminated in response to the June 2008 Department of Defense (DoD) Cluster Munitions Policy.  GMLRS Unitary is currently in full rate production.  GMLRS AW is currently in the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase and scheduled to enter full rate production in FY2015.  The GMLRS AW rocket is 90% common with the Unitary variant.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The United States (U.S.) Army is funding the development of the Guided Mulitple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) Alternative Warhead (AW) increment under the 78G-GMLRS AW project code.  GMLRS AW is being developed as a non-cluster munition to replace GMLRS Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munitions (DPICM) and service the same area and imprecisely-located targets.  GMLRS DPICM Production was terminated in response to the June 2008 Department of Defense (DoD) Cluster Munitions Policy.

The GMLRS AW increment completed Milestone B (MS B) on February 19, 2012 and is currently in the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase.  The three-year EMD contract was awarded on March 30, 2012.  Funding was requested in FY2013 for the second year of the EMD contract and for other government and contracted EMD activities to include engineering developmental testing and the Critical Design Review (CDR).  GMLRS AW is scheduled for a combined Milestone C (MS C) and Full Rate Production (FRP) Decision in FY2015 and Initial Operational Capability (IOC) in FY2016.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Joint Tactical Ground Station (JTAGS) is a post-production, ACAT III program and is designated as a DoD Space Program.  JTAGS provides missile warning message data for the Air and Missile Defense (AMD) architecture and improves performance for Integrated Air and Missile Defense Fire Control Systems/Composite Army Air and Missile Defense Brigades. The JTAGS Program Element (PE) supports development and test to meet JTAGS ORD thresholds using improved sensors and algorithms as Pre-Planned Product Improvements (P3I).  Presently, JTAGS Block 1 is a transportable information processing system, receiving and processing in-theater, direct down-linked data from Defense Support Program (DSP) and other Infrared (IR) satellites. JTAGS then disseminates near real time warning, alerting, and cueing information on ballistic missile launches and other tactical events of interest throughout the theater using existing communication networks, providing critical support to Combatant Commanders in their Areas of Responsibility (AOR).  Four OCONUS deployed JTAGS units constitute DoD's only in-theater system providing space-based missile warning.  The fifth CONUS system is being used as an institutional trainer but is a deployable asset.   JTAGS is designated as the in-theater element of the United States Strategic Command's Theater Event System (TES). JTAGS supports all Theater Missile Defense pillars and by being located in-theater, affords the shortest sensor to shooter connectivity.  P3I Improvements will upgrade JTAGS to a new Block 2 configuration for operation with the next generation of Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) satellites, and will improve warning tactical parameters and timeliness.  JTAGS Block 2 P3I is on contract for a two-Phase development effort. Phase 1 deshelters five systems, adds SBIRS Geosynchronous (GEO) scanner capability (FY 2012-15) and updates hardware/software/communication systems.  Phase 2 activities include stereo SBIRS GEO starer sensor data and Net Centric capabilities (FY 2016-19).  JROC-Memos 197-12 and 113-13 directs fielding of JTAGS P3I Block 2 Phase 1 by FY15 and Phase 2 by FY 2017.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Joint Tactical Ground Station (JTAGS) is a post-production, ACAT III program and is designated as a DoD Space Program.  JTAGS provides missile warning message data for the Air and Missile Defense (AMD) architecture and improves performance for Integrated Air and Missile Defense Fire Control Systems/Composite Army Air and Missile Defense Brigades. The JTAGS Program Element (PE) supports development and test to meet JTAGS ORD thresholds using improved sensors and algorithms as Pre-Planned Product Improvements (P3I).  Presently, JTAGS Block 1 is a transportable information processing system, receiving and processing in-theater, direct down-linked data from Defense Support Program (DSP) and other Infrared (IR) satellites. JTAGS then disseminates near real time warning, alerting, and cueing information on ballistic missile launches and other tactical events of interest throughout the theater using existing communication networks, providing critical support to Combatant Commanders in their Areas of Responsibility (AOR).  Four OCONUS deployed JTAGS units constitute DoD's only in-theater system providing space-based missile warning.  The fifth CONUS system is being used as an institutional trainer but is a deployable asset.   JTAGS is designated as the in-theater element of the United States Strategic Command's Theater Event System (TES). JTAGS supports all Theater Missile Defense pillars and by being located in-theater, affords the shortest sensor to shooter connectivity.  P3I Improvements will upgrade JTAGS to a new Block 2 configuration for operation with the next generation of Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) satellites, and will improve warning tactical parameters and timeliness.  JTAGS Block 2 P3I is on contract for a two-Phase development effort. Phase 1 deshelters five systems, adds SBIRS Geosynchronous (GEO) scanner capability (FY 2012-15) and updates hardware/software/communication systems.  Phase 2 activities include stereo SBIRS GEO starer sensor data and Net Centric capabilities (FY 2016-19).  JROC-Memos 197-12 and 113-13 directs fielding of JTAGS P3I Block 2 Phase 1 by FY15 and Phase 2 by FY 2017.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Joint High Speed Vessel (JHSV) program is a merger of the Army's Theater Support Vessel (TSV) program and the Marine Corps/Navy High Speed intra-theater surface Connector (HSC) program into a joint (multi-service) High Speed Vessel program.
The JHSV program takes advantage of inherent commonality hull forms to create a more flexible asset for the Department of Defense and leverage the Navy's core competency in ship acquisition.  The JHSV program will provide high speed intra-theater surface connector capability to rapidly deploy troops and equipment together and then immediately transition to execute, even in the absence of developed infrastructure, and conduct deployment and sustainment activities in support of multiple simultaneous, distributed, decentralized battles and campaigns.  The primary missions include: support to Theater Security Cooperation Program (TSCP) and Global War on Terrorism (GWOT), littoral maneuver, and seabasing support.  Department of Army (DA) and Department of Navy (DoN) will maintain separate and distinct funding streams to support this joint program.  DA will resource to the critical Army requirement set validated for the joint Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) for High Speed Intra-theater Surface Connector (HSC)and the Capability Development Document (CDD) for JHSV .  DA and DoN will focus on the development of common capabilities, each Department will source their unique developmental costs for unique service capabilities that cannot be incorporated into a combined solution set. FY10/11 funding will procure for the Army Integrated Logistics Support (ILS)/Integrated Electronic Technical Manuals.(IETMs).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The JHSV program will combine the two separate programs (Theater Support Vessel (TSV) - Army and High Speed Connector (HSC) - Navy) and take advantage of inherent commonality of hull forms to create a more flexible asset for the Department of Defense.  Based on the efforts accomplished and data collected to date by the two services, it appears that a hardware solution will incorporate the evolutionary development of commercial based high speed vessel technology employing integrated military unique capabilities/adaptations.  The JHSV would be acquired competitively and production would be based in the United States.  The Joint High Speed Vessel (JHSV) program's updated Acquisition Strategy is currently under development.  The JHSV program Milestone A Defense Acquisition Board (DAB) was in April 2006. Milestone B occurred November 2008.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

Adjustment 1: DV4 Key Management Infrastructure was decreased $.489 Million while DV5 Crypto Modernization was increased $.852 Million, for a net increase of $0.363 Million.  

Adjustment 2: Army Key MGT System funding was reduced by $1.227 Million. 

Adjustment 3: Information Assurance funding was reduced by $2.443 Million.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Information Asurance Development supports the implementation of the National Security Agency (NSA) developed Communications Security (COMSEC) technologies into the Army by providing COMSEC system capabilities through encryption, trusted software or standard operating procedures, and integrating these mechanisms into specific systems in support of securing the National Network Enterprise.  This entails architecture studies, system integration, testing, certification, and accreditation of COMSEC systems and equipment.  COMSEC technology ensures total signal and data security for all Army information systems to include any operational enhancement and specialized Army configurations.  The program also assesses, develops, and integrates COMSEC tools (hardware and software) which provide protection for fixed infrastructure posts, camp or station networks as well as tactical networks.  The cited work is consistent with Strategic Planning Guidance and the Army Modernization Strategy.  

Information Assurance Development funding supports the technical assessment and specifications documentation of cryptographic, key management and Information Assurance (IA) technologies developed under the direction of the National Security Agency (NSA), the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), Joint Services, and commercial developers to secure National Security Systems (NSS) and National Security Information (NSI).  Technical evaluations assess the security, operational effectiveness and network interoperability of advanced concept technologies to identify fundamental building blocks for Army IA solutions. 

The Army Key Management System (AKMS) is the Army's implementation of the National Security Agency's (NSA) Electronic Key Management System (EKMS) program automating the functions of Communications Security (COMSEC) key management, control, and distribution, thereby limiting adversarial access to, and reducing the vulnerability of, Army Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence (C4I) systems. NSA's legacy EKMS infrastructure began its transition to the Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) in FY2012. The transition is set to be completed by the EKMS sunset date of December 2017 and will require a minimum of 528 Management Client Nodes (MGCs) to transition the existing Army COMSEC accounts from Local COMSEC Management System (LCMS) to KMI. 

Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) provides an integrated, operational environment that will bring essential key management personnel and functions in-band. KMI achieves an over the network key (OTNK) management solution to support emerging cryptographically modernized systems. The KMI client nodes are the Army's subset of the National Security Agency's (NSA's) KMI Program supporting DoD Global Information Grid (GIG) Net Centric and Crypto Modernization Initiatives and supports emerging requirements transitioned from the Army Key Management System (AKMS).  The Mission Planning/Mission Support System (MP/MSS) Interface for KMI will create a secure and highly automated interface to enable transparent provisioning of KMI products. The interface shall facilitate transparent communications between MP/MSS and KMI to achieve integration by bridging the gap between provisioning services and the communications net plan of the Warfighter.

The Crypto Modernization program supports the implementation of the National Security Agency (NSA) developed Communications Security (COMSEC) technologies into the Army by providing COMSEC system capabilities through encryption, trusted software or standard operating procedures, and integrating these mechanisms into specified systems in support of securing the National Network Enterprise in as transparent a manner as possible.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Army Key Management System (AKMS) is the Army's implementation of the National Security Agency's (NSA) Electronic Key Management System (EKMS) program automating the functions of Communications Security (COMSEC) key management, control, and distribution, thereby limiting adversarial access to, and reducing the vulnerability of, Army Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence (C4I) systems. 
NSA's legacy EKMS infrastructure began its transition to the Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) in FY2012. The transition is set to be completed by the EKMS sunset date of December 2017 and will require a minimum of 528 Management Client Nodes (MGCs) to transition the existing Army COMSEC accounts from Local COMSEC Management System (LCMS) to KMI. 

AKMS supports the Mission Planning/Mission Support System (MP/MSS), a critical component of the transition to the Army Key Management Infrastructure (AKMI). MP/MSS creates a secure, highly automated interface enabling transparent provisioning of KMI products. MP/MSS is developed by NSA. Each service is responsible for integration efforts specific to their infrastructure requirements. Updates to the MP/MSS Interface Specification and additional capabilities for the base interface will be completed in FY2014. 

The KOV 21 card, previously in production through NSA for use in the Simple Key Loader (SKL) and the Secure DTD 2000 System (SDS), is nearing the end of life due to unavailability of parts. Redesigning and developmental efforts using modern and readily available components for use in the Army's SKL devices are currently underway. The redesign of the current KOV 21 card has been dubbed the KOV 21-A and is an extension of the KOV 21 card as a technology insertion. 

AKMS also supports the efforts of Over the Network Keying (OTNK) and Over the Air Rekeying (OTAR) for legacy devices including the Simple Key Loader (SKL). OTNK is a requirement in the Next Generation Load Device (NGLD) CPD and KMI CI-2 CPD. OTNK will allow KMI to extend Distribution Services to Type 1 devices over the network thus simplifying key change-over and task reorganization. OTAR is the method of updating and changing encryption keys in a two-way radio system over the radio channel. The use of OTAR drastically reduces the distribution of physical keying material and the physical process of loading cryptographic devices with key tapes. OTNK and OTAR developments are expected to begin in FY2016 and continue throughout the POM. Developing this capability in the SKL will allow the ~1.5M legacy End Crypto Units (ECUs) to be recognized on the KMI network until they can be upgraded to be KMI aware.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Army Key Management System (AKMS) Milestone III was conducted/ approved in FY 1999. Local COMSEC Management System (LCMS) completed fielding of software v5.1.0.5 in FY 2013 and is anticipating software v5.2EE fielding to begin in FY 2014 to all Communications Security (COMSEC) custodians in order to provide encrypted key capabilities. LCMS hardware refresh began 2QFY10. AKMS supports the transition from NSA's EKMS infrastructure to the Key Management Infrastructure (KMI). 

The AKMS acquisition strategy to procure Simple Key Loaders (SKLs) was updated in an Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) approved by the PEO C3T Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) 3QFY02. Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) began SKL Post Deployment Software Support (PDSS) efforts in 1QFY09. Software upgrades are released annually. SKL is currently operating on version 8.0 with version 9.0 expected in late FY 2014. In FY 2013, an Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) was initiated to address hardware obsolescence issues that impact operational mission. 

The Automated Communications Engineering Software (ACES) is currently undergoing a hardware refresh to be completed in FY 2014. ACES is currently operating on version 3.3. Continued enhancements and support of AKMS next generation software tools to meet emerging Army systems' requirements are also underway.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>Key management Infrastructure (KMI) (DV4) was realigned from project 491 in FY2014.  KMI supports infrastructure requirements in support of Key Management.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) provides an integrated, operational environment that brings essential key management personnel and functions in-band. KMI achieves an over the network keying (OTNK) solution to support emerging cryptographically modernized systems. The Army Key Management Infrastructure (AKMI) is the Army's subset of the National Security Agency's (NSA's) KMI Program supporting Department of Defense (DoD) Global Information Grid (GIG) Net Centric and Crypto Modernization Initiatives and supports emerging requirements transitioned from the Army Key Management System (AKMS).

The Mission Planning/Mission Support System (MP/MSS) for KMI creates a secure and highly automated interface to enable transparent provisioning of KMI products. The interface facilitates transparent communications between MP/MSS and KMI to achieve integration by bridging the gap between provisioning services and the communications net plan of the WarFighter. The MP/MSS Interface Specification defines the interface between the KMI Management Client Node (MGC) and the Mission Planning System operating on the Secure Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET). This interface definition covers the key ordering, management, and distribution transactions that were decomposed based upon an Army Mission Planning System collaborating with KMI to fulfill mission requirements in a highly automated manner. The initial developmental efforts for MP/MSS were carried in the AKMS line through FY 2014. Continuing support relative to KMI requirements and additional capabilities for the interface are scheduled to begin in FY2015. Activities include Application Programming Interface (API) requirements that are defined in the MGC Spiral II. Major capabilities include development of mission planning data fields, access control, signature validation, Tier 3 Accounting Data Exchange, MP/MSS registration with KMI, and product request management. These interfaces are required for integration into the Army's existing Key Management Planner, Automated Communications Engineering Software/Joint-Automated Communications Electronics Operating Instruction Systems (ACES/JACS). 

AKMI also supports efforts of OTNK and Over the Air Rekeying (OTAR) for emerging devices including  the Simple Key Loader (SKL). OTNK is the KMI interface for providing net-centric services to the customers of KMI. OTNK is expected to allow KMI to extend Distribution Services to Type 1 devices. OTAR is the method of updating or changing encryption keys in a two-way radio system over the radio channel. The use of OTAR drastically reduces the distribution of physical keying material and the physical process of loading cryptographic devices with key tapes. OTNK and OTAR developments are expected to begin in FY2016 and continue throughout the POM.

The KOV 21 card, previously in production through NSA for use in the Simple Key Loader (SKL) and the Secure DTD 2000 System (SDS), is nearing the end of life due to unavailability of parts. Redesigning and developmental efforts using modern and readily available components for use in the Army's SKL and NGLD devices are currently underway. The redesign of the current KOV 21 card has been dubbed the KOV 21-A and is an extension of the KOV 21 card as a technology insertion. The KOV 21-A will also address requirements codified in the NGLD CPD and the KMI CPD that were technologically unachievable with the KOV 21 card. Through insertion of the KOV-21A into a technologically enhanced SKL, NGLD Medium requirements and OTNK can be achieved to take full advantage of the KMI architecture.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Army Key Management Infrastructure (AKMI) is the Army's implementation of the National Security Agency's (NSAs) Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) ACAT ID program. The initial Army Acquisition Program Baseline (APB) for its implementation of KMI was signed on 26 Jan 2012. KMI Clients purchased in FY2012 were Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) Management Clients (MGCs). Deliveries of LRIPS began in FY 2013. KMI MGCs purchased in FY2013 were Full Rate Production (FRP) MGCs with deliveries beginning 12 months after FRP contract award which occurred in 4QFY13. RDTE efforts are underway to provide communication within the KMI architecture for legacy devices. Current sunset for Electronic Key Management System (EKMS) is scheduled for December 2017. The Next Generation Load Device (NGLD) Capability Production Document (CPD) was signed 03 September 2013 and anticipated procurements of NGLD Small and NGLD Medium devices were slated to begin in FY14 but are delayed due to the Bipartisan Budget Act decrements.  Modifications to the existing Automated Communications Engineering Software (ACES) will be made to support planning requirements and key distribution for KMI.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program supports the implementation of the National Security Agency (NSA) developed Communications Security (COMSEC) technologies into the Army by providing COMSEC system capabilities through encryption, trusted software or standard operating procedures, and integrating these mechanisms into specified systems in support of securing the National Network Enterprise in as transparent a manner as possible.  

This entails architecture studies, system integration and testing, installation kits, and certification and accreditation of Automation Information Systems.  The program assesses, develops and integrates emerging Information Assurance (IA)/COMSEC tools (hardware and software) which provide protection for fixed infrastructure post, camp and station networks as well as efforts on tactical networks.  The cited work is consistent with Strategic Planning Guidance and the Army Modernization and Strategy Plan.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>This program creates tools that can be used with current and future methodologies in order to determine what amount of cryptographic solutions can be deployed at the tactical edge.  This experimentation will allow for the WarFighter to have optimized solutions tailored for their specific program requirements while also showing trade-offs between competing solutions.  Examples of common analysis to be performed are comparisons in encryption implementations, network initialization overhead, comparison of emerging Commercial Solutions for Classified architectures with COMSEC architectures, development of new network security and management protocols optimized for low-bandwidth environments and impact of emerging dynamic capabilities that evade or obstruct the adversary.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Global Combat Support System-Army (GCSS-Army) program has two components: a functional component titled GCSS-Army and a technology enabler component titled Army Enterprise Systems Integration Program (AESIP) (formerly Product Lifecycle Management Plus (PLM+)).  GCSS-Army coupled with AESIP are information and communications technology investments that will provide key enabling support to the transformation of the Army into a network-centric, knowledge-based future force.  The GCSS-Army approved Joint Capability Description Document (CDD) requires an enterprise approach to replace current logistics and maintenance Standard Army Management Information Systems (STAMIS). GCSS-Army will provide the Army's Sustainment Support for the warfighter with a seamless flow of timely, accurate, accessible and secure information management that gives combat forces a decisive edge. AESIP will provide the system's enterprise hub services, centralized master data management and cross-functional business intelligence/analytics.  GCSS-Army will implement best business practices to streamline supply, accountability, maintenance, distribution, and reporting procedures in support of the future force transition path of the Army Campaign Plan.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>GCSS-Army is the tactical unit / installation logistics and financial system for the U.S. Army. GCSS-Army is an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solution that will track supplies, spare parts and organizational equipment. It will track unit maintenance, total cost of ownership and other financial transactions related to logistics for all Army units. This modernized application will subsume outdated Standard Army Management Information Systems (STAMIS) that are not financially compliant and integrate about 40,000 local supply and logistics databases into a single, enterprise-wide authoritative system. GCSS-Army will be financially compliant and is a key component for the Army Enterprise strategy to be financially auditable by the end of FY17. When fully deployed, GCSS-Army will affect every supply room, motor pool, direct support repair shop, warehouse, DOL and property book office in the Army.
GCSS-Army will modernize automated logistics by implementing best business practices to streamline supply operations, maintenance operations, property accountability, and tactical logistics and financial management and integration procedures in support of the Future Force transition path of the Army Campaign Plan.  GCSS-Army is a key component of the Federated ERP Integration solution that will optimize tactical logistics and finance domain business processes into a single federated approach.  It will eliminate the need for extensive maintenance and modification of aging, diverse software systems resulting in improved and efficient change control and configuration management through implementation of an enterprise system.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>GCSS-Army has an evolutionary acquisition strategy as defined in DoD Directive 5000.01 and DoD Instruction 5000.02 and will define, develop and produce/deploy an initial, militarily useful (and supportable) operational capability based upon proven technology, time-phased requirements, projected threat assessments, and demonstrated manufacturing capabilities in as short a time as possible.  The system will be developed in multiple releases as functional capabilities are defined and as integration and synchronization opportunities with related systems present opportunities for subsequent releases.  Release 1.2 (Wave 2) will be a viable stand alone capability that will not require subsequent releases to be operational.  

GCSS-Army is being implemented in three releases to ensure program success. 

Release 1.0 replaces: Standard Army Retail Supply System (SARSS) at one Direct Support Unit (DSU) in the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment (ACR), Fort Irwin, California. An Operational Assessment (OA) was conducted on Release 1.0 and information is gathered through Continuous Evaluation. 

Release 1.1 subsumes Release 1.0 and replaces the SARSS, Property Book Unit Supply Enhanced (PBUSE), Standard Army Maintenance System - Enhanced (SAMS-E) and Standard Army Maintenance System Installation Enhanced (SAMS-IE) legacy systems. Moreover, it includes: Supply (Tactical and Installation Warehouse and Materiel Management); Field-level and Installation Based Maintenance; Property Accountability (Property Book, Unit Level Supply, and Unit Basic Load Ammunition); Force Element and Defense Forces Public Security (Allows Task Organization of Personnel, Equipment and Associated Property Accountability, Maintenance and Finance Actions); Store and Forward capability; Interoperability with STAMIS systems; Tactical and Installation Finance (Cost Management, Funds Distribution and Execution, Fund Status Reporting, and General Fund Enterprise Business System (GFEBS) Data Synchronization); Hub services; and Enterprise Master Data Management. Release 1.1 provides over 80% of the required GCSS-Army capability; it subsumes Release 1.0 and replaces the SARSS, Property Book Unit Supply Enhanced (PBUSE), Standard Army Maintenance System - Enhanced (SAMS-E) and Standard Army Maintenance System Installation Enhanced (SAMS-IE) legacy systems. 

Release 1.2 (Wave 2) provides enhanced capabilities such as disconnected operations,increased financial capabilities, expanded enterprise master data management and interface with the Aviation Logistics Enterprise - Platform (ALE-P) Program. Release 1.2 (Wave 2) does not by itself replace any additional Systems. Release 1.2 (Wave 2) represents the complete baseline with all required capabilities provided.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Army Enterprise Systems Integration Program (AESIP), mission is to integrate Army business processes by providing a single source for enterprise hub services, centralized master data management, and business intelligence and analytics. AESIP is the principle GCSS-Army Business Intelligence system and will aggregate data for enterprise reporting. AESIP will support the Army's federated approach and enable the integration of end-to-end logistical and financial processes. The Army has successfully addressed concerns about the lack of integration of ERPs by leveraging AESIP core capabilities and expanding those benefits across the Army enterprise. AESIP will be an Army specific commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) web portal implementation via the NetWeaver Platform from developer Systems Applications and Products (SAP) American Group to support Army process scenarios and requirements that will provide core competencies:

Enterprise Service Bus (Hub Services) - For a Service oriented, Single Point of Entry to connect, mediate, and control the exchange of data.
Enterprise Business Intelligence/Business Warehouse - Aggregates data from ERP and non-ERP systems to provide flexible Enterprise level reporting.
Enterprise Master Data Management - For a single source of authoritative data and improved workflow and business processes. 

The AESIP solution establishes a framework for a fully integrated ERP centric environment that will ultimately provide Commanders Total Visibility from Factory to Battlefield thereby ensuring delivery of the right equipment to the right unit at the right time, while reducing backlogs of material on the battlefield.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Military Satellite Communication (MILSATCOM) systems are joint program/project efforts to satisfy ground mobile requirements for each Service, the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), the National Command Authority, the combatant commanders, the Office of the Secretary of Defense, and other governmental, non-DoD users.  The worldwide MILSATCOM systems are: the Super High Frequency (SHF) Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS); the Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS); the MILSTAR Extremely High Frequency (EHF) Low Data Rate (LDR) and Medium Data Rate (MDR); the Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF); and future MILSATCOM capabilities. All of these systems are required to support legacy, interim and emerging communication space architectures and Future Force requirements. The Army is responsible for materiel development, acquisition, product improvement, testing, fielding and integrated logistics support of ground satellite terminals and SATCOM control subsystems and all associated equipment used to provide range extension of Mission Command Networks and Systems. The Army also participates in the development of MILSATCOM programs, including architectures, payloads, waveforms, antennas and terminal developments to ensure US Army equities are appropriately addressed with our sister services.  This includes technology assessment efforts associated with the integration of MILSATCOM components to US Army Landwarnet. This responsibility also includes maintaining the life cycle logistics support required to achieve end-to-end connectivity and interoperability, satisfying JCS network operations in support of the President, JCS, combatant commanders, Military Departments, Department of State, and other government Departments and Agencies.
This program is designated as a DoD Space Program.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides funds to develop Satellite Communication (SATCOM) ground subsystem equipment and software in support of Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) validated Mission Command Network and Systems requirements for the worldwide Defense Enterprise Wideband SATCOM System (DEWSS).  DEWSS is composed of the Super High Frequency (SHF) Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS) and Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) programs, which are required to support legacy, interim and emerging communication space architectures and future Force requirements.  Expansion of the WGS constellation and upgrades to both DSCS and WGS are vital to support the Army's emerging power projection and rapid deployment role.  DSCS and WGS provide multiple channels of tactical end-to-end connectivity and interoperability with strategic networks and national decision-makers, satisfying JCS network operations in support of the President, JCS, combatant commanders, military departments, Department of State and other government departments and agencies.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>FY15 funding finances Project Manager, Defense Communications and Army Transmission Systems (PM DCATS) netcentric systems engineering, modem risk mitigation, and DoD Information Assurance Certification Accreditation Process (DIACAP) support.  Funding provides for SATCOM terminal upgrades, enhancement of baseband throughput capabilities, technology insertion and upgrades which enhance decision support capabilities, allowing for full utilization of Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) capabilities.  Both the Wideband SATCOM Operational Management System (WSOMS) and the Enterprise Wideband SATCOM Terminal System (EWSTS) Capability Production Documents (CPDs) contain Netcentric-Ready Key Performance Parameters (NR-KPPs) as required by CJCSI 6212.01C.  Netcentric efforts are required to facilitate the migration from the current trunk-based communications systems to Internet Protocol (IP) based systems and to engineer, test and integrate IP based capabilities into EWSTS and WSOMS systems.  Studies, risk mitigation, system integration and advanced demonstrations for netcentric baseband and policy based control will accommodate technology insertion, data sharing, remote operations, architecture efforts and use of commercial technology, thus ensuring the life of the Defense Enterprise Wideband System (DEWSS) terminal family beyond 2025 and reducing lifecycle costs and enterprise requirements on the WGS and Defense Satellite Communication System (DSCS) satellites in the future.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM) System Engineering (SE) provides centralized funding for US Army participation in the joint development of MILSATCOM programs. This includes engineering, technical and cost related analyses supporting architecture, payloads, network and terminal requirement and design decisions across all MILSATCOM programs.
Develop Protected Communications on the Move (PCOTM) terminals by participating in the FY14 Department of Defense Analysis of Alternatives/USAF Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) and applying the study results and leverage/transition low profile Ka/Q band antenna technology to satisfy the Army's PCOTM requirement.  Provides technology maturation and risk reduction for capability insertion into Project Manager Warfighter Information Network – Tactical (PM WIN-T) program of record and insures interoperability with Joint satellite constellations.
Develop a low size, weight and power (SWaP) Ku/Ka band SATCOM antennas for Army's Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) on the move requirement and reduce programmatic technical risk for WIN-T Program of Record (PoR) integration.  Leverage tech base development efforts of multiband, low cost, low profile antennas for a lower cost capability for current and future heavy combat vehicles (M-1, Bradley).

FY15 funds support the continued systems engineering required to mature technology options that demonstrate potential based on the results of the AoA and BAA studies.  These efforts have a direct impact on the ability of the WIN-T Military Wideband SATCOM, Commerical SATCOM, and Protected SATCOM on the move for WIN-T with minimal development and programmatic risk.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>Funds in this program element are a reallignment of funds from the MILSATCOM System Engineering line (PE 0303142A, PROJECT 456) for more efficient, effective program management. The T2C2 efforts were previously funded under PE 0303142A, PROJECT 456 in FY13 &amp; FY14. This project element is not a new start.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Transportable Tactical Command Communications (T2C2) extends the WIN-T Network to small company and team sized early entry units that don't have organic WIN-T. T2C2 provides robust voice and data communications capabilities in the early phases of Joint operations. T2C2 will also integrate these users into the higher capacity Warfighter Information Network Tactical (WIN-T) network and extend that network to the tactical edge. Funding will be used for testing the T2C2 systems (Lite &amp; Heavy) in preparation of Full Material Release (FMR) and Full-Rate Production (FRP) scheduled for FY2017, along with T2C2, with testing in FY2013-2016, specifically Interoperability certification, Environmental testing and network testing FY2015/2016, and Initial Operational Test &amp; Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) and Joint Integration Test Command (JITC) certification in FY2016.
T2C2 Lite (formerly Variant 1) enables small team reporting and situational awareness for early entry and initial phases of Joint operations.
T2C2 Heavy (formerly Variant 2) supports the small command post in phases three through five of Joint operations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Global Command and Control System-Army (GCCS-A): This project is the Army component system that directly supports the implementation of the Global Command and Control System Family of Systems. GCCS-A provides automated command and control tools for Army Strategic and Operational Theater Commanders to enhance warfighter capabilities throughout the spectrum of conflict during joint and combined operations in support of the National Security. The GCCS-A developed software systems dramatically improves the Army's ability to analyze courses of action; develop and manage Army Forces; and ensure feasibility of war plans. In accordance with Army Command Post Computing Environment and Joint Command and Control objectives, GCCS-A will be re-architected away from a scalable process architecture based server - thick client architecture to a virtualized server - web client architecture hosted on Battle Command Common Services and Mission Command Workstation by the end of Fiscal Year 2015. GCCS-A strategic tools for readiness reporting have been modernized and replaced with the Defense Readiness Reporting System - Army (DRRS-A), a suite of web based applications for Army Readiness, Force Registration and Force Projection.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Global Command and Control System-Army (GCCS-A):  This project is the Army component of the Global Command and Control System (GCCS) Family of Systems (FoS). GCCS-A provides automated command and control tools, including Force readiness, planning and movement, and situational awareness, for Army Strategic and Operational Theater commanders to enhance warfighter capabilities throughout the spectrum of conflict during Joint and combined operations in support of National Security. GCCS-A dramatically improves the Army's ability to analyze courses of action, develop and manage Army forces and execute war plans. GCCS-A links the GCCS-Joint Common Operating Picture with the Army Mission Command systems. In accordance with Army Command Post Computing Environment and Joint Command and Control objectives, GCCS-A will be re-architected away from a scalable process architecture based server - thick client architecture to a virtualized server - web client architecture hosted on Battle Command Common Services and Mission Command Workstation by Fiscal Year 2015. GCCS-A strategic tools for readiness reporting have been modernized and replaced with the Defense Readiness Reporting System - Army (DRRS-A), a suite of web based applications for Army Readiness, Force Registration and Force Projection. DRRS-A is currently implementing the Global Force Management Data Initiative (GFMD-I) for consumption of authoritative force structure data.

Based on Congressional direction (Section 247 of Fiscal Year 2010 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA)), the Secretary of Defense submitted reports to the congressional defense committees detailing the consolidation of the Net Enabled Command Capability system with the GCCS FoS. As part of that effort, it was determined that GCCS-A will be included in the modernization of the command and control systems within the DoD under the Joint C2 framework. While sustaining and synchronizing current fielded operations, the Army will modernize and enhance current capabilities to support both the Service and Joint warfighters as part of a synchronized, orchestrated DoD wide effort that will transition the GCCS FoS into a more agile, net-centric, service oriented environment by developing a virtualized server and web client based GCCS-A Global Lite-Army baseline ready for certification testing in Fiscal Year 2015.

Fiscal Year 2015 funding supports certification testing of the GCCS-A Bridge Effort in conjunction with Common Operating Environment testing to ensure that GCCS-A Bridge Effort software is successfully configured as a virtual machine on Battle Command Common Services and is interoperable with Army and Joint Mission Command Systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>GCCS-A was slated for replacement by the future DoD Command and Control (C2) system, the Net Enabled Command Capability (NECC) program.  The NECC program was cancelled by the Defense Acquisition Executive (DAE) on 2 November 2009.  Under current plans, GCCS-A will be modernized to meet the requirements defined in the Joint C2 Capability Development Document (CDD), as well as align with the Joint and Army Enterprise architectures and Common Operating Environment (COE) standards.

GCCS-A must be maintained as a system until replaced by a new joint command and control capability. GCCS-A will be modernized as part of the Joint Command and Control (C2) way forward. In accordance with the Joint Requirements Oversight Committee (JROC) Memorandum (JROCM) 145-09 which states, "The JROC endorses efforts to develop and implement programmatic recommendations to support the "Do No Harm" Strategy", GCCS-A continues to sustain, synchronize and modernize along with the GCCS Family of Systems (FoS). In Fiscal Year 2011 the Joint C2 Overarching Integrated Product Team concurred with the Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) results and endorsed the proposed modernization of the GCCS FoS.

On May 17, 2012 the Under Secretary of Defense, Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics approved the Joint C2 Capability AoA recommendations to implement the Joint C2 sustainment and modernization strategy based on creating and maintaining a federated Joint C2 Family of Programs. An Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) was prepared by Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology (ASA(ALT)) and signed by the Army Acquisition Executive (AAE) on September 7, 2012. The ADM directs that the Modernization Strategy will consist of two separate program efforts. (1) A three-year (Fiscal Years 2012-2015) (FY12-15) Bridge effort, Acquisition Category (ACAT) III level with Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) and authority to conduct a Materiel Development Decision (MDD) delegated down to Program
Executive Office (PEO) Command, Control, Communications - Tactical (C3T), and (2) a Modernization development effort for the Army's Joint and Strategic command and Control capabilities and Common Operating Environment (COE) infrastructure software products, with an MDD no later than (NLT) FY2015 at which time ACAT level will be determined.  The GCCS-A modernization development effort will be scoped and resourced once a validated Army requirement is approved.  GCCS-A must be maintained as a system until replaced by a new Joint Command and Control (C2) capability. Based on the Joint C2 AoA determination, services are directed to transform the GCCS Family of Systems to a more agile, net-centric, service oriented environment.

In accordance with the Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) requirements document approved in 2011, entitled Net Enabled Mission Command (NeMC) Initial Capabilities Document (ICD), software capability will be developed in 2-year increments as capability sets designed to Collaborate, Collapse and Converge Mission Command products.  The product development funded under this R-Form is an integral part of the Mission Command System of Systems, under a strategy designed to optimize opportunity for improved interoperability among the systems, to capture the benefits of competition where possible and to ensure the rapid integration of new capability into warfighter systems.  This strategy is designed to reduce the physical footprint, logistics support requirements and increase operational efficiency through deployment as a virtualized server on Battle Command Common Services and a web client on Mission Command Workstation; GCCS-A Global Lite will meet this requirement and will be undergo certification testing in Fiscal Year 2015.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Project 11A:   The Advanced Payloads Development project line is a shared funding line between multiple Payload programs.  These Payload programs support the Army's transformation by developing Reconnaissance, Surveillance and Target Acquisition (RSTA) and Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) payload systems for Brigade Combat Teams, Divisions, and Corps Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS).  This is in accordance with Headquarters Department of the Army (HQDA) and Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) UAS priorities.  

Small Tactical Radar - Lightweight (STARLite) Synthetic Aperture Radar/Ground Moving Target Indicator (SAR/GMTI) is a lightweight, high performance, all weather, multi-functional radar system for the Gray Eagle Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS). The STARLite system provides wide area, near real time Reconnaissance, Surveillance and Target Acquisition (RSTA) capabilities. It operates throughout the UAS flight mission profile in adverse weather and through battlefield obscurants. The SAR mode generates quality images for the battlefield commander for detection, classification and location of stationary commercial wheeled vehicle-size targets. The GMTI mode detects moving ground targets, to include man-sized detection, and provides location information and performs cross-cue with the Electro-Optic/Infrared (EO/IR) sensors.  STARLite is increasing its software (S/W) capabilities based on IOT&amp;E results which will increase automation and upgrade to a common Graphical User Interface (GUI) to align with the Common Operating Environment (COE) requirement to enable Sensor Processing and Exploitation (SPE).

Common Sensor Payload (CSP) - Electro Optical / Infra Red / Laser Designator (EO/IR/LD) provides High Definition (HD) Full Motion Video (FMV) in both the Electro Optical and Mid Wave IR spectrums with day/night capability to collect and display continuous imagery with the ability to designate targets of interest for attack by laser guided precision weapons.  It is the EO/IR/LD sensor for Gray Eagle UAS which supports force applications, battlespace awareness, force protection, and net-centric operations across the battlefield to provide wide area, near real time RSTA capabilities.  Additional initiatives will continue to focus on the transition of technologies directly supporting emerging requirements and the Army's Current and Future Force.  CSP is being procured for the Gray Eagle UAS program and has potential application to other platforms.   

Project 11B:   The Tactical Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) Payload (TSP) is a SIGINT sensor, currently under development for the Gray Eagle that detects radio frequency (RF) emitters. The TSP system will provide a SIGINT capability to the tactical commander.  The TSP system will be a modular, scalable payload using an architecture that is software reconfigurable to allow for growth and flexibility as technology, and as the adversaries use of technology, changes.  This flexible architecture allows for third party software applications to be integrated into the TSP system. The TSP system processing, control and data dissemination is integrated into the Distributed Common Ground System - Army (DCGS-A) via the Operational Ground Station. It supports Manned/Unmanned (MUM) teaming with Brigade Combat Team ground SIGINT Terminal Guidance (STG) teams and manned airborne assets.  The TSP system improves situational awareness and shortens the targeting cycle by detecting and identifying emitters associated with high value targets (HVTs).  The TSP system is capable of processing conventional signals, standard military signals, and modern signals of interest.  This includes detection, recognition, identification, direction finding, and high confidence geo-location.  The TSP system operates in two modes, passive and active to provide an enhanced Aerial Precision Geolocation (APG) capability.

Project 123:   The Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Joint Technology Center/Systems Integration Laboratory (JTC/SIL) is a Joint facility that develops, integrates, and supports the enhancement of its Multiple Unified Simulation Environment (MUSE) capability for Army systems and operational concepts.  The JTC/SIL conducts prototype hardware and software development, builds the UAS Institutional Mission Simulator (IMS) trainers for the Shadow, Hunter, and Gray Eagle programs, and provides modeling and simulation support. The MUSE is a real-time, operator in-the-loop simulation that may be integrated with larger simulations in support of Army and Joint training and exercises.  The MUSE is also employed as a Mission Rehearsal Tool for ongoing combat operations.  This project funds the management of the JTC/SIL and MUSE enhancements.  This system supports the Legacy to Objective transition path of the Transformation Campaign Plan (TCP).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>STARLite SAR/GMTI is a threshold requirement for the Gray Eagle UAS.  The acquisition strategy for STARLite program was based on a full and open competition for the Army.  A five year competitive production contract was awarded in April 2008 to Northrop Grumman for the build, integration, test and delivery of STARLite systems with preplanned improvements for Extended Range and Increased Reliability.  FRP was successfully achieved in June 2013. A follow-on production contract is planned for award in February 2014 for 3 years that will procure all remaining STARLite Payloads required for the Gray Eagle platform. A STARLite system support contract was awarded in September 2013 to provide system sustainment.  STARLite is increasing its S/W capabilities based on IOT&amp;E results which will increase automation and upgrade to a common Graphical User Interface (GUI) to align with the Common Operating Environment (COE) requirement to enable Sensor Processing and Exploitation (SPE). 

Common Sensor Payload (CSP) EO/IR/LD is a KPP (Key Performance Parameter) requirement for the Gray Eagle UAS.  The acquisition strategy for the CSP program was based on a full and open competition for the Army.  It was briefed and approved at the Army Systems Acquisition Review Council (ASARC) in Dec 2006.  A competitive contract was awarded in Nov 2007 to Raytheon for the build, integration, test and delivery of the CSP.  FRP was completed June 2013.  CSP program was approved by HQDA for fifty-five (55) High Definition (HD) payloads.  Forty-One (41) systems are being upgraded via retrofit to HD while fourteen (14) are being procured in FY14 as HD.

The acquisition strategy for FY15 is software development to improve the STARLite SPE capability by utilizing existing contract vehicles.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Tactical Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) Payload (TSP) is a SIGINT sensor, currently under development for the Gray Eagle that detects radio frequency (RF) emitters. The TSP system will provide a SIGINT capability to the tactical commander.  The TSP system will be a modular, scalable payload using an architecture that is software reconfigurable to allow for growth and flexibility as technology, and as the adversaries use of technology, changes.  This flexible architecture allows for third party software applications to be integrated into the TSP system. The TSP system processing, control and data dissemination is integrated into the Distributed Common Ground System - Army (DCGS-A) via the Operational Ground Station. It supports Manned/Unmanned (MUM) teaming with Brigade Combat Team ground SIGINT Terminal Guidance (STG) teams and manned airborne assets.  The TSP system improves situational awareness and shortens the targeting cycle by detecting and identifying emitters associated with high value targets (HVTs).

The TSP system is capable of processing conventional signals, standard military signals, and modern signals of interest.  This includes detection, recognition, identification, direction finding, and high confidence geo-location.  The TSP system operates in two modes, passive and active to provide an enhanced Aerial Precision Geolocation (APG) capability.

FY2015 Base funding in the amount of $12.904 Million supports engineering corrective actions, regression testing, Government Developmental testing and Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&amp;E).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>TSP is a threshold requirement for the MQ-1C Gray Eagle UAS. The TSP program entered the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase with a Milestone B decision in September 2011. The TSP Program EMD contract award was based on full-and-open competition and was focused on integration and test onto the Gray Eagle platform and integration and test of TSP software into the Operational Ground Station. The TSP EMD program is a derivative of systems that were fielded  as a Quick Reaction Capability on the MQ-1C UAS and a variety of other manned platforms. The demonstrated scalability of these fielded materiel solutions allows the TSP EMD program to leverage effort that directly supports the TSP EMD program.

The TSP program Acquisition Strategy was modified to accommodate the FY 2012 Appropriation that reduced the 11B Funding Line by $14.100 Million. The modified TSP program followed an incremental Acquisition Strategy with a TSP Block 0, Block 1 and Block 2. Schedule adjusted in accordance with the TSP Acquisition Decision Memorandum dated 22 Mar 2012. Block 0 was to be the QRC system to provide an early operational capability for the MQ-1C. The TSP Block 1 is the current Program of Record that entered EMD in FY 2011 to meet all the threshold requirements in the approved Capability Production Document (CPD). Block 2 was to address future objective needs.

Based on available funding, the TSP acquisition strategy has been revised to merge Block 0 and current Block 1 capabilities into a single Block of capability.  Current capabilities that have not been integrated into the Block 1 are deferred and included in the Block 2 suite of requirements.

Block 1 is the initial production capability, with Block 2 being a continuation of the TSP program of record and will integrate the remaining CPD threshold requirements.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Joint Technology Center/Systems Integration Laboratory (JTC/SIL) is a Joint facility that develops, integrates, and supports the enhancement of its Multiple Unified Simulation Environment (MUSE) capability for Army systems and operational concepts.  The JTC/SIL conducts prototype hardware and software development, builds the UAS Institutional Mission Simulator (IMS) trainers for the Shadow, Hunter, and Gray Eagle programs, and provides modeling and simulation support. The MUSE is a real-time, operator in-the-loop simulation that may be integrated with larger simulations in support of Army and Joint training and exercises.  The MUSE is also employed as a Mission Rehearsal Tool for ongoing combat operations.  This project funds the management of the JTC/SIL and MUSE enhancements.  

This system supports the Legacy to Objective transition path of the Transformation Campaign Plan (TCP).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Distributed Common Ground System - Army (DCGS-A) is the Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) System of Systems (SoS) for Joint, Interagency, Allied, Coalition, and National data analysis, sharing and collaboration.  The core functions of DCGS-A are:  the vertical and horizontal synchronization of ISR Processing, Exploitation and Dissemination (PED) efforts; operations in a networked environment at multiple security levels; the control of select Army and joint sensor systems; the fusion of all acquired data and information, and distribution of relevant red (threat), gray (non-aligned), and environmental (weather and terrain) information; and providing the Warfighters' early warning and targeting capability.  DCGS-A provides a single integrated ISR ground processing system composed of common components that are interoperable with sensors, other information sources, all Warfighting Functions, and the Defense Information &amp; Intelligence Enterprise (DI2E) and Intelligence Community Information Technology Enterprise (ICITE).  DCGS-A is fielded in Fixed and Mobile configurations emphasizing the use of reach and split based operations by improving accessibility of data in order to reduce forward deployed footprint.  As enhanced capabilities are developed and tested, a continuing series of software releases will be integrated into Army Common/commodity hardware and fielded to units IAW the Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) process.

The Army Acquisition Executive designated to PEO IEW&amp;S and DCGS-A as the Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE) Lead.  As such, DCGS-A is defining the architecture to fit within the Common Operating Environment (COE) as described by the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology) (ASA(ALT)) COE Implementation Plan.  This is in accordance with the G-3/5/7 priority to align all Army networks, procurements, and enhancements under one COE and one vision leveraging intelligence community investments.

DCGS-A consolidates, enhances, and modernizes the Tasking, Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (TPED) capabilities formerly found in nine Army intelligence programs of record (Common Ground Station (CGS), Guardrail Common Sensor (GRCS), Counterintelligence &amp; Interrogator Operations Workstation (CI&amp;I OPS WS), All Source Analysis System (ASAS), Enhanced TracWolf (ETW), Digital Topographic Support System (DTSS), Integrated Meteorological System (IMETS), Tactical Exploitation System (TES), and Prophet Control) and two Quick Reaction Capabilities (Joint Intelligence Operations Center – Iraq (JIOC-I) and Imagery Work Station(IWS)).  DCGS-A provides these technologically advanced PED capabilities in tailored and scalable mobile and fixed configurations in all maneuver and maneuver support units from Company Intelligence Support Team to Army Service Component Command, and in select maneuver sustainment units battalion and above.  The program develops software packages to be embedded in mission command and other select systems to provide required ISR/analytic capabilities.  DCGS-A is a critical Army priority.

DCGS-A software is tailored by echelon and scalable to each unit's mission.  DCGS-A provides commanders and staffs the ability to maintain an accurate and up to date understanding of the operational environment.  The DCGS-A contribution to commanders' visualization and situational awareness, rapid planning, and the synchronization of all warfighting functions, enable Army units to operate within the enemy's decision cycle.  This capability enhances tactical and operational maneuver and the conduct of full spectrum operations across the range of military operations from humanitarian to major combat operations.

The DCGS-A configurations range from laptops to systems integrated in tactical shelters and mounted on tactical vehicles to large commodity servers operating in a sanctuary based processing environment.  The fundamental intent and tenet of this approach is to reduce forward deployed equipment/footprint by co-locating the advanced analytics capabilities within the DCGS-A baseline with the regional data centers, where the data is stored.  This infrastructure consolidation simultaneously reduces processor and communications requirements in tactical units by limiting the number of large data files transported across tactical communications systems.  Following a successful operational assessment and Milestone C in 2QFY12/Full Deployment Decision in 1QFY13, the program is deploying DCGS-A Increment 1 Release 1 Software Baseline capability throughout the Army.

FY15 Base funding in the amount of $9.270 million for 956, will be used for the continued development and testing of the DCGS-A Increment 1 Software Releases as well as the continued development and testing of the of the Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE) as it fits into the Army's overarching Common Operating Environment (COE) construct.   The COE has been directed by the ASA(ALT) and concurred by the Army G3/5/7 as a priority effort to align all Army networks, procurements, and enhancements under one COE vision.  Funds used for efforts associated with the development of the CPCE/COE will include the continued merger/collapse of capabilities across multiple Battlefield Functional Areas (BFAs) and the consolidation of hardware used across the BFAs.  Funds used for efforts associated with the development of the software will include continued advancements in the Standard Sharable Geospatial Foundation to support the Tactical Common Operating Picture, as well as further investment into capabilities and widget development supporting All Source Intelligence, Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT), and emerging architectural and infrastructure enhancements.  Furthermore, the program will update the commercial technologies to the latest version(s) to enable industry developed enhanced features. Testing activities requiring these funds will include Developmental Testing (DT) and Operational Testing (OT) for Release 3; Participation in Network Integration Evaluation and Exercises such as: Empire Challenge, ULCHI Freedom Guardian, and Joint Interoperability Certification test(s) for each software release. The result of these activities all serve to prove out the capabilities in Increment 1 Release 3 and COE Version 3 (COE V3).

FY15 Base funding in the amount of $10.885 million for D07, will continue the iterative DCGS-A software releases that will increase the Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination capability our Army requires.  Increment 2 of the DCGS-A program will continue critical updates to the All Source Intelligence and the overarching Intelligence Processing capability to the Army through the Cloud Computing capability.  This approach will achieve Information Technology efficiencies through alignment with the Intelligence Community Information Technology Environment, while maintaining the incremental software updates required to remain current.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Distributed Common Ground System-Army (DCGS-A) program was created in response to the Department of Defense (DoD) Distributed Common Ground/Surface System (DCGS) Mission Area Initial Capabilities Document (MA ICD) dated 13 Aug 2004, which captured the overarching requirements for an Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) Family of Systems (FoS) that will contribute to Joint and combined Warfighter needs. That ICD was updated as the Distributed Common Ground/Surface System (DCG/SS) Enterprise ICD, and approved by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) 27 Feb 2009. The Army requirements were refined in the DCGS-A Capabilities Development Document (CDD), and approved by the JROC 31 Oct 2005. The DCGS-A program is currently in the Production and Deployment phase and was designated as a Major Automated Information System (MAIS) in OSD (AT&amp;L) Memorandum, 29 Mar 2010. 

DCGS-A is following an evolutionary acquisition approach to develop and field system capabilities over time to satisfy the requirements of the DCGS-A Capability Development Document (CDD). Following this approach, the first increment was defined and a Capability Production Document (CPD) was created with full consideration of all of the preceding supporting documents and analysis. As part of its initial staffing, a Cost Benefit Analysis was completed in support of the DCGS-A CPD. This analysis projected a significant cost avoidance/savings over the life cycle by not limiting the hardware configuration to a one size fits all unit types design but rather integrating the DCGS-A Software capabilities into common servers and other IT components fielded at that echelon. This approach was validated during the Milestone C and Full Deployment Decision process in FY2012 through the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE) approval of the Economic Analysis.  This Economic Analysis validated the cost savings achieved utilizing the acquisition approach outlined above. 

The DCGS-A System Engineering Plan (SEP) updated the current development plan and was approved by OASD (R&amp;E) on 5 Dec 2011. The DCGS-A Revised Acquisition Strategy (AS) was approved by the Defense Acquisition Executive (DAE) on 8 Aug 2013. The DCGS-A Acquisition Program Baseline was approved on 26 Feb 2013. The DCGS-A program received a Milestone C decision on 29 Feb 2012 and an operational test was completed in Jun 2012. A successful Full Deployment Decision (FDD) for Release 1 Initial Minimum Capability was obtained December 2012.  

PM DCGS-A has been designated as the Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE) Lead for PEO IEW&amp;S. As such, DCGS-A is currently aligning it's architecture to fit within the Common Operating Environment (COE) as described by the ASA(ALT) COE Implementation Plan. This alignment is in accordance with the G-3/5/7 priority to align all Army networks, procurements, and enhancements under one COE and one vision. Our acquisition strategy supports this initiative as we continue to collapse PORs and reduce footprint following our capability migration path and iterative development of software releases which continue to increase capabilities to satisfy the remaining CPD requirements beyond Initial Minimal Capability. As DCGS-A continues the path through Increment 1 and beyond, each release will focus on the COE and continually align the Command Post activities with DCGS-A Cloud and POR migration activities.  The program office expects to continue as the DCGS-A System Integrator for software development and hardware integration, and will continue to access multiple vendors by leveraging a variety of competitively awarded contracts.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Distributed Common Ground System - Army (DCGS-A) is the Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) System of Systems (SoS) for Joint, Interagency, Allied, Coalition, and National data analysis, sharing and collaboration.  The core functions of DCGS-A are:  the vertical and horizontal synchronization of ISR Processing, Exploitation and Dissemination (PED) efforts; operations in a networked environment at multiple security levels; the control of select Army and joint sensor systems; the fusion of all acquired data and information, and distribution of relevant red (threat), gray (non-aligned), and environmental (weather and terrain) information; and providing the Warfighters' early warning and targeting capability.  DCGS-A provides a single integrated ISR ground processing system composed of common components that are interoperable with sensors, other information sources, all Warfighting Functions, compliant with standards providing the Defense Information &amp; Intelligence Enterprise (DI2E) and Intelligence Community Information Technology Enterprise (ICITE).  DCGS-A is fielded in Fixed and Mobile configurations emphasizing the use of reach and split based operations by improving accessibility of data in order to reduce forward deployed footprint.  As enhanced capabilities are developed and tested, a continuing series of software releases will be integrated into Army Common/commodity hardware and fielded to units IAW the Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) process.

The Army Acquisition Executive designated to PEO IEW&amp;S and DCGS-A as the Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE) Lead.  As such, DCGS-A is defining the architecture to fit within the Common Operating Environment (COE) as described by the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology) (ASA(ALT)) COE Implementation Plan.  This is in accordance with the G-3/5/7 priority to align all Army networks, procurements, and enhancements under one COE and one vision leveraging intelligence community investments.

The DCGS-A acquisition strategy incrementally consolidates, enhances, and modernizes the Tasking, Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (TPED) capabilities formerly found in nine Army intelligence programs of record (Common Ground Station (CGS), Guardrail Common Sensor (GRCS), Counterintelligence &amp; Interrogator Operations Workstation (CI&amp;I OPS WS), All Source Analysis System (ASAS), Enhanced TracWolf (ETW), Digital Topographic Support System (DTSS), Integrated Meteorological System (IMETS), Tactical Exploitation System (TES), and Prophet Control) and two Quick Reaction Capabilities (Joint Intelligence Operations Center – Iraq (JIOC-I) and Imagery Work Station(IWS)).  DCGS-A provides these technologically advanced PED capabilities through iterative software releases delivered in tailored and scalable mobile and fixed configurations in all maneuver and maneuver support units from Company Intelligence Support Team to Army Service Component Command, and in select maneuver sustainment units battalion and above.  The program develops software packages to be embedded in mission command and other select systems to provide required ISR/analytic capabilities.  DCGS-A is a critical Army priority.

FY15 Base funding in the amount of $10.885 million will continue the iterative DCGS-A software releases that will increase the Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination capability our Army requires.  Increment 2 of the DCGS-A program will continue critical updates to the All Source Intelligence and the overarching Intelligence Processing capability to the Army through the Cloud Computing capability.  This approach will achieve Information Technology efficiencies through alignment with the Intelligence Community Information Technology Environment, while maintaining the incremental software updates required to remain current.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Distributed Common Ground System-Army (DCGS-A) program was created in response to the Department of Defense (DoD) Distributed Common Ground/Surface System (DCGS) Mission Area Initial Capabilities Document (MA ICD) dated 13 Aug 2004, which captured the overarching requirements for an Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) Family of Systems (FoS) that will contribute to Joint and combined Warfighter needs. That ICD was updated as the Distributed Common Ground/Surface System (DCG/SS) Enterprise ICD, and approved by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) 27 Feb 2009. The Army requirements were refined in the DCGS-A Capabilities Development Document (CDD), and approved by the JROC 31 Oct 2005. The DCGS-A program is currently in the Production and Deployment phase and was designated as a Major Automated Information System (MAIS) in OSD (AT&amp;L) Memorandum, 29 Mar 2010.  The Information Systems Capability Development Document (ISCDD), currently in staffing, is an update to the 2005 CDD.

DCGS-A is following an evolutionary acquisition approach to develop and field system capabilities over time to satisfy the requirements of the DCGS-A Capability Development Document (CDD). Following this approach, the first increment was defined and a Capability Production Document (CPD) was created with full consideration of all of the preceding supporting documents and analysis. As part of its initial staffing, a Cost Benefit Analysis was completed in support of the DCGS-A CPD. This analysis projected a significant cost avoidance/savings over the life cycle by not limiting the hardware configuration to a one size fits all unit types design but rather integrating the DCGS-A Software capabilities into common servers and other IT components fielded at that echelon. This approach was validated during the Milestone C and Full Deployment Decision process in FY2012 through the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE) approval of the Economic Analysis.  This Economic Analysis validated the cost savings achieved utilizing the acquisition approach outlined above. 

The DCGS-A Increment 2 Acquisition Strategy will be a competitive contract to a single vendor for managing the development, integration, documentation, and test for the Increment 2 Releases.  Anticipate RFP release in 3QFY15 and contract award in 2QFY16.

PM DCGS-A has been designated as the Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE) Lead for PEO IEW&amp;S. As such, DCGS-A is currently aligning its architecture to fit within the Common Operating Environment (COE) as described by the ASA(ALT) COE Implementation Plan. This alignment is in accordance with the G-3/5/7 priority to align all Army networks, procurements, and enhancements under one COE and one vision. Our acquisition strategy supports this initiative as we continue to collapse PORs and reduce footprint following our capability migration path and iterative development of software releases which continue to increase capabilities to satisfy the remaining CPD requirements beyond Initial Minimal Capability. As DCGS-A continues the path through Increment 2, each release will focus on the COE and continually align the Command Post activities with the DCGS-A platforms.  The program office expects to award a competitive contract for software development and hardware integration.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Gray Eagle provides Reconnaissance, Surveillance, Target Acquisition (RSTA), command and control, communications relay, Signals Intelligence (SIGNIT), battle damage assessment, and manned-unmanned teaming capability.  Gray Eagle is a dedicated, assured, multi-mission Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) fielded to all ten Army Divisions to support the commander's combat operations.  The Army Special Operations Aviation Command (ARSOAC) Gray Eagle units and Aerial Exploitation Battalions (AEB) Gray Eagle units are self-contained Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance capabilities teamed with organic Processing, Exploitation and Dissemination that are a global rapidly deployable force and contribute to the Department of Defense Global ISR mission.   A Gray Eagle unit consists of either 9 or 12 Aircraft, Universal Ground Control equipment, Standard Equipment Package and Payloads to include: Electro-Optical/Infrared Laser Range Finder/Laser Designator, synthetic aperture radar/ground moving target indicator, communication relay, and up to 4 HELLFIRE Missiles. 

The Ground Based Sense and Avoid (GBSAA) system provides an alternative means of complying with Federal Aviation Administration "see and avoid" regulations.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Gray Eagle provides Reconnaissance, Surveillance, Target Acquisition (RSTA), command and control, communications relay, Signals Intelligence (SIGINIT), battle damage assessment, and manned-unmanned teaming capability.  Gray Eagle is a dedicated, assured, multi-mission Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) fielded to all ten Army Divisions to support the commander's combat operations.  The Army Special Operations Aviation Command (ARSOAC) Gray Eagle units and Aerial Exploitation Battalions (AEB) Gray Eagle units are self-contained Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance capabilities teamed with organic Processing, Exploitation and Dissemination that are a global rapidly deployable force and contribute to the Department of Defense Global ISR mission.   A Gray Eagle unit consists of either 9 or 12 Aircraft, Universal Ground Control equipment, Standard Equipment Package and Payloads to include: Electro-Optical/Infrared Laser Range Finder/Laser Designator, synthetic aperture radar/ground moving target indicator, communication relay, and up to 4 HELLFIRE Missiles. 

The Ground Based Sense and Avoid (GBSAA) system provides an alternative means of complying with Federal Aviation Administration "see and avoid" regulations.

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>An Extended Range Multi-Purpose (ERMP) Operational Requirement Document (ORD) was approved by the Joint Requirement Oversight Council (JROC) 6 Apr 2005, Milestone B occurred 20 Apr 2005, and the System Development and Demonstration contract was awarded 8 Aug 2005, as a result of a competitive solicitation which included a vendor system capabilities demonstration.  A Capabilities Production Document (CPD) was approved 14 Mar 09.  To meet the required capability, evolutionary acquisition has been employed to implement the incremental approach outlined in the CPD.  Gray Eagle completed IOT&amp;E and the program now has to complete software development, integration and testing of the universal products (UGCS, UGDT and other universal ground equipment).  PM JAMS is developing the R model of the HELLFIRE missile and participating in the integration and test activities for the entire Gray Eagle system.  PEO Missile and Space is budgeting for the procurement of missiles for the fielded systems.  PEO Intelligence and Electronic Warfare Systems (IEWS) develops, manages, and is responsible for meeting all Gray Eagle costs associated for payloads, payload integration, and payload sustainment.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Small Unmanned Aircraft System (SUAS) provides the battalion and below ground maneuver elements critical situational awareness and enhance force protection.  The system provides the small unit commander an organic and responsive tactical Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and Target Acquisition capability through the ability to view real-time Full Motion Video and sensor data via the system ground control stations.  Other compatible receivers, such as the One System Remote Video Terminal and appropriately equipped manned platforms may also receive the SUAS products.

A SUAS includes three hand-launched aircraft that do not require an improved launch/recovery location.  In addition to the aircraft, the system contains ground control equipment, which includes an interoperable hand controller.  The equipment is fully transportable in or on rucksack type packs that are organic to the unit.

The SUAS RDT&amp;E budget line includes funding for studies and incremental development/upgrade of current SUAS capabilities that will capitalize on new technology insertions based on identified user requirements.  Past improvements include a Digital Data Link capability, introduced in 2010, which provides data link relay capability, and integrated gimbaled payloads.  Future enhancements will follow the natural progression of technology and exploitation of improved payloads to meet Warfighter needs.  Improved system enhancements will support Army modernization initiatives and the service emphasis on Squad-Foundation of the Decisive Force.  Development of a government purpose rights control device compatible with current and future SUAS platforms and integrated into tactical networks is required.  Compatibility for SUAS with Net Warrior elements will support seamless transmission of data between squad members and adjacent and higher commands.  A communications relay capability for SUAS will extend the operational connectivity of the squad when ground based communications cannot support the ranges due to terrain or atmospherics.  The relay capability supports the Aerial Layer Network Transport Initial Capabilities Document for low altitude requirements.  Development of a sensor to shooter capability will link forward edge combatants to organic and supporting fires networks with rapid dissemination of target information and imagery.  Efforts to reduce the workload required to operate the SUAS will free the soldiers to perform their primary mission while retaining the advantages afforded by the SUAS.  Improved autonomy, to include GPS and comms denied environments will be sought through leverage of software, processor, and communications enhancements.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Tactical Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (TUAV) RQ-7 Shadow provides the Army Brigade Commander with dedicated Reconnaissance, Surveillance and Target Acquisition (RSTA), Intelligence, Battle Damage Assessment (BDA), Force Protection and Manned-Unmanned Teaming capability. It also provides the Brigade Commander with critical battlefield intelligence and targeting information in the rapid cycle time required for success at the tactical level. The TUAV Shadow system air vehicle meets the required operating range of 50 kilometers and remains on station for up to nine hours. The TUAV Shadow system consists of 4 air vehicles (each configured with an Electro Optical/Infrared (EO/IR) sensor payload), launcher, ground control and support equipment including: power generation, communications equipment, automated recovery equipment, one system remote video terminals, vehicle mounted shelters, and High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles with trailer(s). Each system is equipped with one Maintenance Section Multifunctional (MSM) and is supported at the division level by a Mobile Maintenance Facility (MMF). 

All 102 Shadow UAS systems have been procured and fielded. Shadow has amassed over 880,190 total flight hours, most of which were flown in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF).  Incremental upgrades are required for continued improvement and interoperability. Common Systems Integration is required to ensure interoperability with other manned and unmanned weapon systems, to include One System Remote Video Terminal (OSRVT). Continued developmental improvements are required to provide greater interoperability, increase operational capability and flexibility to the Brigade Combat Team. Modifications to the airframe, avionics, payloads, ground control equipment, and support equipment are based on documented requirements and lessons learned from units operating in OEF and OIF. 

Justification:  FY2015 RQ-7 UAV Base funding of $16.389 million will be used for capability and reliability improvements, specifically: Air Vehicle modifications (Block III Engine), reduced noise signature for engine and Ground Equipment (interoperability) improvements. Additionally, funds will be for System Engineering, Program Management, and System Test and Evaluation support. Funds will also be used to incorporate the Increment II OSRVT Bi-Directional capability, ensure interoperability, and OSRVT test events.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Tactical Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (TUAV) RQ-7 Shadow provides the Army Brigade Commander with dedicated Reconnaissance, Surveillance and Target Acquisition (RSTA), Intelligence, Battle Damage Assessment (BDA), Force Protection and Manned-Unmanned Teaming capability. It also provides the Brigade Commander with critical battlefield intelligence and targeting information in the rapid cycle time required for success at the tactical level. The TUAV Shadow system air vehicle meets the required operating range of 50 kilometers and remains on station for up to nine hours. The TUAV Shadow system consists of 4 air vehicles (each configured with an Electro Optical/Infrared (EO/IR) sensor payload), launcher, ground control and support equipment including: power generation, communications equipment, automated recovery equipment, one system remote video terminals, vehicle mounted shelters, and High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles with trailer(s). Each system is equipped with one Maintenance Section Multifunctional (MSM) and is supported at the division level by a Mobile Maintenance Facility (MMF). 

All 102 Shadow UAS systems have been procured and fielded. Shadow has amassed over 880,190 total flight hours, most of which were flown in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF).  Incremental upgrades are required for continued improvement and interoperability. Common Systems Integration is required to ensure interoperability with other manned and unmanned weapon systems, to include One System Remote Video Terminal (OSRVT). Continued developmental improvements are required to provide greater interoperability, increase operational capability and flexibility to the Brigade Combat Team. Modifications to the airframe, avionics, payloads, ground control equipment, and support equipment are based on documented requirements and lessons learned from units operating in OEF and OIF. 

Justification:  FY2015 RQ-7 UAV Base funding of $16.389 million will be used for capability and reliability improvements, specifically: Air Vehicle modifications (Block III Engine), reduced noise signature for engine and Ground Equipment (interoperability) improvements. Additionally, funds will be for System Engineering, Program Management, and System Test and Evaluation support. Funds will also be used to incorporate the Increment II OSRVT Bi-Directional capability, ensure interoperability, and OSRVT test events.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>A System Capability Demonstration (SCD) was conducted with four contractors.  The results from the SCD in conjunction with proposal evaluations resulted in the competitive down select of a Best Value TUAS.  A successful Milestone II ASARC was conducted 21 Dec 99 and a Milestone III Decision 25 Sep 02.  The full rate production contract was awarded 27 Dec 02 and all 102 systems were procured by FY2009.  Continued development of the selected TUAV system will be accomplished through a series of modifications and retrofits such as Shadow v2,  Communications Relay, Laser Designator, Block III engine, and reliability upgrades.  Development/integration of these improved capabilities will be through individual efforts on a (mostly) sole source cost-plus fixed fee engineering services contract with the Shadow prime contractor.  Development of the Block III engine is being accomplished through a competitive process.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Joint Personnel Identification (JPI) supports the Biometric Enterprise database system which will deliver innovative and emergent biometric solutions to protect the nation through global identity superiority.  JPI will provide an Army tactical biometric collection capability to capture an adversary or neutral person's biometric data and enroll them into the DoD enterprise authoritative biometric database to positively identify and verify the identity of actual or potential adversaries.  U.S. forces are currently operating unilaterally or in combination with joint, multinational, and interagency partners, to identify unknown individuals and verify the identity of person(s) across the full range of military operations.  Capabilities proposed for JPI will be configurable for multiple operational mission environments enabling identity dominance on the battlefield and across the DoD spectrum.  JPI will leverage lessons learned through the current Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) to further refine the biometric collection systems abilities to collect, match, store, and share biometric (fingerprint/face/iris) and contextual information from actual or potential adversaries, host nation personnel, and third country nationals.

FY2015 Core funding supports ten (10) Government Full Time Equivalent (FTE) Civilian Positions.  Government FTEs are responsible for Program Management activities (engineering, cost estimating, resource and acquisition management) related development efforts.  The FY15 funds will enable the PM to continue limited JPI Biometrics Tactical Collection Devices (BTCDs) developmental actions.  These actions will afford JPI to conduct a narrow spectrum of bridging strategies designed to extend the BTCDs through limited operational assessments and technology insertion.  Also, funds are intended to enable JPI to incorporate software patches until a future device reaches FOC.  Lastly, funds minimally sustain infrastructure, facility costs and communication requirements (desktop support &amp; network connectivity).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

These actions will afford JPI to conduct a narrow spectrum of bridging strategies designed to extend the BTCDs through limited operational assessments and technology insertion.  Also, funds are intended to enable JPI to incorporate software patches until a future device reaches FOC.  Lastly, funds minimally sustain infrastructure, facility costs and communication requirements (desktop support &amp; network connectivity).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:Text>Funding provided system engineering activities to include execution of Systems Requirements Review (SRR); development of the performance specification; continued market research and trade study analysis.  Additionally, funding provided support for pre-NIE planning and preparation activities.  Support also provided for contracts planning and preparation in conjunction with a planned contract award.  In accordance with ASA(ALT) direction, PM JPI modified the acquisition approach.  The new direction changed acquisition approach from an EMD acquisition solution to a COTS/NDI acquisition approach.  The balance of FY13 Funding enabled PM JPI to begin development of a new acquisition approach which included a revision to planning, developing and preparing Army and Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) level documentation consistent with DoD Instruction 5000.2, The Defense Acquisition System, and compliant with existing statutory and regulatory policy in preparation.  Also, activities included the Biometric Information Exchange Day with industry, followed by RFI release and analysis of industry white paper responses.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:Text>Funding supports refinement of a COTS/NDI Acquisition Strategy, based on transition from a developmental acquisition approach to a COTS acquisition approach which began in FY13.  Funding provides system engineering activities; technology assessment and development of the performance specification; continued market research and trade study analysis.  Additionally, funding will provide support for pre-MS C planning and acquisition activities. Activities include requirements to support RFI, draft and final RFP packages, NIE testing approach (Type I SUT).  Also, contractor support will be provided for Program, Acquisition, Engineering, Budgeting and Contracts planning preparation, and development.  In addition, Product Manager contractor support will continue preparing and developing Army and OSD level statutory and regulatory documentation consistent with DoD Instruction 5000.2, the Defense Acquisition System, and compliant with existing statutory and regulatory policy for a FY16 MS C decision.  These requirements includes Systems Engineering Plan (SEP), Lifecycle Sustainment Plan (LCSP), Test and Evaluation Master Plan (TEMP), and cost analysis activities, including completion of the CARD, EA, and POE.  Funding will support government civilian labor and operations to include travel, training, supplies, infrastructure, and facility costs.  The CDD is being revised due to a change in the acquisition approach.</r2:Text>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Warfighter Information Network (WIN-T) Increment (Inc) 2 provides the Army with On-The-Move (OTM) networking capability.  The Inc 2 network retains capabilities delivered by WIN-T Inc 1 and by leveraging proven government and commercial technologies, adds greater network throughput and automated  Network Management to optimize planning (to include spectrum use), initialization, monitoring and troubleshooting. WIN-T Inc 2 employs Satellite Communications (SATCOM) OTM to extend the network in maneuver Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs) to Company level for the first time.  Using equipment mounted on combat platforms, WIN-T Increment 2 delivers a mobile capability that reduces reliance on fixed infrastructure and allows key leaders to move on the battlefield while retaining Situational Awareness and Mission Command capabilities. Using the Highband Networking Radio (HNR), with the Highband Networking Waveform (HNW) and high performance antennas, the WIN-T Inc 2 Line-of-Sight (LoS) network offers an adaptive 30 Megabit per second (Mbps) aggregate throughput to key leaders in their Command Post or in their vehicle. The WIN-T Inc 2 network is self-forming, which means that it automatically creates transmission paths based on terrain and environmental conditions; and self-healing, meaning that the paths will automatically re-route traffic to complete network transactions and calls even if one or more nodes break down or loses connectivity.  This offers greater network reliability and better end-to-end connectivity than traditional point-to-point networks.  WIN-T Inc 2 introduces the network management capability needed to keep the mobile and dispersed forces networked together through automated planning, initialization, monitoring, and troubleshooting.  Finally, WIN-T adopts "Colorless Core" technology that encrypts both classified and unclassified user information in the network and minimizes the number of users on the "core" of the network.  The Colorless Core allows commanders to utilize the tactical network without fear of the enemy intercepting information. Colorless Core is a technical insertion in the WIN-T Inc 1b network which enables efficient information sharing between Inc 1b and Inc 2.
 
WIN-T Inc 3 mature Network Operations (NetOps) technologies will be inserted into Increment 2 units.

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Defense Acquisition Executive (DAE), through the Nunn-McCurdy certification process, certified a restructured WIN-T program on June 5, 2007.  The certification Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) stated that the Army will restructure the WIN-T Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP) to absorb the former Joint Network Node (JNN) Network program.  It further stated that the restructured program will consist of four Increments: Incs 1, 2, 3, and 4.

The Acquisition Decision Memorandum of September 27, 2013 authorized the procurement of 98 additional communications nodes for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP), bringing the total LRIP quantity to 1030 communications nodes. The Program Manager (PM) procured the authorized quantities on the current initial production contract (W15P7T-10-D-C007). This contract was awarded in 2010 as a three year contract with three option years.  Lots 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the LRIP contract have been procured, and Lot 5 is anticipated to be awarded in March 2014. 

Inc 2 provides the Army with On-The-Move (OTM) networking capability.  Inc 3 NetOps will be technically inserted into Inc 2 and these inserts will be tested in subsequent Network Integration Evaluation (NIE) events.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
