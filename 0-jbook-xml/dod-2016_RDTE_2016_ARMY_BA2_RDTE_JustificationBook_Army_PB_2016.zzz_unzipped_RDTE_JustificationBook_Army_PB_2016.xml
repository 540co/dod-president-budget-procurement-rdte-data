                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project designs, investigates, and evaluates advanced sensor components, signal processing, and information fusion algorithms that will provide the future Soldier decisive new capabilities to locate, identify, decide and engage battlefield targets in tactical environments.  The ultimate impact and utility of this work will be to greatly increase the lethality, range, and speed of engagement of the Soldier.  Emphasis is on solving critical Army-specific battlefield sensing and information management problems such as false targets, complex terrain (including urban applications), movement of sensors on military vehicles, and exploitation of multimodal sensors.  Significant areas of research include: low cost sensors designed to be employed in large numbers of networked sensors for force protection, hostile fire defeat, homeland defense, counter terrorism operations, and munitions; fusion of disparate sensors such as non-imaging acoustic, seismic, electric-field (E-field), magnetic, radar; imaging infrared (IR), forward looking IR (FLIR), laser detection and ranging (LADAR), visible imagers; low cost acoustic, seismic, and magnetic sensors that can passively detect, classify, and track battlefield targets such as personnel, heavy/light vehicles, and helicopters.  Other areas of research include sensing technologies for tagging, tracking, and locating (TTL) non-traditional targets as well as the location of direct and indirect fires and other hostile threats.  Further areas of research include ultraviolet (UV) optoelectronics for battlefield sensors, networked compact radar for vehicle and dismount identification and tracking; ultra wideband radar for buried and concealed threat detection, enhanced robotic mobility, stand-off characterization of infrastructure; and the detection, classification, and tracking of humans in urban terrain.  Additional areas of research are aided/automatic target recognition (ATR) allowing sensors to autonomously locate and identify targets; advanced battlefield sensor and information processing to conduct a dynamic and real time situational assessment to present a common picture of the battlespace focused on low echelon commanders; protection of sensors (including Soldier's eyes) from battlefield laser threats; and advanced information processing methods to provide automatic information technologies that utilize widely dispersed sensor and legacy information sources.

This project supports Army science and technology efforts in the Command Control and Communications, Ground, and Soldier portfolios.  The work in this project complements efforts funded in PE 0601104A (University and Industry Research Centers), PE 0602709A (Night Vision Technology), PE 0603710A (Night Vision Advanced Technologies), and PE 0603001A (Warfighter Advanced Technology).  The networked sensing and data fusion efforts performed in this project complement efforts funded in PE 0601104A/Project H50 (Network Sciences CTA) and PE0601104A/Project J22 (Network Science and Technology Research Center CTA).

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element (PE) designs and validates electronic warfare (EW) components that deny, disrupt, or degrade the enemy's use of the electromagnetic spectrum for offensive or defensive operations. This is accomplished through the investigation of electronic support measures (ESM); countermeasures against communications systems and networks; the design and fabrication of sensors used to identify and locate threat forces in an asymmetric environment; and threat warning and electronic countermeasures (ECM) against munitions sensors, missile guidance systems, targeting systems, and explosive hazards. Project 906 supports protection of high-value ground platforms, aircraft and the Soldier from threat surveillance and tracking systems, imaging systems, and advanced radio frequency (RF)/electro-optical (EO)/infrared (IR) missiles, artillery, and smart munitions. Information fusion research addresses sensor correlation and fusion, relationship discovery, and management services through use of automated processing, as well as software that applies higher level reasoning techniques to support automated combat assessment. Project 906 also supports research and application of key EW sensors, direction finders and jammers to intercept, locate, and disrupt current and emerging communications and non-communications threat emitters to provide vital quality combat information directly to users in a timely and actionable manner. Specifically, it focuses on detection of threat sensors and emitters associated with weapon systems, targeting systems and command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence systems and networks.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project designs, fabricates, evaluates, and applies key electronic warfare (EW)/information operations technologies to enhance platform survivability (to include ground combat vehicles, aircraft, and the dismounted Soldier) and to intercept, track and locate current and emerging threat munitions, communications and non-communications threat emitters. This project applies recent advances in radio frequency (RF), infrared (IR), and electro-optical (EO) sensors and jamming sources to detect, locate, deceive, and jam threats (to include radar directed target acquisition systems, target-tracking sensors, surface-to-air missiles (SAMs), air-to-air missiles (AAMs), top attack weapons, and electronically fuzed munitions). This project also pursues the ability to neutralize improvised explosive devices. This project designs information systems to provide vital, quality combat information directly to users in a timely, actionable manner in accordance with concepts for future force intelligence operations. This project investigates RF collection and mapping technologies to offer real time emitter detection, location, and identification. In addition, this project enables a remote capability to disrupt, deny, or destroy threat communication signals and enables fusion (automated assimilation and synthesis) of battlefield intelligence data to enable interpretation of current threats and future enemy activities. This allows commanders to develop operational courses of action in time to act decisively and in a pre-emptive manner.

This project supports Army science and technology efforts in the Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence, Ground Maneuver, Soldier/Squad and Air portfolios.

The training demands of systems that are increasingly complex, intelligent, and self-adaptive far exceed those of legacy systems that require training of primarily procedural tasks.  This is compounded by parallel increases in autonomy and responsibility at lower echelons.</r2:Description>

This project investigates and designs training applications to enable the Army to train any time and any place.  Efforts include designing virtual humans that embody natural language, speech recognition in noisy environments, gesture, gaze, and conversational speech.  Techniques and methods are assessed for integrating different sensory cues into virtual environments that result in enhanced training and leader development. The project leverages the capabilities of industry and the research and development community through the synthesis of creativity and technology, including work at the Army Research Institute and the Army Research Laboratory. 

Efforts in this program element support the Army science and technology Soldier portfolio.

Developed technologies and techniques are transitioned for maturation and demonstration to PE 0603015A/project S28  (Immersive Learning Environments).

                                    <r2:Description>This effort supports the development of Active Protection System (APS) technologies and common architecture to reduce vehicle weight while significantly increasing protection against current and emerging advanced threats by reducing reliance on armor through other means such as sensing, warning, and active countermeasures. The APS common architecture will provide adaptable APS solutions that can be integrated across Army vehicle platforms as required. This research includes the development of new modeling and simulation capabilities along with supporting experimental and theoretical approaches to enable active protective systems. This effort includes integrated information (e.g., battlefield geography, threat launch detection and tracking) and intelligence to inform protection optimization, requiring collaboration across multiple Army organizations. This effort complements and is coordinated with PE 0602601A (Combat Vehicle and Automotive Technology)/Project C05 (Armor Applied Research), PE 0603004A (Weapons and Munitions Advanced Technology)/Project 232 (Advanced Lethality &amp; Survivability Demo), PE 0603005A (Combat Vehicle Survivability and Automotive Advanced Technology)/Project 221 (Combat Vehicle Survivability), PE 0603270A (Electronic Warfare Technology)/Project K16 (Non-Commo ECM Technology Demo), and PE 0603313A (Missile and Rocket Advanced Technology)/Project 263(Future Missile Technology Integration).</r2:Description>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides for the research, development, and evaluation of high-power electronic components, materials, and related technologies.  These technologies have application in compact and efficient power conversion, conditioning, and management sub-systems; energy storage and conversion devices; radio frequency (RF)/microwave and solid-state laser directed energy weapons (DEW); and traditional and non-traditional RF and laser electronic attack. All project elements are coordinated with and, as appropriate, leveraged by DEW and power/energy programs in the Air Force, Navy, High Energy Laser Joint Technology Office, Defense Threat Reduction Agency, national labs, university consortia, and relevant industry and foreign partners. The products of this research are required by developers of Army (DoD) systems to evolve traditional (mechanical-based) sub-systems such as geared transmissions, plate armor, and kinetic projectiles to electrically-based ones.  These products will provide the Soldier enhanced survivability and lethality through increased power management and energy savings as well as new fighting capabilities offered only by electrical power.

This project sustains Army science and technology efforts supporting the Ground Maneuver, Lethality and Soldier portfolios.

The work in this project is coordinated with the U.S. Army Tank and Automotive Research, Development, and Engineering Center (TARDEC); Armaments Research, Development, and Engineering Center (ARDEC); the U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center (AMRDEC); and the U.S. Army Communications-Electronics Research, Development, and Engineering Center (CERDEC).  

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

Work on this project is performed by the U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL), Adelphi, MD.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) conducts applied research and investigates core night vision and electronic sensor components and software to improve the Army's capability to operate in all battlefield conditions. Technologies pursued in this PE have the potential to provide the Army with new, or enhanced, capabilities to detect and identify targets farther on the battlefield, operate in obscured conditions, and maintain a higher degree of situational awareness (SA). Project H95 advances infrared (IR) Focal Plane Array (FPA) technologies, assesses and evaluates sensor materials, designs advanced multi-function lasers for designation and range finding, and develops models and simulations for validating advanced sensor technologies. In FY11 through FY16 the Army investment in advanced IR FPA technologies is augmented to ensure a world-wide technological and competitive IR sensor advantage for the United States. 

Work in this PE is fully coordinated with PE 0602120A (Sensors and Electronic Survivability), PE 0602705A (Electronics and Electronic Devices), PE 0602712A (Countermine Technology) and PE 0603710A (Night Vision Advanced Technology).

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. 

Work in this PE is performed by the U.S. Army Communications-Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC)/Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD), Fort Belvoir, VA.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project conducts applied research and develops component technologies that enable improved Reconnaissance, Surveillance, Target Acquisition (RSTA) and situational awareness (SA) at an affordable price. Component technologies include novel focal plane arrays (FPAs), processing and electronics improvements, and modeling and simulation to predict performance and to determine operational effectiveness. This research focuses on dual band infrared (IR) FPAs necessary to search, identify and track mobile targets in all day/night visibility and battlefield conditions and to improve standoff detection in ground-to-ground and air-to-ground operations. This project designs, fabricates and validates very large format IR FPAs needed for sensors to simultaneously provide wide area coverage and the high resolution for situational awareness, persistent surveillance and plume/gunflash detection. In addition this project develops multispectral and hyperspectral algorithms for on-chip hyperspectral functionality, which offer the ability to perform detection, identification and signature identification at extended ranges as well as the ability to detect targets in "deep hide". Reducing size, weight and power (SWaP) is a key research objective for all efforts. In FY11 through FY16 the Army investment in advanced IR FPA technologies is augmented to ensure a world-wide technological and competitive IR sensor advantage for the United States. 

This project supports Army science and technology efforts in the Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence, Soldier, Ground and Air portfolios.  

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. 

Work in this PE is performed by the U.S. Army Communications-Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC)/Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD), Fort Belvoir, VA.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>This effort investigates and designs new Digital Readout Integrated Circuit (DROIC) technology (digital-in-pixel) enabling the affordable very large format and multiband IR FPAs. The digital-in-pixel results in increased signal storage available to collect incoming signal information from the scene, compared to traditional analog techniques. DROIC is an important component in reducing the overall IR sensor cost and SWaP by allowing much smaller FPA pitch. The increased storage improves dynamic range for targeting, situational awareness and persistent surveillance applications.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element (PE) investigates and evaluates enabling tools and methodologies that support the long-term sustainment of Army training and testing activities.  Specific focus is on maintaining regulatory compliance while limiting future Army liability in operations and training, and maintaining resilient and adaptive ranges. Project 048 improves the Army's ability to comply with requirements mandated by federal, state and local environmental/health laws and reducing the cost of this compliance. Project 835 develops enabling technologies for advanced life cycle analysis, advanced sensing, and advanced remediation of Army unique hazardous and toxic wastes at sites containing waste ammunition, explosives, heavy metals, propellants, smokes, chemical munitions, and other organic contaminants. Project 895 focuses on reducing hazardous waste generation through process modification and control, materials recycling and substitution and developing technologies to predict and mitigate range and maneuver constraints associated with current and emerging weapon systems, doctrine, and regulations.  Project 896 investigates technologies for ecosystem vulnerability assessment, and ecosystem analysis, monitoring, modeling and mitigation to support sustainable use of Army lands and airspace to reduce or eliminate environmental constraints to military missions.   

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy and supports the Army Strategy for the Environment.  

Technologies developed in this PE are transitioned to PE 0603728A (Environmental Quality Technology Demonstrations).

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project designs and develops tools and methods to enable the Army to reduce or eliminate environmental impacts both in the United States and abroad.  These technologies reduce the impact of legal and regulatory environmental restrictions on installation facilities, training and testing lands and ranges, as well as provide a means to avoid fines and facility shutdowns within the United States and reduce environmental impacts to the Warfighter abroad.  New and innovative technologies are essential for the effective control and reduction of military unique hazardous and non-hazardous wastes on military installations and associated with contingency operations bases worldwide.  Efforts focus on the impacts of new materiel that will enter the Army inventory within the next decade and beyond.  This project focuses on developing sustainable environmental protection technologies that help the Army maintain environmental compliance for sources of pollution such as production facilities, facility contamination and other waste streams.  Efforts abroad include a focus on designing and developing technologies for deployed forces with environmentally safe, operationally enhanced and cost effective technologies and/or processes to achieve maximum diversion, minimization, or volume reduction of base camp and field waste.  This project focuses on Army-unique ecosystem vulnerability assessment, and ecosystem analysis, modeling, adaptation and mitigation technologies for installations associated with air quality and endangered species management and their impacts on training and testing mission.

The work in this project supports the Army S&amp;T Innovation Enablers (formerly Enduring Technologies) Portfolio.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project investigates a quantitative means to determine the environmental effects resulting from exposure to Army-unique explosives, propellants, smokes and products containing nanomaterials and new and emerging compounds and materials across the Army training and operations. This research provides the basis for tools and methods to respond to regulatory constraints, and to protect the health of the Soldier and the extended Army community. Results of this research will be integrated into the life cycle analysis of all new Army materials and chemicals. The specific results of this research include: determination of acceptable contaminant concentration levels for residual Army-unique chemicals and materials of concern that minimize adverse effects on the environment and human health. This includes development of methods that guide the design of nanomaterials and other new and emerging materials such that adverse effects on the environment are minimized in their designed state and when they enter the environment where they may break down. Example areas of research include genomics analysis, cutting edge nanomaterial analysis, and computational/molecular modeling.  Interim projects are used by PEO Ammo and IEW&amp;S for use in life cycle analysis, risk assessment, and cleanup. Interim products are also US Environmental Protection Agency approved criteria documents to be used in risk assessment procedures and establishing regulatory limits. The Army uses these criteria during negotiations with regulatory officials to set scientifically and economically appropriate cleanup and discharge limits on Army lands.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The project develops pollution prevention technologies required to reduce/eliminate the environmental footprint resulting from the manufacture, maintenance, use and surveillance of Army ordnance and other weapon systems. This project researches and develops revolutionary technologies to eliminate or significantly reduce the environmental impacts that threaten the sustainment of production and maintenance facilities, training ranges and operational areas. The project supports the transformation of the Army by ensuring that advanced energetic materials required for high-performance munitions (gun, rocket, missile propulsion systems, and warhead explosives) are devised to meet weapons lethality/survivability stretch goals in parallel with, and in compliance to, foreseeable sustainment requirements. Specific technology thrusts include environmentally-benign explosives developed with computer modeling using Department of Defense high-performance computing resources; novel energetics that capitalize on the unique behavior of nano-scale structures; chemically engineered explosive and propellant formulations produced with minimal environmental waste, long-storage lifetime, rapid/benign environmental degradation properties, and efficient extraction and reuse; and fuses, pyrotechnics, and initiators that are free from toxic chemicals. Other focus areas include base camp energy reduction initiatives, elimination of waste streams in contingency operations and toxic metal reductions from surface finishing processes.

This project provides the Army the technical capability to manage, protect and improve the biophysical characteristics of training and testing areas needed for realistic and sustainable ranges and training lands.  Technologies within this project enable users to match mission events and training schedules with the resource capabilities of specific land areas and understand how the use of those resources effect mission support and environmental compliance.  The project investigates, designs, and develops novel methods and technologies to adapt and restore lands damaged during training activities and allow sustained use of Army resources.  The project supports readiness and full use of training lands through development of invasive, threatened, and endangered species monitoring technology and management technologies for species at risk.  The project also designs and develops tools and technologies to avoid training restrictions and reduce constraints on training lands associated with potential impacts from climate change.

This project focuses development in wireless transport (e.g. mobile radio based communications systems) to develop new techniques for improving communications in high radio frequency (RF) interference environments such as in the presence of electronic warfare (EW) and to increase the communications capacity of terrestrial and satellite communications (SATCOM) systems. This project also investigates enabling antenna components, materials, designs and configurations to reduce the visual signature of antennas on Soldier, vehicular and airborne platforms and reduce co-site interference on platforms with multiple transceivers such as radios and jammers. Additionally this project investigates cyber security devices, software and techniques to harden wireless communications networks against cyber attacks; and new mobile networking protocols to make wireless, on-the-move (OTM) communications networks more responsive to user needs. This project also investigates network operations software and techniques that improve the ability of the Soldier to manage and maintain complex, dynamic networks; and improved spectrum management software tools to make more efficient use of over-subscribed RF spectrum. This project also provides new technology capabilities to lower the size, weight, power (SWAP) and cost of networking systems deployed on Army platforms through rapid technology improvements in hardware and software convergence.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element (PE) investigates, evaluates, and advances technologies, techniques and tools for depiction and representation of the physical and human environment for use in military planning and operations; for characterizing geospatial, atmospheric and weather conditions and impacts on systems and military missions; for conducting mobility, counter-mobility, survivability and force protection; and for enabling secure, sustainable, energy efficient facilities.  Research focuses on special requirements for battlefield visualization, tactical decision aids, weather intelligence products, and capabilities to exploit space assets.  Project 855 conducts geospatial research and development supporting a standard sharable geospatial foundation enabling a common operating environment across mission and command systems. Project H71 supports the materiel development, testing, and operations communities in evaluating the impacts of weather and atmospheric obscurants on military materiel and operations. Project T40 advances technologies for adaptive and expedient force protection across the range of military operations (includes Deployable Force Protection).  This project also designs and evaluates software and hardware to identify and mitigate positive and negative ground obstacles; characterizes austere navigation environments and designs/evaluates materiel solutions including rapidly emplacable bridging, ground stabilization and breakwater structures; and builds and uses modeling and simulation tools to advance understanding of the interactions of weapons/munitions and novel defeat methodologies with buildings, shelters, bunkers, berms and bridges.  Project T41 investigates and evaluates application of technologies to enable garrison/post commanders to plan, monitor and operate facilities more efficiently, cost-effectively, securely and sustainably; and creates tools (including advanced models and simulation) that provide a framework for making trades and decisions, and also supports research to evaluate non-combat population characteristics and status from social and cultural perspectives to achieve mission objectives.  Project T42 develops and validates models and simulations to understand the impacts of the physical environment on the performance of forces, ground and air vehicles, and sensors; as well as the impact of natural and man-made changes in the environment on military operations.  Project T45 investigates and evaluates materials, components and systems that have potential to reduce energy losses in buildings and shelters; and potential to detect and mitigate consequences of contaminants such as bacteria and molds in air handling equipment and building materials.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project develops tactical weather and atmospheric effects/impacts algorithms for their integration into battlefield information products.  Efforts include high-resolution, local assessments and forecasts of meteorological conditions in near real time including effects of urban and mountainous terrain; analytical tools to assess the impact of the atmosphere to optimize system performance and operations planning and advanced atmospheric sensing applications to characterize and mitigate wind and turbulence in complex terrain.  It provides detailed model applications for various effects of the atmosphere on electro-optical and acoustic target detection, location, and identification.  This project develops both physics-based decision aids and rule-based decision support systems for assessing the impacts of weather/atmosphere across a spectrum of friendly and threat weapons systems, sensors, platforms, and operations.  Information can be applied to mission planning and execution, battlefield visualization, reconnaissance surveillance and target acquisition, route planning to maximize stealth and efficiency, web enabled tactical decision aids, and also modeling of environmental impacts for combat simulations and war games.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project investigates, evaluates, and creates technologies for adaptive and expedient force protection across the range of military operations; for force projection and maneuver, including austere port entry and overcoming battlespace gaps (such as cliffs, ravines, mudflats, shallow rivers, and other natural obstacles) through prediction, definition, avoidance, or defeat of the gaps; for scalable weapons effects; and for high-resolution representation of near-surface terrain and environment for use with sensor models for things such as target detection and unmanned ground systems (UGS) navigation. This research further provides physics-based representations of ground vehicle mobility, obstacle and barrier placement, survivability, and weapons effects in complex and urban terrain modeling and simulation. Work in this project increases the survivability of critical assets from conventional, unconventional, and emerging weapons attacks and enables maneuver support of deployed forces, while reducing their logistical footprint.

                                    <r2:Description>This effort researches, designs, and creates rapidly deployable detection, assessment, passive protection and active defensive technology-enabled capabilities to meet critical capability gaps for troops operating remotely at smaller bases or integrated with local communities. The needs at these smaller bases (less than 300 persons, not all U.S. troops) are unique based on constraints in transportability, manpower, organic resources, lack of hardening of structures, resupply, and training for example. Moreover, lack of interoperability and scalability consume manpower and take away from time needed to perform missions. Threats include bases being overrun by hostiles; direct fire; rockets, artillery and mortars; and improvised explosive devices. Force protection challenges at these remote, smaller bases include providing increased standoff detection, blast and ballistic protection, and kinetic technologies subject to the constraints mentioned above.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project investigates and evaluates technologies and techniques to ensure sustainable, cost efficient and effective facilities and to achieve resilient and sustainable installation and base operations.  The project focuses on facilities and operations technologies directly supporting training, readiness, force projection, force protection, homeland security, and forward base operations.  Facility enhancement technologies contribute to cost reductions in the Army facility life cycle process (infrastructure planning, assessment, design, construction, revitalization, sustainment, and disposal), and the supporting installation operations.  This work improves the ability of installations to support forces to meet transformation goals, improves designs for close battle training facilities, and enhances security of Soldiers, families, and civilians.  Technologies evolving from this work include integrated planning and design tools for US facilities and forward bases, models predicting water dispersed contaminant effects on facilities and occupants; sustainable facility and base management; collaborative decision support tools; and advanced materials.  In addition, technologies from this work will support analysis of socio-cultural and facility issues in forward base operations, including urban environments.  

Work in this project supports the Army S&amp;T Innovation Enablers (formerly Enduring Technologies) and Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (C3I) Portfolios.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element (PE) conducts applied behavioral and social science research to enhance the Soldier Lifecycle (e.g., selection, assignment, training, leader development) and human relations (e.g., culture of dignity, respect, and inclusion). These technologies provide advanced personnel measures that more fully assess potential and predict performance, behavior, attitudes, and resilience. These technologies also provide innovative and effective training and mentoring methods to ensure Soldiers, leaders, and units have the knowledge, skills, and abilities to sustain positive unit climates and meet mission requirements in uncertain and complex environments. This PE evaluates new selection measures, refines performance metrics, assesses innovative training methods, and conducts scientific assessments to inform Human Capital policy and programs.  Research in this PE will result in effective non-materiel solutions to help the Army adjust to changes in force size and structure, a variety of mission demands and contexts, challenges in human relations, and budgetary constraints.

Efforts in this program element support the Army Science and Technology Soldier portfolio.

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Human Capital Strategy.

Work in this PE is performed by the US Army Research Institute (ARI) for the Behavioral and Social Sciences in Ft. Belvoir, VA.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project matures and demonstrates fully integrated holistic expeditionary base camp (EBC) capabilities with mission-specific plug and play components, subsystems, and modules designed to optimize manpower requirements, improve situational awareness, increase Soldier readiness and survivability, optimize habitation, reduce logistics footprint, enhance supportability, and reduce cost. EBC systems provide an operational capability for small combat units (battalion and below) and Soldiers in varying environments, which are rapidly deployable and re-locatable and require no Military Construction and limited materiel handing support. This project integrates mature technologies to create mission specific lab demonstrators and evaluates the performance capabilities using metrics and methodologies developed under PE 0603001A/Project VT5.

Efforts in this program element support the Army science and technology Soldier/Squad portfolio.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element (PE) supports application of knowledge gained through basic research to refine drugs, vaccines, medical devices, diagnostics, medical practices/procedures, and other preventive measures essential to the protection and sustainment of Warfighter health. Research is conducted in five principal areas: Combat Casualty Care; Military Operational Medicine; Military Relevant Infectious Diseases Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine; and Systems Biology/Network Sciences. Research is funded in six projects.  

Project 869 refines knowledge and technologies on screening tools and preventive measures for post-traumatic stress disorder and mild traumatic brain injuries, physiological monitors, and interventions to protect Warfighter's from injuries resulting from operational stress, and exposure to hazardous environments and materials.  Also conducts research on medically valid testing devices (i.e. the test mannequins that are true to the human form and physiologically and anatomically accurate) and predictive models used for the refinement of Warfighter protective equipment. This project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Program.  

Project 870 designs and refines medical diagnostic assays/tests, drugs, and vaccines for protection from and treatment of naturally occurring diseases, wound infections of military importance, as identified by worldwide medical surveillance and military threat analysis. This project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Program.  

Project 874 identifies and evaluates drugs, biologics (products derived from living organisms), medical devices, and diagnostics for field trauma care systems, resuscitation, life support, and post-evacuation restorative and rehabilitative care. Focus is identifying more effective critical care technologies and protocols to treat severe bleeding, traumatic brain injury and other blast related injuries, and treatments for ocular (eye) injury and visual system dysfunction.  Additional focus areas are laboratory and animal studies of regenerating skin, muscle, nerves, and bone tissue for the care and treatment of combat trauma casualties. This project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Program. 

Project FH2 conducts applied research focused on sustainment of a healthy Warfighters throughout the entire deployment life cycle.

Project VB4 includes applied research in systems biology of military-relevant diseases such as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), coagulopathy (blood clotting disorders), suicide, and chronic pain. Another focus is environmental exposure toxicology (study of the biology of harm from toxic substances in the environment). The goals are to understand mechanisms (processes and pathways), develop molecular and physiological markers (biological molecules as indicators of the body's functions such as immune response) for future diagnostic systems, and identify therapeutic interventions supporting early decisions for therapeutic strategies. The core capability is a data system that integrates iterative (successively building upon data and results) biological tests, computer simulations, and animal studies, providing powerful analyses in support of research across United States Army Medical Research &amp; Materiel Command. This project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Program. 

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology, focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

All medical applied research is conducted in compliance with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations. The FDA requires thorough testing in animals (preclinical testing) to ensure safety and, where possible, effectiveness prior to evaluation in controlled human clinical trials (upon transition to 6.3 Advanced Technology Development). This PE focuses on research and refinement of technologies such as product formulation and purification and laboratory test refinement with the aim of identifying candidate solutions. This work often involves testing in animal models. The EPA also requires thorough testing of products, such as sterilants, disinfectants, repellents, and insecticides to ensure the environment is adequately protected before these products are licensed for use.

Program refinement and execution is externally peer-reviewed and fully coordinated with all Services as well as other agencies through the Joint Technology Coordinating Groups of the Armed Services Biomedical Research Evaluation and Management (ASBREM) Community of Interest (COI). The ASBREM COI, formed under the authority of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, serves to facilitate coordination and prevent unnecessary duplication of effort within the Department of Defenses (DoD) biomedical research and refinement community, as well as their associated enabling research areas.

Work funded in this project PE is fully coordinated with efforts undertaken in PE 0603002A and the Defense Health Program.

Work in this PE is performed by the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR), Silver Spring, MD and its overseas laboratories; U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) and the Armed Forces Institute of Regenerative Medicine (AFIRM), Fort Detrick, MD; U.S. Army Center for Environmental Health Research (USACEHR), Fort Detrick, MD; U.S. Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine (USARIEM), Natick, MA; the U.S. Army Dental Trauma Research Detachment and the U.S. Army Institute of Surgical Research (USAISR), Joint Base San Antonio-Fort Sam Houston, TX; U.S. Army Aeromedical Research Laboratory (USAARL), Fort Rucker, AL; and the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC), Silver Spring, MD.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project conducts research to prevent and protect Warfighers from training and operational injuries, refine mechanisms for detection of physiological (human physical and biochemical function) and psychological (mental) health problems, evaluate hazards to head, neck, spine, eyes, and ears, set the standards for rapid return-to-duty, and determine new methods to sustain and enhance performance across the operational spectrum. This research provides medical information important to the design and operational use of military systems, and this work forms the basis for behavioral, training, pharmacological (drug actions), and nutritional interventions. 

The four main areas of study are: 
(1) Environmental Health and Protection 
(2) Physiological Health
(3) Injury Prevention and Reduction
(4) Psychological Health and Resilience

Additionally the Warfigher Systems Engineering Architecture task advances medical S&amp;T in the areas of injury prevention and performance sustainment in the context of human interaction with new Soldier systems and provide greater insight into informing new research in development of Warfigher systems and the interactions between Warfighers and the systems they employ.  

Promising efforts identified in this project are further matured under PE 0603002A, project MM3.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project conducts applied research for medical countermeasures to naturally occurring infectious diseases that pose a significant threat to the operational effectiveness of forces deployed outside the United States. Effective preventive countermeasures (protective/therapeutic drugs and vaccines and insect repellents and traps) protect the Force from disease and sustain operations by avoiding the need for evacuations from the theater of operations. Diseases of military importance are malaria, bacterial diarrhea, and viral diseases (e.g., dengue fever and hantavirus). In addition to countermeasures, this project funds refinement of improved diagnostic tools to facilitate early identification of infectious disease threats in an operational environment, informing Commanders of the need to institute preventive actions and improve medical care. Major goals are to integrate genomics (DNA-based) and proteomics (protein-based) as well as other new biotechnologies into the refinement of new concepts for new vaccine, drug, and diagnostics candidates.

Research conducted in this project focuses on the following five areas:

(1) Drugs to Prevent/Treat Parasitic (organisms living in or on another organisms) Diseases
(2) Vaccines for Prevention of Malaria
(3) Diagnostics and Disease Transmission Control
(4) Bacterial Disease Threats (diseases caused by bacteria)
(5) Viral Disease Threats (diseases caused by viruses)

For the refinement of drugs and biological products, studies in the laboratory and in animal models provide a proof-of-concept for these candidate products, including safety, toxicity (degree to which a substance can damage an organism), and effectiveness, and are necessary to provide evidence to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to justify approval for a product to enter into future human subject testing. Additional non-clinical studies are often needed in applied research even after candidate products enter into human testing during advanced technology development, usually at the direction of the FDA, to assess potential safety issues. Drug and vaccine refinement bears high technical risk. Of those candidates identified as promising in initial screens, the vast majority are eliminated after additional safety, toxicity, and/or effectiveness testing. Similarly, vaccine candidates have a high failure rate, because animal testing may not be a good predictor of human response, and therefore candidate technologies/products are often eliminated after going into human trials. Because of this high failure rate, a continuing effort to identify other potential candidates to sustain a working pipeline of countermeasures is critical for replacing those products that fail in testing.  

Work is managed by the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) in coordination with the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC). The Army is responsible for programming and funding all Department of Defense (DoD) naturally occurring infectious disease research requirements, thereby precluding duplication of effort within the Military Departments.   

Promising medical countermeasures identified in this project are further matured under PE 0603002A, project 810.
 
The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology, focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project refines and assesses concepts, techniques, and materiel that improve survivability and ensure better medical treatment outcomes for Warfighters wounded in combat and other military operations. Combat casualty care research addresses control of severe bleeding, revival and stabilization, predictive indicators and decision aids for life support systems , treatment of burns, and traumatic brain injury (TBI). Clinical and rehabilitative medicine research addresses tissue repair including transplant technologies, orthopedic injuries, eye injuries, genitourinary (reproductive and excretory organs) injury, and face trauma.

Research involves extensive collaboration with multiple academic institutions to refine treatments for combat wounds through Armed Forces Institute of Regenerative Medicine (AFIRM). This project is coordinated with the Military Departments and other government organizations to avoid duplication.

Research conducted in this project focuses on the following five areas:
(1) Damage Control Resuscitation
(2) Combat Trauma Therapies
(3) Combat Critical Care Engineering
(4) Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine
(5) Traumatic Brain Injury

All drugs, biological products, and medical devices are refined in accordance with FDA regulations, which govern testing in animals to assess safety, toxicity, and effectiveness and subsequent human subject clinical trials.  

Promising efforts identified in this project are further matured under PE 0603002A, project 840.

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology, focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

Work on this project is performed by U.S. Army Institute of Surgical Research (USAISR), the U.S. Army Dental Trauma Research Detachment (USADTRD), Joint Base San Antonio-Fort Sam Houston, TX; the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR), Silver Spring, MD; and the AFIRM, Fort Detrick, MD. 

Efforts in this project support the Soldier Portfolio and the principal areas of Combat Casualty Care and Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project conducts research to support applied research directed toward the sustainment of a healthy Warfighters from accession through retirement.  This research focuses on enhanced protection of Warfighters against health threats in military operations and training. Stressors that adversely affect individual Warfighter health readiness are identified and studied to refine interventions that will protect Soldiers and improve their health and performance in stressful environments. This is follow-on research that extends and applies findings from over a decade of research on Gulf War Illnesses and other chronic multi-symptom illnesses that have suspected nerve and behavioral alterations caused by environmental contaminants and deployment stressors. Key databases include the Millennium Cohort Study and the Total Army Injury and Health Outcomes Database. These databases allow us to evaluate interactions of psychological stress and other deployment and occupational stressors that affect Warfighter health behaviors.

Force Health Protection applied research is conducted in close coordination with the Department of Veterans Affairs. This project contains no duplication with any effort within the Military Departments and includes direct participation by other Services working on Army projects.

Research conducted in this project focuses on the following three areas:
(1) Millennium Cohort Research
(2) Biomarkers of Exposure and Environmental Biomonitoring
(3) Physiological Response and Blast and Blunt Trauma Models of Thoracic (Chest) and Pulmonary (Lung) Injuries
 
Promising efforts identified in this project are further matured under PE 0603002A, project FH4.

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology, focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.    
 
Work in this project is performed by the U.S. Army Center for Environmental Health Research (USACEHR), Fort Detrick, MD; the Naval Health Research Center (NHRC), San Diego, CA; and the U.S. Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine (USARIEM), Natick, MA.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This projects efforts support applied research. The primary capability of systems biology (field of study that focuses on complex interactions within biological systems, using a holistic approach) is to integration and analysis of complex human and animal study data and development of computational disease models, providing a method to discriminate unique combinations of biological molecules corresponding to clinical conditions, supporting transition of research to clinical applications.  This capability applies a systematic integrated approach to trace progression of illnesses and diseases and has already shown that the approach significantly reduces time, funds and effort invested in medical product development and refinement.  An application of systems biology is to characterize physiological pathways altered by toxic substances enabling identification of the causative toxic substances as well as to understand the injury mechanisms.  The detection/identification of physiological markers of exposure to toxic substances can then be used to support medical countermeasure decisions or development of targeted therapeutic drugs. 

These examples of more complex, yet integrated approaches to projects studying biological systems (PTSD project) have been shown to reduce both the time and expense of medical product development for the Army

Conduct applied research to identify and characterize (the substance itself and how it causes harm) toxic substances, e.g. Toxic Industrial Chemicals.  The molecular and physiological markers of intoxication are then applied to support diagnostic tools development of medical countermeasures.  Current studies are addressing exposures to industrial chemicals, toxicogenomics (study of what genes are involved with responding to a toxic substance and those genes associated with susceptibility to the toxic substance) of metals, health surveillance with assessment of micro-biome, metabolomics of heat injury, and modeling toxicity pathways.</r2:Description>
