            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Research Sciences Program Element is budgeted in the Basic Research Budget Activity because it provides the technical foundation for long-term National Security enhancement through the discovery of new phenomena and the exploration of the potential of such phenomena for Defense applications.  It supports the scientific study and experimentation that is the basis for more advanced knowledge and understanding in information, electronic, mathematical, computer, biological and materials sciences.

     The Bio/Info/Micro Sciences project will explore and develop potential technological breakthroughs that exist at the intersection of biology, information technology and micro/physical systems to exploit advances and leverage fundamental discoveries for the development of new technologies, techniques and systems of interest to the DoD.  Programs in this project will draw upon information and physical sciences to discover properties of biological systems that cross multiple scales of biological architecture and function, from the molecular and genetic level through cellular, tissue, organ, and whole organism levels. 

     The Math and Computer Sciences project supports long term national security requirements through scientific research and experimentation in new computational models and mechanisms for reasoning and communication in complex, interconnected systems. The project is exploring novel means of leveraging computer capabilities, including: practical, logical, heuristic, and automated reasoning by machines; development of enhanced human-to-computer and computer-to-computer interaction technologies; innovative approaches to the composition of software; innovative computer architectures; mathematical programs and their potential for defense applications; and new learning mechanisms for systematically upgrading and improving these capabilities.

      The Cyber Sciences project supports long term national security requirements through scientific research and experimentation in cybersecurity.  Networked computing systems control virtually everything, from power plants and energy distribution, transportation systems, food and water distribution, financial systems, to defense systems.  Protecting the infrastructure on which these systems rely is a national security issue.   The Cyber Sciences project will ensure DoD cyber-capabilities survive adversary attempts to degrade, disrupt, or deny military computing, communications, and networking systems.  Basic research in cyber security is required to provide a basis for continuing progress in this area. Promising research results will transition to both technology development and system-level projects.

     The Electronic Sciences project explores and demonstrates electronic and optoelectronic devices, circuits and processing concepts that will provide: 1) new technical options for meeting the information gathering, transmission and processing required to maintain near-real time knowledge of the enemy and the ability to communicate decisions based on that knowledge to all forces in near-real time; and 2) provide new means for achieving substantial increases in performance and cost reduction of military systems providing these capabilities.

     The Materials Sciences project provides the fundamental research that underpins the development and assembly of advanced nanoscale and bio-molecular materials, devices, and electronics for DoD applications that greatly enhance soldier awareness, capability, security, and survivability, such as materials with increased strength-to-weight ratio and ultra-low size, devices with ultra-low energy dissipation and power, novel spectroscopic sources, and electronics with persistent intelligence and improved surveillance capabilities.

     The Transformative Sciences project supports research and analysis that leverages converging technological forces and transformational trends in computing and the computing-reliant subareas of the social sciences, life sciences, manufacturing, and commerce.  The project integrates these diverse disciplines to improve military adaptation to sudden changes in requirements, threats, and emerging/converging trends, especially trends that have the potential to disrupt military operations.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Title>Quantitative Models of the Brain</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>The Quantitative Models of the Brain program will establish a functional mathematical basis on which to build future advances in cognitive neuroscience, computing capability, and signal processing across the DoD.  An important focus of this program will be determining how information is stored and recalled in the brain and other DoD-relevant signals, developing predictive, quantitative models of learning, memory, and measurement.  Using this understanding, the program will develop powerful new symbolic computational capabilities for the DoD in a mathematical system that will provide the ability to understand complex and evolving signals and tasks while decreasing software and hardware requirements and other measurement resources.  This includes a comprehensive mathematical theory to extract and leverage information in signals at multiple acquisition levels that would fundamentally generalize compressive sensing for multi-dimensional sources beyond domains typically used.  New insights related to signal priors, task priors, and adaptation will enable these advances.  This program will further exploit advances in the understanding and modeling of brain activity and organization to improve training of individuals and teams as well as identify new therapies for cognitive rehabilitation (e.g., Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)).  Critical to success will be the ability to detect cellular and network-level changes produced in the brain during the formation of new, hierarchically organized memories and memory classes, and to correlate those changes with memory function of animals during performance of behavioral tasks.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Title>Big Mechanism</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>The Big Mechanism program is creating new approaches to automated computational intelligence applicable to diverse domains such as biology, cyber, economics, social science, and intelligence.  Mastering these domains requires the capability to create abstract yet predictive - ideally causal - models from massive volumes of diverse data generated by human actors, physical sensors, and networked devices.  Current modeling approaches are heavily reliant on human insight and expertise, but the complexity of these models is growing exponentially and has now, or will soon, exceed the capacity for human comprehension.  Big Mechanism will create technologies to extract and normalize information for incorporation in flexible knowledge bases readily adapted to novel problem scenarios; powerful reasoning engines that can infer general rules from a collection of observations, apply general rules to specific instances, and generate (and compute the likelihood of) the most plausible explanations for a sequence of events; and knowledge synthesis techniques to derive abstract principles and/or create models of extreme complexity consistent with huge volumes of data.  Big Mechanism applications will accommodate an operator-in-the-loop by accepting questions posed in human natural language, providing drill-down to reveal the basis for an answer, taking user inputs to improve/correct derived associations, weightings, and conclusions, and querying the operator to clarify ambiguities and reconcile detected inconsistencies.  Big Mechanism techniques will integrate burgeoning data into causal models and explore these models for precise interventions.  The program has adopted cancer modeling as an initial focus because the availability of experimental data, and the complexity of the problems are representative of challenges facing the DoD in areas such as cyber attribution, open-source intelligence, and economic indications and warning.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Title>Building Resource Adaptive Software from Specifications (BRASS)</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>The Building Resource-Adaptive Software from Specifications (BRASS) program is developing an automated framework that permits software systems to seamlessly adapt to changing resource conditions in an evolving operational environment.  Effective adaptation is realized through rigorously defined specifications that capture application resource assumptions and resource guarantees made by the environment.  The current manual adaptation process is based on corrective patching, which is time-consuming, error-prone, and expensive.  Predicting the myriad of possible environment changes that an application may encounter in its lifetime is problematic, and existing reactive approaches are brittle and often incorrect.  The use of specification-based adaptation will allow BRASS applications to be correctly restructured in real time whenever stated assumptions or guarantees are broken.  This restructuring is optimized to trade off execution fidelity and functionality for continued operation.  BRASS will create tools to automatically discover and monitor resource changes, build new analyses to infer deep resource-based specifications, and implement compiler and runtime transformations that can efficiently adapt to resource changes.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Communicating With Computers (CWC) program is advancing the state-of-the-art in human-computer interaction by enabling computers to comprehend language, gesture, facial expression and other communicative modalities in context.  Human language is inherently ambiguous and so humans depend strongly on perception of the physical world and context to make language comprehensible.  CWC aims to provide computers with analogous capabilities to sense the physical world, encode the physical world in a perceptual structure, and link language to this perceptual encoding.  To accomplish this, CWC will apply and extend research in language, vision, gesture recognition and interpretation, dialog management, cognitive linguistics, and the psychology of visual encoding, which are essential for human communication in the physical world.  CWC will also work to extend the communication techniques developed for physical contexts to nonphysical contexts such as virtual constructs in the cyber domain.  CWC advances will impact military application areas such as robotics and command and control.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Mining and Understanding Software Enclaves (MUSE) program is developing program analyses and frameworks for improving the resilience and reliability of complex software applications at scale.  MUSE techniques will apply machine learning algorithms to large software corpora to repair likely defects and vulnerabilities in existing programs and to discover new programs that conform to desired behaviors and specifications.  MUSE frameworks will enable robust execution of large-scale and data-intensive computations.  Specific technical challenges include persistent semantic artifact generation and analysis, defect identification and repair, pattern recognition, and specification inference and synthesis.  MUSE research will improve the security of intelligence-related applications and enhance computational capabilities in areas such as automated code maintenance and revision management, low-level systems implementation, graph processing, entity extraction, link analysis, high-dimensional data analysis, data/event correlation, and visualization.</r2:Description>

At present, programming languages allow programmers to create programs having large attack surfaces, major flaws, and critical vulnerabilities.  Minimizing the attack surface, correcting flaws, and eliminating vulnerabilities are the programmer's responsibility, and the degree to which the programmer succeeds depends largely on the skill of the programmer.  The languages developed by SPL will break this paradigm by incorporating security features in the language itself that ensure formal correctness throughout all phases of the software development lifecycle.  SPL languages and integrated development environments will facilitate the creation of software free from broad classes of flaws and vulnerabilities, and enable even novice programmers to readily create secure computer programs.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The objective of the Unconventional Processing of Signals for Intelligent Data Exploitation (UPSIDE) program is to achieve extreme power savings while increasing performance for object detection and tracking from video streams by using an unconventional, approximate computing approach. Today, image processing applications use high precision, digital representations, which are inherently power-inefficient, particular for data produced by noisy, analog, real-time sensors such as video.  UPSIDE's unconventional approach uses pattern matching techniques that map very efficiently to both analog complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) circuits and various emerging devices.  Furthermore, this pattern matching approach can leverage the physics of certain emerging devices to compute a best pattern match directly requiring very little power. The UPSIDE computing approach will be benchmarked using a DoD-relevant image processing pipeline, to verify gains in both throughput and power efficiency.  The result will be new approach for image processing systems that demonstrate five orders of magnitude improvement, in terms of combined power and performance for the mixed signal implementations, and seven orders of magnitude improvements using the emerging devices.  The UPSIDE program will create a new generation of computing structures that will, in turn, enable revolutionary advances in Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) processing, particularly for DoD applications of embedded, real-time sensor data analysis.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>While the DoD has been extremely effective in deploying rigorous analytical and predictive methods for problems involving continuously valued variables (tracking, signals processing), analytical methods for discrete data such as graphs and networks have not kept pace.  Recent evidence has shown that network analysis can provide critical insight when used in DoD-relevant scenarios.  In this paradigm, nodes represent items of interest and their relationships or interactions are edges; the result forms a network or graph.  Current analysis of large networks, however, is just in its infancy: the composition of real-world networks is understood only at the most coarse and basic details (diameter, degree distribution).  In order to implement network techniques efficiently and usefully, a better understanding of the finer mathematical structure of these networks is needed.  This includes the development of a comprehensive and minimal mathematical set that characterizes networks of DoD interest and a description of how these quantities vary in both space and time.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The battlefield of the future will certainly have more data generators and sensors that produce information required to efficiently execute operations.  With networked sensors, the variety and complexity of the information streams will be even further extended.  This project studied silicon designs which help alleviate the complexity inherent in next generation systems.  These systems will have increasingly large data sets generated by their own multidomain sensors (such as RF and Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR) payloads) as well as new inputs from external sensors that may or may not have been planned for initially.  With current programming approaches, there are laborious coding requirements needed to assimilate new data streams. However, the context provided by these data sets is ever changing, and it is imperative for the integrated electronics to adapt to new information without a prolonged programming cycle.  Providing contextual cues for processing of data streams will alleviate the fusion challenges that are currently faced, and which stress networked battlefield systems.  As opposed to the intuition and future-proofing that is required at the programming stage of a current system, the silicon circuit of the future will be able to use contextual cues to adapt accordingly to new information as it is provided.  The fundamental aspects of this program looked at various algorithms to explore the ability to use context to adapt to new information.  Applied research for the program was budgeted in PE 0602303E, Project IT-02.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Transparent Computing program is developing technologies to enable the implementation of more effective security policies across distributed systems.  The scale and complexity of modern information systems obscures linkages between security-related events, the result being that detection of attacks and anomalies must rely on narrow contextual information rather than complete knowledge of the event's provenance.  This shortcoming facilitates attacks such as advanced persistent threats (APTs).  The Transparent Computing program will address these problems by creating the capability to propagate security-relevant information and ensure component interactions are consistent with established behavior profiles and policies.  Transparent Computing technologies are particularly important for large integrated systems with diverse components such as distributed surveillance systems, autonomous systems, and enterprise information systems.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Space/Time Analysis for Cybersecurity (STAC) program is developing techniques to detect vulnerabilities to algorithmic complexity and side channel attacks in software.  Historically, adversaries have exploited software implementation flaws through buffer and heap overflow attacks.  Advances in operating systems have largely mitigated such attacks, so now cyber adversaries must find new ways of compromising software.  Algorithmic complexity and side channel attacks are emerging as the next generation of attacks since they depend on intrinsic properties of the algorithms themselves rather than implementation flaws.  News reports have highlighted the first wave of these attacks (CRIME, BREACH, Hash DoS).  The STAC program seeks to develop new analysis tools and techniques to detect vulnerabilities to these attacks in the software upon which the U.S. government, military, and economy depend.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The SafeWare program is developing new code obfuscation techniques for protecting software from reverse engineering.  At present, adversaries can extract sensitive information from stolen software, which can include cryptographic private keys, special inputs/failsafe modes, proprietary algorithms and even the software architecture itself.  Today's state of the art in software obfuscation adds junk code (loops that do nothing, renaming of variables, redundant conditions, etc.), which unfortunately does little more than inconvenience the aggressor.  Recent breakthroughs in theoretical cryptography have the potential to make software obfuscation into a mathematically rigorous science, very much like what the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) algorithm did for the encryption of messages in the 1970's.  The SafeWare program aims to take this very early-stage theory, which in its present form incurs too much runtime overhead to be practical, and re-tool its mathematical foundations such that one day it will be practical and efficient.  As with RSA, SafeWare methods will require the solution of a computationally hard mathematical problem as a necessary condition for a successful de-obfuscation attack.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project seeks to continue the phenomenal progress in microelectronics innovation that has characterized the last decades by exploring and demonstrating electronic and optoelectronic devices, circuits and processing concepts that will: 1) provide new technical options for meeting the information gathering, transmission and processing required to maintain near real-time knowledge of the enemy and the ability to communicate decisions based on that knowledge to all forces in near real-time; and 2) provide new means for achieving substantial increases in performance and cost reduction of military systems providing these capabilities.  Research areas include new electronic and optoelectronic device and circuit concepts, operation of devices at higher frequency and lower power, extension of diode laser operation to new wavelength ranges relevant to military missions, development of uncooled and novel infrared detector materials for night vision and other sensor applications, development of innovative optical and electronic technologies for interconnecting modules in high performance systems, research to realize field portable electronics with reduced power requirements, and system and component level improvements to provide greater affordability and reliability.  Additionally, electronically controlled microinstruments offer the possibility of nanometer-scale probing, sensing and manipulation for ultra-high density information storage "on-a-chip," for nanometer-scale patterning, and for molecular level analysis and synthesis.  These microinstruments may also offer new approaches to integration, testing, controlling, manipulating and manufacturing nanometer-scale structures, molecules and devices.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The Semiconductor Technology Advanced Research Network (STARNet) program is a government-industry partnership, combining the expertise and resources from select defense, semiconductor, and information companies with those of DARPA, to sponsor an external set of academic research teams that are focused on specific technology needs set by experts in industry and government.  Efforts under this program will remove the roadblocks to achieving performance needed for future sensing, communication, computing, and memory applications.  The program involves close collaboration between these experts and the academic base, with industry providing 60% of program funding matched by 40% from DARPA.  For both industrial and government participants, leveraging shared research funding for high risk, pre-competitive technology explorations focused on shared technical hurdles is very attractive.

Research in STARNet is divided into a discovery thrust (ACCEL) and an integration thrust (NEXT) executed by virtual academic centers and focused on exploiting current and emerging technologies to provide new capabilities.  ACCEL seeks to discover new material systems, devices, and novel computing/sensing architectures.  NEXT involves projects on advanced analog and mixed signal circuitry, complex system design tools, and alternative computing architectures.  As the projects in ACCEL mature, it is expected that they will replace the efforts in NEXT that are based on current standard technologies for integrated circuits.

The STARNet program creates a community where industry and government participate as co-sponsors to guide and learn from a large academic research base (including approximately 42 universities, 171 faculty researchers, 638 students, and more than 109 industry associate personnel), with DoD shaping the goals to have direct impact on important long-range DoD needs.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Title>Direct On-Chip Digital Optical Synthesis (DODOS)</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>The development of techniques for precise frequency control of radio frequencies (RF) and microwave radiation in the 1940's revolutionized modern warfare.  Frequency control is the enabling technology for radar, satellite and terrestrial communications, and positioning and navigation technology, among many other core DoD capabilities.  By comparison, frequency control at optical frequencies is relatively immature, comparable to the state-of-the-art of microwave control in the 1930's.  The first practical demonstration of optical frequency synthesis, utilizing a self-referenced optical comb, was performed in 1999 and, since that time, the precision and accuracy of optical measurements has improved by four orders of magnitude, including the demonstration of atomic clocks utilizing optical-frequency atomic transitions that far outperform existing technology based on microwave transitions.  To date, however, optical frequency control has been constrained to laboratory experiments due to the large size, relative fragility, and high cost of optical comb-based synthesizers.  Recent developments in self-referenced optical frequency combs in microscale resonators enable the development of a fully-integrated chip-scale optical frequency synthesizer.  Ubiquitous low-cost robust optical frequency synthesis is expected to create a similar disruptive capability in optical technology as microwave frequency synthesis did in the 1940's, enabling high-bandwidth coherent optical communications, coherent synthesized-aperture LiDAR, portable high-accuracy atomic clocks, high-resolution standoff gas/toxin detection, and intrusion detection, among other foreseen applications.

The Direct On-chip Digital Optical Synthesis (DODOS) program will investigate high-performance photonic components for creating a microscale high-accuracy optical frequency synthesizer in a compact robust package, suitable for deployment in a wide variety of mission-critical DoD applications.  Significant challenges in the program include reducing the power threshold and stabilizing microresonator optical combs, developing efficient devices for on-chip second harmonic generation, and characterizing the frequency stability and phase noise of a slave laser locked to the stabilized comb.  Applied research for this program is funded within PE 0602716E, Project ELT-01.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The DoD has an unfilled need for a persistent, event driven sensing capability, where physical, electromagnetic and other sensors can be pre-placed and remain dormant until awoken by an external trigger or stimulus.  State-of-the-art sensors use active electronics to monitor the environment for the external trigger.  The power consumed by these electronic circuits limits the sensor lifetime to durations of weeks to months.  The Near Zero Power RF and Sensor Operations (N-ZERO) program will extend the lifetime of remotely deployed sensors from months to years.  N-ZERO will develop the underlying technologies and demonstrate the capability to continuously and passively monitor the environment and wake-up an electronic circuit upon detection of a specific signature or trigger.  Thereafter, sensor lifetime will be limited only by processing and communications of confirmed events.

This program will investigate the development of highly innovative sensors and sensor architectures as well as signal processing and digitization technologies with near zero power consumption.  In particular, a fundamental understanding of the trade space that simultaneously minimizes power consumption, the minimum detectable signal, and the probability of false detection will be explored.

                                <r2:Title>High power Amplifier using Vacuum electronics for Overmatch Capability (HAVOC)</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>The effectiveness of combat operations across all domains increasingly depends on our ability to control and exploit the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum, and to deny its use to our adversaries.  Below 30 GHz, the proliferation and availability of inexpensive high-power commercial RF sources has made the EM spectrum crowded and contested, challenging our spectrum dominance.  The numerous tactical advantages offered by operating at higher frequencies, most notably the wide bandwidths available, is driving both commercial and DoD solid-state and vacuum electronic amplifiers into the millimeter wave (mm-wave) spectrum above 30 GHz. Control of the mm-wave spectrum necessitates advanced and increasingly more sophisticated electronic components and systems.  The performance of these systems strongly depends on the available amplifier power.

The High power Amplifier using Vacuum electronics for Overmatch Capability (HAVOC) program will fund basic research in the area of vacuum electronics with the ultimate goal of improving the fundamental understanding of the various phenomena governing the science and technology for the next generation of vacuum electronic amplifiers operating at mm-wave frequencies above 75 GHz.  Focus areas will include modeling and simulation techniques, advanced manufacturing methods, novel beam-wave interaction structures, high current density and long-life cathodes, and other relevant topics.

                                <r2:Title>Precise Robust Inertial Guidance for Munitions (PRIGM)</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>The DoD relies on GPS for ubiquitous and accurate positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT). With the increased prevalence of intentional GPS jamming, spoofing, and other GPS-denial threats, GPS access is increasingly unavailable in contested theaters and alternative sources of PNT are required.  In particular, guided munitions navigation is the most immediate and among the most demanding of GPS-denial challenges, due to the necessity of operating in highly contested theaters and the stringent requirements for minimization of cost, size, weight, and power consumption (CSWaP). The Precise Robust Inertial Guidance for Munitions (PRIGM) program will develop low-CSWaP inertial sensor technology for GPS-free munitions navigation.  PRIGM comprises two focus areas: 1) Development of a Navigation-Grade Inertial Measurement Unit (NGIMU) that transitions state-of-the-art micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) to DoD platforms by 2020; and 2) Research and development of Advanced Inertial MEMS Sensors (AIMS) to achieve gun-hard, high-bandwidth, high dynamic range navigation requirements with the objective of complete autonomy in 2030.  PRIGM will advance state-of-the-art MEMS gyros from TRL-3 devices to a TRL-6 transition platform (complete IMU) that enables Service Labs to perform TRL-7 field demonstrations.  PRIGM will exploit recent advances in heterogeneous integration of photonics and complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) and advanced MEMS technology to realize novel inertial sensors for application in extreme dynamic environments and beyond navigation-grade performance.

Future warfighting scenarios will take place in a GPS-denied world.  When GPS is not available inertial sensors will provide autonomous positioning and navigation information.  For successful transition to the warfighter, these sensors need to be low-CSWaP, have unprecedented precision and stability, and be immune to the perturbations of external vibrations and temperature fluctuations.  PRIGM will identify, investigate, and demonstrate novel inertial sensing schemes that are capable of being miniaturized once proof of concept is complete.  Advanced research efforts are funded in PE 0602716E, Project ELT-01 and advanced development efforts funded in PE 0603739E, Project MT-15.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>Advanced materials and novel devices have often become the basis for new and asymmetric military capabilities.  The adoption of Gallium arsenide (GaAs) monolithic microwave integrated circuits greatly increased the range and effectiveness of U.S. radar systems, and recently matured Gallium Nitride (GaN) technology will be deployed with even greater capabilities.  However these major investments were only possible after materials were advanced to a level of maturity that a device program could be executed.  The Quantum and Materials Basics (QMB) program will investigate basic materials and device physics to mature concepts to the point that functioning components could be tested.  These materials promise performance that will radically change future military systems, far exceeding the state of the art but only after they can be matured.  The community is pushing towards the ultimate limits set by quantum mechanics, and managing this scaling requires fundamental research.  Promising avenues of research include highly linear 1D and 2D devices and materials that would increase the dynamic range of RF transceivers; coupling of electrical, acoustic, and/or optical fields to significantly reduce the size and improve performance of RF components; and addressing the most outstanding challenges to deploying timing and sensing devices based on modern atomic physics and technology.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Title>Microscale Plasma Devices (MPD)</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>The goal of the Microscale Plasma Devices (MPD) program was to design, develop, and characterize MPD technologies, circuits, and substrates.  The MPD program focused on development of fast, small, reliable, high carrier-density, micro-plasma switches capable of operating in extreme conditions, such as high-radiation and high-temperature environments.  Specific focus was given to methods that provide efficient generation of ions that can perform robust signal processing of RF through light electromagnetic energy over a range of gas pressures.  Applications for such devices are far reaching, including the construction of complete high-frequency plasma-based circuits, and microsystems with superior resistance to radiation and extreme temperature environments.  MPDs were developed in various circuits and substrates to demonstrate the efficacy of different approaches.  MPD-based microsystems are demonstrated in DoD applications where electronic systems must survive in extreme environments.

The Basic Research part of this effort focused on fundamental MPD research to advance scientific knowledge based on the study of several key MPD design parameters.  These parameters included ultra-high pressure and high carrier density regimes.  MPD focused on expanding the design space for plasma devices enabling revolutionary advances in micro-plasma device performance.  MPD developed innovative concepts and technologies that are clearly disruptive with respect to the current state of the art in terms of switching speed (less than 100 picoseconds), carrier density (exceeding 1E18 per cubic centimeter), and capable of operation and robustness in extreme high-radiation or high-temperature (600degC) environments.  Fundamental scientific knowledge derived from MPD is also expected to drive developments in commercialization of MPD technology developed and funded in PE 0602716E, Project ELT-01.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Title>Micro-coolers for Focal Plane Arrays (MC-FPA)</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>The Micro-coolers for Focal Plane Arrays (MC-FPA) program developed low size, weight, power, and cost (SWaP-C) cryogenic coolers for application in high-performance infrared (IR) cameras.  It is well known that the sensitivity of an IR focal-plane array (FPA) is improved by cooling its detectors to cryogenic temperatures.  The disadvantages of state-of-the-art cryo-coolers are their large size, high power and high cost.  On the other hand, thermoelectric (TE) coolers used in low performance IR cameras are relatively small, but are inefficient, and it is difficult to achieve temperatures below 200 Kelvin (K).

To reduce IR camera SWaP-C, innovations in cooler technology are needed.  This program exploited the Joule-Thomson (J-T) cooling principle, in a silicon-based Micro Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) technology, to develop and demonstrate wafer-scale integrated micro-cryogenic IR FPA coolers with very low SWaP-C.  MEMS microfluidics, piezoelectric MEMS, and CMOS electronics were used to demonstrate an integrated cold head and compressor, all in a semiconductor chip.  This program has related applied research efforts funded under PE 0602716E, Project ELT-01.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Fundamentals of Nanoscale and Emergent Effects and Engineered Devices program seeks to understand and exploit a broad range of physical properties and new physics that emerge as a result of material and/or device structure and organization at nano-scale dimensions and/or at extreme temperature and pressure.  There are a wide variety of material properties that currently exist only at the nanoscale including quantized current-voltage behavior, very low melting points, high specific heats, large surface to volume ratio, high efficiency catalysis, enhanced radiative heat transfer, and correlated electron effects that arise in low dimensional systems.  In addition, extreme high pressure conditions can lead to new material polymorphs or phases with dramatically enhanced physical, mechanical and functional properties.  The focus of this thrust is to further characterize these emergent properties and to identify new synthesis approaches to enable access to these properties in stable, bulk material systems suitable for a wide range of DoD applications.  The insights gained from research performed under this thrust will enable new, more efficient, and powerful material and device architectures that will benefit many DoD applications including controllable photonic devices that operate over multiple wavelengths, ultra-high sensitivity magnetic sensors, high-throughput biochemical sensors for known and unknown (engineered) molecules, ultra-precision air and water purification systems, materials for hypersonic aircraft, and advanced armor protection.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Basic Photon Science thrust is examining the fundamental science of photons, and their interactions in integrated devices, from their inherent information-carrying capability (both quantum mechanically and classically), to novel modulation techniques using not only amplitude and phase, but also orbital angular momentum.  The new capabilities driven by this science will impact DoD through novel approaches to communications, signal processing, spectroscopic sensing, and imaging applications.  For example, fully exploiting the computational imaging paradigm and associated emerging technologies will ultimately yield ultra-low size, weight, and power persistent/multi-functional intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance systems that greatly enhance soldier awareness, capability, security, and survivability.  One focus of this thrust is to explore approaches for optical frequency division and harmonic generation for applications such as time distribution from ultrastable optical clocks, ultra-low phase noise microwaves, frequency references, table-top sources of coherent x-rays, and isolated attosecond pulses.  In addition, this thrust will pursue novel, chip-scale optical frequency comb sources and associated technologies throughout the electromagnetic spectrum for spectroscopic sensing and demonstrate their performance with proof-of-concept studies in targeted applications.  These sources will enable and spawn entirely new fields in simultaneous remote sensing, identification, and quantification of multiple trace materials in spectrally cluttered backgrounds.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The goal of the Living Foundries program is to create a revolutionary, biologically-based manufacturing platform for the DoD and the Nation.  With its ability to perform complex chemistries, be flexibly programmed through DNA code, scale, adapt to changing environments and self-repair, biology represents one of the most powerful manufacturing platforms known.  Living Foundries seeks to develop the foundational technological infrastructure to transform biology into an engineering practice, speeding the biological design-build-test-learn cycle and expanding the complexity of systems that can be engineered.  Ultimately, Living Foundries aims to provide game-changing manufacturing paradigms for the DoD, enabling adaptable, on-demand production of critical and high-value molecules.

Living Foundries will develop tools to simplify, abstract, and standardize the biological production pathway optimization process.  Additionally, Living Foundries will identify the fundamental design rules that govern the construction and organization of underlying genetic elements in the production pathways.  Research thrusts include developing the fundamental tools, capabilities and methodologies to accelerate the biological design-build-test cycle, thereby reducing the extensive cost and time it takes to engineer new systems and expanding the complexity and accuracy of designs that can be built.  The result will be rapid design, construction, implementation, and testing of complex, higher-order genetic networks with programmable functionality.  Applied research for this program is budgeted in PE 0602715E, Project MBT-02.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>*Formerly Applying Biological Complexity at Scale

Biological systems operate over an enormous range of spatial, physical, and temporal scales and span individual cells to multi-organism systems.  This project seeks to enhance the understanding of the basic processes associated with biological network interactions, communication, and control to enable novel approaches and technology development to enhance national security.   Applications range from infectious disease mitigation or prevention, to predicting and leveraging biological systems for managing communities of microorganisms.  Key advances expected from this research will include the identification of approaches to create stable, predictable, and dynamic control mechanisms of biological networks.  Such information will allow the determination of a biosystem's state and enable the prediction of state.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>Exploiting prior work in the areas of social media and social networks in programs such as Social Media in Strategic Communication (SMISC) in this project and Graph-theoretical Research in Algorithm Performance &amp; Hardware for Social networks (GRAPHS) in project CCS-02, the Modeling and Forecasting of Social Dynamics (MFSD) program will develop and demonstrate modeling capabilities that anticipate changes in social systems.  The U.S. military works with local populations in an effort to strengthen relationships and gain new allies for purposes of security cooperation, with successful engagement fundamental to meeting these objectives.  Current approaches to engagement planning are more art than science and rigorous approaches for understanding the social dynamics of local populations are lacking.  MFSD will address this need by developing and demonstrating analogical societal models that, while reduced in scope, preserve the key properties of full social systems while remaining amenable to simulation.  MFSD will rigorously test and validate the resulting models and establish the limits to the predictive capability they provide.  Social media and other computer-mediated communications provide an important opportunity both as drivers of social dynamics and as indicators of social attitudes.  The techniques that MFSD creates will enable the U.S. military to engage more effectively with local populations.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Title>Vanishing Programmable Resources (VAPR)</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>The Vanishing Programmable Resources (VAPR) program will create microelectronic systems capable of physically disappearing (either in whole or in part) in a controlled, triggerable manner.  The program will develop and establish an initial set of materials and components along with integration and manufacturing capabilities to undergird a fundamentally new class of electronics defined by their performance and transience.  These transient electronics ideally should perform in a manner comparable to Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) systems, but with limited device persistence that can be programmed, adjusted in real-time, triggered, and/or sensitive to the deployment environment.  Applications include sensors for conventional indoor/outdoor environments (buildings, transportation, and materiel), environmental monitoring over large areas, and simplified diagnosis, treatment, and health monitoring in the field.  VAPR will explore transience characteristics of electronic devices and materials as well as build out an initial capability to make transient electronics a deployable technology for the DoD and Nation.  The technological capability developed through VAPR will be demonstrated through a final test vehicle of a transient sensor with RF link.

A basis set of transient materials and electronic components with sufficient electronic and transience performance is needed to realize transient electronic systems for environmental sensing and biomedical applications.  Research and development of novel materials for implementing basic transient electronic components (actives and passives), power supply strategies, substrates and encapsulants as well as development of modes and triggers for transience will form the core of fundamental research activities.  Transient components and devices developed in this technical area will form the basis for advanced functional circuit blocks and test systems to be developed in PE 0602716E, Project ELT-01.</r2:Description>

Programs in this project address the Department's identified medical gaps in warfighter care related to health monitoring and preventing the spread of infectious disease.  Efforts will draw upon the information, computational modeling, and physical sciences to discover properties of biological systems that cross multiple scales of biological architecture and function, from the molecular and genetic level through cellular, tissue, organ, and whole organism levels.  To enable in-theater, continuous analysis and treatment of warfighters, this project will explore multiple diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, including the use of bacterial predators as therapeutics against infections caused by antibiotic-resistant pathogens; developing techniques to enable rapid transient immunity for emerging pathogens; and identifying fundamental biological mechanisms that enable certain species to be tolerant to various environmental insults.  Advances in this area may be used as a preventative measure to mitigate widespread disease.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The Autonomous Diagnostics to Enable Prevention and Therapeutics (ADEPT) program will develop the underlying technologies to rapidly respond to a disease or threat and improve individual readiness and total force health protection by providing capabilities which are currently available only in centralized laboratories in the U.S. to non-tertiary care and individual settings.  ADEPT will develop and exploit biological tools for the in vivo creation of nucleic acid circuits that continuously and autonomously sense and respond to changes in physiologic state and for novel methods to target delivery, enhance immunogenicity, or control activity of vaccines, potentially eliminating the time to manufacture a vaccine ex vivo.  ADEPT advancements to control cellular machinery include research to optimize orthogonality and modularity of genetic control elements; identify methods to increase sensitivity and specificity; and demonstrate methods to control cellular machinery in response to changes in physiological status.  ADEPT will develop methodologies for measuring health-specific biomarkers from a collected biospecimen to enable diagnostics at the point-of-need or resource limited clinical facilities (point-of-care), in-garrison or deployed.  Additionally, ADEPT will develop techniques that will enable the rapid establishment of transient immunity through stimulation of the production of components of the immune system to impart effective but temporary protection.  This transient immunity would bridge the time gap between the delivery of a vaccine and the development of a long term protective immune response.  Applied research efforts are budgeted in PE 0602115E, Project BT-01.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Harnessing Biological Systems program will explore fundamental approaches to applying the advantages of nature's building blocks and principles in the design of biological technologies and systems.  Rather than creating biomimetic designs that imitate naturally evolved capabilities this program seeks to transition to a biocentric design approach, developing tools and understanding mechanisms to leverage evolutionary advances from the start.  Key advances expected from this research include identifying approaches to discover and develop new classes of dynamic therapeutics for antibiotic-resistant bacteria.  One example will be to identify the underlying mechanisms by which predatory bacteria prey upon and consume other antibiotic-resistant bacteria that are pathogenic to humans.  This approach represents a significant departure from conventional antibacterial therapies that rely on small molecule antibiotics.  Advances in this area may be applied to a range of biological technologies including the autonomous control of epidemics.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Analysis and Adaptation of Human Resilience program will explore new methods to maintain and optimize warfighter health in response to environmental insults such as new and emerging infectious diseases.  Projects in this area will apply recent advances in comparative biology, genetic sequencing, omics technologies, and bioinformatics to develop new tools for modulating health to ensure warfighter readiness.  One approach to achieve this goal is identifying the fundamental mechanisms that enable certain species to be tolerant to various environmental insults.  Genomic and physiological analyses of a wide array of resilient animal species may be combined with sophisticated algorithms to identify important patterns of survival.  By analyzing patterns in the underlying variability of host responses for resilient animals, one may formulate a survival blueprint to restore and maintain warfighter homeostasis in response to infection.  This approach is orthogonal to traditional infectious disease research, which primarily relies on reducing the pathogen load through drug intervention.  Projects within this program may enable discovery of novel methods to optimize human health against infectious diseases caused by multi-drug resistant pathogens.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Outpacing Infectious Disease thrust will investigate fundamental methods for using biology as a technology to create adaptive therapeutic response mechanisms to outpace viruses and bacteria.  Today, protective measures such as antibiotics and vaccines are often circumvented by fast-mutating viruses and bacteria that evolve to create new methods for pathogenicity.  New approaches, such as enabling co-evolution and co-transmission of newly developed therapeutics to ultimately outcompete the pathogen, are needed to utilize the power of evolution in vaccine and antibiotic design.  Key advances expected from this research include identifying methods to discover and develop new classes of dynamic therapeutics for fast-mutating viruses and antibiotic-resistant bacteria, as well as recurrent chronic diseases.  This approach represents a significant departure from conventional antibacterial and antiviral therapies, which typically rely on static solutions and continuous re-formulation and re-development in attempt to keep pace with emerging strains and disease variants.  Advances in this area may be applied to the mitigation of known, new, or emerging disease.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Program Element focuses on applied research for medical related technology, information, processes, materials, systems, and devices.  Successful battlefield medical technologies and neural interface technologies developed within this Program Element address a broad range of DoD challenges.  Example battlefield medical technologies include continued understanding of infection biomarkers to lead to the development of detection devices that can be self-administered and provide a faster ability to diagnose and prevent widespread infection in-theater.  Complementary battlefield technologies will be implemented in a predictive platform for forecasting disease outbreak and the capability to manufacture field-relevant pharmaceuticals in theater.  New neural interface technologies will reliably extract information from the nervous system to enable control of the best robotic prosthetic-limb technology.  Advanced evidence-based techniques will be developed to supplement warfighter healthcare and the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI).  FY 2015 Biomedical Technology program funding includes 117.0 million of base funding and 47.5 million congressionally added funding including $45.0 million of Ebola emergency funding.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Text>This program focused on the development of Ebola antibodies, vaccines, and diagnostics to enable a more rapid response to this outbreak and increase preparedness for response to future epidemics.  This research utilized earlier investments by DARPA that explored technologies to discover, optimize, and deliver antibodies as a means to provide fast-acting protection against infectious diseases.  A key component of this program was not only identifying effective antibodies to treat and prevent disease, but also defining and developing the antibody gene blueprint for transfer and production of vaccines.  The Ebola Response and Preparedness Congressional Add is non-OCO emergency funding.

                                <r2:Description>The overarching goal of the Autonomous Diagnostics to Enable Prevention and Therapeutics (ADEPT) program is to increase our ability to rapidly respond to a disease or threat and improve individual readiness and total force health protection by providing centralized laboratory capabilities at non-tertiary care settings.  ADEPT will focus on the development of Ribonucleic Acid (RNA)-based vaccines, potentially eliminating the time and labor required for traditional manufacture of a vaccine while at the same time improving efficacy.  Additionally, ADEPT will develop methods to transiently deliver nucleic acids for vaccines and therapeutics, and kinetically control the timing and levels of gene expression so that these drugs will be safe and effective for use in healthy subjects.  ADEPT will also focus on advanced development of key elements for simple-to-operate diagnostic devices.  A companion basic research effort is budgeted in PE 0601117E, Project MED-01.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Restoration of Brain Function Following Trauma program will exploit recent advances in the understanding and modeling of brain activity and organization to develop approaches to treat traumatic brain injury (TBI).  Critical to success will be the ability to detect and quantify functional and/or structural changes that occur in the human brain during the formation of distinct new memories, and to correlate those changes with subsequent recall of those memories during performance of behavioral tasks.  This program will also develop neural interface hardware for monitoring and modulating neural activity responsible for successful memory formation in a human clinical population.  The ultimate goal is identification of efficacious therapeutics approaches that can bypass and/or recover the neural functions underlying memory, which are often disrupted as a consequence of TBI.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Neuro-Adaptive Technology program will explore and develop advanced technologies for real-time detection and monitoring of neural activity.  One shortcoming of today's brain functional mapping technologies is the inability to obtain real-time correlation data that links neural function to human activity and behavior.  Understanding the structure-function relationship as well as the underlying mechanisms that link brain and behavior is a critical step in providing real-time, closed-loop therapies for military personnel suffering from a variety of brain disorders.  Efforts under this program will specifically examine the networks of neurons involved in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), traumatic brain injury (TBI), depression, and anxiety as well as determine how to best ameliorate these disorders.  The objective for this program is to develop new hardware and modeling tools to better discriminate the relationship between human behavioral expression and neural function and to provide relief through novel devices.  These tools will allow for an improved understanding of how the brain regulates behavior and will enable new, disorder-specific, dynamic neuro-therapies for treating neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders in military personnel.  Technologies of interest under this thrust include devices for real-time detection of brain activity during operational tasks, time synchronized acquisition of brain activity and behavior, and statistical models that correlate neural activity with human behavioral expression.</r2:Description>

Through investments in the DARPA Reliable Neural-Interface Technology (RE-NET) program, novel interface systems have been developed that overcome these issues and are designed to last for the lifetime of the patient.  The goal of the Prosthetic Hand Proprioception &amp; Touch Interfaces (HAPTIX) program is to create the first bi-directional (motor &amp; sensory) peripheral nerve implant for controlling and sensing advanced prosthetic limb systems.  With a strong focus on transition, the HAPTIX program will create and transition clinically relevant technology in support of wounded warriors suffering from single or multiple limb loss.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Tactical Biomedical Technologies thrust will develop new approaches to deliver life-saving medical care on the battlefield.  Uncontrolled blood loss is the leading cause of preventable death for soldiers on the battlefield.  While immediate control of hemorrhage is the most effective strategy for treating combat casualties and saving lives, currently no method, other than surgical intervention, can effectively treat intracavity bleeding.  A focus in this thrust was the co-development of a materials-based agent(s) and delivery mechanism capable of hemostasis and wound control for non-compressible hemorrhage in the abdominal space, regardless of wound geometry or location within that space.  This thrust also investigated non-invasive techniques and equipment to use laser energy to treat intracranial hemorrhage through the skull and tissues in a pre-surgical environment.  Finally, in order to address logistical delays associated with delivering necessary therapeutics to the battlefield, this thrust will also develop a pharmacy on demand that will provide a rapid response capability to enable far-forward medical providers the ability to manufacture and produce small molecule drugs and biologics.</r2:Description>

Device technology has advanced to the point where human beings can be instrumented with and connected to a broad range of unobtrusive, always-on physiological, cognitive, and contextual sensors and information systems.  At the same time, body-area networks, wearable displays, haptics, and other novel forms of human-computer interfaces have advanced enough that convenient real-time multifactor analysis for neurofeedback and biofeedback are within reach.  The Performance Optimization in Complex Environments program will first focus on developing prototyping and manufacturing techniques necessary to integrate these two advancing areas to enable optimal performance in a wide variety of activities from learning and training to specialized tasking, and to mitigate the effects of physical injury, age, and mental impairment.  Research will also focus on understanding various forms of sensing and actuation to improve outcomes and how biofeedback over time can alter human capability.  Technologies developed through this program will provide a foundation of novel value propositions to the warfighter in terms of restoration of lost capability, situational awareness, resilience, cognitive and physical effectiveness, and force multiplication.</r2:Description>

While new technology platforms have enhanced our ability to respond to illness and disease, there is a need for predictive and pre-emptive technologies that enable us to correctly prepare a response prior to its obvious need.  Research in this thrust will investigate new methods for the collection and detection of multiplexed biological markers as well as the analysis, correlation, and ultimate integration of vast personalized data into the clinical care information technology infrastructure.  Additionally, this thrust will develop new approaches to integrate multi-source data streams to create effective predictive models of disease outbreak and spread.  Technologies developed in this program will enable clinically actionable information, even when an individual has no awareness of symptoms, and extend infectious disease forecasting into a real-time, accurate capability for decision support.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>Sepsis, a bacterial infection of the blood stream, is a significant cause of injury and death among combat-injured soldiers.  The goal of this program is to develop a portable device capable of controlling relevant components in the blood volume on clinically relevant time scales.  Reaching this goal is expected to require significant advances in sensing in complex biologic fluids, complex fluid manipulation, separation of components from these fluids, and mathematical descriptions capable of providing predictive control over the closed loop process.  The envisioned device would save the lives of thousands of military patients each year by effectively treating sepsis and associated complications.  Additionally, the device may be effective as a medical countermeasure against various chemical and biological (chem-bio) threat agents, such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, and toxins.

Applied research under this program further develops and applies existing component technologies and then integrates these to create a complete blood purification system for use in the treatment of sepsis.  Included in this effort will be development, integration and demonstration of non-fouling, continuous sensors for complex biological fluids; implementation of high-flow microfluidic structures that do not require the use of anticoagulation; application of intrinsic separation technologies that do not require pathogen specific molecular labels or binding chemistries; and refinement of predictive modeling and control (mathematical formalism) with sufficient fidelity to enable agile adaptive closed-loop therapy.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>Musculoskeletal injury and fatigue to the warfighter caused by dynamic events on the battlefield not only impact immediate mission readiness, but also can have a deleterious effect on the warfighter throughout his/her life.  The Warrior Web program will mitigate that impact by developing an adaptive, quasi-active, joint support sub-system that can be integrated into current soldier systems.  Because this sub-system will be compliant and transparent to the user, it will reduce the injuries sustained by warfighters while allowing them to maintain performance.  Success in this program will require the integration of component technologies in areas such as regenerative kinetic energy harvesting to offset power/energy demands; human performance, system, and component modeling; novel materials and dynamic stiffness; actuation; controls and human interface; and power distribution/energy storage.  The final system is planned to weigh no more than 9kg and require no more than 100W of external power.  Allowing the warfighter to perform missions with reduced risk of injuries will have immediate effects on mission readiness, soldier survivability, mission performance, and the long-term health of our veterans.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Information and Communications Technology program element is budgeted in the applied research budget activity because it is directed toward the application of advanced, innovative computing systems and communications technologies.  

     The High Productivity, High-Performance Responsive Architectures project is developing the necessary computing hardware and the associated software technology base required to support future critical national security needs for computationally-intensive and data-intensive applications.  These technologies will lead to new multi-generation product lines of commercially viable, sustainable computing systems for a broad spectrum of scientific and engineering applications; it will include supercomputer and embedded computing systems.

     The Information Assurance and Survivability project is developing the core computing and networking technologies required to protect DoD's information, information infrastructure, and mission-critical information systems.  The technologies will provide cost-effective security and survivability solutions that enable DoD information systems to operate correctly and continuously even under attack.  

     The Language Understanding and Symbiotic Automation project develops technologies to enable computing systems to understand human speech and extract information contained in diverse media; to learn, reason and apply knowledge gained through experience; and to respond intelligently to new and unforeseen events. Enabling computing systems in this manner is of critical importance because sensor, information, and communication systems generate data at rates beyond which humans can assimilate, understand, and act. Incorporating these technologies in military systems will enable warfighters to make better decisions in complex, time-critical, battlefield environments; intelligence analysts to make sense of massive, incomplete, and contradictory information; and unmanned systems to operate safely with high degrees of autonomy.

     The Cyber Technology project develops technology to increase the security of military information systems and the effectiveness of cyber operations.  Over the past decade the DoD has embraced net-centric warfare by integrating people, platforms, weapons, sensors, and decision aids.  Adversaries seek to limit this force multiplier through cyber attacks intended to degrade, disrupt, or deny military computing, communications, and networking systems.  Technologies developed under the Cyber Technology project will ensure DoD net-centric capabilities survive adversary cyber attacks and will enable new cyber-warfighting capabilities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The goal will be to create not just larger computing platforms, but to extract information out of large and chaotic data sets efficiently.  One of the major challenges currently facing the DoD is the prohibitively high cost, time, and expertise required to build complex computing systems including software and hardware.  Powerful new approaches and tools are needed to enable the rapid and efficient production of new software, including software that can be easily changed to address new requirements and can adjust dynamically to platform and environmental perturbations.  The project will ensure accessibility and usability to a wide range of application developers, not just computational science experts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The battlefield of the future will have more data generators and sensors to provide information required for successful combat operations.  With networked sensors, the variety and complexity of the information streams will be even further extended.  The Complexity Management Hardware program will develop silicon designs which help alleviate the complexity inherent in next generation systems.  These systems will have increasingly large data sets generated by their own multidomain sensors (such as RF and Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR) payloads) as well as potentially new inputs from external sensors.  With current programming approaches, there are laborious coding requirements needed to accommodate new data streams.  Additionally, the context provided by these data sets is ever changing, and it is imperative for the integrated electronics to adapt to new information without a prolonged programming cycle.  Providing contextual cues for processing data streams will alleviate the fusion challenges that are currently faced, and which stress networked battlefield systems.  As opposed to the intuition and future-proofing that is required at the programming stage of a current system, the silicon circuit of the future will be able to use contextual cues to adapt accordingly to new information as it is provided.

The applied research aspects of this program will investigate circuit design which can exploit the algorithms showing benefit for complexity management.  This will entail various sparse versus dense data manipulations with hardware implementations catered to both types of data.  The program will show hardware implementations that gracefully handle multiple data streams and limit the programming burden for a complex scenario.  Basic research efforts are funded in PE 0601101E, Project CCS-02.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Power Efficiency Revolution For Embedded Computing Technologies (PERFECT) program will provide the technologies and techniques to overcome the power efficiency barriers which currently constrain embedded computing systems capabilities and limit the potential of future embedded systems.  The warfighting problem this program will solve is the inability to process future real time data streams within real-world embedded system power constraints.  This is a challenge for embedded applications, from Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) systems on unmanned air vehicles through combat and control systems on submarines.  The PERFECT program will overcome processing power efficiency limitations by developing approaches including near threshold voltage operation, massive and heterogeneous processing concurrency, new architecture concepts, and hardware and software approaches to address system resiliency, combined with software approaches to effectively utilize resulting system concurrency and optimized data placement to provide the required embedded system processing power efficiency.  The remaining efforts under the PERFECT program will emphasize the implementation of near threshold and specialization approaches to address processing efficiency.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>*Formerly Scalable Optical Nodes for Networked Edge Traversal (SONNET)

Graph analytics on large data sets is currently performed on leadership-class supercomputers that are designed for other purposes.  These machines are required because they have the memory capacity required for large graph problems, but the ability to efficiently move data to and effectively utilize compute resources is limited, resulting in extremely low compute efficiency.  Computationally, graph analysis is characterized by many short, random accesses to memory which is inefficient on current systems that are optimized for regular, predictable access.  The movement of data between memory and processors now requires more time and energy than the logical operations themselves.  This is the result of generations of systems that architecturally separate computing/data manipulation and main data storage.  Large systems have shown utilization (percentage of system peak throughput capability used) drop from as high as 90% to in the order of 2% due to the data patterns for different applications.  To resolve this problem, the PALS program will develop technologies, architectures, and software approaches that move critical data processing kernels and critical data organization operations adjacent to the memory itself, rather than at physically distant general computing nodes, addressing data latency, overall computational performance and power for critical data intensive elements of an application.  

The PALS approach is not to physically or functionally move processing entirely to the memory, but rather to move specific, critical data intensive components of an application to the data.  The result will dramatically improve performance for data intensive applications, by off-loading the main processor of data-intensive operations, and enabling data security operations at the memory itself.  This will be accomplished by utilizing industry advances in 3D packaging, particularly the bandwidth, latency and power advances being developed in 3D memory stacks; new software approaches for data management; investigating alternative data movement technologies such as co-designing processor and photonic hardware, exploiting the high bandwidth provided by silicon photonics.  It will also include incorporation of domain specific logic for unique and asymmetric data-intensive DoD functional capabilities at all appropriate levels of a processing system's memory.  The performance and efficiency will be transformational for data analytics for both big data and embedded data-intensive DoD applications and enable real-time analysis on dynamic graphs in the fields of cyber security, threat detection, and numerous others.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>Approximately 66% of all installed semiconductor wafer capacity is in Asia.  This creates a significant risk for the DoD as off-shore manufacturing of microelectronic components could introduce various vulnerabilities to DoD systems that utilize these non-U.S. fabricated electronic components.  As the DoD is faced with this globalization reality, it is essential to prevent potential consequences such as reverse engineering, and the theft of U.S. intellectual property.

New applied research technology enablement will be developed in the Electronics Globalization program to provide a means of assessing the impact of high stress upon Government Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) and Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) components produced in conventional contemporary foundries.  The potential application of these components in extreme stresses DoD systems and makes it even more important to understand the new physics mechanisms to be expected in these regimes.  The extendibility of existing reliability models, and the calibration of new reliability models for components operated outside of typical use conditions will be studied.  Further, the insight gained from understanding these impacts will inform the use of elevated stress burn-in and screening tools, potentially allowing shorter and more effective test times in the fabrication plant.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>Enriching a primary data stream with contextual information (i.e., the circumstances or facts such as who, what, and where that surround a particular event) can be accomplished by fusing data from multiple sensors.  For this task, modern systems rely heavily on man-made reference signals, such as Global Positioning Systems (GPS), and preprogrammed algorithms with limited adaptability.  Object recognition using Deep Learning and related approaches has been demonstrated, but these methods require significant offline training.  The tactical CONtext EXtraction (CONEX) program will develop compact sensors and adaptive processors for extracting contextual information from resource-constrained environments.  CONEX sensors will collect information from the landscape and natural sources, such as the relative position of stars, to supplement inertial measurement systems and other sensor feeds in GPS-denied areas.  CONEX processors will contain embedded real-time learning algorithms that operate over multiple timescales.  These adaptive methods efficiently capture complex spatial and temporal structure in noisy, ambiguous data streams that are beyond the analysis capabilities of state-of-the-art signal/image processing systems.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>Small software companies are a dynamic force in the U.S. economy because they face very low barriers to innovation.  Anyone can code applications for established mobile or cloud platforms and leverage the tremendous infrastructure built by larger companies to quickly access potential customers.  However, commercial hardware innovations for advanced integrated circuits and Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) sensors face costly obstacles that impede progress outside of large corporations.  Smaller businesses generally do not have the budget or sales volume to access the latest design software, verification tools and fabrication processes.  The smaller DoD market for hardware amplifies these problems for delivering revolutionary military components.  The Removing Barriers to Hardware (REBHAR) program will develop methods to facilitate hardware innovation for defense applications.  The objective of the REBHAR program is to establish relationships with commercial companies to gain access to proven processes, to explore the possibilities of open source hardware, and to develop an aftermarket customization strategy to economically adapt commercial chips to specific military needs.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The objective of the Spectrum Grand Challenge is for participants to develop wireless communications networks which can learn to cohabitate and share the same Radio Frequency (RF) spectrum as other networks without preplanning or co-design of the technologies.  Access to spectrum is critical to many modern sectors: military, commercial, infrastructure, public-safety, disaster recovery, and many more.  Spectrum however is treated as a scarce resource typically assigned to exclusive-use licenses.  These approaches still rely on exclusive use of the spectrum by only a single network.  In order to meet growing spectrum demands networks must be able to dynamically adapt their use of the spectrum as needs and as spectrum conditions change, autonomously determining when, where, and how spectrum should be used.  Spectrum Grand Challenge solutions will survey their environment, learn to morph their configuration to suit both their needs and others, and employ interference coping and exploitation techniques to make more efficient use of the RF spectrum.

The Spectrum Grand Challenge will develop the world's first large-scale spectrum testbed to test participants in realistic emulated conditions.  The test conditions and qualification metrics developed will thoroughly vet solutions, and ultimately serve as the basis for certification of an envisioned new class of shared spectrum technology which does not rely on exclusive use of the spectrum.

                                <r2:Description>The Edge-Directed Cyber Technologies for Reliable Mission Communication (EdgeCT) program is developing technologies to enable reliable communications for military forces that operate in the presence of disrupted, degraded or denied wide-area networks.  The program is creating algorithms and software prototypes for use exclusively at the network edge, specifically, on end hosts and/or on proxy servers (middleboxes) fronting groups of such end hosts within a user enclave.  EdgeCT systems will sense and respond rapidly to network failures and attacks by dynamically adapting protocols utilized to exchange packets among these hosts, thereby implementing fight-through strategies that restore networked communication.  This will enable highly reliable networked communication for the military in the face of a wide variety of common network failure modes as well as cyber attacks against network infrastructure.  EdgeCT technologies will be developed in collaboration with and transitioned to operational commands.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Cyber Fault-tolerant Attack Recovery (CFAR) program is developing novel architectures to achieve cyber fault-tolerance with commodity computing technologies.  Current approaches to handling cyber-induced faults in mission-critical systems are inadequate, as perimeter defenses wrapped around vulnerable monocultures do not scale, while zero-day exploits evade signature-based defenses.  The proliferation of processing cores in multi-core central processing units provides the opportunity to adapt fault-tolerant architectures proven in aerospace applications to mission-critical, embedded, and real-time computing systems.  The CFAR program will combine techniques for detecting differences across functionally replicated systems with novel variants that guarantee differences in behavior under attack.  The resulting CFAR-enabled computing systems will quickly detect deviations in processing elements at attack onset and rapidly reboot to restore affected services.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Title>Supply Chain Hardware Integrity for Electronics Defense (SHIELD)</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>Counterfeit electronic components compromise business as well as defense systems, and pose a threat to the integrity and reliability of DoD systems.  Detection of counterfeit components by current means is expensive, time-consuming, and of limited effectiveness.  Maintaining complete control of the supply chain using administrative controls incurs substantial costs and has exhibited limited effectiveness.  Current methods of detection involve a wide variety of techniques ranging from functional testing to physical inspections which may still miss certain classes of counterfeits.  There have also been attempts by the semiconductor market to protect electronic components through the use of technology embedded in the component or its packaging.  However, most of these methods are specific to a manufacturer's component and as such address only those issues critical to that manufacturer.  Some methods can be circumvented, or require slow, expensive, off-site forensic analysis to verify authenticity.

The Supply Chain Hardware Integrity for Electronics Defense (SHIELD) program will develop a technology capable of confirming, at any time and place, the authenticity of trusted parts, even after they have transited a complex global supply chain.  SHIELD will prevent counterfeit component substitution by incorporating a small, inexpensive additional silicon chip ("dielet") within the Integrated Circuit (IC) package.  The dielet will provide a unique and encrypted ID as well as anti-tamper features.  The microscopic-size dielet embedded in the electronic component packaging will enable verification of a chip's identity from very close proximity.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>*Previously Adaptable Information Access and Control (AIAC)

 The Brandeis program is creating the capability to dynamically, flexibly, and securely share information while ensuring that private data may be used only for its intended purpose and no other.  In the civilian sphere, there is a recognized need for technologies that enable the sharing of information between commercial entities and U.S. government agencies.  Similarly, the U.S. military is increasingly involved in operations that require highly selective sharing of data with a heterogeneous mix of allies, coalition partners, and other stakeholders.  The Brandeis program will develop the technical means to protect the private and proprietary information of individuals and enterprises.  Brandeis will break the tension between (a) maintaining privacy and (b) being able to tap into the huge value of data.  Rather than having to balance between them, Brandeis aims to build a third option: enabling safe and predictable sharing of data in which privacy is preserved.  The Brandeis program is timely due to recent progress on techniques such as homomorphic encryption, secure multiparty computation, and differential privacy.  To facilitate deployment, Brandeis technologies will be designed to work with the virtualization, cloud computing, and software-defined networking technologies now widely used in both civilian and military environments.</r2:Description>

The Rapid Attack Detection, Isolation and Characterization Systems (RADICS) program will create new technologies for maintaining the availability and integrity of critical U.S. cyber-physical infrastructure.  This is a national security issue due to the near-ubiquitous use of computers to monitor and control U.S. civilian and military critical infrastructure such as electric power.  RADICS will develop technologies to monitor heterogeneous distributed control system networks, detect anomalies that require rapid assessment, isolate compromised system elements, characterize attacks in real time, mitigate sensor spoofing and denial of service attacks, and restore services.  Hardware-in-the-loop simulation techniques will be developed to enable the discovery of emergent vulnerabilities and the development and optimization of mitigation, restoration, and reconstitution strategies applicable to the power grid.  This will include understanding the potential role of electric power markets and smart grid technologies in propagating or damping power grid anomalies.  RADICS technologies will transition to military installations and commercial industry.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The High Assurance Cyber Military Systems (HACMS) program is developing and demonstrating technologies to secure mission-critical embedded computing systems.  The DoD is making increasing use of networked computing in systems such as military vehicles, weapon systems, ground sensors, smartphones, and other communication devices.  This dependence makes it critically important that the embedded operating system provides high levels of inherent assurance.  This operating system must also integrate the computational, physical, and networking elements of the system while running on a processor with very limited size, weight, and power.  Consequently, it can only devote a limited share of its computational resources to security while satisfying hard real-time constraints.  Recent advances in program synthesis, formal verification techniques, low-level and domain-specific programming languages, and operating systems mean that fully verified operating systems for embedded devices may be within reach at reasonable costs.  The program will develop, mature, and integrate these technologies to produce an embedded computing platform that provides a high level of assurance for mission-critical military applications.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Cyber Grand Challenge (CGC) program will create automated defenses that can identify and respond to cyber attacks more rapidly than human operators.  CGC technology will monitor defended software and networks during operations, reason about flawed software, formulate effective defenses, and deploy defenses automatically.  Technologies to be developed and integrated may include anomaly detection, Monte Carlo input generation, case-based reasoning, heuristics, game theory, and stochastic optimization.  The CGC capability is needed because highly-scripted, distributed cyber attacks exhibit speed, complexity, and scale that exceed the capability of human cyber defenders to respond in a timely manner.  DARPA will incentivize competition through a Grand Challenge in which CGC technologies compete head-to-head.  Initial funding for this effort was provided in Project IT-05.  Additional funding is being provided in IT-03 to enable the creation of the more robust competition infrastructure necessary to accommodate the large number of competitors.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>Building upon work in the Mission-oriented Resilient Clouds (MRC) program, the Extreme Distributed Denial of Service Defense (XD3) program will develop new computer networking architectures better able to deter, detect, and overcome distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks.  DDoS attacks include not only high-volume flooding attacks of hundreds of gigabits per second, but more subtle low-volume attacks that evade traditional intrusion detection systems while causing exhaustion of server processor and memory capacity.  These attacks will likely accelerate as the Internet of Things (IoT) expands to new classes of devices that in many cases will be deployed with inadequate security controls: attackers will incorporate poorly defended IoT devices in their botnets.  XD3 will develop defensive architectures that use maneuver, deception, dispersion, and on-host adaptation to increase adversary work factors, boost resilience of mission critical services such as command and control, and ultimately thwart DDoS attacks.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>System Security Integrated Through Hardware and software (SSITH) seeks to better protect DoD systems by exploring innovative approaches that combine hardware and software to provide enhanced system security. Traditional cybersecurity approaches have focused either on software or hardware, but rarely on an integration of both domains. By exploring integrated hardware/software solutions, SSITH will combine the efficiency and robustness of hardware with the flexibility and adaptability of software to provide security solutions that are resistant to attack and adaptive to new attack approaches. The program is based on the concept that co-design of hardware and software provides new modalities to protect electronic systems.

The SSITH program will pursue several hardware/software approaches to enhancing electronic system security. First, the program will investigate new co-designed hardware/software architectures that are inherently more secure than current electronic systems. Second, the program will investigate hardware/software architectures that are flexible and can adapt to new system attack methods and vectors. Third, the program will examine methods to reduce the power/performance overhead required to implement novel and powerful protection methods recently conceived in the security community.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Mission-oriented Resilient Clouds (MRC) program is creating technologies to enable cloud computing systems to survive and operate through cyber attacks.  Vulnerabilities found in current standalone and networked systems can be amplified in cloud computing environments.  MRC is addressing this risk by creating advanced network protocols and new approaches to computing in potentially compromised distributed environments.  Particular attention is focused on adapting defenses and allocating resources dynamically in response to attacks and compromises.  MRC will result in new approaches to measure trust, reach consensus in compromised environments, and allocate resources in response to current threats and computational requirements.  MRC will develop new verification and control techniques for networks embedded in clouds that must function reliably in complex adversarial environments.</r2:Description>

In the cyber environment, defenders have detailed knowledge of, and unlimited access to, the system resources that attackers wish to gain.  The ACD program will exploit emerging technologies to facilitate the conduct of defensive operations that involve immediate and direct engagement between DoD cyber operators and sophisticated cyber adversaries.  Through these active engagements, DoD cyber defenders will be able to more readily disrupt, counter, and neutralize adversary cyber tradecraft in real time.  Moreover, ACD-facilitated operations should cause adversaries to be more cautious and increase their work factor by limiting success from their efforts.</r2:Description>

The Active Authentication program addressed these issues by focusing on the unique aspects of the individual (i.e., the cognitive fingerprint) through the use of software-based biometrics that continuously validate the identity of the user.  Active Authentication integrated multiple biometric modalities to create an authentication system that is accurate, robust, and transparent to the user.</r2:Description>

Higher level organisms have two distinct immune systems: the innate system is fast and deadly but is only effective against a fixed set of pathogens; the adaptive system is slower but can learn to recognize novel pathogens.  Similarly, CRASH developed mechanisms at the hardware and operating system level that eliminate known vulnerabilities exploited by attackers.  However, because novel attacks will be developed, CRASH also developed software techniques that allow a computer system to defend itself, to maintain its capabilities, and even heal itself.  Finally, biological systems show that diversity is an effective population defense; CRASH developed techniques that make each computer system appear unique to the attacker and allow each system to change over time.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Low Resource Languages for Emergent Incidents (LORELEI) program is developing the technology to rapidly field machine translation capabilities for low-resource foreign languages.  The United States military operates globally and frequently encounters low-resource languages, i.e., languages for which few linguists are available and no automated human language technology capability exists.  Historically, exploiting foreign language materials required protracted effort, and current systems rely on huge, manually-translated, manually-transcribed, or manually-annotated data sets.  As a result, systems currently exist only for languages in widespread use and in high demand.  LORELEI will take a different approach by leveraging language-universal resources, projecting from related-language resources, and fully exploiting a broad range of language-specific resources.  These capabilities will be exercised to rapidly provide situational awareness based on information from any language in support of emergent missions such as humanitarian assistance/disaster relief, terrorist attack response, peacekeeping, and infectious disease response.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Deep Exploration and Filtering of Text (DEFT) program is developing language technology to enable automated extraction, processing, and inference of information from text in operationally relevant application domains.  A key DEFT emphasis is to determine explicit and implicit meaning in text through probabilistic inference, anomaly detection, and other techniques.  To accomplish this, DEFT will develop and apply formal representations for basic facts, spatial, temporal, and associative relationships, causal and process knowledge, textually entailed information, and derived relationships and correlated actions/events.  DEFT inputs may be in English or in a foreign language and sources may be reports, messages, or other documents.  DEFT will extract knowledge at scale for open source intelligence and threat analysis.  Planned transition partners include the intelligence community and operational commands.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Understanding Machine Intelligence (UMI) program will develop techniques that enable artificial intelligence (AI) systems to better support users through transparent operation.  If current trends continue, future U.S. military autonomous systems will need to perform increasingly complex and sensitive missions.  AI will be critical to such autonomous systems, but in order for developers, users, and senior leaders to feel confident enough to deploy and use AI-enabled systems, they must operate with high degrees of transparency, reliability, predictability, and safety.  UMI will develop AI technologies that support transparency by providing supporting rationale and logic sequences that establish the basis for and reliability of outputs.  In addition, efforts will be made to develop a mathematically rigorous virtual stability theory for AI-enabled systems analogous to the (conventional) stability theory developed for dynamical systems (solutions to systems of differential equations).  Such a virtual stability theory will enable the creation of feedback mechanisms that flag, interrupt, and modify anomalous outputs and behaviors to ensure safe, predictable operation.  UMI implementations will be developed and demonstrated in next-generation decision-support and autonomous systems.  This program was previously funded in PE 0602702E, Project TT-13.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Cyber Grand Challenge (CGC) is creating automated defenses that can identify and respond to cyber attacks more rapidly than human operators.  CGC technology will monitor defended software and networks during operations, reason about flawed software, formulate effective defenses, and deploy defenses automatically.  Technologies to be developed and integrated may include anomaly detection, Monte Carlo input generation, case-based reasoning, heuristics, game theory, and stochastic optimization.  The CGC capability is needed because highly-scripted, distributed cyber attacks exhibit speed, complexity, and scale that exceed the capability of human cyber defenders to respond in a timely manner.  DARPA will incentivize competition through a Grand Challenge in which CGC technologies compete head-to-head.  The CGC program is also funded in Project IT-03.</r2:Description>

Efforts to counter existing and emerging biological; chemical and radiological threats include countermeasures to stop the pathophysiologic processes that occur as a consequence of an attack; host immune response enhancers; medical diagnostics for the most virulent pathogens and their molecular mechanisms; collection of environmental trace constituents to support chemical mapping, tactical and strategic biological, chemical, and radiological sensors; and integrated defense systems.  This program also includes development of a unique set of platform technologies and medical countermeasures synthesis that will dramatically decrease the timeline from military threat detection to countermeasure availability.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>To further develop an expedited medical countermeasure capability, emerging technologies will be integrated to address the safety and efficacy considerations in the risk/benefit package necessary to successfully counter naturally emerging or engineered biological warfare threats and new emerging chemical and radiological threats.  These technologies will also be focused on reduction of time, risk, and costs associated with new therapeutic development.  For example, this program will develop in vitro tissue constructs (IVTC) that will emulate human response to therapeutic compounds, thereby significantly reducing the cost and time for evaluating safety and efficacy of therapeutics.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element is budgeted in the Applied Research Budget Activity because it supports the advancement of concepts and technologies to enhance the next generation of tactical systems.  The Tactical Technology program element funds a number of projects in the areas of Naval Warfare, Advanced Land Systems, Advanced Tactical Technology, Aeronautics Technology and Network Centric Enabling Technology.

The Naval Warfare Technology project develops advanced technologies for application to a broad range of naval requirements.  Enabling and novel technologies include concepts for expanding the envelope of operational naval capabilities such as improved situational awareness over large maritime environments, ship self-defense techniques, novel underwater propulsion modalities, high speed underwater vessels, improved techniques for underwater object detection and discrimination, long endurance unmanned surface vehicles, and high bandwidth communications.

The Advanced Land Systems Technology project is developing technologies for enhancing U.S. military effectiveness and survivability in operations ranging from traditional threats to military operations against irregular forces that can employ disruptive or catastrophic capabilities, or disrupt stabilization operations.  The emphasis is on developing affordable technologies that will enhance the military's effectiveness while decreasing the exposure of U.S. or allied forces to enemy fire.  This project will also explore novel design technologies for the manufacture of ground vehicles and new tools for systems assessments of emerging DARPA technologies.

The Advanced Tactical Technology project focuses on broad technology areas including compact, efficient, frequency-agile, diode-pumped, solid-state lasers for infrared countermeasures, laser radar, holographic laser sensors, communications, and high-power laser applications.

Aeronautics Technology efforts will address high payoff opportunities that dramatically reduce costs associated with advanced aeronautical systems and/or provide revolutionary new system capabilities for satisfying current and projected military mission requirements.  This includes advanced technology studies of revolutionary propulsion and vehicle concepts, sophisticated fabrication methods, and examination of novel materials for aeronautic system applications.

The Network Centric Enabling Technology project develops network-centric mission applications that integrate information arising from: 1) intelligence networks; 2) open and other external sources; 3) sensors and signal/image processors; and 4) collection platforms and weapon systems.  Technical challenges include the need to process huge volumes of diverse, incomplete, and uncertain data streams in tactically-relevant timeframes.  The data processing efforts include: conditioning of unstructured data, content analysis, behavioral modeling, pattern-of-life characterization, economic activity analysis, social network analysis, anomaly detection, and visualization.  Operational benefits include deeper understanding of the evolving operational environment tailored to the needs of commanders at every echelon.  Promising technologies are evaluated in the laboratory and demonstrated in the field to facilitate transition.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Title>Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) Continuous Trail Unmanned Vessel (ACTUV)</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>The Anti-Submarine Warfare  (ASW) Continuous Trail Unmanned Vessel (ACTUV) program has three primary goals: (1) to build and demonstrate an experimental unmanned vessel with beyond state-of-the-art platform performance based on clean sheet design for unmanned operation; (2) demonstrate the technical viability of operating autonomous unmanned craft at theater or global ranges, from forward operating bases, under a sparse remote supervisory control model; and (3) leverage unique ACTUV characteristics to transition a game changing ASW capability to the Navy.  By establishing the premise that a human is never intended to step on board at any point in the operational cycle, ACTUV concepts can take advantage of an unexplored design space that eliminates or modifies conventional manned ship design constraints in order to achieve disproportionate speed, endurance, and payload fraction.  The resulting unmanned naval vessels must possess sufficient situational awareness and autonomous behavior capability to operate in full compliance with the rules of the road and maritime law to support safe navigation for operational deployments spanning thousands of miles and months of time.  When coupled with innovative sensor technologies, the ACTUV system provides a low cost unmanned system with a fundamentally different operational risk calculus that enables game changing capability to detect and track even the quietest diesel electric submarine threats.  Key technical areas include unmanned naval vessel design methodologies, ship system reliability, high fidelity sensor fusion to provide an accurate world model for autonomous operation, novel application of sensors for ASW tracking, and holistic system integration due to unique optimization opportunities of the ACTUV system.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Upward Falling Payloads (UFP) program will develop forward-deployed unmanned distributed systems that can provide non-lethal effects or situational awareness over large maritime environments.  Building upon and complimenting concepts for maritime situational awareness and ISR developed under the DASH program, budgeted in PE 0603766E, Project NET-02, the UFP approach centers on pre-deploying deep-ocean nodes years in advance in forward operating areas which can be commanded from standoff to launch to the surface.

Advances in miniaturized sensors and processors, growth in the variety of unmanned systems, and advances in autonomy and networking all point toward highly capable, yet affordable, distributed systems.  However, power and logistics to deliver these systems in a timely manner in forward operating areas limit their utility.  The UFP program will remove this barrier to accelerate large-scale unmanned distributed missions.  The presumption is that a wider range of technology options and system solutions will emerge when the barriers to deployment are removed.</r2:Description>

Initially, the activity will focus on identifying high payoff logistics and deployment technologies, and understanding the deployment and sustainment architectures required to support these technologies.  The program will examine increased automation in logistics and distribution operations, new platform technologies for sea-based transportation and prepositioning, and technologies which could enable aerial delivery of forces to the vicinity of an objective area.  The Strategic Mobility program will then shift to a focused technology risk reduction activity designed to systematically address the principal risks for the highest payoff technology set.  The technologies developed by the program could enable a rapid strategic response capability, with rapid deployment and sustainment of substantial ground combat forces, even to very remote or austere locations.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Multi-Azimuth Defense Fast Intercept Round Engagement (MAD-FIRES) program seeks to develop a point defense system against today's most stressing threats by developing a highly maneuverable, medium caliber, guided projectile, fire sequencing and control system capable of neutralizing large threat raids of high speed, highly maneuverable targets.  Leveraging recent advancements in gun hardening, miniaturization of guided munition components, and long range sensors, MAD-FIRES will advance fire control technologies, medium caliber gun technologies, and guided projectile technologies enabling the multiple, simultaneous target kinetic engagement mission at greatly reduced costs.  MAD-FIRES seeks to achieve lethality overmatch through accuracy rather than size, thus expanding the role of smaller combat platforms into missions where they have been traditionally outgunned.  MAD-FIRES, sized as a medium caliber system, enhances flexibility for installment as a new system and as an upgrade to existing gun systems with applications to various domain platforms across a multitude of missions to include: ship self-defense, precision air to ground combat, precision ground to ground combat, counter unmanned air vehicles (C-UAV), and counter rocket and artillery and mortar (C-RAM).</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The goal of the Ground Experimental Vehicle (GXV) program is to investigate ground vehicle technologies that enable crew/vehicle survivability through means other than traditional heavy passive armor solutions.  This will be accomplished through research and development of novel ground combat and tactical vehicle technology solutions that demonstrate significantly advanced platform mobility, agility, and survivability.  The focus of the GXV program will be on technology development across multiple areas to simultaneously improve military ground vehicle survivability and mobility.  Traditionally, survivability and mobility have to be traded against each other due to the reliance on heavy armor.  The GXV program seeks to break this trend.  Coupled with the development of technologies, the GXV program will define concept vehicles which showcase these developmental technologies.  A modeling and simulation effort will also be undertaken to understand the vehicle design trade space for the concept vehicles using the developmental technologies and to illustrate how these vehicles might be used operationally in combat scenarios.  Technology development areas are likely to include increasing vehicle tactical mobility, survivability through agility, and crew augmentation, though other relevant technologies may also be pursued.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The U.S. military achieves overmatch against its adversaries in certain regimes; however, this level of overmatch is not enjoyed at the squad to individual dismounted warfighter level.  The goal of the Squad X program is to leverage advances in real-time situational awareness and mission command; organic three-dimensional dismount mobility; extended range tracking, targeting, and response; and unmanned mobility and perception in order to create a squad with substantial combat overmatch.  The concept of overmatch at the squad level includes increased human stand-off, a smaller force density, and adaptive sensing to allow for responses at multiple scales.  Squad X will explore advanced wearable force protection, advanced organic squad level direct and indirect trajectory precision weaponry, and non-kinetic precision capabilities.  The end result of the Squad X program is an individual dismount unit outfitted with sensors, weaponry, and supporting technology to achieve unit level overmatch as well as the overall integration of unmanned assets alongside the dismounts to create a new Hybrid Squad unit.</r2:Description>

The program will create low-cost, high-utility robotic component solutions that result in prototype systems and proofs of concept in months.  The Robotics Fast Track program will engage numerous robotics related efforts across the spectrum of robotics professionals and enthusiasts, extending the existing performer base.  The program will demonstrate the ability for robotics projects to be performed at an asymmetric advantage in time, cost, and contribution of the efforts.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Robotics Challenge program sought to boost innovation in autonomous systems and expand platform utility through enhanced actuation, energy density, perception, locomotion, agile reconfiguration, and design efficiency.  Program thrusts were centered on a progressive regimen of physical problem solving, real-time team oriented tasks, and dynamic adaptation designed to build "machine trust", especially when integrated with humans in a variety of operational environments.  The Robotics Challenge program consisted of a series of obstacle course style challenge events that focused on technology solutions to demonstrate and test robot capabilities for disaster response.  The program drove advances in power systems, agility and speed, precision in perception tied to platform coordination, dexterity, and impulsive power.  Program objectives focused on technologies to expand mobility and extend endurance of unmanned platforms, advanced tactile and manipulation capabilities, and tools for cost effective design, validation, and construction of autonomous technology, and human-robot interaction.  The 6.3 portion of this program was budgeted in PE 0603766E, Project NET-01.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Laser Ultraviolet Sources for Tactical Efficient Raman (LUSTER) program is developing a compact semiconductor laser that emits in the deep UV (i.e., wavelength &lt; 250 nanometers (nm)) and is capable of an output power of 1 Watt (W) with high efficiency and spectral purity suitable for a wide array of spectroscopy applications.  Such an achievement will represent a significant advance over the state of the art, as existing lasers in this wavelength range are bulky, highly inefficient, and expensive, as there are no available semiconductor lasers that can emit in the UV range &lt; 250 nm.  LUSTER will leverage lessons learned in growing high quality light emitting material from the Compact Mid-Ultraviolet Technology (CMUVT) program.  The compact size of semiconductor lasers along with the LUSTER performance goals will enable many applications including but not limited to standoff Raman spectroscopy which is of interest for DoD applications such as chemical agent sensing.</r2:Description>

ALIAS intends to enable reduction of aircrew workload and/or the number of onboard aircrew to improve performance.  The program will develop hardware and software to automate select aircrew functions and will employ novel, low impact approaches to interface with existing aircraft monitoring and control systems.  The program will also develop tractable approaches to rapidly capture crew-station specific skills and aircraft unique behaviors.  To accomplish this, ALIAS will leverage recent advances in perception, manipulation, machine learning, reusable software architectures, autonomous systems architecture, and verification and validation.  ALIAS will culminate in a demonstration of the ability to rapidly adapt a single system to multiple aircraft and execute simple missions.  This reliability enhancement capability will enable new operational concepts for reuse of existing air assets and allow a reduction in the number of aircrew required.</r2:Description>

The program will provide current and future missile systems the flexibility in speed-range combinations unachievable in current solid propellants and will reduce current volume and weight forms for smaller rocket systems.  Successful propellant systems for this program must demonstrate a controlled burn rate, restart capability, termination control, improved safety, and a dramatically improved shelf life (>15 years).  The program will also address critical issues of safer manufacturing (improved operational handling, transportability issues, and improved environmental impact).  Advanced manufacturing methods are of special interest because they can assure reproducibility and can support building custom propellant grains for different rocket systems.</r2:Description>

The program will build and flight test an unmanned 10,000 - 12,000 lb aircraft capable of sustained speeds in excess of 300 kt, demonstrate system level hover efficiency within 25% of the ideal power loading, and a lift-to-equivalent drag ratio no less than ten.  Additionally, the demonstrator will be designed to have a useful load of no less than 40% of the gross weight with a payload capacity of at least 12.5% of the gross weight.  A strong emphasis will be placed on the development of elegant, multi-functional subsystem technologies that demonstrate net improvements in aircraft efficiencies to enable new and vastly improved operational capabilities.  In FY 2016, VTOL Technology Demonstrator will be funded in PE 0603286E, Project AIR-01.</r2:Description>

U.S. computer networks are continually under attack, and these attacks are typically handled by individual organizations as they occur.  Analyzing network summary data across a wide array of networks will make it possible to identify trends and patterns visible only when the data is viewed as a whole and to detect recurring threats, patterns of activity, and persistent vulnerabilities.  Network Defense is developing novel algorithms and analysis tools that enable a big picture approach for identifying illicit behavior in networks.  This analysis and subsequent feedback to system administrators, security engineers, and decision makers will enhance information security in both the government and commercial sectors.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Memex program is developing the next generation of search technologies to revolutionize the discovery, organization, and presentation of domain-specific content.  Current search technologies have limitations in search query format, retrieved content organization, and infrastructure support and the iterative search process they enable is time-consuming and inefficient, typically finding only a fraction of the available information.  Memex is creating a new domain-specific search paradigm to discover relevant content and organize it in ways that are more immediately useful to specific missions and tasks.  In addition, Memex domain-specific search engines will extend the reach of current search capabilities to the deep web and non-traditional content.  Memex technologies will enable the military, government, and commercial enterprises to find and organize mission-critical information on the Internet and in large intelligence repositories.  Anticipated mission areas include counter-terrorism, counter-drug, anti-money-laundering, and anti-human-trafficking, with transition partners from DoD and other U.S. government activities.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Distributed Battle Management (DBM) program will develop mission-driven architectures, protocols, and algorithms for battle management (BM) in contested environments.  The military is turning to networked weapons and sensors on-board a heterogeneous mix of multi-purpose manned and unmanned systems.  In contested environments, it is a challenge for BM networks to communicate with subordinate platforms due to extensive adversarial cyber and electronic warfare operations, anti-satellite attacks, and the need for emissions control in the face of a formidable integrated air defense system.  The Distributed Battle Management program will seek to develop a distributed command architecture with decentralized control of mission-focused asset teams.  The architecture will enable rapid reaction to ephemeral engagement opportunities and maintain a reliable BM structure, despite limited communications and platform attrition in continuously evolving threat environments.  The program will incorporate highly automated decision making capability while maintaining vital human-on-the-loop operator approval.</r2:Description>

The Quantitative Crisis Response (QCR) program develops and applies big data analysis and visualization methodologies to better understand the true nature of non-traditional threats, track the effectiveness of remedial measures, and develop/optimize alternative strategies.  Recently we have seen the rise of extremely challenging non-traditional threats including illicit networks of (human) traffickers and infectious diseases like Ebola. To counter illicit networks it is important to detect their activities, which often take place on the dark web, and derive their command and control structure.  Infectious disease contagion presents a somewhat different challenge, specifically, finding patterns in the spread of the disease and factors that favor/mitigate its propagation.  There is also interest in quantitative methods for countering the proliferation of weapons of mass terrorism.  QCR will be coordinated with and transitioned to multiple national security agencies.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Science of Human and Computer Teaming program will develop and demonstrate data-driven approaches for the formation and training of teams comprised of humans and computers.  Conventional approaches to military personnel selection, role assignment, and training are optimized for individual performance, but military operations are typically performed by teams, and future teams are likely to also include autonomous systems that use artificial intelligence (AI) to sense, reason, learn, and interact.  Behavioral scientists are studying the performance of groups across diverse sets of tasks and developing performance assessment techniques for group work.  Interesting early results suggest that groups exhibit a form of intelligence beyond that of the individual members, and that group intelligence has social correlates.  Computer scientists are looking at ways in which humans may team with computers to achieve superior levels of performance.  Such human-computer teams have shown great promise in highly structured competitive domains such as chess.  Realizing this promise in free-form (battlefield) environments will require intuitive, low-latency, high-bandwidth, human-computer interfaces that enable computers to be better teammates. The program will identify individual characteristics predictive of performance of mixed human-computer teams; develop techniques for measuring these characteristics in military personnel; demonstrate the capability to select, assign roles, and train human-computer teams with performance superior to that of human-only teams formed and trained using current methods; and develop an understanding of how to structure human-computer teams for superior performance on military missions such as cyber defense and intelligence analysis.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Title>Predicting Complex Operational Environments</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>The Predicting Complex Operational Environments program expands on prior work in the XDATA program and will develop advanced modeling, analysis, simulation, and visualization tools to enable command staffs to rapidly and effectively plan and manage missions in complex operational environments.  The U.S. military increasingly operates in remote and unstable parts of the world where mission success depends heavily on cooperation with and among a wide variety of stakeholder groups.  These groups typically include host nation government organizations, local civilian groups, and non-governmental organizations each of which has priorities, sensitivities and concerns that may differ significantly.  Economic disruptions can add great urgency to these considerations, as shortages of water and food directly impact theater security and may even lead to war.  Current mission planning and plan assessment/adaptation technologies do not adequately model the inherent uncertainties.  Addressing this challenge will require the creation of new semantic techniques that automatically generate, update, and prune alternative hypotheses as they become more or less likely given incoming data streams.  The program will create computational models that represent the most significant dynamics and uncertainties of the operational environment including political, military, economic, and social factors.  These will enable command staffs to develop and assess potential courses of action at multiple levels of granularity and time scales, and to quickly adapt to changing situations in complex operational environments.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Visual Media Reasoning (VMR) program created technologies to automate the analysis of enemy-recorded photos and videos and to identify, within minutes, key information related to the content.  This included identification of individuals within the image (who), enumeration of the objects within the image and their attributes (what), and determining the image's geospatial location and time frame (where and when).  Large data stores of enemy photos and video are available but cannot be easily leveraged by a warfighter or analyst attempting to understand a specific new image in a timely fashion.  The VMR program developed technology to enable users to gain insights rapidly through application of highly parallelized image analysis techniques that can process the imagery in massive distributed image stores.  VMR technology serves as a force-multiplier by rapidly and automatically extracting tactically relevant information and alerting the analyst to scenes that warrant the analyst's expert attention.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element is budgeted in the Applied Research Budget Activity because its objective is to develop material, biological and energy technologies that make possible a wide range of new military capabilities.

The major goal of the Materials Processing Technology project is to develop novel materials, materials processing techniques, mathematical models and fabrication strategies for advanced materials, devices and components that will lower the cost, increase the performance, and/or enable new missions for military platforms and systems.  Included in this project are efforts across a wide range of materials including structural materials and devices, functional materials and devices, energetic materials and devices, low distortion optical lenses, and materials that enable new propulsion concepts for land, sea, and space vehicles.

The Biologically Based Materials and Devices project acknowledges the growing and pervasive influence of the biological sciences on the development of new DoD capabilities.  This influence extends throughout the development of new materials, devices, and processes and relies on the integration of biological breakthroughs with those in engineering and the physical sciences.  Contained in this project are thrusts in the application of biomimetic materials and devices for Defense, the use of biology's unique fabrication capabilities to produce structures that cannot be made any other way, the application of materials in biological applications, and the development of manufacturing tools that use biological components and processes for materials synthesis.  This project also includes major efforts aimed at integrating biological and digital sensing methodologies and maintaining human combat performance despite the extraordinary stressors of combat.  Finally, this thrust will develop new cognitive therapeutics, investigate the role of complexity in biological systems, and explore neuroscience technologies.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

It will also develop approaches that yield new materials and materials capabilities that cannot be made through conventional processing approaches as well as address efficient, low-volume manufacturing.  As a result of recent advances in manufacturing techniques (3D printing, manufacture on demand, etc.) and the push towards programmable hardware in embedded systems, the development cycle from design to production of both hardware and software is severely bottlenecked at the design phase.  Further research within this thrust, will create methods to translate natural inputs into software code and mechanical design.  This process will complete underspecified designs when possible and initiate an iterative dialog with a human to specify details as needed and actively suggest changes to designers when the intended design cannot operate within the required specifications.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Multifunctional Materials and Structures thrust is developing materials, materials processing, and structures that are explicitly tailored for multiple functions and/or unique mechanical properties.  One goal of this research is the ability to design, develop, and demonstrate materials with combinations of properties that are normally orthogonal (e.g., damage tolerance and biocompatibility).  This capability will ultimately lead to enhanced lethality, survivability, and performance in future DoD platforms.  This thrust will also include the exploration and development of dynamic models of complex systems across scale and develop new methodologies for understanding, architecting, and engineering complex systems.  These computational tools will link material properties to physics across multiple length scales (from molecule to part) and provide the ability to model and exploit complexity, such as hierarchy and strongly correlated effects, in structural and functional materials.  Development efforts under this thrust include reactive structures that can serve as both structure and explosive for lightweight munitions, novel materials and surfaces that are designed to adapt structural or functional properties to environmental and/or tactical threat conditions, and new thin film material deposition processes to improve the performance of surface dominated properties (friction, wear, and membrane permeability).  In addition, this thrust will also explore new cost effective processes for ensuring DoD accessibility to future advanced materials.  Examples of DoD applications that will benefit from these material developments include lower weight and higher performance aircraft, turbines with enhanced efficiency, erosion-resistant rotor blades, and high-temperature materials for operation in hypersonic environments.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Manufacturable Gradient Index Optics (M-GRIN) program seeks to advance the development of gradient index optics (GRIN) lenses from a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 3 to a Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL) 6.  The program will expand the application of GRIN by providing compact, lightweight, and cost-effective optical systems with controlled dispersion and aberrations that will replace large assemblies of conventional lenses.  The ability to create entirely new optical materials and surfaces creates the potential for new or significantly improved military optical applications, such as solar concentrators, portable designators, highly efficient fiber optics, and imaging systems.  The program also seeks to extend GRIN manufacturing technologies to glass, ceramic, and other inorganic materials in order to allow for small, lightweight, customized optical elements for mid-wave and long-wave infrared (MWIR and LWIR) applications.  A key component of the program is to develop new design tools that enable optics designers to incorporate dynamic material properties, fabrication methods, and manufacturing tolerances.  The integration of new materials, design tools, and manufacturing processes will enable previously unattainable 3-D optical designs to be manufactured.  This new manufacturing paradigm will enable flexible production of GRIN optics in quantities of one unit to thousands of units.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The goal of the Living Foundries program is to create a revolutionary, biologically-based manufacturing platform for the DoD and the Nation.  With its ability to perform complex chemistries, be flexibly programmed through DNA code, scale, adapt to changing environments, and self-repair, biology represents one of the most powerful manufacturing platforms known.  Living Foundries seeks to develop the foundational technological infrastructure to transform biology into an engineering practice, speeding the biological design-build-test-learn cycle and expanding the complexity of systems that can be engineered.  Ultimately, Living Foundries aims to provide game-changing manufacturing paradigms for the DoD, enabling adaptable, on-demand production of critical and high-value molecules.  

Research thrusts will focus on the development and demonstration of open technology platforms to prove out capabilities for rapid (months vs. years) design and construction of new bio-production systems.  The result will be an integrated, modular infrastructure across the areas of design, fabrication, debugging, analysis, optimization, and validation -- spanning the entire development life-cycle and enabling the ability to rapidly assess and improve designs.  Key to success will be tight coupling of computational design, fabrication of systems, debugging using multiple characterization data types, analysis, and further development such that iterative design and experimentation will be accurate, efficient and controlled.  Demonstration platforms will be challenged to build a variety of DoD-relevant, novel molecules with complex functionalities, such as synthesis of advanced, functional chemicals, materials precursors, and polymers (e.g., those tolerant of harsh environments).

                                <r2:Description>The Neuroscience Technologies thrust leveraged recent advances in neurophysiology, neuro-imaging, cognitive science, molecular biology, and modeling of complex systems to sustain and protect the cognitive functioning of the warfighter faced with challenging operational conditions.  Warfighters experience a wide variety of operational stressors, both mental and physical, that degrade critical cognitive functions such as memory, learning, and decision making.  These stressors also degrade the warfighter's ability to multitask, leading to decreased ability to respond quickly and effectively.  Currently, the long-term impact of these stressors on the brain is unknown, both at the molecular and behavioral level.  This thrust area investigated modern neuroscientific techniques to develop quantitative models of this impact and explored mechanisms to protect, maintain, complement, or restore physical and cognitive functioning during and after exposure to operational stressors.  In addition, new approaches for using physiological and neural signals to make human-machine systems more time efficient and less workload intense were identified.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program element is budgeted in the Applied Research budget activity because its objective is to develop electronics that make a wide range of military applications possible.

Advances in microelectronic device technologies, including digital, analog, photonic and MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS) devices, continue to have significant impact in support of defense technologies for improved weapons effectiveness, improved intelligence capabilities and enhanced information superiority.  The Electronics Technology program element supports the continued advancement of these technologies through the development of performance driven advanced capabilities, exceeding that available through commercial sources, in electronic, optoelectronic and MEMS devices, semiconductor device design and fabrication techniques, and new materials and material structures for device applications.  A particular focus for this work is the exploitation of chip-scale heterogeneous integration technologies that permit the optimization of device and integrated module performance.

The phenomenal progress in current electronics and computer chips will face the fundamental limits of silicon technology in the early 21st century, a barrier that must be overcome in order for progress to continue.  The program element will therefore explore alternatives to silicon-based electronics in the areas of new electronic devices.  The program element will also explore new architectures to use devices of all types, new software to program the systems, and new methods to fabricate the chips.  Approaches include nanotechnology, nanoelectronics, molecular electronics, spin-based electronics, quantum-computing, new circuit architectures optimizing these new devices, and new computer and electronic systems architectures.  Projects will investigate the feasibility, design, and development of powerful information technology devices and systems using approaches for electronic device designs that extend beyond traditional Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) scaling, including non-silicon-based materials technologies to achieve low cost, reliable, fast and secure computing, communication, and storage systems.  This investigation is aimed at developing new capabilities from promising directions in the design of information processing components using both inorganic and organic substrates, designs of components and systems leveraging quantum effects and chaos, and innovative approaches to computing designs incorporating these components for such applications as low cost seamless pervasive computing, ultra-fast computing, and sensing and actuation devices.  

This project has five major thrusts: Electronics, Photonics, MicroElectroMechanical Systems, Architectures, Algorithms, and other Electronic Technology research.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>There is a critical ongoing military need for flexible, affordable, and small size, weight and power (SWaP) real-time-adaptable military electromagnetic interfaces.  The Adaptive Radio Frequency Technology (ART) program will provide the warfighter with a new, fully adaptive radio platform capable of sensing the electromagnetic and waveform environment in which it operates, making decisions on how to best communicate in that environment, and rapidly adapting its hardware to meet ever-changing requirements, while simultaneously significantly reducing the SWaP of such radio nodes.  ART technology will also provide each warfighter, as well as small-scale unmanned platforms, with compact and efficient signal identification capabilities for next-generation cognitive communications, and sensing and electronic warfare applications.  ART technology will also enable rapid radio platform deployment for new waveforms and changing operational requirements.  The project will remove the separate design tasks needed for each unique Radio Frequency (RF) system, which will dramatically reduce the procurement and sustainment cost of military systems.  ART aggregates the Feedback Linearized Microwave Amplifiers program, the Analog Spectral Processing program, and Chip Scale Spectrum Analyzers (CSSA) program, and initiates new thrusts in Cognitive Low-energy Signal Analysis and Sensing Integrated Circuits (CLASIC), and Radio-Frequency Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (RF-FPGA).</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Title>Diverse &amp; Accessible Heterogeneous Integration (DAHI)</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>The scaling of silicon (Si) transistors to ever smaller dimensions has led to dramatic gains in processor performance over the past fifty years. In parallel, Integrated Circuits (IC) designers for RF circuits have leveraged the different material properties of compound semiconductor (CS) technologies such as indium phosphide (InP), gallium arsenide (GaAs), gallium nitride (GaN) and silicon-germanium (SiGe) to enable devices that operate at frequencies and powers difficult or impossible to achieve in Silicon.  Historically, a designer would have to decide between the high density of Si circuits or the high performance of CS materials.  Prior DARPA efforts have demonstrated the ability to achieve near-ideal "mix-and-match" capability for DoD circuit designers with limited demonstrations of the heterogeneous integration of silicon and InP technologies that far exceeded what can be accomplished with one technology alone.  Specifically, the Compound Semiconductor Materials On Silicon (COSMOS) program enabled transistors of InP to be freely mixed with silicon complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) circuits to obtain the benefits of both technologies (very high speed and very high circuit complexity/density, respectively).  The Diverse &amp; Accessible Heterogeneous Integration (DAHI) effort will take this capability to the next level, ultimately offering the seamless co-integration of a variety of semiconductor devices (for example, GaN, InP, GaAs, antimonide based Compound Semiconductors), microelectromechanical (MEMS) sensors and actuators, photonic devices (e.g., lasers, photo-detectors) and thermal management structures.  This capability will revolutionize our ability to build true "systems on a chip" (SoCs) and allow dramatic size, weight and volume reductions while enabling higher performance such as power, bandwidth or dynamic range in our electronic systems for electronic warfare, communications and radar.  

In the Applied Research part of this program, high performance RF/optoelectronic/mixed-signal systems-on-a-chip (SoC) for specific DoD transition applications will be developed as a demonstration of the DAHI technology.  To provide maximum benefit to the DoD, these processes will be transferred to a manufacturing flow and made available (with appropriate computer aided design support) to a wide variety of DoD laboratory, Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC), academic and industrial designers.  Manufacturing yield and reliability of the DAHI technologies will be characterized and enhanced.

                                <r2:Description>*Formerly Fast and Big Mixed-Signal Designs (FAB)

The scaling of silicon transistors to ever smaller dimensions has led to dramatic gains in processor performance over the past forty years. In parallel, IC designers for RF circuits have leveraged the different material properties of compound semiconductor (CS) technologies such as gallium arsenide (GaAs), gallium nitride (GaN) and silicon-germanium (SiGe) to enable devices that operate at frequencies and powers difficult or impossible to achieve in silicon.  When integrated together the heterogeneous integration of these technologies has been demonstrated to far exceed what can be accomplished with any one technology alone. The process of integrating CS technologies on silicon currently requires that the silicon transistor dimension, or process node, be fixed which requires designs to be remade for various combinations of technology and process node, a costly and time consuming effort. This program will investigate the potential for a truly process-agnostic integration technology that is inclusive of any current or future circuit fabrication technology with a standardized interconnect topology. Such a technology platform will enable the design of individual circuit intellectual property (IP) blocks, such as low-noise amplifiers or analog-to-digital converters (ADC), with a goal of re-using them across applications and resulting in time and cost savings.  Re-use will allow the DoD to spread the upfront design cost of these blocks over several designs instead of leveling the burden on a single program.  Furthermore, the IP can be designed in the fabrication process best suited for the performance goals and evolve more quickly than larger, more expensive single-chip (monolithic) systems-on-a-chip.  Through standardization of the interface, CHIPS will enable the DoD to leverage the advancements driven by the global semiconductor market rather than relying on a single on-shore foundry provider or on proprietary circuit designs owned by a few traditional prime performers.

In the Applied Research part of this program, focus will be placed on the rapid development and insertion of microsystems utilizing the CHIPS technology.  For example, the development of an ADC combining a SiGe circuit integrated with 14 nanometer Silicon CMOS will be explored.

                                <r2:Title>Direct On-Chip Digital Optical Synthesis (DODOS)</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>The development of techniques for precise frequency control of RF and microwave radiation in the 1940's revolutionized modern warfare.  Frequency control is the enabling technology for RADAR, satellite and terrestrial communications, and positioning and navigation technology, among many other core DoD capabilities.  By comparison, frequency control at optical frequencies is relatively immature, comparable to the state-of-the-art of microwave control in the 1930's.  The first practical demonstration of optical frequency synthesis, utilizing a self-referenced optical comb, was performed in 1999 and, since that time, the precision and accuracy of optical measurements has improved by four orders of magnitude, including the demonstration of atomic clocks utilizing optical-frequency atomic transitions that far outperform existing technology based on microwave transitions.  To date, however, optical frequency control has been constrained to laboratory experiments due to the large size, relative fragility, and high cost of optical comb-based synthesizers.  Recent developments in self-referenced optical frequency combs in microscale resonators enable the development of a fully-integrated chip-scale optical frequency synthesizer.  Ubiquitous low-cost robust optical frequency synthesis is expected to create a similar disruptive capability in optical technology as microwave frequency synthesis did in the 1940's, enabling high-bandwidth coherent optical communications, coherent synthesized-aperture LiDAR, portable high-accuracy atomic clocks, high-resolution standoff gas/toxin detection, and intrusion detection, among other foreseen applications.

The Direct On-chip Digital Optical Synthesis (DODOS) program will integrate a diverse range of photonic and electronic components to create a microscale, high-accuracy optical frequency synthesizer, in a compact, robust package, suitable for deployment in a wide variety of mission-critical DoD applications.  Significant challenges in the program include the integration of heterogeneous devices and materials that are incompatible with conventional high-volume manufacturing of integrated circuits, optimizing efficient on-chip pump lasers and high-bandwidth detectors, and developing high-precision microwave control electronics with low power consumption.  Basic research for this program is funded within PE 0601101E, Project ES-01.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>Phased arrays are critical system components for high performance military electronics with widespread applications in communications, electronic warfare and radar.  The DoD relies heavily on phased arrays to maintain technological superiority in nearly every theater of conflict.  The DoD cannot update these high cost specialized arrays at the pace necessary to effectively counter adversarial threats. The Arrays at Commercial Timescales (ACT) program fills this gap through the use of commercial-of-the-shelf components that can undergo technology refresh far more frequently in response to a continually changing threat environment.  ACT will develop adaptive and standardized digital-at-every-element arrays that can replace static analog beamformers with cost effective digital array systems capable of a yearly technology refresh.  By doing so, phased arrays will become ubiquitous throughout the DoD, moving onto many platforms for which phased arrays had been previously prohibitively expensive to develop or maintain.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Title>High power Amplifier using Vacuum electronics for Overmatch Capability (HAVOC)</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>The effectiveness of combat operations across all domains increasingly depends on our ability to control and exploit the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum, and to deny its use to our adversaries.  Below 30 GHz, the proliferation and availability of inexpensive high-power commercial RF sources has made the EM spectrum crowded and contested, challenging our spectrum dominance.  The numerous tactical advantages offered by operating at higher frequencies, most notably the wide bandwidths available, is driving both commercial and DoD solid-state and vacuum electronic amplifiers into the millimeter wave (mm-wave) spectrum above 30 GHz.  Control of the mm-wave spectrum necessitates advanced and increasingly more sophisticated electronic components and systems.  The performance of these systems strongly depends on the available amplifier power which impacts how much power the system can radiate.

The High power Amplifier using Vacuum electronics for Overmatch Capability (HAVOC) program seeks to strengthen our dominance of the EM spectrum and create overmatch capability by developing a new class of wideband, high-power vacuum electronic amplifiers.  The size, weight, and power (SWaP) will be consistent with reusable airborne and mobile platforms enabling an increased offset range and the ability to engage multiple targets at the speed of light.  Realization of wideband, high power vacuum electronic amplifier technology will require significant advancements in cathodes with high current-density and long lifetime, beam-wave interaction circuits with wide bandwidth and high power handling capability, wideband and low-loss vacuum windows, and compact magnetic structures for electron beam transport.  The HAVOC amplifier will provide leap-ahead capabilities to air, ground, and ship-based communications, sensing, and electronic warfare systems.  Opportunities for transfer of the HAVOC technology to the Services will be identified during the execution of the early phases of the program.  The technology transfer efforts will follow a spiral development process to mitigate risk and provide the opportunity to incorporate new technological developments as they occur. Basic research for this program is funded within PE 0601101E, Project ES-01.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Title>Precise Robust Inertial Guidance for Munitions (PRIGM)</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>The DoD relies on GPS for ubiquitous and accurate positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT). With the increased prevalence of intentional GPS jamming, spoofing, and other GPS-denial threats, GPS access is increasingly unavailable in contested theaters and alternative sources of PNT are required.  In particular, guided munitions navigation is the most immediate and among the most demanding of GPS-denial challenges, due to the necessity of operating in highly contested theaters and the stringent requirements for minimization of cost, size, weight, and power consumption (CSWaP). The Precise Robust Inertial Guidance for Munitions (PRIGM) program will develop low-CSWaP inertial sensor technology for GPS-free munitions navigation.  PRIGM comprises two focus areas: 1) Development of a Navigation-Grade Inertial Measurement Unit (NGIMU) that transitions state-of-the-art MEMS to DoD platforms by 2020; and 2) Research and development of Advanced Inertial MEMS Sensors (AIMS) to achieve gun-hard, high-bandwidth, high dynamic range navigation requirements with the objective of complete autonomy in 2030.  PRIGM will advance state-of-the-art MEMS gyros from TRL-3 devices to a TRL-6 transition platform (complete IMU) that enables Service Labs to perform TRL-7 field demonstrations.  PRIGM will exploit recent advances in heterogeneous integration of photonics and CMOS and advanced MEMS technology to realize novel inertial sensors for application in extreme dynamic environments and beyond navigation-grade performance.

Future warfighting scenarios will take place in a GPS-denied world.  High-dynamics navigation applications, such as smart munitions, require low-CSWaP inertial sensors demonstrating high bandwidth, high precision, and high shock tolerance. Conventional MEMS inertial sensors rely on capacitive sensing to measure position, which suffer from perturbations due to asymmetry, temperature sensitivity, parasitic capacitances, and squeeze film damping of gas in narrow gaps.  Various methods have been proposed to overcome challenges with capacitive readout.  One solution is optical sensing, which has demonstrated high sensitivity, low noise position sensing and potential to reject external vibrations.  Recent advances in heterogeneous integration, on-chip optical waveguides, and quantum-assisted sensing and readout of MEMS/NEMS have resulted in new capabilities to enable candidate technologies for PRIGM.  The candidate technologies include optically interrogated MEMS gyroscopes and accelerometers, waveguide optical gyroscopes, and rate-integrating MEMS gyroscopes.  Basic research for this program is funded within PE 0601101E, Project ES-01 and advanced development for the program is budgeted in PE 0603739E, Project MT-15.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The DoD has an unfilled need for a persistent, event driven sensing capability, where physical, electromagnetic and other sensors can be pre-placed and remain dormant until awoken by an external trigger or stimulus.  State-of-the-art sensors use active electronics to monitor the environment for the external trigger.  The power consumed by these electronic circuits limits the sensor lifetime to durations of weeks to months.  The Near Zero Power RF and Sensor Operations (N-ZERO) program will extend the lifetime of remotely deployed sensors from months to years.  N-ZERO will develop the underlying technologies and demonstrate the capability to continuously and passively monitor the environment and wake-up an electronic circuit upon detection of a specific signature or trigger. Thereafter, sensor lifetime will be limited only by processing and communications of confirmed events.

The N-ZERO program will replace the power consuming electronic circuits used for processing and detection of information in current systems with passive or extremely low power devices.  The N-ZERO program will develop RF communications and physical sensor systems that collect, process, and detect the presence of useful information, while rejecting spurious signals and noise, using the energy in the collected information to perform these functions.  This will eliminate or significantly reduce the standby power consumption from the battery.  By doing so, the N-ZERO program will provide the warfighter with wireless sensors systems with drastically increased mission life.

Leveraging investments in high-volume wafer scale processing has made digital imaging technologies ubiquitous, for example, making high resolution digital cameras common place in every cell phone.  A smaller scale revolution is currently underway due to the development of long-wave infrared (LWIR) thermal imaging sensors.  These sensors are also manufactured at the wafer scale, and they are becoming widely available due to the low cost relative to existing infrared (IR) imaging technologies.  No similar technology exists in the tactically and strategically important short-wave and mid-wave IR (SWIR/MWIR) bands.  The Wafer-scale Infrared Detectors (WIRED) program addresses these needs by developing high performance SWIR and MWIR Focal Plane Array (FPA) technologies that are manufactured at the wafer scale.  These sensors will provide increased standoff distances to smaller Tier I and II class unmanned aerial vehicle platforms, low cost missiles, hand held weapon sights/handheld surveillance systems, helmet-mounted systems, and ground vehicle-mounted threat warning systems.

The MWIR detector technologies developed under WIRED will provide, for the first time, MWIR FPAs that do not require heavy, expensive cryogenic coolers.  The SWIR detector technologies will provide, for the first time, diffraction limited imaging with compact optics.  Significant challenges include obtaining high detector performance from disordered materials that can be deposited directly onto readout integrated circuits (ROICs).  New ROIC designs will also be required to achieve the noise reduction and pixel pitches required for the suggested applications.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>*Formerly MultiPLEX

While radio-enabled technologies manipulate radio waves for sensing (e.g. RADAR) and communication, optical systems leverage visible light and can enable foliage-penetrating light detection and ranging (LIDAR), navigation, 3D imaging, and long-range communications. Although the basic technology already exists, optical systems have been limited by their size, weight, and cost. A traditional optical telescope, for instance, requires expensive precision lenses and mirrors, large empty volumes for gathering and focusing light, and heavy mechanical steering components. Mechanical steering's limited speed and precision also impedes the use of optical systems in certain defense applications, although LIDAR is more suitable for detailed imaging relative to RADAR.

The Modular Optical Aperture Building Blocks (MOABB) program seeks to greatly reduce the size and weight of optical systems while increasing steering rates. Specifically, MOABB aims to construct millimeter scale optical unit cells that can be coherently arrayed onto a flat surface to form a much larger, higher power device. These building blocks would replace the precision lenses, mirrors, and mechanical components from a conventional optical system. MOABB would also develop scalable optical phased arrays, borrowing from RADAR the technology required to steer electromagnetic waves, such as light and radio, without mechanical components. These advances would allow for a 100-fold reduction in size and weight and a 1,000-fold increase in steering rate. For applications such as LIDAR, laser communications and laser illumination, MOABB provides a compelling opportunity to replace empty space and bulk components with a planar, integrated system.</r2:Description>

High performance electronics are at the heart of most modern military systems. Today, when selecting the electronics for advanced systems, DoD programs must choose between a high performing, custom integrated circuit that takes years to design, or a significantly lower performing general purpose integrated circuit that can be designed in a few months.  The tradeoff between performance and time has placed the DoD in an undesirable state.  The Circuit Realization At Faster Timescales (CRAFT) Program will break this paradigm by developing a custom integrated circuit design flow and methodology that will drastically reduce the amount of effort required to design a custom integrated circuit by 10 times while preserving high performance.  CRAFT will enable critical DoD electronic system needs by reducing the barrier to the design and fabrication of custom integrated circuits in leading-edge CMOS technology.

The CRAFT program will investigate novel design flows that utilize recent advances in software development methodology to reduce the amount of required design time.  The goal will be a reduction in the manual labor required for verification by automating much of the design tasks with automated generators.  In addition, CRAFT will explore increasing the level of design reuse and the flexibility of transferring a design from one foundry to another as well as migrating from one foundry technology to a more advanced technology.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>*Formerly Next Generation Atomic Clock

Atomic clock technology provides the high-performance backbone of timing and synchronization for DoD navigation, communications, Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), and Electronic Warfare (EW) systems.  Prior DARPA investment in Chip-Scale Atomic Clock (CSAC) technology has led to recent demonstrations of enhanced DoD capabilities, enabled by the availability of atomic-quality timing in portable battery-powered applications.  The Atomic Clock with Enhanced Stability (ACES) program will develop a next-generation low-size, weight, and power (SWaP) atomic clock, with 100X-1000X improvement in key performance parameters, by employing alternative approaches to atomic confinement and interrogation, with particular focus on developing the component technologies necessary to enable low-cost manufacturing and robust deployment in harsh DoD environments.

ACES will develop chip-scale atomic clocks achieving temperature coefficient of frequency &lt; 10^-15/°C, drift &lt; 10^-13/month, instability &lt; 10^-11/sqrt(tau), and retrace &lt; 10^-13 which are robust against acceleration and magnetic fields (10^-13/g and 10^-13/gauss, respectively).  This will enable precise timing on low size, weight, and power (SWaP) platforms with extended mission duration.  In order to achieve these performance metrics, new enabling technology and interrogation techniques will be integrated into systems.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The long wave infrared (LWIR) is the most commonly used spectral band for thermal imagery, and current systems must choose between high performance cryogenically cooled focal plane arrays (FPAs), and uncooled microbolometers.  Microbolometers offer a significant reduction in size, weight, and cost (SWaP-C), at the expense of reduced sensitivity and slower response time.  The objective of the LOTS program is to demonstrate a detector technology that breaks this traditional trade space by providing the same benefits in SWaP-C as current microbolometers while approaching the sensitivity of a cryogenically cooled sensor.  The result will be the ability to deploy smaller, lighter, cheaper sensors on higher value assets and in more critical missions.</r2:Description>

Research efforts will focus on leveraging commercial industry investment in future wireless technology to develop communication modules that operate within the various unlicensed radio frequency (RF) and millimeter wave (mm-wave) frequency bands.  Employing advanced silicon technology, a fully-integrated multi-channel transceiver array including antenna, RF front-end amplifiers, passives, modems, and digital processors will be realized with a goal of reducing the barrier of connecting an existing device into a high data rate network.  These universal communication modules will be capable of accepting digital input data and DC power only, modulating the digital data and generating RF/mm-wave radio signals, and receiving and demodulating external RF/mm-wave radio signals into digital output data. More importantly, built-in calibration, tuning, and self-test functions will be integrated so that the communication module will not require costly post-manufacture testing and evaluation.  The program will extend current state of art Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) techniques toward future applications which require gigahertz bandwidth, low latency, low power, and high power efficiency to support seamless connectivity between users, sensors, payloads, and platforms across the RF and mm-wave spectrum.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The IntraChip Enhanced Cooling (ICECool) program is exploring disruptive technologies that will remove thermal barriers to the operation of military electronic systems, while significantly reducing size, weight, and power consumption.  These thermal barriers will be removed by integrating thermal management into the chip, substrate, or package technology.  Successful completion of this program will raise chip heat removal rates to above 1 kW/cm^2 and chip package heat removal density to above 1kW/cm^3 in RF arrays and embedded computers.

Specific areas of focus in this program include overcoming limiting evaporative and diffusive thermal transport mechanisms at the micro/nano scale to provide an order-of-magnitude increase in on-chip heat flux and heat removal density, determining the feasibility of exploiting these mechanisms for intrachip thermal management, characterizing the performance limits and physics-of-failure of high heat density, intrachip cooling technologies, and integrating chip-level thermal management techniques into prototype high power electronics in RF arrays and embedded computing systems.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The PIXNET program addresses the squad level capability gap for target detection, recognition and identification in day/night missions through real-time fusion of visible and thermal infrared (IR) imagery.  The vision of the program is to offer the warfighter a small and versatile camera that would be affordable for individual soldiers and provide multiple band imagery with fusion capability to take full advantage of different wavelength-band phenomenology in a compact single unit.  In the future, the availability of the PIXNET camera would enable a peer-to-peer networked system for image sharing within a squad, thereby providing a better common operating picture of the battlefield and significantly enhancing the warfighter's situational understanding.  The program aims to develop a low size, weight and power (SWaP), low cost, soldier-portable multiband infrared camera that will provide real-time single and multiple band imagery using a combination of a thermal and reflected spectral band.    The use of fused imagery in the PIXNET design will allow the soldier to detect camouflaged targets and distinguish targets from decoys.  The PIXNET camera will eliminate limitations posed by current camera systems, allowing for the detection, recognition and identification of targets from a single camera in daylight or no-light conditions.

The PIXNET program will focus on a significant reduction in SWaP and cost of infrared sensor components to enable the deployment of this technology to a wide range of participants in the theater.  The emphasis on a small form factor will enable new opportunities such as surveillance with small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), multi-band rifle sights, vehicle-mounted systems, as well as helmet-mounted and handheld surveillance systems.  The phenomenology of utilizing the unique characteristics of different infrared wavelengths for target detection will be exploited.  The combination of a smart phone and PIXNET camera at the soldier level will enable more effective tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP) over the current capability.  The PIXNET program takes advantage of the computing capability of smart phones to process and fuse multicolor images and send them as videos or still images to the warfighter's helmet-mounted display via a wireless or wired connection.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Vanishing Programmable Resources (VAPR) program will create microelectronic and mechanical systems capable of physically disappearing (either in whole or in part) in a controlled, triggerable manner, a characteristic referred to as transience.  The program will develop and establish an initial set of materials and components along with integration and manufacturing capabilities to undergird a fundamentally new class of electronics and mechanical structures defined by their performance and transience.  These transient electronics and structural systems ideally should perform in a manner comparable to Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) systems, but with limited device persistence that can be programmed, adjusted in real-time, triggered, and/or be sensitive to the deployment environment.  Applications include sensors for conventional indoor/outdoor environments (buildings, transportation, and materiel), environmental monitoring over large areas, simplified diagnosis, treatment, and health monitoring in the field and airborne delivery vehicles with vanishing properties.  VAPR will explore transience characteristics of electronic devices and structural materials as well as build out an initial capability to make transient electronics and transient structural materials a deployable technology for the DoD and Nation.  The technological capability developed through VAPR will be demonstrated through two final test vehicles.  The transient electronics test vehicle will be a vanishing sensor with RF link.  The sensor with RF link will serve as an application vehicle showing the manufacturability of the research and process developed in the VAPR program being performed in PE 0601101E, Project TRS-01.  The sensor with RF link is meant to be functional on its own, but also a leading indicator of the types of circuits possible under the VAPR program.  The transient structural materials demonstration will be a vanishing air delivery vehicle capable of precise, gentle drops of small payloads (~3 lbs.).  This demonstration will be functional on its own and will also be a leading indicator of the types of complex vanishing mechanical structures enabled by VAPR materials and technologies.  The resulting prototype designs will establish a fundamental capability to gently, precisely, and without debris deliver mission-critical payloads and are expected to broadly apply to various concepts of operation (CONOPS) relevant to national security.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>Modern weapons systems are dependent on radio frequency (RF) links for communications, command and control, geolocation and battle management.  This dependence will only grow with the move to disaggregated systems in the battlefield. To create assured RF links in contested environments, HERMES will study the architectures and develop the technologies to enable spread-spectrum links with 10 GHz of instantaneous bandwidth. The ultimate objective is >70 dB of jammer suppression.  This program will explore the limits of jammer suppression through a combination of processing gain and tunable filtering in a hyper-wideband system.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Title>Direct SAMpling Digital ReceivER (DISARMER)</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>The goal of the Direct SAMpling Digital ReceivER (DISARMER) program is to produce a hybrid photonic-electronic analog-to-digital converter (ADC) capable of coherently sampling the entire X-band (8-12 GigaHertz (GHz)).  Conventional electronic wideband receivers are limited in dynamic range by both the electronic mixer and the back-end digitizers.  By employing an ultra-stable optical clock, the DISARMER program will allow for mixer-less digitization and thereby improve the dynamic range 100x over the state of the art.  Such a wide bandwidth, high fidelity receiver will have applications in electronic warfare and signals intelligence systems while dramatically reducing the cost, size and weight of these systems.

The DISARMER program will develop a low jitter mode-locked laser to be used as the sampling source.  The program will also develop a novel photonic architecture in a compact platform capable of hybrid electronic-photonic track-and-hold functionality and coherent photo-detection.  This program has advanced technology development efforts funded in PE 0603739E, Project MT-15.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Title>Micro-Technology for Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (Micro PN&amp;T)</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>The Micro-Technology for Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (Micro-PNT) program developed low-Cost, Size, Weight, and Power (CSWaP) inertial sensors and timing sources for navigation in GPS degraded environments, primarily focusing on the development of miniature solid state and atomic gyroscopes and clocks.  Both classes of sensors are currently unsuitable for small platform or dismount soldier applications. Micro Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) sensors have limited performance but excellent CSWaP, while atomic sensors are capable of excellent performance but are limited to laboratory experiments due to complexity and high CSWaP.  Micro-PNT advanced both technology approaches by improving the performance of MEMS inertial sensors and by miniaturizing atomic devices.  Ultimately, low-CSWaP inertial sensors and clocks will enable ubiquitous guidance and navigation on all platforms, including guided munitions, unmanned aerial vehicles (micro-UAVs), and mounted and dismounted soldiers.

The successful realization of Micro-PNT depends on development of new microfabrication processes and novel material systems for fundamentally different sensing modalities, as well as understanding the error sources at the microscale and the scaling relationships for size reduction of sensors based on atomic physics techniques.  The Micro-PNT program included research into novel techniques for fabrication and integration of three-dimensional MEMS devices as well as theoretical and experimental studies of new architectures and geometries for MEMS inertial sensing.  Atomic physics research included the development of new architectures for atomic inertial sensing and investigation of miniature enabling technologies, whose conventional counterparts are currently large, power hungry, and temperature sensitive, limiting high performance sensors to laboratory demonstrations.  Advanced research for the program is budgeted in PE 0603739E, Project MT-12.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>To realize high performance analog, Radio Frequency (RF) and mixed-signal electronics, a next-generation transistor technology with high cutoff frequency and high breakdown voltage is under development.  This technology enabled large voltage swing circuits for military applications that the current state-of-the-art silicon transistor technology cannot support.  The objective of the NEXT program was to develop a revolutionary, wide band gap, nitride transistor technology that simultaneously provides extremely high-speed and high-voltage swing [Johnson Figure of Merit (JFoM) larger than 5 Terahertz (THz)-V] in a process consistent with large scale integration of enhancement/depletion (E/D) mode logic circuits of 1,000 or more transistors.  In addition, this fabrication process was reproducible, high-yield, high-uniformity, and highly reliable.  The accomplishment of this goal was validated through the demonstration of specific program Process Control Monitor (PCM) Test Circuits such as 5, 51 and 501-stage ring oscillators in each program phase.  The impact of this next-generation nitride electronic technology is the speed, linearity, and power efficiency improvement of RF and mixed-signal electronic circuits used in military communications, electronic warfare and sensing.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The goal of the Microscale Plasma Devices (MPD) program was to design, develop, and characterize MPD technologies, circuits, and substrates.  The MPD program focused on development of fast, small, reliable, high-carrier-density, micro-plasma switches capable of operating in extreme conditions, such as high-radiation and high-temperature environments.  Specific focus was given to methods that provide efficient generation of ions that can perform robust signal processing of radio frequency (RF) through light electromagnetic energy over a range of gas pressures.  Applications for such devices are far reaching, including the construction of complete high-frequency plasma-based circuits, and microsystems with superior resistance to radiation and extreme temperature environments.  Two and multi-terminal devices consisting of various architectures were developed and optimized under the scope of this program.  MPDs were developed in various circuits and substrates to demonstrate the efficacy of different approaches.  MPD-based microsystems were demonstrated in DoD applications where electronic systems must survive in extreme environments.

The MPD applied research program focused on transferring the fundamental scientific advances funded by PE 0601101E, Project ES-01 to produce complex circuit designs that may be integrated with commercial electronic devices.  The MPD program resulted in the design and modeling tools, as well as the fabrication capabilities necessary to commercially manufacture high-performance microscale-plasma-device-based electronic systems for advanced DoD applications.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The goal of the Tactically Exploited Reconnaissance Node (TERN) program, a joint effort with the Office of Naval Research, is to develop a systems approach for, and perform technical demonstration of, a Medium-Altitude, Long-Endurance Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (MALE UAV) capability from smaller ships.  The program will demonstrate the technology for launch and recovery of large unmanned aircraft capable of providing persistent 24/7 Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) and strike capabilities at long radius orbits.  By extending the ISR/strike radius and simultaneously increasing time on station beyond current capabilities from smaller ships, TERN will enable novel operational concepts including maritime surveillance and responsive, persistent deep overland ISR and strike, without requirement for forward basing.  To achieve these goals, the program will create new concepts for aircraft launch and recovery, aircraft logistics and maintenance, and aircraft flight in regimes associated with maritime operating conditions.  The program will culminate in a launch and recovery demonstration.  Application of TERN technologies and operational concepts will enable a novel and cost efficient approach for multiple mission sets.  The transition partner is the Navy.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The goal of the Collaborative Operations in Denied Environment (CODE) program is to enhance mission performance, reduce cost, confound adversaries, and reduce reliance on space assets for navigation and communication by distributing mission functions such as sensing, communication, precision navigation, kinetic, and non-kinetic effects to small platforms and increasing their level of autonomy.  Collaboration of multiple assets offers new possibilities to conduct military missions using smaller air platforms to enhance survivability, reduce overall acquisition cost, create new effects, increase communications range and robustness in denied environments, increase search area, increase areas held at risk, reduce target prosecution reaction time, and provide multi-mission capabilities by combinations of assets.  This effort will specifically focus on developing and demonstrating approaches that will expand the mission capabilities of legacy air assets through autonomy and collaborative behaviors, within a standard based open architecture.  Potential transition partners include the Air Force, Army, and Navy.</r2:Description>

HAWC will pursue flight demonstration of the critical technologies for an effective and affordable air-launched hypersonic cruise missile.  These technologies include advanced air vehicle configurations capable of efficient hypersonic flight, hydrocarbon scramjet-powered propulsion to enable sustained hypersonic cruise, thermal management approaches designed for high-temperature cruise, and affordable system designs and manufacturing approaches.  HAWC technologies also extend to reusable hypersonic air platforms for applications such as global presence and space lift.  The HAWC program will leverage advances made by the previously funded Falcon, X-51, and HyFly programs.  This is a joint program with the Air Force, and HAWC technologies are planned for transition to the Air Force after flight testing is complete.</r2:Description>

The program will also consider traceability to, and ideally compatibility, with the Navy Vertical Launch System (VLS).  The metrics associated with this objective include total range, time of flight, payload, accuracy, and impact velocity.  The program will address the system and technology issues required to enable development of a hypersonic boost glide system considering (1) vehicle concepts possessing the required aerodynamic and aero-thermal performance, controllability and robustness for a wide operational envelope, (2) the system attributes and subsystems required to be effective in relevant operational environments, and (3) approaches to reducing cost and improving affordability for both the demonstration system and future operational systems.

                                <r2:Description>The Technology for Enriching and Augmenting Manned - Aircraft (TEAM-US) project seeks to increase lethality, survivability, payload, and reach of combat aircraft by: (i) teaming them (wingmen) with advanced Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), and (ii) enabling swarming employment and operations of manned and unmanned airborne systems.  The synergy between the mission tailored UAV wingmen and the less survivable, but decision making manned platforms will provide access to contested airspace and enhance force projection.  UAV wingmen will reduce air dominance lifecycle costs by dramatically reducing training costs.  Legacy manned platforms will train with virtual unmanned teammates saving operations, maintenance, and logistics costs associated with manned wingmen.  Unmanned wingmen can be developed for a wide variety of missions including penetrating intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), electronic attack (EA), and weapons delivery. Mixed operations of manned and unmanned systems in a swarming configuration can be developed to support missions against networked-integrated air defenses and to support operations in highly contested environments.  A common core will enable reduced development and integration costs.  Finally, leveraging existing platforms for command, control, and battle management recapitalizes existing investments, making these 4th and 5th generation platforms viable participants in future anti-access, area denial scenarios where they may have limited survivability.  Balancing in situ battle management with highly capable, mission specific unmanned teammates will offset new threat technologies, enabling more cost effective mission execution, and increasing the survivability of the manned platform team leader.  The anticipated transition partners for this effort are the Air Force, Army, and Marine Corps.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) Technology Demonstrator program will demonstrate revolutionary improvements in (heavier than air) VTOL air vehicle capabilities and efficiencies through the development of subsystem and component technologies, aircraft configurations and system integration.  The program will build and flight test an unmanned 10,000 - 12,000 lb aircraft capable of sustained speeds in excess of 300 kt, demonstrate system level hover efficiency within 25 percent of the ideal power loading, and a lift-to-equivalent drag ratio no less than ten.  Additionally, the demonstrator will be designed to have a useful load of no less than 40 percent of the gross weight with a payload capacity of at least 12.5 percent of the gross weight.  A strong emphasis will be placed on the development of elegant, multi-functional subsystem technologies that demonstrate net improvements in aircraft efficiencies to enable new and vastly improved operational capabilities.  Technologies developed under this program will be made available to all Services for application to future air systems development.  This program is a continuation of applied research efforts funded in PE 0602702E, Project TT-07.

                                <r2:Description>Current and future land and ship-to-shore operations will require rapid and distributed employment of U.S. forces on the battlefield.  The Aerial Reconfigurable Embedded System (ARES) program developed a vertical take-off and landing (VTOL), modular unmanned air vehicle that can carry a 3,000 lb useful load at a range of 250 nautical miles on a single tank of fuel.  ARES enabled distributed operations and access to compact, high altitude landing zones to reduce warfighter exposure to hostile threats and bypass ground obstructions.  ARES modular capability allowed mission modules to be quickly interchanged and deployed at the company level.  This enables the flexible employment of many different capabilities including: cargo resupply, casualty evacuation, reconnaissance, weapons platforms, and other types of operations.  ARES vehicles could be dispatched to resupply isolated small units.  ARES was suited for enhanced company operations concepts that would provide the warfighter/team increased situational awareness for operations in an urban environment.  The enabling technologies of interest developed under the ARES program included vertical and translational flight, conversion between powered lift and wing borne lift, ducted fan propulsion systems, lightweight materials, tailless configuration, modularity, and advanced over-actuated flight controls for stable transition from vertical to horizontal flight.  Additionally, the program explored opportunities for the design, development, and integration of new, key technologies and capabilities.  These included adaptable landing gear concepts to enable operations from irregular landing zones and moving launch/recovery platforms, and autonomous take off and landing.  The anticipated transition partners for this effort are the Army, Marine Corps, and Special Operations Forces.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Persistent Close Air Support (PCAS) program significantly increased close air support (CAS) capabilities by developing a system to allow continuous CAS availability and lethality to the supported ground commander.  The enabling technologies were: manned/unmanned attack platforms, next generation graphical user interfaces, data links, digital guidance and control, and advanced munitions.  PCAS demonstrated the ability to digitally task a CAS platform from the ground to attack multiple/simultaneous targets.  PCAS allowed the Joint Tactical Air Controller (JTAC) the ability to rapidly engage multiple moving targets simultaneously within the area of operation.  PCAS's ability to digitally task a CAS platform to attack multiple/simultaneous targets would improve U.S. ground forces operations and speed of attack.  The system was designed to reduce collateral damage and potential fratricide to friendly forces.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Space Programs and Technology program element is budgeted in the Advanced Technology Development budget activity because it addresses high payoff opportunities to dramatically reduce costs associated with advanced space systems and provides revolutionary new system capabilities for satisfying current and projected military missions.

A space force structure that is robust against attack represents a stabilizing deterrent against adversary attacks on space assets.  The keys to a secure space environment are situational awareness to detect and characterize potential threats, a proliferation of assets to provide robustness against attack, ready access to space, and a flexible infrastructure for maintaining the capabilities of on-orbit assets.  Ready access to space requires the delivery of capabilities, replenishment of supplies into orbit, and rapid manufacturing of affordable space capabilities.  Developing space access and spacecraft servicing technologies will lead to reduced ownership costs of space systems and new opportunities for introducing technologies for the exploitation of space.

Systems development is also required to increase the interactivity of space systems, space-derived information and services with terrestrial users.  Studies under this project include technologies and systems that will enable satellites and microsatellites to operate more effectively by increasing maneuverability, survivability, and situational awareness; enabling concepts include novel power/propulsion/propellants, unique manufacturing or assembly processes; and precision control of multi-payload systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The XS-1 program will mature the technologies and operations for low cost, persistent and responsive space access and global reach.  Past efforts have identified and demonstrated critical enabling technologies including composite or light weight structures, propellant tanks, thermal protection systems, rocket propulsion and advanced avionics/software.  A critically important technology gap is integration into a flight demonstration able to deliver aircraft-like operability.  The program will validate key technologies on the ground, and then fabricate an X-Plane to demonstrate: 1) 10 flights in 10 days,  2) up to Mach 10+ flight, and 3) design capable of a 10X lower cost space access for cargos from 3,000-5,000 lbs to low earth orbit.  A key goal is validating the critical technologies for a wide range of next generation high speed aircraft enabling new military capabilities including worldwide reconnaissance, global transport, small responsive space access aircraft and affordable spacelift.  The anticipated transition partners are the Air Force, Navy and commercial sector.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>To date, servicing operations have never been conducted on spacecraft beyond low earth orbit (LEO).  A large number of national security and commercial space systems operate at geosynchronous earth orbit (GEO) altitudes; furthermore, many end-of-life or failed spacecraft drift without control through portions of the GEO belt, creating a growing hazard to operational spacecraft.  Technologies for servicing of spacecraft with the expectation that such servicing would involve a mix of highly autonomous and remotely (i.e., ground-based) tele-operated robotic systems have been previously pursued.  The Phoenix program will build upon these legacy technologies, tackling the more complex GEO environment and expanding beyond pure traditional servicing functions.  The program will examine utilization of a new commercial ride-along system to GEO called Payload Orbital Delivery (POD) system, supporting hardware delivery for upgrading, repairing, assembling, and reconfiguring satellites.  In addition, the program will include a LEO flight experiment focused on satlets, modular building blocks for space systems, as a path of risk reduction for modular assembly on orbit.  The anticipated transition partners are the Air Force and the commercial spacecraft servicing providers.</r2:Description>

Technologies for servicing of GEO spacecraft would involve a mix of highly automated and remotely operated (from Earth) robotic systems.  The Robotic Servicing of Geostationary Satellites (RSGS) program, an outgrowth of the Phoenix program budgeted within this Project, seeks to establish the capability to acquire robotic services in GEO suitable for a variety of potential servicing tasks, in full collaboration and cooperation with existing satellite owners, and with sufficient propellant for several years of follow-on capability.  Key RSGS challenges include robotic tool/end effector requirements, efficient orbital maneuvering of a servicing vehicle, robotic arm systems, automation of certain spacecraft operations, and development of the infrastructure for coordinated control between the servicer and client spacecraft operations teams.  The anticipated transition is to a commercial partner who will provide the satellite to carry the robotic payload and who will operate the robotic servicer.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Space Surveillance Telescope (SST) program has developed and demonstrated an advanced ground-based optical system to enable detection and tracking of faint objects in space, while providing rapid, wide-area search capability.  A major goal of the SST program, to develop the technology for large curved focal surface array sensors to enable an innovative telescope design combining high detection sensitivity, short focal length, wide field of view, and rapid step-and-settle to provide orders of magnitude improvements in space surveillance has been achieved.  This capability enables ground-based detection of un-cued objects in deep space for purposes such as asteroid detection and space defense missions.  The initial program is transitioning to Air Force Space Command.

The SST Australia effort will provide a further operational demonstration of the SST at the Naval Communication Station Harold E. Holt near Exmouth, Western Australia.  Such a location presents a more operationally relevant demonstration, with a richer and more interesting population of SSA targets in geosynchronous orbit.  A demonstration in New Mexico will validate telescope performance comparable to the requirement in Australia.  In addition, the demonstration will generate data for analysis and fusion efforts, which will be used to further refine and evaluate data processing techniques, such as those developed under the data fusion effort.  This program will address technical challenges which may arise from an Australian site, including adaptations to a different telescope environment, and the logistical and communications challenges presented by a site significantly more remote than the current SST location.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Title>Airborne Launch Assist Space Access (ALASA)</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>The ALASA program seeks to make access to space more affordable by reducing the cost per launch to under one million dollars per flight for 100 lb payloads to low earth orbit.  In addition, the program seeks to improve the responsiveness of space access by reducing the interval from call-up to launch to a single day.  This enables rapid delivery of spacecraft in response to evolving situations, such as a humanitarian crisis or unexpected conflict, and is accomplished by developing rapid mission planning tools which streamline existing range processes, and automated flight safety systems which reduce reliance on expensive and fragile range infrastructure.  These tools enable the program's third goal: to escape the limitations of fixed launch sites by achieving a greater flexibility in the direction and location of launch.  Challenges include, but are not limited to: development of a high-energy, low cost monopropellant, development of alternatives to current range processes, and achieving a cost per flight of one million dollars, including range support costs, to deploy satellites on the order of one hundred pounds.  The anticipated transition partners are the Air Force and the emerging commercial space launch industry.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Optical Apertures Self-assembling in Space program seeks to demonstrate the feasibility of constructing large optical apertures in orbit from a number of smaller modular components that self-organize in space.  The program will demonstrate the technologies needed to assemble a large (>5m) and near-diffraction limited optical aperture from modular components that are launched as separate payloads.  The program will include a scalable zero-g demonstration of a functional optical system that maintains the precision and large-scale physical stability required, and utilizes at least one segmented optical surface.  This program will address technical challenges of precision mechanical assembly from modular components, multiple object rendezvous and coupling in space, and active surface measurement, compensation and control.  Modular construction in space is intrinsically more challenging than ground-based assembly in that there is not necessarily any measurement and support infrastructure and equipment available, such as interferometer test towers.  Therefore, the modular pieces and system design must include self-contained measurement and alignment capabilities to be employed after or during assembly.  The OASIS program will demonstrate the feasibility of assembling complex and highly precise structures in space which, in assembled form, are larger than the capacity of any existing or planned space launch vehicle.  This capability could enable a number of surveillance and communications instruments in orbit that are not possible today or in the near future under the current paradigm.  The anticipated transition partners are the Air Force, Navy and commercial sector.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Title>Space Domain Awareness (SDA)</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>The goal of the Space Domain Awareness (SDA) program is to develop and demonstrate an operational framework and responsive defense application to enhance the availability of vulnerable space-based resources.  Current space surveillance sensors cannot detect, track, or determine the future location and threat potential of small advanced technology spacecraft in deep space orbits, where a majority of DoD spacecraft are located.  Additionally, servicing missions to geosynchronous earth (GEO) orbits will require exquisite situational awareness, from ultra-high-accuracy debris tracking for mission assurance at GEO orbits to high resolution imaging of GEO spacecraft for service mission planning.

SDA will investigate revolutionary technologies in two areas: 1) advanced space surveillance sensors to better detect, track, and characterize space objects, with an emphasis on deep space objects, and 2) space surveillance data collection, data archival, and data processing/fusion to provide automated data synergy.  The resulting increase in space domain awareness will enhance overall space safety of flight, and allow space operators to make informed, timely decisions.  The SDA program will leverage data fusion and advanced algorithms developed under the Space Surveillance Telescope (SST) program, as well as seek to exploit new ground-breaking technologies across the electromagnetic spectrum and utilize already existing sensor technology in nontraditional or exotic ways, to bring advanced capabilities to the space domain.  SDA will demonstrate new approaches to collection of data utilizing a variety of collection modalities, ranging from fusion of observations from non-traditional sources, such as amateur astronomers, to evaluation of sparse aperture imaging techniques.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Advanced Electronics Technologies program element is budgeted in the Advanced Technology Development Budget Activity because it seeks to design and demonstrate state-of-the-art manufacturing and processing technologies for the production of various electronics and microelectronic devices, sensor systems, actuators and gear drives that have military applications and potential commercial utility.  Introduction of advanced product design capability and flexible, scalable manufacturing techniques will enable the commercial sector to rapidly and cost-effectively satisfy military requirements.

The MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS) and Integrated Microsystems Technology program is a broad, cross-disciplinary initiative to merge computation and power generation with sensing and actuation to realize a new technology for both perceiving and controlling weapons systems and battlefield environments.  Using fabrication processes and materials similar to those used to make microelectronic devices, MEMS applies the advantages of miniaturization, multiple components and integrated microelectronics to the design and construction of integrated electromechanical and electro-chemical-mechanical systems.  The MEMS program addresses issues ranging from the scaling of devices and physical forces to new organization and control strategies for distributed, high-density arrays of sensor and actuator elements.  These issues include microscale power and actuation systems as well as microscale components that survive harsh environments.  Thermal management technologies will develop heat resistant thermal layers to provide efficient operation for cooling electronic devices.

The Mixed Technology Integration project funds advanced development and demonstrations of selected basic and applied electronics research programs.  Examples of activities funded in this project include, but are not limited to:  (1) component programs that integrate mixed signal (analog and digital; photonic and electronic) or mixed substrate (Gallium Nitride, Gallium Arsenide, Indium Phosphide, or Silicon Germanium with CMOS) technology that will substantially improve the capability of existing components and/or reduce size, weight and power requirements to a level compatible with future warfighter requirements; (2) development and demonstration of brassboard system applications in such areas as laser weaponry or precision navigation and timing to address mid-term battlefield enhancements; and (3) novel technological combinations (i.e. photonics, magnetics, frequency attenuators) that could yield substantial improvement over current systems.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Title>Micro-Technology for Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (Micro PN&amp;T)</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>The Micro-Technology for Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (Micro-PNT) program is developing low-Cost, Size, Weight, and Power (CSWaP) inertial sensors and timing sources for navigation in GPS degraded environments, primarily focusing on the development of miniature solid state and atomic gyroscopes and clocks.  Both classes of sensors are currently unsuitable for small platform or dismount soldier applications.  Micro Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) sensors have limited performance but excellent CSWaP, while atomic sensors are capable of excellent performance but are limited to laboratory experiments due to complexity and high CSWaP.  Micro-PNT is advancing both technology approaches by improving the performance of MEMS inertial sensors and by miniaturizing atomic devices.  Ultimately, low-CSWaP inertial sensors and clocks will enable ubiquitous guidance and navigation on all platforms, including guided munitions, unmanned aerial vehicles (micro-UAVs), and mounted and dismounted soldiers.

Successful realization of Micro-PNT requires development of new microfabrication processes and novel material systems for fundamentally different sensing modalities, understanding of error sources at the micro-scale, and development of miniature inertial sensors based on atomic physics.  Innovative microfabrication techniques under development will allow co-fabrication of dissimilar devices on a single chip, such that clocks, gyroscopes, accelerometers, and calibration stages can be integrated into a small, low power architecture.  The program is developing miniature inertial sensors based on atomic interferometry and nuclear magnetic resonance.  Ancillary research efforts for this program are funded within PE 0602716E, Project ELT-01.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Endurance program will develop technology for pod- or internally-mounted lasers to protect a variety of airborne platforms from emerging and legacy electro-optical IR guided surface-to-air missiles.  The Endurance system will be a completely self-contained laser weapon system brassboard in an open architecture configuration.
 
The focus of the Endurance effort under MT-15 will be to develop and test integrated subsystems, such as a laser subsystem, a command subsystem, a threat missile warning subsystem, a target acquisition and tracking subsystem, a beam control and director subsystem, an energy storage and electrical power delivery subsystem, a thermal management subsystem a mechanical support framework, subsystem interfaces, and the design, integration, and testing of a form/fit/function brassboard laser countermeasure.  This program is an early application of technology developed in the Excalibur program and will transition via industry.  Applied research for this program is budgeted in PE 0602702E, Project TT-06.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The scaling of silicon (Si) transistors to ever smaller dimensions has led to dramatic gains in processor performance over the past fifty years. In parallel, integrated circuit (IC) designers for radio frequency (RF) circuits have leveraged the different material properties of compound semiconductor (CS) technologies such as indium phosphide (InP), gallium arsenide (GaAs), gallium nitride (GaN) and silicon-germanium (SiGe) to enable devices that operate at frequencies and powers difficult or impossible to achieve in Silicon.  Historically, a designer would have to decide between the high density of Si circuits or the high performance of CS materials.  Prior DARPA efforts have demonstrated the ability to  achieve near-ideal "mix-and-match" capability for DoD circuit designers with limited demonstrations of the heterogeneous integration of silicon and InP technologies that far exceeded what can be accomplished with one technology alone.  Specifically, the Compound Semiconductor Materials On Silicon (COSMOS) program enabled transistors of InP to be freely mixed with silicon complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) circuits to obtain the benefits of both technologies (very high speed and very high circuit complexity/density, respectively).  The Diverse &amp; Accessible Heterogeneous Integration (DAHI) effort will take this capability to the next level, ultimately offering the seamless co-integration of a variety of semiconductor devices (for example, GaN, InP, GaAs, antimonide based Compound Semiconductors), microelectromechanical (MEMS) sensors and actuators, photonic devices (e.g., lasers, photo-detectors) and thermal management structures.  This capability will revolutionize our ability to build true "systems on a chip" (SoCs) and allow dramatic size, weight and volume reductions while enabling higher performance such as power, bandwidth or dynamic range in our electronic systems for electronic warfare, communications and radar.  

This program has applied research efforts funded in PE 0602716E, Project ELT-01.  The Advanced Technology Development part of this program will leverage these complementary efforts to focus on the establishment of an accessible, manufacturable technology for device-level heterogeneous integration of a wide array of materials and devices (including, for example, multiple electronics and MEMS technologies) with complex silicon-enabled (e.g. CMOS) architectures on a common silicon substrate platform.  This part of the program is expected to culminate in accessible foundry processes of DAHI technology and demonstrations of advanced microsystems with innovative architectures and designs that leverage heterogeneous integration.  By the end of the program, this effort seeks to establish a technologically mature, sustainable DAHI foundry service to be made available (with appropriate computer-aided design support) to a wide variety of DoD laboratory, Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC), academic and industrial designers.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The goal of the FLASH program is to demonstrate a transportable, ultra-low size, weight, and power (SWaP), packaged laser system by coherently combining the outputs of an array of ultra-lightweight, flight-worthy high-power fiber lasers.  The packaged FLASH laser system will project a >30-kW-class beam with near perfect beam quality and very high electrical-to-optical efficiency.  The SWaP will be consistent with weight and volume densities needed to support the integration of laser weapons on a broad range of military platforms, including 4th and 5th generation aircraft and UAVs.  To accomplish these objectives, FLASH will: (1) greatly reduce the overall size and weight of packaged coherently-combinable high-power fiber laser amplifiers while greatly simplifying the demands they make on support systems such as cabling, cooling lines and support structures while increasing their efficiency and resistance to shock, vibration and acoustics; and (2) fabricate an array of these ultralight fiber-laser amplifiers and integrate them with advanced battery power, thermal management and coherent-beam combination sub-systems into a transportable, fully packaged, ultra-low SWaP laser system.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Title>Common Heterogeneous integration &amp; IP reuse Strategies (CHIPS)*</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>*Formerly Fast and Big Mixed-Signal Designs (FAB)

Developing capabilities to intermix and tightly integrate silicon processes which are currently supported at different scaling nodes and by different vendors is critical to increasing the capabilities of high-performance military microelectronics.  For example, Silicon-Germanium (SiGe) Bipolar Complementary Metal-oxide Semiconductor (BiCMOS) processes allow CMOS logic to be integrated with radio frequency (RF) heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBTs), which enables mixed-signal circuits having RF analog capabilities tightly coupled to digital processing.  However, the SiGe process flow was developed to integrate to a single CMOS technology node and significant design and engineering effort is required to retarget the flow for a new node.  Thus, BiCMOS processes tend to lag behind commercial CMOS by several generations.  CHIPS will investigate the potential for a truly process-agnostic integration technology, i.e., one that is inclusive of any current or future circuit fabrication technology such as Gallium Arsenide (GaAs), Gallium Nitride (GaN) and SiGe with a standardized interconnect topology.  Such a technology platform will enable the design of individual circuit Intellectual Property (IP) blocks, such as low-noise amplifiers and analog-to-digital converters, with a goal of re-use of the IP across applications.  Re-use will allow the DoD to amortize the upfront design cost of these blocks over several designs instead of leveling the burden on a single program.  Furthermore, the IP can be designed in the fabrication process best suited for the performance goals and evolve more quickly than larger, more expensive single chip systems-on-a-chip.  Through standardization of the interface, CHIPS will enable the DoD to leverage the advancements driven by the global semiconductor market rather than relying on a single on-shore foundry provider or on proprietary circuit designs owned by a handful of traditional prime performers.

In the Advanced Technology Development part of this program, focus will be placed on the development of rapid development and insertion of microsystems utilizing III-V semiconductors and other microelectronic technologies with advanced Si CMOS.

                                <r2:Title>Precise Robust Inertial Guidance for Munitions (PRIGM)</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>The DoD relies on GPS for ubiquitous and accurate positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT). With the increased prevalence of intentional GPS jamming, spoofing, and other GPS-denial threats, GPS access is increasingly unavailable in contested theaters and alternative sources of PNT are required.  In particular, guided munitions navigation is the most immediate and among the most demanding of GPS-denial challenges, due to the necessity of operating in highly contested theaters and the stringent requirements for minimization of cost, size, weight, and power consumption (CSWaP). The Precise Robust Inertial Guidance for Munitions (PRIGM) program will develop low-CSWaP inertial sensor technology for GPS-free munitions navigation.  PRIGM comprises two focus areas: 1) Development of a Navigation-Grade Inertial Measurement Unit (NGIMU) that transitions state-of-the-art MEMS to DoD platforms by 2020; and 2) Research and development of Advanced Inertial MEMS Sensors (AIMS) to achieve gun-hard, high-bandwidth, high dynamic range navigation requirements with the objective of complete autonomy in 2030.  PRIGM will advance state-of-the-art MEMS gyros from TRL-3 devices to a TRL-6 transition platform (complete IMU) that enables Service Labs to perform TRL-7 field demonstrations.  PRIGM will exploit recent advances in heterogeneous integration of photonics and CMOS and advanced MEMS technology to realize novel inertial sensors for application in extreme dynamic environments and beyond navigation-grade performance.

At present, DoD suffers a trade-space dichotomy between low-CSWaP tactical-grade IMUs, based on MEMS inertial sensors, and relatively high-CSWaP navigation-grade IMUs, based on ring-laser or interferometric fiber-optic gyroscopes (RLG/iFOG).  RLG/iFOG is the technology of choice for high-value platforms.  However, for the vast majority of platforms (munitions, dismounts, UAVs), CSWaP necessitates the use of lower-performance, MEMS-based IMUs.  Under the micro-PNT program, DARPA has developed MEMS gyroscopes with performance rivaling that of navigation-grade interferometric fiber optic gyros (IFOGs), thus exposing a new tradespace for low-CSWaP navigation grade IMUs.  The ultimate goal of the program is to develop a complete MEMS-based navigation-grade IMU with an identical mechanical/electronic interface to existing DoD-standard tactical-grade MEMS IMUs, thereby providing a drop-in replacement for existing DoD systems and rapid transition through early insertion demonstrations.

                                <r2:Description>The goal of the Direct SAMpling Digital ReceivER (DISARMER) program is to produce a hybrid photonic-electronic analog-to-digital converter (ADC) capable of coherently sampling the entire X-band (8-12 GigaHertz (GHz)).  Conventional electronic wideband receivers are limited in dynamic range by both the electronic mixer and the back-end digitizers.  By employing an ultra-stable optical clock, the DISARMER program will allow for mixer-less digitization and thereby improve the dynamic range 100x over the state of the art.  Such a wide-bandwidth, high-fidelity receiver will have applications in electronic warfare and signals intelligence systems with the potential to drastically reduce the cost, size and weight of these systems.

The DISARMER program will design, fabricate, and test a hybrid photonic-electronic ADC packaged in a standard form factor.  This involves the integration of electronic and photonic circuits, packaging of a mode-locked laser with ultralow jitter, and delivering a field programmable gate array with the necessary firmware to process the sampled data.

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Command, Control and Communications Systems program element is budgeted in the Advanced Technology Development Budget Activity because its purpose is to demonstrate and evaluate advanced information systems research and development concepts.

The goal of the Information Integration Systems project is to develop and demonstrate technologies that will provide effective communications to U.S. forces.  The success of military operations depends on timely, reliable, secure, and synchronized dissemination of command and control and relevant situational awareness information to every military echelon.  While wired communications and networks are fairly well developed, providing assured high-bandwidth mobile wireless capabilities that match or exceed commercial wired infrastructure is needed to meet the demands of military users.  Approaches to this goal include developing technologies in these areas:
-  High-Capacity Links technologies - enables greater back-haul capability.
-  Advanced Networking technologies - supports resilience, adaptability, and scalability.
-  Low Probability of Detection and Anti-Jam (LPD/AJ) technologies - provides assured communications in a very high-threat environments.
-  Novel Radio Frequency and Spectral Sensing (RF/SS) - supports efficient spectrum management in congested environments and detection of electromagnetic threats.

The Secure Information and Network Systems project developed and demonstrated computer and network technologies and systems suitable for use in military networks, U.S. government enterprise networks, critical infrastructure, and embedded computing systems.  The project developed, integrated, and tested technologies for re-using software components.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Title>100 Gb/s RF Backbone</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>The proliferation of video, voice, chat, and other important data-streams on the battlefield is driving a need for higher capacity, reliable, assured, and all-weather communications that are deployable on a wide range of air, ground, and maritime platforms.  The goal of this High-Capacity Links technologies program is to demonstrate a 100 Gigabit-per-second (Gb/s) radio frequency (RF) backbone that will meet the anticipated mid-term (within 3-10 years) wireless networking requirements of deployed military forces.  DARPA's hybrid Free Space Optical RF Communications Adjunct (ORCA) system has broken the 10 Gb/s wireless network boundary using free-space optical links, but all-weather Ku band components are currently limited to much less than 1Gb/s capacity.  Furthermore, the hybrid optical/RF system exhibits size, weight, and power (SWaP) consumption characteristics that preclude deployment on many SWaP-limited platforms.  Moving to a millimeter-wave (mmW) solution will provide high capacity and all-weather resiliency, but presents technical challenges that include the generation of higher-order waveforms (beyond common data link), efficient power transmission, high-speed routing, and low-noise receivers.  This program seeks to develop the constituent subsystems (waveform generation, efficient power amplifiers, and receivers) and spatial multiplexing architectures to construct an all-weather mmW 100 Gb/s backbone at half the SWaP consumption of the current ORCA system.  The 100 Gb/s RF Backbone program is intended for transition to multiple Services.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>Current Presidential Initiatives, FCC Broadband Task Force, and Congressional legislation are working to transition large swaths of spectrum (up to 500 MHz) from Federal (DoD is the primary contributor) to civilian use for broadband telecommunications.  The DoD will need more highly integrated and networked data/sensor capacity over the next decades and will therefore need new technology that requires less spectrum to operate.  The objective of the Spectrum Efficiency and Access program is to investigate improvements in spectral reuse, such as spectrum sharing of sensor/radar bands.  The program will leverage technical trends in cooperative sharing to exploit radar anti-jam and interference mitigation technologies that could enable spectrum sharing by allowing overlay of communications within the same spectral footprint.  The approach will include exploring real-time control data links between radars and communications systems, and developing the advanced waveforms and components to enable radars and communication networks to operate in close proximity.  The ultimate goal is to turn the DoD spectrum loss into a net gain of up to hundreds of MHz in capacity.  Technology from this program will be made available to the DoD.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Title>Advanced RF Mapping</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>One of the key advantages on the battlefield is the ability to actively sense and manipulate the radio frequency (RF) environment, enabling reliable and assured communications, as well as effectively mapping and manipulating the adversary's communications in ways that defy their situational awareness, understanding, or response.  Current approaches are emitter-based, with the signal processing techniques focused on array and time-based processing for each emitter.  As the RF environment becomes more complex and cluttered, the number of collection assets and the required level of signal processing inhibits our capability to pervasively sense and manipulate at the precision (time, frequency, and space) required for effective action.  To address these Radio Frequency and Spectral Sensing (RF/SS) challenges, the Advanced RF Mapping program will develop and demonstrate new concepts for sensing and manipulating the RF environment based on distributed rather than centralized collection.  This approach will take advantage of the proliferation of RF devices, such as radios and cell phones, on the battlefield.  To leverage these existing devices effectively, the program will develop new algorithms that can map the RF environment with minimal communication load between devices.  It will also develop approaches to exploit our precise knowledge of the RF environment and the distributed proximity of RF devices to provide reliable and assured communications for our warfighter as well as to infiltrate or negate our adversaries' communications networks.  Building upon technologies investigated within other programs within this project, the Advanced RF Mapping program will enable both offensive and defensive operations in complex RF environments.  Advanced RF Mapping technology is planned to transition to the Services.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>Building upon the technologies explored and developed under the Computational Leverage Against Surveillance Systems (CLASS) program budgeted in this PE/Project, the Communication in Contested Environments (C2E) program will seek to address communications problems anticipated in networked airborne systems in the mid-21st century.

Expected growth in sensor systems, unmanned systems, and internetworked weapons systems will strain the size of networks that our current communications technology can support in the contested environment.  As adversary capabilities advance, the DoD will need new techniques to quickly and efficiently accommodate better networking and improved communications capabilities, specifically communications systems with higher capacity, lower latency, greater jamming resistance, and reduced detectability.  As part of Advanced Networking technologies efforts, the C2E program addresses these needs with a three-pronged approach: first, to develop heterogeneous networking capabilities and advanced communication technology for airborne systems.  Low Probability of Detection (LPD), Anti-Jam (AJ), low latency, and high capacity communication protocols will be developed.  Second, to create a government controlled and maintained reference architecture for communications systems that draws from commercial communication architectures.  The defense contractor community can build specific communications systems based upon this reference architecture.  Finally, C2E will create a government controlled development environment to allow rapid refresh of communications technology and allow third party native application and waveform developers to contribute their own communications technologies.  Technologies from this program are planned to transition to the Services.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Communications Module - Millimeter-wave (COMMO-MMW) program will develop a compact, scalable, millimeter wave (mm-wave) active electronically scanned array (AESA) module to enable high-performance communications links. The module will focus on low cost connectivity of weapons platforms and systems. The cost will be reduced through exploitation of mass manufacturing techniques at the chip scale and a reduction in size of the system which will aid in retrofitting into existing platforms. The COMMO-MMW module will operate in the high frequency portion of the electromagnetic spectrum to take advantage of reduced competition for bandwidth compared to the increasingly congested bands at lower frequencies. By leveraging mass manufacturing processes to reduce module cost, and new advances in compound semiconductors to enhance system performance, the COMMO-MMW program will realize affordable mm-wave communications that can be made ubiquitous across the domains of modern warfare. Additionally, mm-wave operation offers the potential for extremely high data rate communications links that are intrinsically jam resistant and low probability of detection due to narrow beamwidths and atmospheric propagation characteristics at these frequencies. The lack of commercial component technology in the mm-wave band will further increase the military advantage gained by this capability. This program will develop the critical compound semiconductor devices and circuits for high performance, high power efficiency mm-wave front end electronics, and will apply 3-D and/or heterogeneous integration approaches to build a compact, scalable, mm-wave AESA module. COMMO-MMW not only will revolutionize Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) capability but also make it possible and affordable to retrofit existing military systems and extend high performance communications link capability to smaller platforms. Technologies developed under this program will transition to the Services and will provide the capability of "fiber-like" connectivity rates in infrastructure free environments.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>*Formerly Self-Optimizing Networks

Wireless networks have evolved into complex systems having many configurable parameters/features, including link data rates, power settings, inter-network gateways, and security associations.  The optimal settings for these features vary greatly depending on the mission for which the network is deployed and the environment in which it is operating.  Currently, the majority of these features are optimized off-line for specific scenarios and assumptions and are pre-set before use in a mission.  There is no capability for the settings to adapt if the actual mission or environment differs from the original assumptions used to configure the network.  The problem is exacerbated in scenarios in which intelligent adversaries can affect the topology and operation of the network unpredictably and on short timescales.  Furthermore, future operations will include multiple, different radios interconnected on the same platform, and those existing networks lack a common standard for interoperability.  The Dynamic Network Adaptation for Mission Optimization (DyNAMO) program will develop software that addresses the incompatibilities preventing information sharing across independent airborne networks and develop new approaches to configure and control networks and networks of networks for operation in dynamic and contested environments.  The program will address optimization within legacy and future military networks, interactions between networks, and availability of necessary network services to support mission success.  Technologies developed under this program will transition to the Services.</r2:Description>

Accomplishing this depends on providing reliable wireless communications to all U.S. forces, platforms, and devices in all phases of conflict.  Based on initial work under this effort, the Spectrum Efficiency and Access program in this PE/Project was created to enable reliable operation of military and commercial communications and radar systems when occupying the same spectrum bands.  As part of the Advanced Networks technologies effort, the Wireless Network Defense program increases wireless network capacity and reliability for tactical users, with the ultimate vision of making high quality data services pervasive throughout the DoD.  The primary focus is mitigation of advanced threats particular to the security of wireless networks.  The program intends to leverage the capabilities of the dynamic network to identify sources of misinformation, whether malicious or due to poor configuration, across the functional components of the complex system, and mitigate the corresponding effects.

                                <r2:Description>Commercial Test and Measurement equipment has advanced greatly with the emergence of sophisticated cellular and wireless local area network technology and can be used to intercept, analyze, and exploit our military communications signals.  The Computational Leverage Against Surveillance Systems (CLASS) program worked to expand Low Probability of Detection/Anti-Jam (LPD)/(AJ) technologies, sought new ways to protect our signals from exploitation by increasingly sophisticated adversaries in ways that can be maintained as commercial technology advances.  Three different techniques were developed: 1) Waveform Complexity uses advanced communications waveforms that are difficult to recover without knowledge and understanding of the signals itself; 2) Spatial Diversity uses distributed communications devices and the communication environment to disguise and dynamically vary the apparent location of the signal; and 3) Interference Exploitation makes use of the clutter in the signal environment to make it difficult for an adversary to isolate a particular signal.  The program's objective was to make modular communications technology that was inexpensive to incorporate in existing and emerging radio systems (&lt; $100 incremental cost) but pushed adversaries to need more than 1,000x our processing power - supercomputer-level processing power.  Another track of the program extended the CLASS technology to provide LPD communications.  These techniques drastically reduced the detectability of communications signals beyond current capabilities.  Scalable performance allowed LPD techniques to better trade information rate for communications capacity.  Technologies from this program will transition to the Services.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>Communications requirements have grown exponentially due to the proliferation of high-data rate sensors (full motion video), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), and the emergence of the Soldier/Marine as both an operator and a sensor within military networks.  However, limited spectrum availability results in a large disparity between capacity requirement and availability.  Supporting the development of Advanced Networks technologies, Mobile Hotspots developed an airborne high capacity data distribution network to interconnect groups of tactical users in a manner conceptually similar to the commercial tiered approach of interconnecting cell towers and wireless hotspots.  Mobile Hotspots exploited advances in millimeter-wave technology and airborne networking to develop a self-organizing, 1 Gb/s mobile tactical airborne network formed from highly-directional communications links to interconnect mounted and dismounted warfighters, dispersed tactical operations centers, and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) assets.  Low size, weight, and power (SWaP) designs were integrated with commercial and military communications equipment and mounted on tactical UAVs and ground vehicles to provide network access to mobile users via infrastructure-less hotspots compatible with existing radios.  The Mobile Hotspots program will transition to the Army and Marine Corps Expeditionary Forces.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Rapid Software Development using Binary Components (RAPID) program developed a system to identify and extract software components for reuse in new applications.  The DoD has critical applications that must be ported to future operating systems.  In many cases, the application source code is no longer available requiring these applications to continue to run on unsecure and outdated operating systems, impacting operations.  A companion applied research effort was budgeted in PE 0602303E, Project IT-03.  RAPID capabilities are transitioning to the Services.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Network-Centric Warfare Technology program element is budgeted in the Advanced Technology Development budget activity because it addresses high payoff opportunities to develop and rapidly mature advanced technologies and systems required for today's network-centric warfare concepts.  It is imperative for the future of the U.S. forces to operate flawlessly with each other, regardless of which services and systems are involved in any particular mission.  The overarching goal of this program element is to enable technologies at all levels, regardless of service component, to operate as one system.

The objective of the Joint Warfare Systems project is to create enabling technologies for seamless joint operations, from strategic planning to tactical and urban operations.  Joint Warfare Systems leverage current and emerging network, robotic, and information technology and provide next generation U.S. forces with greatly expanded capability, lethality, and rapid responsiveness.  Critical issues facing this project are:  (1) U.S. opponents utilizing systems that are flexible, robust, and difficult to neutralize; and (2) U.S. doctrine that limits the use of firepower to lessen the impact of operations on noncombatants.  These problems are magnified in urban and semi-urban areas where combatants and civilians are often collocated, and in peacekeeping operations where combatants and civilians are often indistinguishable.  Meeting these challenges places a heavy burden on joint war planning.  Understanding opponent networks is essential so that creative options can be developed to counter their strategies.  Synchronization of air and ground operations to apply force only where needed and with specific effects is required.  

The Maritime Systems project will identify, develop and rapidly mature critical advanced technologies and system concepts for the naval forces' role in today's network centric warfare concept.  Improvements in communications between and among submarines, surface ships and naval aircraft have allowed these forces to operate seamlessly with each other and with other Service's network centric systems.  Naval forces will play an ever-increasing role in network centric warfare because of their forward deployed nature, their unique capability to operate simultaneously in the air, on the sea and under the sea and their versatile ability to provide both rapid strike and project-sustained force.  The technologies developed under this project will capitalize on these attributes, improve them and enable them to operate with other network centric forces.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The objective of the Joint Warfare Systems project is to create enabling technologies for seamless joint operations, from strategic planning to tactical and urban operations.  Joint Warfare Systems leverage current and emerging network, robotic, and information technology and provide next generation U.S. forces with greatly increased capability, lethality, and rapid responsiveness.  Critical issues facing this project are: (1) U.S. opponents using systems that are flexible, robust, and difficult to neutralize; and (2) U.S. doctrine that limits the use of firepower to lessen the impact of operations on noncombatants.  These problems are magnified in urban and semi-urban areas where combatants and civilians are often co-located and in peacekeeping operations where combatants and civilians are often indistinguishable.  Meeting these challenges places a heavy burden on joint war planning.  Understanding opponent networks is essential so that creative options can be developed to counter their strategies.  Synchronization of air and ground operations to apply force only where needed and with specific effects is required.  This project supports all levels of the force structure including: (1) the strategic/operational level by generating targeting options against opponents' centers of gravity that have complex networked relationships; (2) the tactical/operational level by managing highly automated forces with tight coupling between air and ground platforms; and (3) the focused tactical level by developing platforms and tools, which acquire targets of opportunity and cue network-based analysis of likely enemy operations thus maximizing the effectiveness of ground forces in stability and support operations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The System of Systems Integration Technology and Experimentation (SoSite) program seeks to implement an architecture framework capable of assessing and demonstrating potential operational benefits of integrating various system capabilities to improve mission success in contested environments.  Such assessments would optimize system-level trades of requirements and architectures to properly leverage an integrated set of system characteristics and capabilities.  The demonstration assessment metrics will measure individual and combined system performance to further streamline resource allocation to maximize operational impact.  In addition, providing a modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) environment to assess complex systems will enable greater utility of emerging system technologies, since they can be assessed in near-real-world simulations without the real-world costs of testing fully integrated systems.  The program will also develop system synthesis and integration technologies that enable rapid assimilation of new and off-the-shelf technologies into the system of systems architecture.  These technologies will break down current barriers to entry that new technologies face in system of systems using formal methods, compositional reasoning, and automated design space exploration.  Technologies from this program will be transitioned to the Services.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>Currently, Command and Control (C2) of air platforms is a highly centralized process operating largely independently across planning domains (intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), strike, and spectrum management) and is optimized for a permissive environment.  To address the challenges faced in today's increasingly contested environments, the Resilient Synchronized Planning and Assessment for the Contested Environment (RSPACE) program will develop tools to enable distribution of planning functions across the C2 hierarchy for resilience (e.g., loss of communications) while synchronizing strike, ISR, and spectrum planning to maximize the contribution of all assets through increased utilization and exploitation of synergies.  The program will develop tools supporting a mixed initiative planning approach, maximizing automation according to operator's choice, and enabling human-in-the-loop intervention and modification.  During execution, the tools will provide lifecycle tracking of targeting and information needs and support assessment of progress towards achieving the commander's intent.  The tools will dynamically respond as directed to ad hoc requests and significant plan deviations via a real-time dynamic replanning capability, and easily adapt to technology refreshes.  The RSPACE tools will transition to the Air Force and the Navy.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Title>Retrodirective Arrays for Coherent Transmission (ReACT)</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>Worldwide advancements in signal processing and electronics have decreased the effectiveness of single-platform, power-based Electronic Warfare (EW) as a viable technique in the future.  The goal of the Retrodirective Arrays for Coherent Transmission (ReACT) program is to develop and to demonstrate the capability to combine distributed mobile transmitters to provide high-power spatially resolved EW beams at frequencies utilized by adversary communications and radars.  ReACT will achieve this capability by synchronizing multiple distributed transmitters to form a much larger effective array than a single platform could support.  The key technical challenge is to synchronize distributed and moving transmitters while compensating for platform motion and vibration.  Further, the ReACT system must sense the target's emissions and then optimally configure the ReACT transmitters to focus on the area to be jammed, as well as the minimum power required to sufficiently jam the target.  The ReACT program builds upon technology developed under the Arrays at Commercial Timescales (ACT) program, which is budgeted in PE 0602716E, Project ELT-01, and will culminate with a flight demonstration of distributed EW beamforming.  The ReACT technology is planned to transition to the Air Force and Navy.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The goal of the High Energy Liquid Laser Area Defense System (HELLADS) program was to develop a high-energy laser weapon system that provides an order of magnitude reduction in weight compared to previous laser systems.  HELLADS enabled high-energy lasers (HELs) to be integrated onto tactical aircraft and significantly increased engagement ranges compared to ground-based systems, in addition to enabling high precision/low collateral damage and rapid engagement of fleeting targets for both offensive and defensive missions.  Advancements in beam control and other subsystems that are required for the practical integration of a laser weapon into existing tactical platforms were explored.  With the assistance of the Services, the HELLADS program pursued the necessary analysis, coordination, and design activity for a prototype laser weapon system incorporating the HELLADS laser system and the ABC turret into air-, ground-, or sea-based tactical vehicles.  The HELLADS 150 kilowatt (kW) class laser will transition to the Air Force.  Additional technologies developed under this program will transition to the Services.</r2:Description>

Program thrusts were centered on a progressive regimen of physical problem solving, real-time team oriented tasks, and dynamic adaptation designed to build "machine trust", especially when integrated with humans in a variety of operational environments.  The Robotics Challenge program consisted of a series of obstacle course style challenge events that focused on technology solutions to demonstrate and test robot capabilities for disaster response.  The program drove advances in power systems, agility and speed, precision in perception tied to platform coordination, dexterity, and impulsive power.  Program objectives focused on technologies to expand mobility and extend endurance of unmanned platforms, advanced tactile and manipulation capabilities, and tools for cost effective design, validation, and construction of autonomous technology, and human-robot interaction. The 6.2 portion of this program was budgeted in PE 0602702E, Project TT-04. Anticipated Service users include the Army, Marines, and Special Forces.</r2:Description>

Improvements in communications between and among submarines, surface ships, and naval aircraft have allowed these forces to operate seamlessly with each other and with other Service's network centric systems.  Naval forces will play an ever-increasing role in network centric warfare because of their forward deployed nature, their unique capability to operate simultaneously in the air, on the sea and under the sea, and their versatile ability to provide both rapid strike and project sustained force.  The technologies developed under this project will capitalize on these attributes, improve them, and enable them to operate with other network centric forces.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The Hydra program will develop and demonstrate advanced capabilities for the undersea deployment and employment of unique payloads.  Hydra integrates existing and emerging technologies and the ability to be positioned in the littoral undersea battlespace to create a disruptive capability.  The system consists of a modular enclosure with communications, command and control, energy storage, and standard interfaces for payload systems.  The modular enclosures are deployed by various means, depending on the need for speed and stealth, and remain deployed until awakened for employment.  Hydra will develop critical enabling technologies for energy storage and recharging, communications, command and control, deployment, and autonomous operations. Technologies from this program will transition to the Navy.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The goal of the Hybrid Multi Material Rotor Full Scale Demonstration (HyDem) program is to dramatically improve U.S. Navy submarine superiority.  HyDem will apply breakthroughs in materials and material system technologies, and multi-disciplinary design methods to a Virginia Class Submarine propulsor, a critical component in submarine performance.  The U.S. Navy's ability to operate their submarine fleet with improved capability allows for the creation of strategic surprise.  Submarines could exploit expanded areas which were previously unattainable for the purpose of submarine warfare, including antisubmarine warfare (ASW), antisurface warfare (ASuW), intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) gathering, strike, Special Forces operations, and strategic deterrence missions.  The HyDem program will design, manufacture, and supply the Navy with a novel component for integration into a new construction Virginia Class Submarine.  The Navy will evaluate this component in sea trials.  It is envisioned that the Navy will integrate this design change into the future development of the Virginia Class and Ohio Replacement Submarines, and back-fit previously constructed Virginia Class Submarines.  This program will transition to the Navy.</r2:Description>

This connectivity is important for synchronizing forces, establishing and maintaining situation awareness, and control of remotely operated vehicles and systems.  Additionally, undersea systems are challenged to maintain connectivity and must carry their own energy and operate over their design lifetime with little to no maintenance and repair.  These factors inhibit their use in collaborative networks and prevent the full exploitation of the potential of undersea systems.  By leveraging techniques explored under the Distributed Agile Submarine Hunting (DASH) program budgeted within this PE/Project, the Tactical Undersea Network Architecture program will overcome these limitations by developing the technologies necessary for autonomous, reliable, and secure undersea data transfers; true plug, play, and operating standards; and rapid, cost effective deployment technologies. The program will develop and demonstrate novel technology options and designs to temporarily restore connectivity for existing tactical data networks in contested environments using small diameter optical fiber and buoy relay nodes.  The program will focus on innovative system architecture designs, lightweight optical fiber technologies, and rapidly deployable buoy node designs and component technologies.  The Tactical Undersea Network Architecture program will emphasize early risk reduction with future scaled at-sea integrated demonstrations of increasing complexity.  Program technologies will transition to the Navy.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Title>Blue Wolf</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>Undersea platforms have inherent operational and tactical advantages such as stealth and surprise.  Platform drag due to fluid viscosity and platform powering requirements varies with the speed through the water.  Platform energy and power density limitations create two distinct operational usage profiles: one for unmanned undersea vehicles (low speed, long endurance) and another for undersea weapons (high speed, short endurance).  Designers have historically solved this with hybrid systems such as the Navy's Vertical Launch Anti-Submarine Rocket, or by increasing the size of undersea systems.  However, hybrid systems can be vulnerable to air and undersea defensive systems and larger undersea systems can result in significant launch platform modifications. The Blue Wolf program seeks to provide a radically different solution to develop and demonstrate an undersea demonstrator vehicle with endurance and speed capabilities beyond conventional undersea systems within the weight and volume envelopes of current Navy undersea systems.  Significant technical challenges to be addressed include: dynamic lift and drag reduction; hybrid energy system development compatible with existing manned platform safety requirements and certification; and system integration and demonstration in at-sea environment.  The program will leverage Navy connectivity, autonomy, guidance, navigation, and obstacle avoidance technologies and culminate in a series of at-sea demonstrations and transition to the Navy.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Title>Positioning System for Deep Ocean Navigation (POSYDON)*</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>*Formerly Long-Range Undersea Navigation

The Positioning System for Deep Ocean Navigation (POSYDON) program will provide continuous, Global Positioning System (GPS)-level positioning accuracy to submarines and autonomous undersea vehicles (AUVs) in ocean basins over extended periods of time.  Undersea navigation cannot use GPS because the water blocks its signals.  At shallower depths, masts can be raised to receive GPS signals, but masts present a detection risk.  Typically, the alternative to GPS for undersea navigation has been inertial navigation systems (INS), but INS accuracy can degrade unacceptably over time.  Building upon concepts explored under the Distributed Agile Submarine Hunting (DASH) program, budgeted within this PE/Project, and the Upward Falling Payloads program, PE 0602702E, Project TT-03, the POSYDON program will distribute a small number of acoustic sources, analogous to GPS satellites, around the ocean basin.  A submarine or AUV will be equipped with an acoustic receiver and appropriate software in order to obtain, maintain, and re-acquire, if lost, an initial location.  By transmitting specific acoustic waveforms and developing accurate acoustic propagation models to predict and interpret the complex arrival structure of the acoustic sources, the submarine or AUV can determine its range from each source and thus triangulate its position.  Technologies developed under this program will transition to the Navy.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Mobile Offboard Command, Control and Attack (MOCCA) program seeks to counter the fourth generation submarine signature quieting technology that has significantly degraded passive anti-submarine warfare (ASW) sonar detection range and targeting performance.  The MOCCA program will build on lessons learned under the Distributed Agile Submarine Hunting (DASH) program, budgeted within this PE/Project, to nullify submarine signature reduction trends with active sonar projectors deployed from a mobile unmanned undersea vehicle (UUV) and cooperatively processed with onboard submarine acoustic receive sonar systems.  The off-board UUV sonar projector will operate, under positive control, at a significant distance from the cooperative submarine using communication links.

The program seeks to achieve breakthrough capability for long-range submarine detection and precision target tracking.  The program will develop compact, high output acoustic transducers, novel low probability of intercept/low probability of detection (LPI/LPD) communication signaling, and high energy density sub-systems compatible with deployable UUV packaging constraints.  In addition, the MOCCA system will be integrated into submarine onboard sonar and weapons control systems.  This program will transition to the Navy.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Cross Domain Maritime Surveillance and Targeting (CDMaST) program seeks to identify and implement architectures consisting of novel combinations of manned and unmanned systems to execute long-range kill chains against submarines and ships over large contested maritime areas.  By exploiting promising new developments in unmanned platforms, seafloor systems, and emerging long-range weapon systems, the program will develop an advanced, integrated undersea and above sea warfighting capability.  Building upon research conducted under the System of Systems Integration Technology and Experimentation (SoSite) program (budgeted in PE 0603766E, Project NET-01), the Cross Domain Maritime Surveillance and Targeting (CDMaST)program will establish an analytical and experimental environment to explore architecture combinations in terms of operational effectiveness as well as engineering feasibility and robustness.  The program will leverage enabling technologies needed for command, control, and communication (C3) between physical domains in order to support the architecture constructs.  Through experimentation, the program will not only demonstrate integrated system performance, but also develop new tactics that capitalize on features created by the heterogeneous architecture.  The Cross Domain Maritime Surveillance and Targeting (CDMaST) program will invest in technologies that will reduce cost, manage complexity, and improve reliability.  Technologies from this program will transition to the Navy.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The diesel-electric submarine is an asymmetric threat in terms of its cost and consequential growth in numbers relative to our legacy maritime platforms.  In addition, these submarines have trended toward lower acoustic signature levels and have grown in lethality.  The Distributed Agile Submarine Hunting (DASH) program intends to reverse the asymmetric advantage of this threat through the development of advanced standoff sensing from unmanned systems.  Deep-ocean sonar nodes will be developed to operate at significant depths in open ocean areas to achieve large fields of view to detect submarines overhead.  Each deep node is the maritime equivalent of a satellite, and is referred to as a subullite.  The significant field of view, along with the advantage of low-noise phenomena at extreme depths, will permit a scalable number of collaborative sensor platforms to detect and track submarines over large areas.  At-sea demonstrations have shown that the detection capability is achievable.  The program will continue to develop prototype systems that will evolve through additional at-sea testing.  These tests will demonstrate the ability to integrate into the Navy's undersea systems responsible for anti-submarine warfare (ASW).  The program seeks to achieve breakthrough technology for long-range detection and classification, communications, energy management, sensor and platform integration, and robust semiautonomous processing and control for distributed sensing platforms.

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Sensor Technology program element is budgeted in the Advanced Technology Development Budget Activity because it funds sensor efforts that will improve the accuracy and timeliness of our surveillance and targeting systems for improved battlefield awareness, strike capability and battle damage assessment.  

The Surveillance and Countermeasures Technology project will improve the accuracy and timeliness of our surveillance and targeting systems for improved battlefield awareness, strike capability, and battle damage assessment.  Timely surveillance of enemy territory under all weather conditions is critical to providing our forces with the tactical information needed to succeed in future wars.  This operational surveillance capability must continue to perform during enemy efforts to deny and deceive the sensor systems, and operate, at times, in a clandestine manner.  This project will exploit recent advances in multispectral target phenomenology, signal processing, low-power high-performance computing, and low-cost microelectronics to develop advanced surveillance and targeting systems.  In addition, this project encompasses several advanced technologies related to the development of techniques to counter advanced battlefield threats.

The Sensors and Processing Systems project develops and demonstrates the advanced sensor processing technologies and systems necessary for intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) missions.  The project is primarily driven by four needs:   1) providing day-night ISR capabilities against the entire range of potential targets; 2) countering camouflage, concealment, and deception of mobile ground targets; 3) detecting and identifying objects of interest/targets across wide geographic areas in near-real-time; and 4) enabling reliable identification, precision fire control tracking, timely engagement, and accurate battle damage assessment of ground targets.

The Exploitation Systems project develops algorithms, software, and information processing systems to extract information from massive intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) datasets.  In particular, it develops new technologies for detection and discrimination of targets from clutter, classification and fingerprinting of high value targets, localization and tracking over wide areas, and threat network identification and analysis.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>*Formerly Multi-Function Optical Sensing (MOS)

The proliferation of radio frequency (RF)-based countermeasures, such as digital radio frequency memory (DRFM), has presented challenges to the effectiveness of data sensors.  The Multi-Optical Sensing (MOS) program will enable an alternative approach to detecting, tracking, and performing non-cooperative target identification, as well as providing fire control for fighter class and long-range strike aircraft.  This program leverages emerging high-sensitivity focal plane array (FPA) and compact, multiband laser systems technology in the near/mid/long-wave infrared bands to enable the development of a multi-optical sensing system.  Technical challenges include the demonstration of inexpensive, multiband, large-format, photon-counting, high-bandwidth receivers and their integration into a multi-optical sensor suite compatible with airborne assets.  The MOS program seeks to advance the state of the art of components and technology to support an all-optical airborne system that can detect, geolocate, and identify targets at standoff ranges.  Technologies from this program will transition to the Services.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Title>Adaptable Navigation Systems (ANS)</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>The Adaptable Navigation Systems (ANS) program provided the U.S. warfighter with the ability to effectively navigate challenging environments including when Global Positioning System (GPS) is unavailable due to hostile action (jamming) or blockage by structures, foliage, or other environmental obstacles.  The ANS approach relied on three major technology innovations.  The first was the development of a new type of inertial measurement unit (IMU) that required fewer GPS position fixes.  Using cold atom technology, this IMU exceeds the performance of strategic-grade IMUs, with comparable size, weight, and power (SWaP).  The second innovation used Signals of Opportunity (SoOp) from a variety of ground-, air-, and space-based sources, as well as natural SoOps to reduce dependency on GPS position fixes. The third technology innovation allowed SoOp-based position information to be combined with inertial and other sensors to enable flexible navigation systems that can be reconfigured in the field to support any platform or environment.  This capability enhanced new advanced component technology for positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) emerging from other programs in the form of Micro Electro-Mechanical System devices, clocks, and new aiding sensors.  Recent advances in mathematics, data abstraction, and network architectures built upon these capabilities by enabling "plug-and-play" integration of both existing and future navigation components and processing to allow real-time reconfiguration of navigation systems.  Major improvements in navigation accuracy and system cost were also realized.  Potential transition partners include all Services, with emphasis on platforms and users that must operate in multiple environments, such as Naval forces.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The objective of the Adaptable, Low Cost Sensors (ADAPT) program was to leverage commercial technology and manufacturing techniques to improve the development time and significantly reduce the cost of sensors and sensor systems.  Currently, military sensors are designed and developed with unique, mission-specific hardware and software capability requirements in a single, fully integrated device.  This approach significantly increases both the cost and difficulty of meeting continuously changing requirements and upgrades.  Commercial processes, such as those used in the smart phone industry, create reference designs for common system functions and features to accelerate system development time.  This makes changing requirements and completing upgrades far simpler.  Adopting these commercial processes enables a mission-independent, designed-to-cost "commercial smart core" that can be combined with an appliqué of mission-specific hardware to provide low-cost, independently upgradable, and previously infeasible sensor system distribution capabilities.  The ADAPT Smart Munitions effort has applied ADAPT's sensing, processing, communications, and location capabilities to provide positive identification and man-in-the-loop control of distributed, unattended ground sensor systems.  It also developed a reference design to demonstrate capability and develop tactics for unattended sensors.  This program will transition to the Army and Navy.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Sensors and Processing Systems project develops and demonstrates the advanced sensor and processing technologies and systems necessary for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions.  Future battlefields will continue to be populated with targets that use mobility and concealment as key survival tactics, and high-value targets will range from specific individual insurgents and vehicles to groups of individuals and large platforms such as mobile missile launchers and artillery.  The Sensors and Processing Systems Project is primarily driven by four needs: (a) providing day-night ISR capabilities against the entire range of potential targets; (b) countering camouflage, concealment, and deception of mobile ground targets; (c) detecting and identifying objects of interest/targets across wide geographic areas in near-real-time; and (d) enabling reliable identification, precision fire control tracking, timely engagement, and accurate battle damage assessment of ground targets.  The Sensors and Processing Systems Project develops and demonstrates technologies and system concepts that combine novel approaches to sensing with emerging sensor technologies and advanced sensor and image processing algorithms, software, and hardware to enable comprehensive knowledge of the battlespace and detection, identification, tracking, engagement, and battle damage assessment for high-value targets in all weather conditions and combat environments.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The goal of the Adaptive Radar Countermeasures (ARC) program is to provide effective electronic countermeasure (ECM) techniques against new or unknown threat radars.  Current airborne electronic warfare (EW) systems rely on the ability to uniquely identify a threat radar system to apply an appropriate preprogrammed countermeasure technique which can take many months to develop.  Countering radar systems is increasingly challenging as digitally programmed radars exhibit novel behaviors and agile waveform characteristics.  ARC will develop new processing techniques and algorithms that adapt in real-time to generate suitable countermeasures.  Using techniques such as state modeling, machine learning, and system probing, ARC will learn the behavior of the threat system, then choose and implement an appropriate countermeasure strategy.  The program is planned for transition to Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps airborne EW systems.</r2:Description>

Key attributes of this program are global availability; minimal and low cost infrastructure; anti-jamming capability; and performance equal to or better than GPS through recent advances in optical clocks and time transfer.

                                <r2:Description>Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) systems provide the capability to detect, identify, and track high value targets from collected sensor data.  Current ATRs are typically designed for specific sensors and static due to pre-programmed target lists and operating mode, limiting mission execution capabilities.  Extending ATR Technology to accommodate sensor upgrades or include new emerging targets can be costly and time consuming.  The objective of the ATR Technology program is to develop technologies that reduce operation limitations while also providing significant performance improvements, dramatically reduced development times, and reduced life cycle maintenance costs.  Recent breakthroughs in deep learning, sparse representations, manifold learning, and embedded systems offer promise for dramatic improvements in ATR Technology.  The program will focus on three core areas: (1) development of on-line adaptive algorithms that enable performance-driven sensing and ATR technology; (2) recognition technology that enables rapid incorporation of new targets; and (3) technologies that dramatically reduce required data rates, processing times, and the overall hardware and software footprint of ATR systems.  ATR technology developed under the program is planned for transition to the Services.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Advanced Scanning Technology for Imaging Radars (ASTIR) program will provide immediate benefit to applications that are constrained by power, weight, and the complexity limits of production.  The goal of this program, building on technologies developed under the Multifunction RF (MFRF) program which is budgeted in this PE/Project, is to demonstrate a new imaging radar architecture using an electronically scanned sub-reflector to produce a more readily available, cost-effective sensor solution that does not require platform or target motion.  Key system attributes will: (1) provide high-resolution 3D imaging for enhanced identification and targeting, independent of platform or target motion; (2) produce video frame rates to provide well-focused images even when there is platform or target motion; (3) beam steer with a single transmit/receive chain to reduce system complexity resulting in lower cost, power, and weight; and (4) integrate millimeter-wave (mmW)/terahertz (THz) electronic component advancements from other DARPA programs for transmit and receive functions.  The completion of this program will result in a more readily available, cost-effective imaging radar technology that will work in concert with a wide area surveillance system to provide target identification at video frame rates in all conditions where existing sensors will not work.  Candidate military applications include efficient terminal seekers, imaging systems for defense of shipping in ports and littoral environments, base perimeter monitoring, and screening of personnel passing through access control points.  This technology is intended to transition to Special Operations Command and the Navy.</r2:Description>

Small satellites provide a low-cost and quick-turnaround capability for testing new technologies and experimental payloads.  Operationally, small and low-cost satellites enable the deployment of larger constellations which can provide greater coverage, persistence, and survivability compared to a small number of more expensive satellites, as well as the possibility for launch-on-demand.  This program seeks to leverage rapid progress being made by the commercial sector on small satellite bus technology, as well as investments being made by DoD and industry on low-cost launch and launch-on-demand capabilities for small satellites.

                                <r2:Description>*Formerly Low Cost Seeker

The Seeker Cost Transformation (SECTR) program will develop novel weapon terminal sensing and guidance technologies and systems, for air-launched and air-delivered weapons, that can: (1) find and acquire fixed and moving targets with only minimal external support; (2) achieve high navigation accuracy in a GPS-denied environment; and (3) have very small size and weight, and potentially low cost.  The development objectives are technologies and systems with small size, weight and power (SWaP), low recurring cost, applicability to a wide range of weapons and missions such as small unit operations, suppression of enemy air defenses, precision strike, and time-sensitive targets.  The technical approach for the sensing/processing hardware is to use both passive electro-optical infrared (EO/IR) sensors, which have evolved into very small and inexpensive devices in the commercial market, and a reconfigurable processing architecture, such as the architecture developed in DARPA's ADAPT program (budgeted in PE 0603767E, Project SEN-01).  The program will also develop a Government-owned open architecture for the seeker with standardized interfaces between components (both hardware and software).  The technical approach to target recognition will start from "deep learning" and 2D/3D machine vision algorithms pioneered for facial recognition and the identification of critical image features.  Technologies developed under this program will transition to the Services.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The goal of the Unbanded SPectrum operatIoNs (U-SPIN) program is to develop technologies which enable interoperability of multiple spectrum objectives simultaneously.  Currently, U.S. forces divide the RF spectrum into "bands" to deconflict specific functions which are considered incompatible with one another (for example, communications, electronic warfare, signals intelligence, and RADAR).  This approach relies on a static RF environment and accurate intelligence about the opposing force's spectrum capabilities and allocations. It also enables the enemy to accurately predict where and what our spectrum functions will be.  U-SPIN will demonstrate the ability to dynamically co-design the previously incompatible functions on-the-fly using learned knowledge about the RF environment.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>Dominance of the RF spectrum is critical to successful U.S. military operations. Radar systems, electronic warfare (EW) systems, and communication systems require custom software and hardware that is costly and time consuming to build and integrate onto platforms.  Expanding on ideas developed under the Multifunction RF program, also in this PE, the Dynamically Composed RF Systems program addresses these challenges by developing adaptive, converged RF array systems.  This enables enhanced operational capability by dynamically adapting the system for tasks to support radar, communications, and EW in a converged manner.  This program will design and develop: (1) a modular architecture for collaborative, agile RF systems; (2) advanced techniques for RF apertures and their associated airframe integration; (3) wide-band agile electronics to support converged missions over those apertures; and (4) software tools for the control, coordination, and scheduling of RF functions and payloads at the element level to maximize overall task performance.  This capability can be adapted to address diverse missions.   Technology developed under this program will transition to the Services.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Multifunction RF (MFRF) program goal is to enable U.S. rotary wing aircraft forces to fight effectively in all forms of severely Degraded Visual Environments (DVE) when our adversaries cannot.  The program goes beyond landing aids in DVE to address all elements of combat to include landing, takeoff, hover/taxi, enroute navigation, lethality, and survivability.  Building on previous RF sensors advancements, the program will seek to eliminate many redundant RF elements of current independently developed situational and combat support systems to provide multifunction capability with flexibility of adding new mission functions.  This will reduce the overall size, weight, power, and cost (SWaP-C) of subsystems and protrusive exterior antennas on military aircraft, enabling greater mission capability with reduced vehicle system integration burden.  The program approach includes: (1) development of synthetic vision for pilots that fuses sensor data with high-resolution terrain databases; (2) development of Advanced Rotary Multifunction Sensor (ARMS), utilizing silicon-based tile arrays, for agile electronically scanning technology at low SWAP-C; and (3) implementation of software development kit to re-define modes as required by mission or platform needs, and ease of adding new modes via software without hardware modifications.  The program is planned for transition to the Army and Marines.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>Recent conflicts have demonstrated the need for close air support by precision attack platforms such as the AC-130J aircraft in support of ground forces.  Under clear conditions, targets are easily identified and engaged quite effectively, but in degraded environments, the atmosphere can inhibit traditional optical sensors.  The AC-130J must fly above cloud decks in order to avoid anti-aircraft fire, negating optical targeting sensors.  Similarly, rotary/wing blades in urban operations generate copious amounts of dust that prevent circling assets from supplying cover fire for ground forces.  The Video-rate Synthetic Aperture Radar (ViSAR) program seeks to develop a real-time spotlight synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging sensor that will provide imagery of a region to allow high-resolution fire direction in conditions where optical sensors do not function.  Technology from this program is planned to transition to Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC).</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Military Imaging and Surveillance Technology (MIST) program is developing a fundamentally new optical Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) capability that can provide high-resolution 3-D images to locate and identify a target at much longer ranges than is possible with existing optical systems.  Short, moderate, and long-range prototype optical surveillance and observation systems are being developed that: (1) demonstrate probabilities of recognition and identification at distances sufficient to allow stand-off engagement; (2) overcome atmospheric turbulence, which now limits the ability of high-resolution optics; and (3) increase target identification confidence to reduce fratricide and/or collateral damage.  The program will develop and integrate the necessary component technologies including high-energy pulsed lasers, receiver telescopes that have a field of view and depth of field that obviates the need for steering or focusing the optical system, computational imaging algorithms to improve system resolution, and data exploitation and analysis tools.  Advances in laser systems, digital imagers, and novel image processing algorithms will be leveraged to reduce the overall size, weight, and power (SWaP) of imaging systems to allow for soldier portable and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) platform integration. The MIST program will transition the optical ISR technology to the Services and SOCOM.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Behavioral Learning for Adaptive Electronic Warfare (BLADE) program developed the capability to jam adaptive and rapidly evolving wireless communication threats in tactical environments and at tactically-relevant timescales.  This has changed the paradigm for responding to evolving threats from lab-based manual development to an adaptive in-the-field systems approach.  When an unknown or adaptive communication threat appears in theater, BLADE dynamically characterized the communication network, synthesized an effective countering technique, and evaluated jamming effectiveness by iteratively probing, learning, and adapting to the threat.  An optimization process tailored real-time responses to specific threats, producing a countermeasure waveform that maximizes jam effectiveness while minimizing the required jamming resources.  BLADE enabled the rapid defeat of new communication threats and provided the warfighter with real-time feedback on jam effectiveness.  The program transitioned to the U.S. Army Communications-Electronic RDT&amp;E Center, Intelligence and Information Warfighter Directorate for further maturation and hardening.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Exploitation Systems project develops algorithms, software, and information processing systems to extract information from massive intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) datasets.  In particular, it develops new technologies for detection and discrimination of targets from clutter, classification and fingerprinting of high value targets, localization and tracking over wide areas, and threat network identification and analysis.  Interest extends to open source information and issues such as trustworthiness and provenance.  The resulting technology will enable operators to more effectively and efficiently incorporate all sources of information, including sensor, human, and open source data, in intelligence products.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>Insight is developing the next generation multi-intelligence exploitation and analysis system.  Insight provides new exploitation capabilities through an integrated, standards-based system that is designed for mission flexibility and cross-theater applicability.  Insight will enable threat detection through combination and analysis of information from imaging and non-imaging sensors and other sources.  The technical approach emphasizes graph-based correlation, adversary behavior modeling, threat network analysis tools, a unified data management and processing environment, novel exploitation algorithms and analysis methodologies, and tools to integrate human and machine processing, including visualization, hypothesis manipulation, and on-line learning.  Insight development activities leverage both virtual and physical test bed environments.  The virtual test bed enables evaluation of alternative sensor mixes and algorithms under extended operating conditions.  The physical test bed enables live testing under realistic operational conditions using current and next generation sensing and processing systems.  Insight technology development is coordinated with the following transition sponsors: Army Program Executive Office - Intelligence, Electronic Warfare &amp; Sensors, United States Army Intelligence Center of Excellence, Project Manager Distributed Common Ground System - Army, Air Staff, National Air and Space Intelligence Center, and Air Force Research Laboratory.  Insight provides a unified architecture for plug-and-play ISR with extensibility to all Services and Combatant Commands.</r2:Description>
