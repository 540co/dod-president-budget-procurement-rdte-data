            <r2:ProgramElementNote>FY2017 funding for Long Range Precision Fires (LRPF) has been realigned to a new OSD-directed PE 0607134A, Project ES1.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Project 093. The Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) is a full spectrum, combat proven, all weather, 24/7, tracked weapon system. These precision strike weapon systems are organic/assigned to Field Artillery Brigades (FABs). The MLRS launcher provides critical missile precision strike, operational shaping fires, counterfire, and close support destructive and suppressive fires.  In FY16 a third battalion of MLRS launchers will be added to United States Forces Korea (USFK).  Army Prepositioned Stock requirements have increased to eight M270A1s in FY16. The launcher is complemented by the MLRS Family of Munitions (MFOM) to include the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS), and the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) Family of Munitions (AFOM), capable of engaging targets up to a range of 300 kilometers.  The MLRS product improvement program provides funding for research, development, test, and integration efforts necessary for incorporation of advanced automotive, armament, and system hardware and software technologies, including Common Operating Environment (COE) and Network Integrated Evaluation (NIE), obsolescence mitigation, reliability improvements, and decreasing the logistics footprint.  This effort includes performing technical assessments, concept studies, and risk reduction efforts for incorporation of future requirements. The MLRS product improvement program maintains compliance with intra-army interoperability and digital communications via joint variable message format.

Project DX8. The M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) is a full spectrum, combat proven, all weather, 24/7 lethal and responsive, precision strike weapon system that fully supports more deployable, affordable and lethal, Brigade Combat Teams (BCT), Fires Brigades, Modular Forces, and Joint Expeditionary Forces.  The HIMARS launcher is a C-130 transportable, wheeled, indirect fire, rocket/missile launcher capable of firing all rockets and missiles in the current and future Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) Family of Munitions (MFOM) and Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) Family of Munitions (AFOM) engaging targets with precision out to ranges of 300 kilometers. The HIMARS satisfies the Army's digitization requirements by interfacing with the Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) fire support command and control system. The HIMARS product improvement program provides funding for research, development test, and integration efforts necessary for incorporation of advanced automotive, armor, armament, life cycle enhancements, system hardware and software technologies, including Common Operating Environment (COE) and Network Integrated Evaluation (NIE), obsolescence mitigation, reliability improvements and decreasing the logistics footprint.  This effort includes performing technical assessments, concept studies, and risk reduction efforts for incorporation of future requirements.  The HIMARS product improvement program maintains compliance with Intra-Army Interoperability and Digital Communications.  Army prepositioned stock requirement has increased to twenty-four HIMARS in FY16.  The HIMARS was deployed to Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) with great success by both US Army and Marine Corps units.

Project DZ8. LRPF is being developed as a non-cluster munition to provide Joint Force Command with a 24/7 all weather long-range fires capability without placing aircraft and crews at risk.  FY2017 funding for Long Range Precision Fires (LRPF) has been realigned to a new OSD-directed PE 0607134A, Project ES1.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The MLRS product improvement program conducts concept studies to support obsolescence mitigation, automotive updates, and hardware/software enhancements.  Development efforts underway include EC2 and efforts supporting interoperability certifications, information assurance compliance, IAC, and mitigating obsolescence of the Fire Control System through the FCS-U effort.  The IAC effort enhances the level of crew protection. A contract was awarded following a competitive bid process (full and open competition) to ensure best value for the government.   Seven prototype cabs have been delivered and integrated onto the launchers; testing was completed in FY15.  The FCS-U is driven by the need to mitigate obsolete electronic components that are being sustained through life of type purchases. These purchased components will be exhausted, thus requiring an update to the design.  This update to the design will preserve current and future capability of firing the complete set of MLRS family of munitions per the Operational Requirements Document (ORD). The FCS-U development effort began in FY13, utilizing the Industrial Engineering Services (IES) contract that was previously sole source awarded.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>The Army G-3/5/7 has directed that Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) Increment 4 change its name to Long-Range Precision Fires (LRPF) to better reflect the solution as an Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) replacement versus a follow-on increment to the GMLRS program. Starting in FY2017 funding for LRPF has been realigned to new OSD-directed PE 0607134A, Proj ES1.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The LRPF is being developed as a cluster and insensitive munition-compliant system that replaces and improves upon ATACMS capabilities to provide Joint Force Commanders with a 24/7, all-weather, area target, long-range fires capability without placing aircraft and crews at risk.  The mission of the LRPF System will be to attack/neutralize/suppress/destroy targets using missile delivered indirect precision fires.  The LRPF will counter the enemy's ability to conduct combat maneuver and air defense operations.  Targets include counterfire, air defense, command and control, and other high payoff targets at all depths of the tactical battlefield. LRPF requirements include 300km range; specified lethality against the designated target set, a Missile Launch Pod Container (MLPC) that holds a minimum of two missiles; and compatibility with the existing launcher platforms (M270A1 and High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS)).  The Army has completed an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA), in accordance with Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) approved Material Development Decision (MDD) on 6 November 2013.  The AoA was completed on 30 April 2015 and a letter of sufficiency issued by OSD in August 2015.

The Army initially funded the development of the LRPF under PE 0603778A, Proj DZ8.  The LRPF program currently has a Milestone (MS) A Decision scheduled for 1QFY16.  Funding was requested in FY2016 to conduct competitive sub-system risk reduction activities under DoD Section 845 Other Transaction Authority (OTA), to mature the rocket motor and warhead technology to support the award of Technology Maturation/Risk Reduction (TM/RR) system demonstration contracts in FY17.  LRPF will be developed using competitive prototyping, carrying two or more contractors through the TM/RR Phase.  LRPF is scheduled for a MS B in FY2020 and MS C in FY2024.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

An AoA supporting a MS A decision is being conducted by U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Analysis Center-White Sands Missile Range (TRAC-WSMR), with the final report to be completed in March 2015.  The Milestone Decision Authority will hold a MS A decision review in 1QFY16.  The Acquisition Strategy is for competitive prototyping for TM/RR at both the sub-system and system demonstration levels.  After a MS A decision directing a new start LRPF system, the program office will initiate TM/RR activities with awards in 3QFY16 for critical sub-system prototyping under the DoD Ordnance Technology Consortium (DOTC) Section 845 (NDAA 1994) Other Transaction Authority. The program will also conduct a full and open competition in FY2016 of a 24-month TM/RR competitive prototyping and flight demonstration phase to be awarded to two contractors in 2QFY2017.  Flight demonstrations and PDRs in FY18 will lead to a limited competition for the EMD contract and competitive down select at MS B.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Anti-Tamper (AT) Technology Support.  The Protective Technologies (PT) organization is the Army’s Technical Center for the DoD AT program, which is focused on preventing exploitation (reverse engineering (RE)) of U.S. systems lost or captured on the battlefield or sold via Foreign Military Sales (FMS) or Direct Commercial Sales (DCS).  In support of this mission, PT’s classified efforts are focused on AT Validation and Verification (V&amp;V) activities with Army programs, AT/RE Lab facilities and equipment and AT/RE Lab assessments.  Failure to adequately fund these efforts will put all current and future Army acquisition programs, and their underlying critical technologies, at risk for loss to our adversaries.  This will reduce or eliminate the U.S. technological advantage and put warfighters lives at unnecessary peril.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Project ER2: The Close Combat Technology program includes development efforts to upgrade Close Combat technologies, energetics, and munitions, such as counter explosives, grenades, demolitions, shoulder launched munitions, pyrotechnic simulators, countermeasure flares, non-lethal ammunition/systems, networked munitions and mines, that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production.  This program will identify, characterize, study, analyze, test and develop technologies to resolve close combat munition reliability, safety, environmental, storage, standardization, obsolescence and manufacturing/producibility issues.  

FY 2017 funds will be used to support the following efforts: MK3A2 Offensive Hand Grenade, improve Claymore Force-on-Force Training Aids, Device, Simulator and Simulation (TADSS) Trainer, Countermeasure Flare Decoy Formulations, AN-M82A Obscuration Grenade, and Non-Lethal Ammunition Obsolescence.

Project ER5: The Indirect Fire and Fuze Technology program supports product improvement development efforts to upgrade indirect fire weapon systems and munitions that have already been fielded and/or are in production.  Indirect Fire Weapons and Munitions Product Improvement Programs include improved target engagement; increased reliability, availability, maintainability, and safety; standardization and interoperability with weapons and munitions of Allied Nations; defense exportability features under the auspices of Better Buying Power; reduced taxpayer life-cycle costs; reduction of failure mechanisms and supply chain risk through introduction of new and alternative technology and materiel solutions; materiel and technology obsolescence mitigation; improvement of manufacturing methods and their associated production and life cycle support processes; new capabilities in response the evolving and emerging threats and countermeasures; and reduction/elimination of potential environmental and health risks associated with these products and their underlying components, materials, and production processes.   

This program supports the standardization and interoperability of legacy and new production U.S. weapons and ammunition with Allied Nations to maximize battlefield interchangeability/compatibility under the auspices of the international Joint Ballistics Memorandum Of Understanding (JBMOU).  Maximizing standardization, interchangeability, and exportability will also potentially increase Foreign Military Sales (FMS) of U.S. indirect fire Weapon and Munition products to maintain critical mass domestic production and affordable taxpayer costs through increased economies of scale.

This program also supports the identification, study, analysis and development of fuzing technologies and safe and arm devices in production and in the field. This program will implement these technologies into fuzing systems to preclude obsolescence, maximize standardization, enhance performance, and improve the safety and exportability of existing munitions. The program addresses two major areas: (1) analysis and (2) block upgrades. Analysis efforts will identify second sources for fuzing systems that may reduce cost by providing competition, and maintain production when sources or parts are no longer available. It will also allow for the performance enhancement of current ammunition items by conducting studies of major fuze components to detect and identify latent defects. The second major area is block upgrades, which will identify and perform studies on improvements to fuzes; increase commonality of fuze components and requirements. Block upgrades will enable the introduction of the latest technologies into fuzing, keep the fuzing design current to avoid obsolescence issues, and add capabilities. 

Project ER6: The Munitions, Survivability and Logistics program funding will be used to support direct fire ammunition from small caliber ammunition, 40mm grenade, medium caliber cannon ammunition and large caliber ammunition enhancements to lethality, effectiveness, survivability, accuracy and general product improvements.  In FY 2016, this program assures complete interchangeability of direct fire ammunition and weapons among all the North Atlantic Treaty Organization  (NATO) countries with all of the associated logistic, strategic and tactical advantages of the alliance.  The program involves development and testing compliance of NATO standardization agreements (STANAGS) and staffing of the North American Regional Test Center (NARTC).  In FY 2017, the NATO Standardization mission transfers to PE 0605805A - Munitions Standardization, Effectiveness and Safety, Project F21 - Direct Fire Technology and NATO Ammo Evaluation.       

FY 2017 funds are used for a more lethal and safer design for 40mm grenades that will be built and tested.  An improved 30mm training round for the Apache helicopter will allow pilots to see where the rounds strike.  Warhead improvements for the 30mm Apache ammunition are also under development.  A number of studies on potential improvements for training ammunition and better primers will be conducted.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program supports product improvement development efforts to upgrade indirect fire weapon systems and munitions that have already been fielded and/or are in production.  Indirect Fire Weapons and Munitions Product Improvement Programs include improved target engagement; increased reliability, availability, maintainability, and safety; standardization and interoperability with weapons and munitions of Allied Nations; defense exportability features under the auspices of Better Buying Power; reduced taxpayer life-cycle costs; reduction of failure mechanisms and supply chain risk through introduction of new and alternative technology and materiel solutions; materiel and technology obsolescence mitigation; improvement of manufacturing methods and their associated production and life cycle support processes; new capabilities in response the evolving and emerging threats and countermeasures; and reduction/elimination of potential environmental and health risks associated with these products and their underlying components, materials, and production processes.   

This program supports the standardization and interoperability of legacy and new production U.S. weapons and ammunition with Allied Nations to maximize battlefield interchangeability/compatibility under the auspices of the international Joint Ballistics Memorandum Of Understanding (JBMOU).  Maximizing standardization, interchangeability, and exportability will also potentially increase Foreign Military Sales (FMS) of U.S. indirect fire Weapon and Munition products to maintain critical mass domestic production and affordable taxpayer costs through increased economies of scale.

This program also supports the identification, study, analysis and development of fuzing technologies and safe and arm devices in production and in the field. This program will implement these technologies into fuzing systems to preclude obsolescence, maximize standardization, enhance performance, and improve the safety and exportability of existing munitions. The program addresses two major areas: (1) analysis and (2) block upgrades. Analysis efforts will identify second sources for fuzing systems that may reduce cost by providing competition, and maintain production when sources or parts are no longer available. It will also allow for the performance enhancement of current ammunition items by conducting studies of major fuze components to detect and identify latent defects. The second major area is block upgrades, which will identify and perform studies on improvements to fuzes; increase commonality of fuze components and requirements. Block upgrades will enable the introduction of the latest technologies into fuzing, keep the fuzing design current to avoid obsolescence issues, and add capabilities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Joint Ballistics Memorandum of Understanding (JBMOU) Concerning the Standardization of Elements of 155mm Weapons and Ammo between US, FR, GE, IT, and UK was signed 18Dec09.  This is a FY17 continuation of live fire testing, evaluation, and validation and any corresponding NATO Armaments Ballistics Kernel (NABK) and Firing Control Input (FCI) database changes, enables battlefield interchangeability of existing/new 155mm cannon munitions between domestic US and NATO/Allied Nations Indirect Fires Weapons And Munitions. 

ARDEC Fuze Technology Improvement (FTI) will improve current production munitions by exploiting existing fuzing technologies and inserting them into current production fuzes, providing safer, more producible, and more lethal fuzing solutions.  FTI develops second source suppliers and resolve component obsolescence issues to mitigate risk and prevent production interruptions in order to continue to provide safer, more reliable munitions for the Warfighter with significant risk reduction to production fuzes also benefiting the US Taxpayer.  In FY16, FTI will ballistically evaluate a proximity sensor filter to eliminate potential of early M734A1 fuze function due to undesired out-range response and generate ECP(s) to incorporate changes into M734A1 fuze TDP, ballistically evaluate the omni-directional G-switch performance of the M433 grenade, and evaluate if it will reduce duds, due to improved reliability on soft targets and graze angles.  In FY17 FTI will analyze the design modification to the escapement housing will ensure the M433 HEDP round and M918 training rounds will decrease the risk of having a defeated safety and evaluate feasibility of incorporating state of the art MEMS G-Switch into the M734A1/M783 through comparable G-Switch performance metrics and generate ECP(s) to incorporate changes into M734A1/M783 TDPs, evaluate feasibility of incorporating state of the art MEMS G-Switch into the M734A1/M783 through equivalency tests for comparable G-Switch performance metrics and generate ECP(s) to incorporate changes into M734A1/M783 TDPs. FTI will also analyze the delay primer and evaluate changes to the explosive mixture of the delay primer input cup assembly to reduce occurrences of instantaneous firings and generate ECP to incorporate into M734A1 and M783 fuze TDPs. as well as evaluate the potential for a simplified inductive fuze setting capability to provide cost savings and simplify integration with future weapon platforms.

FTI will evaluate the design and integration of a custom radar transceiver integrated circuit into indirect fire proximity fuzes due to component obsolescence through bench and sub-scale testing. FTI will conduct tests to evaluate the integration of the next generation microcontroller into 60, 81, and 120mm mortar fuzes to replace the current one-time-programmable part due to component obsolescence. FTI will evaluate reserve power source improvements for indirect fire fuzes that will provide a safer, more producible reserve battery configuration that performs reliably across the operating temperature range through bench and sub-scale testing. FTI will evaluate the design and integration of a MEMS-based G-switch from a second source of supply which is used on direct fire and indirect fire production fuzes for the elimination of a single point failure through analysis, bench, and sub-scale testing. FTI will evaluate improvements on 40mm medium caliber fuze that will reduce occurrences of rejected parts due to porosity of material which will increase throughput and avoid cost escalations due to additional quality controls and will subsequently generate an ECP to incorporate into the M550 TDP.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>The 0607131A ER6, Munitions, Survivability and Logistics, program is not a new start.  Funds in this program in FY 2016 are a realignment of funds from program 0605805A - Munitions Standardization, Effectiveness and Safety for more efficient and effective program management.  In FY 2016 the F21 Direct Fire Technology and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Ammunition Evaluation program transfers to PE 0607131A, Weapons and Munitions Product Improvement Programs, Project ER6, Munitions, Survivability and Logistics.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Munitions, Survivability and Logistics program funding will be used to support direct fire ammunition from small caliber ammunition, 40mm grenade, medium caliber cannon ammunition and large caliber ammunition enhancements to lethality, effectiveness, survivability, accuracy and general product improvements.  In FY 2016, this program assures complete interchangeability of direct fire ammunition and weapons among all the North Atlantic Treaty Organization  (NATO) countries with all of the associated logistic, strategic and tactical advantages of the alliance.  The program involves development and testing compliance of NATO standardization agreements (STANAGS) and staffing of the North American Regional Test Center (NARTC).  In FY 2017, the NATO Standardization mission transfers to PE 0605805A - Munitions Standardization, Effectiveness and Safety, Project F21 - Direct Fire Technology and NATO Ammo Evaluation.       

FY 2017 funds are used for a more lethal and safer design for 40mm grenades that will be built and tested.  An improved 30mm training round for the Apache helicopter will allow pilots to see where the rounds strike.  Warhead improvements for the 30mm Apache ammunition are also under development.  A number of studies on potential improvements for training ammunition and better primers will be conducted.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>30mm x 113mm is used on the Apache (AH64) and Blackhawk (MH60) systems, its primers are not HERO safe.  The primers do not meet the requirements of MIL-STD-464A.  Consequently 30mm x 113mm ammunition cannot be safely handled, including loading the systems, when in high energy electromagnetic environments such as on or near Navy ships.  It also introduces risk to the systems operating in unknown environments because there are approximately 10 exposed cartridges in the feed shoot between the Helicopter Body and the gun.   Effort will address this design shortcoming by  developing and proving out a laser initiated primer which will be a direct replacement of the existing primer.  Performance of the end items will not be affected by this change.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Long Range Precision Fires (LRPF)program is being developed as a cluster and insensitive munition compliant system that replaces and improves upon Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) capabilities to provide Joint Force Commanders with a 24/7, all-weather, area target, long-range fires capability without placing aircraft and crews at risk.  The mission of the LRPF System will be to attack/neutralize/suppress/destroy targets using missile delivered indirect precision fires.  The LRPF will counter the enemy's ability to conduct combat maneuver and air defense operations.  Targets include counter-fire, air defense, command and control, and other high payoff targets at all depths of the tactical battlefield. LRPF requirements include 300km range; specified lethality against the designated target set, a Launch Pod Missile Container (LPMC) that holds a minimum of two missiles; and compatibility with the existing launcher platforms (M270A1 and High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS)).  An Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) was directed in the Material Development Decision (MDD) on 6 November 2013.  The AoA was completed on 30 April 2015 and a letter of sufficiency issued by OSD in August 2015.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The AoA was completed on 30 April 2015 and a letter of sufficiency issued by OSD in August 2015.

The LRPF program Milestone(MS) A Decision is scheduled for 2QFY16. FY 2017 funding is requested to provide incremental funding to continue risk reduction activities through the execution of Technology Maturation/Risk Reduction (TMRR) system demonstration contracts to be awarded in 3QFY16.  LRPF will be developed using competitive prototyping, carrying two or more contractors through the TMRR Phase.  The FY17 funding will be used to continue execution of two TMRR prototyping and flight demonstration contracts and conduct System Requirements Review (SRR), functional reviews, and prototype design activities and long-lead material procurement to support flight demonstrations and Preliminary Design Reviews (PDRs) in FY19. This funding also supports Government management and Government systems engineering and test support activities.  LRPF is scheduled for a MS B in FY2020 and MS C in FY2024.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

An AoA supporting the MS A decision has been completed by U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Analysis Center-White Sands Missile Range (TRAC-WSMR), with the OSD letter of sufficiency issued in August 2015.  The Milestone Decision Authority will hold a MS A decision review in 2QFY16.  After an MS A decision directing a new start LRPF system, the program office will conduct a limited competition in FY16 of a 45 month TMRR phase using DoD Ordnance Technology Consortium (DOTC) Other Transaction Authority (OTA) for competitive prototyping. TMRR will include two award agreements in 3QFY16 leading to flight demonstrations and PDRs in FY19. Data from the TMRR phase will support the EMD contract competition in FY19 that will result in selection of a single contractor for Engineering and Manufacturing Development at MS B in FY20 to complete product development, qualification, production readiness assessment, and limited user test.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 budget request for Apache AH-64E, previously known as Apache Block III, will fund the non-recurring engineering (NRE), development, and testing work associated with the planned remanufacture and new build of 690 Apache aircraft in the AH-64E configuration (deliveries began in Oct 2011).  The AH-64E program consists of two Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAP), AH-64E Remanufacture and AH-64E New Build.  This project also addresses obsolescence and reliability challenges and provides increased combat capability to the aircraft.  Upgrades include: Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Level III-IV Control, Improved Situational Awareness, Upgraded Communications Suite, Improved Drive and Propulsion Systems, Improved Targeting Capability, Increased Computer Processing Capability and Speed, Improved Navigation Systems, Improved Diagnostics and Maintainability, and Joint Air to Ground Missile (JAGM) integration.  Upgrades are integrated as incremental block modifications.  The program addresses operational shortfalls identified during real-world combat missions and meets Longbow Apache Capability Production Document (CPD) requirements for modernization.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The NRE will encompass subsystem integration and will utilize existing test aircraft, incorporate the technical insertions, and initiate appropriate qualification and operational flight-testing. 

In FY14, a contract for Apache AH-64E Lot 3, initiating Full Rate Production, was awarded with options for Lot 4 and will continue to a total of 690 remanufactured and new build aircraft.

Training device concurrency will be maintained with each technical insertion. The Engineering/Manufacturing Design (EMD) effort is managed as Cost Reimbursable.  Production efforts will be awarded as Fixed Price Incentive (FPI) and include the Advance Procurement requirements.

In FY13, FY14, and FY15 MRL NRE encompassed US Government (USG) design of the Hydra Launcher Electronics Assembly (LEA), modification of the M261 launcher, launcher fabrication, and launcher testing.

In FY15-FY18, Apache AH-64E Version 6 System Development and Demonstration (SDD) Contract.

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The H-60L Digital Blackhawk, now designated as UH-60V, is designed to update the existing H-60L analog architecture to a digital infrastructure enabling the upgraded aircraft to have a similar Pilot-Vehicle Interface (PVI) to the H-60M.  The program will address current capability gaps and meet operational requirements by employing an evolutionary acquisition approach to leverage mature technologies that have been successfully integrated on other military aircraft.  The program will reduce obsolescence and increase commonality and interoperability by installing a digital cockpit, bussing and upgrading the communication/identification suite, improving navigation guidance, and integrating Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE), digital moving map, and Joint Variable Message Format (JVMF) messaging.

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The CH-47 Chinook is the Army's only heavy lift helicopter and is an essential element of the current Army Aviation master plan.  This program funds improvements to the CH-47F System that include: T55-GA-714A engine control and component upgrades to increase power to support emerging 6K/95 requirements, continued development and testing of the Advanced Chinook Rotor Blades (ACRB) which will provide increased lift in high/hot conditions and reduce Operation and Support (O&amp;S) costs. Production of the ACRB will begin in Fiscal Year (FY) 2018.  Funding supports the transition from individual Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) into a CH-47F Block II Engineering/Manufacturing Design (EMD) effort with Milestone B planned for May 2017.  Funding also initiates advanced flight control and drive train component improvements to improve aircraft performance.  Development of requirements specifications, studies and risk reduction prototyping are also part of this effort.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>The CH-47F program replaces the aging CH-47D aircraft by FY 2020, incorporates a new machined airframe, and includes a new Common Avionics Architecture System (CAAS) cockpit with digital communication/navigation capability allowing improved interoperability on the digital battlefield. The CH-47F program includes recapitalization of key dynamic components, bringing them to a near zero time.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Given the need to maintain the fleet’s relevance through 2060, the PM is proposing a block strategy to facilitate incremental upgrades to the Chinook fleet. Using the CH-47F as a baseline, the H-47 Block II is the first increment of this potential multi-block strategy. The Block II program will restore performance lost due to the added weight of safety and survivability equipment incorporated since initial fielding in 2007. Additional objectives of the Block II program include: Efficiently incorporating multiple engineering changes; Accomplishing required mid-life airframe recapitalization; Converging the special operations and conventional Army designs; Establishing a foundation for future block upgrades; and Maintaining the industrial base until Future Vertical Lift (FVL)-Heavy is realized.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The budget line provides for Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE), development of supplemental type certificates (STC) and associated developmental testing, and integration of all Army fixed wing aircraft to provide Communications, Navigation and Surveillance (CNS), Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE), and Department of Defense (DoD) mandated safety equipment to meet current and evolving international and Army standards.  As requirements for new avionics equipment continue, aircraft delays and airspace exclusions are likely for aircraft not properly equipped. Upgrade of communication and aircraft modifications will assure worldwide deployability for those required to deploy. This budget line will also provide funding for studies, evaluations and Analysis of Alternatives to support emerging Army fixed wing requirements for product improvements to support the Army fleet.

In accordance with the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Director of Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&amp;E) Working Oversight List (dtd 26 Jun 15), the Fixed Wing Utility Aircraft Program will be required to undergo both Live Fire Testing and Operational Testing.  Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDTE) dollars in the amount of $0.796 million provides funding for Live Fire Test &amp; Evaluation (LFT&amp;E) hardware materials on Fixed Wing Utility Aircraft.  The LFT&amp;E hardware materials consist of Structural Wing, Engine, Propeller, Fuselage, Wing Iron Bird, Hydraulic System, Dry Bay Fire Suppression System, and Emergency Supplemental Oxygen Supply (ESOS) System.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>For Fiscal Year (FY) 2014 and prior, all funding for the Improved Turbine Engine Program (ITEP) was contained in Program Element (PE) 0203744A – Aircraft Modifications/Product Improvement Programs, Project 504.  FY 2015 funding has moved from PE 0203744A, Project EB1 to PE 0607139A, Project ES6. This is not a New Start.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>ITEP develops, tests, qualifies, and integrates the next generation turboshaft engine on the Black Hawk and Apache aircraft.  The Improved Turbine Engine (ITE) replaces the existing T700 engine design originated in the 1970's and meets the operational requirement of 6000 feet pressure altitude and 95 degrees (6K/95).  The ITE will fit inside the existing engine bays of the Black Hawk and Apache Helicopters and provides a significant power enhancement of up to fifty percent (total of 3,000 shaft horsepower) with increased fuel efficiency.  Additional benefits include improved design life, enhanced reliability, lower maintenance cost and restored capability lost due to aircraft weight growth, without increasing the logistics footprint.  The program consists of systems engineering and program management, detailed design engineering, design assurance, hardware manufacturing and testing, component and module level development and testing, system level testing and qualification, as well as integration into the airframe.

FY 2016 funding provides for dual vendor competitive Preliminary Design Review (PDR) contract awards, initial engine design effort, and continues platform/engine integration trade studies.  FY 2017 continues engine design effort and completes platform/engine integration trade studies.  FY 2018 funds the remaining PDR engine design effort, the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Source Selection and Evaluation Board (SSEB) for entry into Milestone B (MS B), EMD contract award, and begins platform Original Engine Manufacturer (OEM) integration design engineering.  FY 2019 continues both the EMD effort and platform/engine integration design engineering.   FY 2020 continues both the EMD effort and platform/engine integration A-kit development, resulting in a Critical Design Review (CDR) in FY 2020. FY 2021 continues the EMD effort, provides for First Engine To Test (FETT), and begins physical airframe integration.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>These funds supports Pre NIE testing and NIE participation of 3rd party software for COE. These funds will be used to mature, test, and integrate small business and industry technologies that are demonstrated and evaluated to have significant application to COE. This includes improvements of technology applications and widgets found in the commercial marketplace.  The scope of this effort covers SoSE&amp;I responsibility for execution of Phases 0-3 of COE Integration and preparation of Phase 4 AIC.  The impact if not funded is that the activities identified above will not be accomplished.  The results will slow COE abilities to respond to threat activities and limits shared information sources that can be downloaded in real time.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Logistics Information Warehouse (LIW) has been designated by the Secretary of the Army as the primary system for the accessing, acquiring, and delivery of materiel data. This includes data from all sources designated as Authoritative, as well as, system derived data and appropriate reference data. This data will be used in support of materiel sourcing and distribution and other Materiel Enterprise missions. It enables Command visibility of business intelligence and resulting metrics for critical logistics components enabling enterprise-level analytics to be performed in support of the equipping mission within the Army's Tiered Readiness processes. LOGSA and its LIW suite of products and services provide the Army community with vital logistics data necessary for the planning, conducting and sustainment of war fighting capability worldwide. The LMI-DST directly supports Tiered Readiness by linking available equipment to the Generated Force model. Specifically, LMI-DST synchronizes an Army authoritative Demand Signal for manning, equipping, services &amp; infrastructure and authoritative resourcing (money) information, resulting in an accurate prediction of a ready and properly equipped force. The Army Financial Liability Investigation of Property Loss Tracker (AFT) tool is a web-based, automated FLIPL processing and tracking system which provides an electronic FLIPL documentation packet that includes intelligent, digital versions of required forms and allows for attachment of supporting documentation.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Logistics Information Warehouse (LIW) is designated as the Army's authoritative materiel data repository. As chartered by the Secretary of The Army, LIW will provide enterprise-accepted and trusted information for analysis, aggregation, and reuse in support of the Lead Materiel Integrator (LMI) mission. As an Army enterprise-level repository and retrieval system to facilitate accurate choices and rapid decision making. Specifically, LIW will provide all required data structured in a way that allows for querying and reporting; e.g., equipment authorizations, equipment on-hand, new procurement schedules, RESET production schedules and in transit visibility from origin and distribution to final destination, in support of the information needs of the Army Materiel Command (AMC) and other command logistics managers. This includes data from all sources designated as authoritative, as well as system derived data and appropriate reference data. This data will be used in support of materiel sourcing and distribution and other Materiel Enterprise missions. LIW enables visibility of business intelligence and resulting metrics for critical logistics components enabling enterprise-level analytics to be performed in support of the equipping mission within the Army's Tiered Readiness processes. LIW supports the tenants of Mission Command by logistically empowering the Commander to successfully integrate and synchronize logistics information with warfighter functions in time and space to maximize potential for mission success. ADDITIONAL CAPABILITIES: LIW provides the data and custom business intelligence environment to enable Command-specific analysis and presentation of business intelligence displays to satisfy unique command management requirements.  LIW serves as the single logistics repository which bridges the Army ERP systems (GCSS-Army, LMP, AESIP, GFEBS) with enduring legacy systems. 

LOGSA is requesting RDTE funds to develop and enhance the Materiel Common Operating Picture (M-COP).  The M-COP provides interactive views, models, and simulations that directly address Warfighter priorities by giving senior Army leaders the ability to visualize current and future materiel requirements, materiel readiness levels and Warfighter materiel readiness options of the Logistics Readiness Center (LRC) at the installation level.  Data from many agencies is integrated into M-COP views, assisting with information superiority for joint and inter-agency operations (examples:  assisting CENTCOM, NORTHCOM, and FEMA).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Lead Materiel Integrator Decision Support Tool (LMI DST) is a software solution, resident within the Logistics Information Warehouse, that supports the Army Materiel Command in its mission as the Army Lead Materiel Integrator as well as materiel managers at Army Commands, Army Service Component Commands, Direct Reporting Units, Corps and Divisions with making informed equipping decisions. The LMI DST directly supports Army Forces Generation (ARFORGEN) by linking available equipment to the Generated Force model. 

Specifically, development will enable the tool to consume and display additional data sources, such as maintenance data from both legacy and Enterprise data sources - a critical capability during the fielding of GCSS-Army; provide additional modules, including Second Destination Transportation Planning, supporting USARC and NGB requirements to deprecate legacy systems and a Readiness Cost Banding module to implement analysis algorithms to deliver decisions to optimize readiness within Army cost constraints. New development will also enable equippers to redistribute items, based on their level of modernization, limiting transportation costs of moving outdated equipment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The LMI DST is a development effort to meet the Secretary of the Army's intent in designating the Army Materiel Command as the Lead Materiel Integrator and the Logistics Information Warehouse (LIW) as the authoritative repository of Army logistics domain data. The LMI DST integrates logistics domain data from the LIW with materiel demand requirements from the Readiness Enterprise to enable automated decision support for equippers throughout the Army. In August 2011, a sole source contract was awarded to ProModel Corporation to leverage their COTS modeling and simulation capability, the ProModel Application Framework to develop the Lead Materiel Integrator Decision Support Tool, which is a GOTS product. The project utilizes an agile development methodology. Versions 1-4 were released on a six-month cadence between December 2011 and April 2013. LMI DST development and sustainment have been transitioned to LOGSA's Information and Technology Services Contract.  Requirements for additional development were collected from Army Commands and vetted through a General Officer Steering Committee, chaired by Army Materiel Command.  RDTE funding supports future major version releases.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>Project 0607664A was created to clearly delineate between the future Biometrics Enabling Capability (Authoritative Biometrics System) and Family of Biometrics (current Authoritative Biometrics Repository System) efforts.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Biometrics Enabling Capability (BEC) product office has full life-cycle management responsibility of the upgraded authoritative biometrics enterprise repository system, known as DoD Automated Biometrics Identification System (DoD ABIS).  DoD ABIS is an information technology system that supports identity superiority by providing the critical capability for Warfighters to identify known or suspected terrorists and third country nationals in the course of military operations.  DoD ABIS is the authoritative biometrics enterprise system that provides matching, sharing and storing of biometrics data.  The capability can receive multi-modal biometrics submissions to include iris, face, palm and finger prints from biometrics collection devices, which will support the Warfigher in making, retain, capture or release decisions.  The system has a direct impact on the availability of critical intelligence information that is of vital interest to DoD and other government agencies, including Department of Justice (DoJ), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and Department of State (DoS).

The Defense Forensics and Biometrics Agency (DFBA) as the Executive Manager for Army Biometrics acts as the DoD proponent to establish and maintain Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation (RDTE) and information management support throughout the Armed Services.  DFBA leads in the development and implementation of biometric technologies for Combatant Commands (CCMDs), Services, and Agencies; delivers capabilities that contribute to the enhancement of the biometric community; increases Joint Service interoperability and; empowers the warfighter by improving operational effectiveness on the battlefield. The DFBA strategy pursues technology opportunities through scientific discovery and makes investments responsive to specific requirements identified by combat developers. These directives are carried out by DFBA's Office of the Chief Scientist (OCS). OCS coordinates all science and technology (S&amp;T) efforts and oversees the RDT&amp;E program.

Justification:
FY 2017 Research Development Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) funding in the amount of $10.853 million will support the completion of end of life upgrades and associated developmental testing to support of a service life extension to the DoD ABIS system baseline that will extend the life of the system through FY 2022.  These upgrades are required to maintain the systems security accreditation and performance.

FY 2017 funding in the amount of $1.250 million will provide DFBA the ability to actively manage internal and external research efforts to ensure scientific merit, feasibility, and DFBA objectives and requirements are met. DFBA conducts biometric T&amp;E activities, including standards conformance and Automated Biometric Identification System (ABIS) interoperability assessments, supporting DoD acquisition organizations, and providing subject matter expertise to DoD and non-DoD government stakeholders.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Defense Forensics and Biometrics Agency (DFBA) as the Executive Manager for Army biometrics acts as the DoD proponent to establish and maintain Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation (RDTE) and information management support throughout the armed services.  DFBA leads in the development and implementation of biometric technologies for Combatant Commands (CCMDs), Services, and Agencies; delivers capabilities that contribute to the enhancement of the biometric community; increases Joint Service interoperability and; empowers the warfighter by improving operational effectiveness on the battlefield. The DFBA strategy pursues technology opportunities through scientific discovery and makes investments responsive to specific requirements identified by combat developers. These directives are carried out by DFBA's Office of the Chief Scientist (OCS). OCS coordinates all science and technology (S&amp;T) efforts and oversees the RDT&amp;E program.

Justification:
FY2017 funding in the amount of $1.250 million will provide DFBA the ability to actively manage internal and external research efforts to ensure scientific merit, feasibility, and DFBA objectives and requirements are met. DFBA conducts biometric T&amp;E activities, including standards conformance and Automated Biometric Identification System (ABIS) interoperability assessments, supporting DoD acquisition organizations, and providing subject matter expertise to DoD and non-DoD government stakeholders.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>PATRIOT is an advanced Surface-to-Air guided missile system with a high probability of kill, capable of operation in the presence of Electronic Countermeasures (ECM) and able to conduct multiple simultaneous engagements against high performance air breathing targets and ballistic missiles likely to be encountered by U.S. Forces.  The PATRIOT Product Improvement Program provides for the upgrade of the PATRIOT System through individual materiel changes and upgrades to the PATRIOT system to address operational lessons learned, enhancements to joint force interoperability, and other system performance improvements to provide overmatch capability with the emerging threat.  Efforts will be made to expedite PATRIOT materiel solutions (e.g. Radar Digital Processor, Communications Upgrades, address Tactical Ballistic Missile (TBM) capability, Combat ID, and Advanced ECM improvements) to both enhance capability and facilitate integration into the Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) architecture.  

The software funding provides improvements to the PATRIOT system against the evolving threat. This effort supports work with national agencies to evaluate, assess, and develop means to mitigate threat trends and specific threat developments potentially impacting system performance.  Specific improvements may be developed and fielded under this task if warranted. The effort maintains the Mission Tailoring Database, responding to immediate tactical concerns.  Database updates are fielded between major software upgrades as necessary.

FY2017 base dollars will add assured Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) activities and continue Software Improvement for Threat Evolution, Advanced Electronic Counter Measures (AECM), Tasks 2, 6, and 7 activities, and Combat ID Enhancements for the PATRIOT Product Improvement Program (PIP).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Software Improvements for threat evolution:  Performs necessary analysis and development efforts to maintain PATRIOT system effectiveness against evolving threat technologies and specific threat capabilities.  This effort identifies evolving threats and threat characteristics that might present a challenge to PATRIOT's current capabilities and develops initial concepts to maintain system effectiveness relative to these threats.  

Upper-Tier Debris Mitigation (UTDM):  Implements algorithms to mitigate system impacts of debris from Upper Tier intercepts associated with operating in the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) environment.  Debris from Upper Tier intercepts can cause significant radar loading effects and the potential for erroneous engagements and missile wastage on debris.

Radar Digital Processor (RDP) Development:  Incorporates improvements to mitigate radar hardware obsolescence, improves Reliability, Availability and Maintainability (RAM) and improves performance of the PATRIOT Radar Set against evolving threat sets.  This program includes the implementation of Identification Friend or Foe Mode 5 Level 1 / Level 2, and a Non-Cooperative Target Recognition Combat ID technique to mitigate potential fratricide risk, and the development of CONOPS to incorporate the new Combat ID capabilities into system operation.  The RDP also provides the necessary radar processing capability to support follow-on Evolutionary Development Program (EDP) Tasks 6 and 7 to counter emerging threats and provide data necessary to support migration to IAMD.  The RDP is a pre-requisite for migration to an IAMD Netted Sensor.

RDP Waveform Suite:  Develops a comprehensive set of waveforms in the RDP to improve PATRIOT radar capabilities against current and evolving threats, including support to Task 6 and 7 efforts (see below), and implements advanced data collection enabled by the RDP to support further system improvements.  The RDP implementation allows significant radar waveform improvements necessary to counter evolving threats.

SIPRNet/NIPRNet Access Point/Troposcatter (SNAP/TROPO):  Provides hardware interfaces to support extended range communications within the battalion (TROPO) and Force Operations interfaces to satellite for access to SIPR/NIPR worldwide communication networks. 
 
THAAD/PATRIOT Interoperability:  Implements improvements to THAAD/PATRIOT Interoperability and addresses Joint Defense Network deficiencies that impact Tactical Ballistic Missile battle management and force/engagement operations.  Efforts will be concentrated on joint, collaborative force operations (defense design and planning) and enhanced Tactical Digital Information Link - Joint interoperability. 
 
Advanced Electronic Counter Measures (AECM):  This task investigates the implications of advanced technology Digital Radio Frequency Memory available on airborne platforms that enables new ECM techniques which could adversely affect Air and Missile Defense System effectiveness.   

Task 2:  Implements improved ground system and interceptor capabilities (PATRIOT Advanced Capability-2/Guidance Enhanced Missiles, PATRIOT Advanced Capability-3, and Missile Segment Enhancement) to counter emerging Tactical Ballistic Missile threats.
 
Task 6:  Software improvements enhance discrimination of higher altitude Tactical Ballistic Missile Re-entry Vehicles (RVs) from associated objects to support the full engagement capabilities of the interceptor.  Longer-range detection, track, and improved high-altitude discrimination are required to achieve the required lethality performance against the RV and to mitigate missile wastage against separation debris.  This task leverages the signal processing capabilities of the Radar Digital Processor, and supports the high altitude engagements required by the PATRIOT Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) and PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement  missiles.

Task 7:  Software improvements analyze existing and evolving Tactical Ballistic Missile countermeasures and their effects on PATRIOT system effectiveness.  Develops concepts to address countermeasure effects and ensure the PATRIOT system maintains its effectiveness.  Develops detailed system requirements to implement concepts; design/code/test software implementation leveraging Radar Digital Processor, Modernized Adjunct Processor, Enhanced Weapons Control Computer - Emulator and Flight Solution Computer-Redesign processing capabilities.

Assured Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT):  Efforts will develop and test the military’s improved Global Position M-Code with Patriot Major End Items (MEI) integrating the improved anti-jamming and secure access of military GPS signals.  This effort meets the requirement for Assured PNT through M-Code as mandated by FY2011 National Defense Act, public law 111-383 &amp; 913.

Combat ID Enhancements:  Develop and implement improvements to the Radar Digital Processor-Capability Combat ID capabilities and additional Non-Cooperative Target Recognition techniques to further mitigate misclassification and fratricide risk, and to provide the Warfighter with improved situational awareness.

Lower Tier Air &amp; Missile Defense-Capability (LTAMD-C)/ Flat Panel Array Concept Study:  This task provides studies for initial concepts and performance capabilities related to the implementation of an Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) transmitter/antenna into the PATRIOT radar.  These assessments are needed to refine user community expectations and requirements, and to prepare a viable set of requirements to support a competitive modernization competition.

Anti-Radiation Missile (ARM) Asset Defense:  Provides improved capability for PATRIOT to protect other Army and Joint Services Sensors from ARM attacks.  Builds on an initial capability provided in Post-Deployment Build-7 by determining remaining gaps, identifying and evaluating alternatives, and implementing further improvements.

Lower Tier Air &amp; Missile Defense-Capability (LTAMD-C):  LTAMD-C tasks include all the programmatic and engineering activities needed for the LTAMD-C Materiel Development Decision, Analysis of Alternatives, and Business Case Analyses/Trades. Once the material solution has been determined, the development effort for LTAMD-C will be accomplished.  These activities will continue through the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction and Engineering and Manufacturing Development phase to enable the prototyping, development, and testing of the LTAMD-C continued under 0604114A in FY17.

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Joint Land Attack Cruise Missile Defense Elevated Netted Sensor System (JLENS) is a supporting program for Army and Joint Integrated Air and Missile Defense, providing elevated, persistent, over the horizon surveillance and fire control quality data on Army and Joint networks, enabling protection of the U.S. and coalition forces as well as critical geo political assets from Cruise Missiles, Aircraft, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, Tactical Ballistic Missiles, Large Caliber Rockets, and Surface Moving Targets.  A JLENS Orbit consists of two systems: a fire control radar system and a wide-area surveillance radar system. Each radar system consists of a separate 74-meter tethered aerostat, mobile mooring station, radar and communications payload, processing station, and associated ground support equipment. The systems are designed to work together, but can operate independently. The JLENS Orbit is transportable by road, rail, sea and air.  

JLENS uses advanced sensor and networking technologies to provide persistent, 360-degree, wide-area surveillance and precision tracking of Land Attack Cruise Missiles and other types of Air Breathing Threats. This information is distributed via joint service networks and provides fire control quality data to Surface to Air missile systems, such as Army Patriot and Navy Aegis, increasing the weapons' capabilities by allowing systems to engage targets normally below, outside, or beyond surface based weapons' field of view. JLENS also provides fire control quality data to fighter aircraft, allowing the aircraft to engage hostile threats from extended ranges, and contributes to the development of a single integrated air picture.

JLENS is participating in Operation Noble Eagle (ONE) with NORAD-USNORTHCOM National Capital Region (NCR) Integrated Air Defense System (IADS) Operational Exercise (OPEX) from FY14-FY17.  The OPEX will include an operational assessment to "inform a future decision for enduring operational employment", in accordance with Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memorandum (JROCM) 021-13.  The Combatant Command (CCMD) objective for the OPEX is to provide the full range of JLENS Orbit level capability to include: Persistent Wide Area Surveillance (WAS) through Battle Command System Fixed (BCS-F) Integration Combat Identification (CID) / Electronic Identification (EID) Precision Cue to Fighters/Ground-Based Air Defense (GBAD) via Tactical Data Link (TDL) Integrated Fire Control to Fighters (IFC)/GBAD via TDL.

The JLENS Product Office has a requirement for the acquisition of services through the JLENS Exercise Contract to support the deployment of a JLENS Orbit at Aberdeen Proving Grounds (APG), MD as directed by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memorandum (JROCM) 021-13 signed by the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on 31 January 2013.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>JLENS is a supporting program for Army and Joint Integrated Air and Missile Defense, providing elevated, persistent, over the horizon surveillance and fire control quality data on Army and Joint networks, enabling protection of the U.S. and coalition forces as well as critical geo-political assets from Cruise Missiles, Aircraft, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, Tactical Ballistic Missiles, Large Caliber Rockets, and Surface Moving Targets.  A JLENS Orbit consists of two systems: a fire control radar system and a wide-area surveillance radar system. Each radar system consists of a separate 74-meter tethered aerostat, mobile mooring station, radar and communications payload, processing station, and associated ground support equipment. The systems are designed to work together, but can operate independently. The JLENS Orbit is transportable by road, rail, sea and air.  

JLENS uses advanced sensor and networking technologies to provide persistent, 360-degree, wide-area surveillance and precision tracking of Land Attack Cruise Missiles and other types of Air Breathing Threats. This information is distributed via joint service networks and provides fire control quality data to Surface to Air missile systems, such as Army Patriot and Navy Aegis, increasing the weapons' capabilities by allowing systems to engage targets normally below, outside, or beyond surface based weapons' field of view. JLENS also provides fire control quality data to fighter aircraft, allowing the aircraft to engage hostile threats from extended ranges, and contributes to the development of a single integrated air picture.

JLENS is participating in the NORAD-USNORTHCOM National Capital Region (NRC) Integrated Air Defense System (IADS) Operational Exercise (OPEX) for Operation Noble Eagle (ONE)from FY14- FY17.  The OPEX will include an operational assessment to "inform a future decision for enduring operational employment", in accordance with Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memorandum (JROCM) 021-13.  The Combatant Command (CCMD) objective for the OPEX is to provide the full range of JLENS Orbit level capability to include: Persistent Wide Area Surveillance (WAS) through Battle Command System Fixed (BCS-F) Integration Combat Identification (CID) / Electronic Identification (EID) Precision Cue to Fighters/Ground-Based Air Defense (GBAD) via Tactical Data Link (TDL) Integrated Fire Control to Fighters (IFC)/GBAD via TDL.

The JLENS Product Office has a requirement for the acquisition of services through the JLENS Exercise Contract to support the deployment of a JLENS Orbit at Aberdeen Proving Grounds (APG), MD as directed by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memorandum (JROCM) 021-13 signed by the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on 31 January 2013.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>JLENS has been directed to support the Homeland Defense Operational Exercise in the National Capital Region from FY 2014 to FY 2017 and will be assessed during the exercise to support a follow on decision from Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC).  The JLENS Product Office has a requirement for the acquisition of services through the JLENS Exercise Contract to support the deployment of JLENS Orbit deployed at Aberdeen Proving Grounds (APG), MD as directed by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memorandum (JROCM) 021-13 signed by the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on 31 January 2013.

Exercise preparation was conducted in FY 2013 on a limited basis to facilitate 2014 Activities as funding became available. Site development was projected to be completed 2014 with MILCON funding, followed by emplacement of the Orbit on the developed tactical sites at APG in 1Q 2015. Due to new start constraints related to the Continuing Resolution Act (CRA), MILCON funding was not received in time to complete construction in 2014 as planned.  The sites were constructed sequentially with the Surveillance Radar System (SuS) being completed first.  Both sites were completed by October 2016.  To allow operations to commence as early as possible, the MILCON contractor agreed to co-occupancy of the SuS site to allow JLENS System Integration and Check-out concurrent with completion of MILCON activities.

Transfer of operational control for operations to the Combatant Command occurred in 1QFY16.  End of flying in support of the exercise is projected to be the end of 3QFY2017.  4QFY2017 will be reserved for displacement and storage of Orbit 1 unless an enduring mission is directed otherwise.  The COCOM Exercise Contract is to support the JLENS NCR Exercise at APG, MD.  December 5, 2014 the contract was awarded as an Undefinitized Contract Action (UCA) for the 6 month base period of the contract.  The contract was definitized and Option 1 awarded in June 2015.  

The JLENS system is sustained by a two-Level maintenance concept consisting of Field and Sustainment Levels.  Sustainment level maintenance for common support equipment is supported by standard Army procedures and all sustainment level maintenance for JLENS peculiar or unique equipment is provided by the Prime Contractor.  Prime Contractor will serve as the supply chain manager and ensure failed spares are requisitioned and replaced to ensure system is operational.  There is no organic capability for the JLENS peculiar equipment at this time.  The JLENS Product Office retains major end item management responsibilities and performs oversight of the contractor's efforts.

A recommendation for continuing JLENS operations as an enduring mission will be considered by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) based on results of the Combatant Commander's assessment of the initial operations period in support of the NCR Exercise.  The date for enduring mission decision is to be determined (TBD) since testing was delayed due to the tether break incident in October 2015.  Upon receipt of direction to proceed with Enduring Mission or to store or dispose of the system, the Department of Defense will address funding needs to meet the requirements of the decision.  Based on the system being an EMD versus Production unit, an enduring mission decision will require major technical refresh of the system due to obsolescence and wear and tear. A competitive or sole source contract will be pursued if the decision is for an enduring mission.  The current budget provides funding through FY 2017 for the JLENS Homeland Defense Operational Exercise and FY 2018 for program close-out.  Depending on the results of the enduring mission decision, funding may be required for continued operations, to include technical refresh, for transportation to storage and cost of storage, or for transportation to appropriate location for demilitarization along with the cost of demilitarization. 

The EMD contract was completed 31 December 2013 and close-out tasks were initiated.  The EMD JLENS Systems, sub-systems, components, etc. were transferred to the Government on 19 December 2013 via DD250s.  A modification to the current Engineering Services contract was awarded on 20 December 2013, incorporating all Government Furnished Property (GFP).  The Engineering Services Contract for technical refresh assessments; conducting analysis required in support of the Homeland Defense Exercise; training of soldiers; maintaining  equipment until ready for shipment to the exercise location; packaging, handling and transportation of equipment to the exercise location; and system set-up, integration and check-out, was completed on 31 December 2015 and close-out tasks were begun.  The JLENS Product Office anticipates that a new technical requirements contract will be awarded in the first quarter of 2016 for contractor technical requirements support during the Exercise.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>The program office was directed to move all non-AFATDS Increment II funding out of the AFATDS PE 0203726A (PB2014 BLIN 161) to comply with the Major Automated Information System (MAIS) transparency guidance. The Joint Automated Deep Operation Coordination System (JADOCS) PE 0203728A will contain three project codes: project code EF6 justifies the Joint Automated Deep Operations Coordination System (JADOCS) Version (v) 2.0 development; project code EF7 justifies the Pocket-sized Forward Entry Device (Increment II) development; and project code EF8 justifies the Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) (Increment I).

The Army Acquisition Executive (AAE) determined that AFATDS Increment 2 (program element 0203726A project code DU5) was a software modernization effort of the existing AFATDS program. The Army moved funding for AFATDS Increment 2 from program element 0203726A project code DU5, to the current AFATDS funding (program element 0203728A project code EF8) as AFATDS version 7.0. Previous "AFATDS Increment 1" efforts are delineated as V6.8.x in program element 0203728A project code EF8.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) provides the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps automated fire support command, control and communications. AFATDS is used to plan, execute, and deliver lethal and non-lethal effects. AFATDS provides Joint/Coalition Situational Awareness for fires execution and mission management. The system interoperates and integrates with over 80 different battlefield systems, including Navy and Air Force command and control weapon systems; and the German, French, Turkish, and Italian fire support systems. AFATDS automates the planning, coordination, and control of all fire support assets (field artillery, mortars, close air support, naval gunfire, attack helicopters, offensive electronic warfare, fire support meteorological systems, forward observers, and fire support radars). AFATDS provides eleven core services that manage user input and handle dissemination of complex fires processes. These core services are: Attack/Engagement Analysis, Fire Support Planning, Mission Guidance, Target Definition, Mission Area Definition, Cross-System Graphics/Mapping management, Unit Task Organization Data, Fires Conflict Detection, Mobile Air/Ground Tracking, Mission Execution and Mission Trigger Events. These AFATDS services promote situational awareness of data, intelligence information and targeting data, in near real time, in order to effectively manage target selection and target engagement in accordance with the Maneuver Commanders guidance and priorities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>The Army Acquisition Executive (AAE) determined that AFATDS Increment 2 (program element 0203726A project code DU5) is a software modernization effort of the existing AFATDS program. Therefore, the Army moved funding for AFATDS Increment 2 from program element 0203726A project code DU5, to the current AFATDS funding (program element 0203728A project code EF8) as AFATDS version 7.0. Previous "AFATDS Increment 1" efforts are delineated as V6.x in program element 0203728A project code EF8.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) provides the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps automated fire support command, control and communications. AFATDS is used to plan, execute, and deliver lethal and non-lethal effects. AFATDS provides Joint/Coalition Situational Awareness for fires execution and mission management. The system interoperates and integrates with over 80 different battlefield systems, including Navy and Air Force command and control weapon systems; and the German, French, Turkish, and Italian fire support systems. AFATDS automates the planning, coordination, and control of all fire support assets (field artillery, mortars, close air support, naval gunfire, attack helicopters, offensive electronic warfare, fire support meteorological systems, forward observers, and fire support radars).

AFATDS provides eleven core services that manage user input and handle dissemination of complex fires processes. These core services are: Attack/Engagement Analysis, Fire Support Planning, Mission Guidance, Target Definition, Mission Area Definition, Cross-System Graphics/Mapping management, Unit Task Organization Data, Fires Conflict Detection, Mobile Air/Ground Tracking, Mission Execution and Mission Trigger Events. These AFATDS services promote situational awareness of data, intelligence information and targeting data, in near real time, in order to effectively manage target selection and target engagement in accordance with the Maneuver Commanders guidance and priorities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>There are three developmental efforts that are being executed concurrently: Joint Automated Deep Operations Coordination System (JADOCS) (project code EF6); Pocket-sized Forward Entry Device (Increment II) (project code EF7) and Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) (Increment I) (project code EF8). 

Joint Automated Deep Operations Coordination System (JADOCS) is a Joint and Coalition targeting, coordination mission management software application. It links Command and Control (C2), Intelligence, and Air operations information with execution systems using real time collaborative targeting managers, customized for each service or specific functional area. JADOCS is used to significantly enhance the Joint Force and Component Command's capability to simultaneously develop, coordinate and execute Dynamic and Time Sensitive targets and fire missions, as well as battle space coordination, search and rescue, and disaster relief/recover operations worldwide. JADOCS provides coordination and de-confliction of targeting information at all levels of command structure for the military. JADOCS is used by Air, Ground, Maritime, and Special Operations forces. It provides horizontal (across Services) as well as vertical (within Services) coordination of missions to ensure a common picture of targeting operational status across the entire joint force. As a software application, JADOCS can be configured and customized for each user and location. The client and server software can be installed on typical Windows Operating System.

Pocket-sized Forward Entry Device (PFED) Increment II will be a software only application that operates on the Nett Warrior End User Device (EUD).  It will provide the dismounted Forward Observer (FO) and Fire Support Teams (FISTs) the capability to accurately and rapidly locate ground targets and enable the Soldier wearing the NETT Warrior ensemble to digitally process a Call For Fire. PFED Increment II complies with the Mobile Handheld Computing Environment requirement that all handheld applications reside on the Nett Warrior End User Device. 

The Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) provides Army, Navy, and Marine Corps automated fire support command, control and communications. AFATDS is used to plan, execute, and deliver lethal and non-lethal effects. AFATDS provides Joint/Coalition capability for fires execution and mission management. The system interoperates and integrates with over 80 different battlefield systems, including Navy and Air Force command and control weapon systems; As a member of the Artillery System Cooperation Agreement (ASCA), AFATDS is interoperable with the German, French, Turkish, and Italian fire support systems. AFATDS automates the planning, coordination, and control of all fire support assets (field artillery, mortars, close air support, naval helicopters, offensive electronic warfare, fire support meteorological systems, forward observers, and fire support radars).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Joint Automated Deep Operations Coordination System (JADOCS) is a Joint and Coalition targeting, coordination mission management software application. It links Command and Control (C2), Intelligence, and Air operations information with execution systems using real time collaborative targeting managers, customized for each service or specific functional area. JADOCS is used to significantly enhance the Joint Force and Component Command's capability to simultaneously develop, coordinate and execute Dynamic and Time Sensitive targets and fire missions, as well as battle space coordination, search and rescue, and disaster relief/recover operations worldwide. JADOCS provides coordination and de-confliction of targeting information at all levels of command structure for the military. 

JADOCS is used by Air, Ground, Maritime, and Special Operations forces. It provides horizontal (across Services) as well as vertical (within Services) coordination of missions to ensure a common picture of targeting operational status across the entire joint force. As a software application, JADOCS can be configured and customized for each user and location. The client and server software can be installed on typical Windows Operating System.

JADOCS fires and targeting capabilities will migrate to AFATDS Version 7.0. JADOCS capabilities will be sustained until AFATDS meets the Joint Users requirements. JADOCS v 2.0 software is being developed by CECOM Life Cycle Management Command, Software Engineering Center (SEC).

FY17 funding in the amount of $2.825 million will be used to complete development and test efforts on JADOCS version 2.0.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Pocket-sized Forward Entry Device (PFED) Increment II will be a software-only application that operates on the Nett Warrior End User Device (EUD). It will provide the dismounted Forward Observer (FO) and Fire Support Teams (FISTs) the capability and functionality to accurately and rapidly locate ground targets and digitally process a Call For Fire. PFED Increment II answers the Mobile Handheld Computing Environment requirement that all handheld applications reside on the Nett Warrior End User Device.

FY17 funding of $1.966 million supports the evolutionary software development and testing of this handheld Fires Command and Control (C2) system.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) officially approved entry into the Development phase as an Acquisition Category (ACAT) III program.

PFED Increment II leverages an Army Science and Technology investment by transitioning a software application that has been developed and used in proponent experimentation events (i.e. Army Expeditionary Warrior Experiment (AEWE) and Bold Quest). Upon a successful Milestone B decision in FY2015, this software application transitioned to PM Mission Command to conduct all Army developmental and operational test and evaluation requirements. PFED Increment II will be integrated onto the Nett Warrior End User Devices (EUDs) and will be fielded by PM Soldier Warrior (PM SWAR). Training on the PFED Increment II software will be conducted by PM Mission Command as units are fielded the capability.

PM Mission Command will continue to manage future capability Blocks of software development. PM Mission Command will continue to coordinate with PM Soldier Warrior to field and train future versions of the software, as described above.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>AFATDS version 6.8.0.1 is the current fielded version of software. AFATDS version 6.8.1.1 remains under development with a Full Materiel Release projected for 4QFY2016. 

Per Memorandum for Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology and Logistics) dated 13 May 2015, the Army Acquisition Executive (AAE) determined that AFATDS Increment II is a modernization of the existing software code to provide Army Common Operating Environment (COE) standards to be executed as AFATDS 7.0. The PM will re-design AFATDS version 7.0 to provide the operator role/duty-based interaction, a dynamic embedded training capability, integration of COE compliant architectures and allowance for more efficient insertion of future capabilities. 

Development of future AFATDS capabilities will be considered based on requirements approved through the Fires Center of Excellence (FCoE) Tactical Software Requirements Governance Board.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Army has approved engineering change proposals for the Abrams, Bradley and Stryker programs to restore lost platform capability and host inbound technologies.  

This Program Element (PE) corrects vehicle deficiencies identified during Army operations; continues technical system upgrades to include the integration of applicable technologies on ground systems; addresses needed evolutionary enhancements to tracked combat vehicles; and develops technology improvements which have application to or insertion opportunities across multiple Ground Combat Systems vehicles.  This PE provides combat effectiveness and Operating and Support (O&amp;S) cost reduction enhancements for the Abrams tanks, Bradley Fighting Vehicles and Stryker Family of Vehicles (FOVs) through a series of product improvements.

The strategy for Abrams and Bradley will focus on incrementally delivering capability to the warfighter to meet both near-term limitations as well as mitigating gaps and maintaining combat overmatch in the future.  This effort was approved by the Army Acquisition Executive in 3Q FY 2011.  

The Abrams M1A2 SEP V2 and M2/M3A3 Bradley Fighting Vehicles are at or exceed Space, Weight, and Power-Cooling (SWaP-C) limitations.  In order to host and restore lost platform capability, the Abrams Tank and Bradley Fighting Vehicle programs will execute a series of Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) to support the current embedded systems and to facilitate integration of technologies currently in development under other existing Programs of Record.  The ECPs are not intended to exceed the operational capability outlined in current system requirements documents, but rather to ensure that the existing system performance is not further degraded and that Army mission equipment packages can be integrated on the Abrams and Bradley Platforms.

Stryker Improvement will address the development of Lethality, Survivability, Mobility, and Communication, Command and Control (C3) improvements within the Stryker Family of Vehicles (FoV).  Principal development efforts include upgrades associated with the ECP 1, Operational Needs Statement Lethality (ONS), and ECP 2 efforts.  ECP 1 power generation, suspension, and network upgrades will both restore Stryker Double-V Hull (DVH) Space, Weight, and Power-Cooling (SWaP-C) lost as a result of incorporating vehicle changes to counter threats encountered during deployment operations while allowing the future network to be hosted without further degradation in vehicle protection and mobility.  The Stryker ONS Lethality effort will address an Urgent Operational Need to increase the firepower of Stryker Infantry Carrier Vehicles (ICV) within the US Army European Command (USAREUR).  The ONS Lethality effort will integrate a 30mm-equipped weapon station that will provide USAREUR with precision direct firepower to overwhelm the enemy in encounter actions and suppressive fire to preserve mounted and dismounted freedom of movement.  The ECP 2 effort will focus on the integration of lethality upgrades such as a medium caliber weapon, under armor Javelin, and other capabilities that will improve suppressive fire and armored vehicle engagement capabilities across the Army's Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (SBCTs).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The M2/M3A3 Bradley Fighting Vehicle is at or exceeds Space, Weight, and Power-Cooling (SWAP-C) limitations. To restore lost platform capability and to host other Army Existing Programs of Record, the Bradley Fighting Vehicle program shall execute a series of Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs). ECP 1 improves vehicle's track and suspension while ECP 2 improves the power train and electrical system to enable the A3 fleet to host inbound technologies from Army Program of Records, including continued SINCGARS integration and Handheld Manpack Small (HMS) Radios and Joint Battle Command – Platform (JBC-P). The ECPs are not intended to exceed the operational capability outlined in current system requirement documents, but rather to ensure that the existing system performance is not further degraded and that Army mission equipment packages can be integrated on the Bradley platform. ECP 2 development effort will lead to a production start in FY 2017.   The Bradley M2A4 Vehicle is the combination of the M2A3 Base Vehicle with ECP 1 and ECP 2 components installed and integrated.  A separate integration effort begins in FY 2017 for an underbelly armor kit for improved survivability against blast threats.  Additionally, a follow on Engineering change proposal to ECP2, ECP 2B  integrates Third Generation Forward Looking Infrared (3G FLIR) to replace the current FLIR for increased lethality through improved target acquisition capability along with other technology upgrades and insertions (i.e. laser pointing, color camera, laser range finder, vehicle generated smoke, Vehicular Integration for Command, Control, Communication, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and, Reconnaissance/Electronic Warfare (C4ISR/EW) Interoperability (VICTORY) architecture compliance, Environmental Control System, etc). Product Manager Bradley will initiate a Non Development Initiative (NDI) to develop force protection and survivability improvements to counter evolving threats to include, but not limited to Active Protection System. Begins ECP3 analysis to build a program plan that acquires full buy back of all IFV approved requirements using common technologies with other Army investments.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>PE Number 0203735A/Project EE2 funds the Stryker Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) 1, Stryker Operational Needs Statement Lethality (ONS), Stryker Survivability Enhancements, and Stryker Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) 2 efforts.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Funding supports the development of Lethality, Survivability, Mobility, and Communication, Command and Control (C3) improvements within the Stryker Family of Vehicles (FoV).  Principal development efforts include upgrades associated with the ECP 1, Operational Needs Statement Lethality (ONS), Stryker Survivability Enhancements and ECP 2 efforts.  ECP 1 power generation, suspension, and network upgrades will both restore Stryker Double-V Hull (DVH) Space, Weight, and Power-Cooling (SWaP-C) lost as a result of incorporating vehicle changes to counter threats encountered during deployment operations while allowing the future network to be hosted without further degradation in vehicle protection and mobility.  The Stryker ONS Lethality effort will address an Urgent Operational Need to increase the firepower of Stryker Infantry Carrier Vehicles (ICV) within the US Army European Command (USAREUR).  The ONS Lethality effort will integrate a 30mm-equipped weapon station that will provide USAREUR with precision direct firepower to overwhelm the enemy in encounter actions and suppressive fire to preserve mounted and dismounted freedom of movement. The Stryker Survivability Enhancement will address evolving threats by assessing survivability improvements to include passive and active protection systems.  The ECP 2 effort will focus on the integration of lethality upgrades (i.e. medium caliber weapon and under armor Javelin), obsolescence, optics improvements and network lethality enhancements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>AAE approval for a 3rd DVH SBCT Bridgade of 337 Exchange Vehicles was given on July 26, 2013 (funded in G85100). Army System Acquisition Review Council (ASARC) production decision planned for 3rd quarter FY2016 will provide approval to begin 4th Brigade Double-V Hull (DVH) Engineering Change Proposal 1 production, which will be funded in Stryker Upgrade (G85200).  Stryker MOD (GM0100) is for Stryker Fleet modifications to include Operational Needs Statement Lethality production and fielding in FY16-18 and Engineering Change Proposal 1 retrofits in FY19-21.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Stryker Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) 1 effort will buy back the vehicle space, weight, and power margin lost due to the addition of numerous kits in response to eleven years of war (20-combat rotations &amp; 37+ million total miles), in order to allow integration of the future network (as directed by VCSA in August 2011) without further degrading the performance of the platform.  In May 2012, Stryker ECP 1 program (Phase I) was approved, permitting preliminary design and integration efforts on both the Flat Bottom (FB) and Double-V Hull (DVH) variants.  In March 2013, Phase II approved upgrading the mechanical power, electrical power generation, chassis upgrades and the in-vehicle network for the DVH vehicles.  Based on additional testing conducted in the summer of 2013, the decision was made to focus ECP efforts on the DVH and defer efforts on flat bottom Strykers.  ECP 1 Phase II contract, awarded November 25, 2013, continues development engineering, prototype build test and evaluation.  The Production decision (Phase III) will determine the production requirements of the technologies selected in Phase II.  

On 2 July 2015, ASARC authorization was granted to execute the Stryker Operational Needs Statement Lethality effort.  Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE), to include prototype builds and technical support to USG testing will be awarded as a sole-source, Cost Plus Fixed-Fee (CPFF) contract, with the prime contractor executing a source selection for the 30mm weapon station solution.  A Firm Fixed Price (FFP) production/retrofit contract is targeted for an award in 3rd quarter FY2016.

The ECP 2 effort will focus on the integration of lethality upgrades such as a medium caliber weapon, under armor Javelin, and other capabilities that will improve suppressive fire and armored vehicle engagement capabilities across the Army's Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (SBCTs).  In FY17, integration of an under armor Javelin capability will be initiated, along with a Trade Study and Cost-Benefit Analysis focused on medium caliber weapon system, and other lethality improvements (to support a 4th quarter FY2017 Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) decision).  A competitive EMD contract is targeted for award in 1st quarter FY2018 with USG developmental test initiated upon successful 4th quarter FY2018 Test Readiness Review.  A production Knowledge Point decision is targeted for 3rd quarter FY2020.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Gray Eagle provides Reconnaissance, Surveillance, Target Acquisition (RSTA), Command and Control, Communications Relay, Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), Battle Damage Assessment, and Manned-Unmanned Teaming capability.   Gray Eagle is a dedicated, assured, multi-mission Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) fielded to all Army Divisions, Army Intelligence and Security Command and Army Special Operations Command in support of the commander's warfighting priorities.  

The MQ-1C Gray Eagle Modification/Product Improvement Program (PIP) funding is required for the implementation of the Alternate Munition Integration integration, Global Positioning System (GPS) Denied, an electronic warfare capability, Universal Ground Control Station (UGCS) improvements, and Ground Based Sense And Avoid (GBSAA) Block II.

The Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 Aircraft Modification/Product Improvement funding of $35.793 million will support the development required to integrate JAGM, GPS Denied, UGCS Improvements into the MQ-1C Gray Eagle product.  GBSAA Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDTE) will provide development, integration and testing of Block 2.  Block 2 decreases operational &amp; sustainment costs, operator workload, hardware/software costs, increases system safety, and provides full material release for soldier operation.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>An Extended Range Multi-Purpose (ERMP) Operational Requirement Document (ORD) was approved by the Joint Requirement Oversight Council (JROC) 6 Apr 2005.  Milestone B occurred on 20 Apr 2005, and the System Development and Demonstration contract was awarded 8 Aug 2005, as a result of a competitive solicitation which included a vendor system capabilities demonstration.  A Capabilities Production Document (CPD) was approved 14 Mar 2009.  MQ-1C Gray Eagle completed FOTE 12 Jun 2015.  

The RDTE funded elements for GPS Denied, UGCS Improvements and Alternate Munition Integration addressed in this submission are planned for award on the Gray Eagle Engineering Services contract as a Sub-Engineering Services Memorandum (SESM) task order, and as Military Interdepartmental Purchase Requisitions (MIPRs) to various other Government Agencies. The purpose of the SESMs is to mature the respective designs to a level that Engineering Change Requests (ECR) are submitted to the Government via the Configuration Control Board (CCB). Following successful completion of the SESM and CCB approval, a contract modification to retrofit and/or cut-in the respective engineering change will be awarded on the appropriate Performance Based Logistics (PBL) or Production contract.  The RDTE funded element for GBSAA Block II addressed in this submission are planned for award on various contracts and MIPR actions to other government agencies.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Horizontal Battlefield Digitization is a strategy that allows warfighters, from the individual soldier and platform to echelons above corps, to share critical situation awareness (SA) and command and control (C2) information. It conducts analysis and evaluation of new information technologies, concepts, and applications of integrated management activities. Digital information technologies to acquire, exchange, and employ data throughout the operational environment, are used to provide an operational picture for leaders. This timely sharing of information significantly improves the ability to quickly make decisions, synchronize forces and fires, and increase the operational tempo. The major efforts included in the program element are: 1) Integration and synchronization of the Army's interoperability efforts; between joint and multi-national forces, combat material, and training efforts. 2) Systems engineering and integration of hardware and software from a System of Systems (SOS) perspective. 3) Develop Army Equipping Enterprise System (AE2S) integration of the Force Development Investment Information System (FDIIS), Army Flow Model (AFM), and Force Development Knowledge Center (FDKC) programs into a single integrated system. 

Digitization efforts are in support of the Army Equipping Strategy, National Defense Authorization Act 804, and OSD reports to Congress.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project funds the Army Equipping Enterprise System (AE2S) continued development and integration of the Force Development Investment Information System (FDIIS), Army Flow Model (AFM), and the Force Development Knowledge Center (FDKC) into an improved, single system. Continued development of the suite of the AE2S applications is necessary to create and improve workflow efficiencies amongst various organizations and data base systems, Active and Reserve Component equipment transparency reporting requirements, and Active and Reserve equipment fielding plans to the Solider according to the Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN). Additionally, this program element funds various Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) projects that provide system engineering expertise to provide unbiased advice, formulate course of actions, analyze programs and make technical support and process recommendations to create efficiencies and improve systems.  Specifically, these FFRDC projects support Army Mission Command and network architecture (operational and systems) development, technical and policy document review in support of planning and acquisition, network and joint integration and interoperability evaluations and assessments, program and database analysis, independent technical analysis, special studies, and acquisition process improvement.  In accordance with the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) 804 and support of the Office of the Secretary of Defense’s (OSD) report to Congress, the Army is poised to implement an incremental approach to software development and hardware/software capability integration. This process will improve effectiveness in the identification, assessment and acquisition of capability solutions for the Army</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Avenger Air Defense System is a lightweight, highly mobile surface-to-air missile and gun weapon system mounted on a High Mobility Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV).  The system employs a canopied turret consisting of a gunner position, two gyro-stabilized missile launcher pods containing four STINGER missiles each, a Forward Looking Infrared Receiver (FLIR), a Laser Range Finder (LRF), an Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) system, and a very high rate of fire .50 caliber machine gun.  The gun system is used against ground targets and to cover the Stinger missile dead-zone.  Avenger is capable of day, night and adverse weather operations; can be transported by UH-60L Blackhawk helicopter or C-130 aircraft; is air-droppable and can shoot on the move.  The Avenger system is operated by a two-man crew to counter Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs), cruise missiles, attack helicopters, and high performance fixed wing/rotary wing aircraft. The system can also be operated by remote control from a protected position up to 50 meters away from the fire unit. The system fills the line-of-sight rear component of the Forward Area Air Defense (FAAD) system.
These funds are provided to modify the Avenger to ensure viability and sustainability through the end of the useful life. Avenger is planned to remain in the force through the Fiscal Year (FY) 31. Avenger fills a capability gap which will be permanently filled by the Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment 2 Intercept (IFPC Inc 2-I) which will be fully fielded in FY31. The Avenger Fire Control Computer (AFCC) will undergo software and hardware upgrades that will enable the system to handle increased targeting capability realized with the latest version of the Forward Area Air Defense (FAAD) early warning system and ensures the system meets the latest Information Assurance (IA) requirements, upgraded analog to digital vehicle internal communication (VIC) system and Mode 5 cooperative target identification functions.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Avenger Product Improvement Program modifies Avenger and ensures that it is viable and sustainable through the end of its program life. Avenger will remain in the force through the fiscal year (FY) 2031 timeframe according to the Long Range Investments Requirements Analysis (LIRA), filling a capability gap to counter Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs), cruise missiles, attack helicopters, and high performance fixed wing rotary wing aircraft.  This capability will be permanently filled by the Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment 2 Intercept (IFPC Inc 2-I) which will be fully fielded in FY31. The Avenger Fire Control Computer (AFCC) will undergo software and hardware upgrades that will enable the system to handle increased targeting capability realized with the latest version of the Forward Area Air Defense (FAAD) early warning system and ensures the system meets the latest Information Assurance (IA) requirements, upgraded analog to digital vehicle internal communication (VIC) system, and Mode 5 cooperative target identification functions.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS) is the United States (U.S.) Army's primary 24/7, all-weather, and surface-to-surface artillery precision missile used by current and future Combatant Commanders to shape the battlefield with long-range fires against hard and soft stationary targets in open, complex, and urban environments. This effort will not build any new missiles or add to the overall inventory. Block (Blk) 1 missiles currently have warheads (WHs) that are non-compliant with the 2008 Department of Defense (DoD) policy on cluster munitions (CM). Starting with a Blk 1 missile, this modification effort will integrate, test, and qualify an ATACMS configuration to include a policy compliant WH, obsolescence refresh, and re-grained rocket motors. A characterization effort will also be performed to include qualification and flight testing to assess ATACMS performance with inclusion of a proximity sensor. Additional efforts include launcher updates to enable firing of the new ATACMS configuration.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>No FY 2017 funding request.  Beginning in FY 2017 Ground-Based Operational Surveillance System (Expeditionary) (G-BOSS(E) funding is now under PE0605033A Project EQ3.  Beginning in FY 2017 Integrated Ground Security, Surveillance and Response Capability (IGSSR-C) funding is now under PE0605029A Project EQ2.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>G-BOSS(E):  Ground-Based Operational Surveillance System (Expeditionary) (G-BOSS(E)) will replace the interim Persistent Surveillance System-Ground (PSS-G) Increment 1 towers with improved persistent surveillance capabilities and will provide network integration and better mobility utilizing modular configurations. G-BOSS(E) will replace obsolete, quick reaction capability (QRC) surveillance and force protections systems utilizing modular configurations: Light (man-transportable) for extra small base camps or small outpost/company, Medium (mid sensor height) for small to medium size base, and Heavy (high level sensor height) for large contingency base camps. G-BOSS(E) will operate in a stand-alone mode or as part of an integrated network utilizing government owned software, be easily operated and maintained, and be rugged enough to support employment in expeditionary operations worldwide.

IGSSR-C:  The Integrated Ground Security, Surveillance and Response Capability (IGSSR-C) is an Automated Information System (AIS) program. IGSSR-C has a requirement to provide a layered approach to integrate sensors, sensor systems and unmanned systems with automated fusion capabilities. The system will provide a Force Protection (FP) Common Operational Picture (COP) capability for CONUS fixed, OCONUS semi-fixed or expeditionary elements in all Operating Environments (OE). This capability will enable rapid decision analysis, speed the response process as well as increase information dissemination horizontally and vertically along the chain of command and with outside supporting organizations. IGSSR-C is a software centric fusion engine that connects legacy and emerging FP systems, legacy Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN), unmanned systems, biometric identification and forensic data systems. The desired end state is to achieve interoperability and COP with current and emerging FP systems used by Joint Forces, Department of Defense (DoD) agencies and multi-national forces.

Integrated Base Defense (IBD): The purpose of IBD Kitting is to harvest and refurbish physical security and Force Protection (FP) Non-Standard Equipment (NS-E) and package them into integrated and interoperable IBD Capabilities.  IBD provides integration of software and analytical capability to support the integration of systems in the field.  IBD employs an enterprise approach to enable IBD capabilities across the operational spectrum by leveraging interoperability efforts in support of the Integrated Unit, Base and Installation Protection (IUBIP) framework.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Ground-Based Operational Surveillance System (Expeditionary) (G-BOSS(E)) will replace the interim Persistent Surveillance System – Ground (PSS-G) Increment 1 towers with improved persistent surveillance capabilities along with network integration and better mobility utilizing modular configurations. The G-BOSS(E) Capability Design Document (CDD) was approved May 2014. In FY 2014, the Department of Defense (DoD) Physical Security Enterprise and Analysis Group (PSEAG) provided funds to conduct pre-milestone B activities. G-BOSS(E) received an approved Materiel Development Decision (MDD) from the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) on 4 December 2015. Pending successful Milestone B decision in FY 2016, the existing United States Marine Corps (USMC) tower's design (Ground Based Operational Surveillance System) (GBOSS) will be leveraged and modified to meet the Army's G-BOSS(E) program requirements. The acquisition strategy for FY 2017 is pending approval from the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA), with plans to leverage the Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) at Crane, Indiana and the Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD), Fort Belvoir, Virginia to provide system design, development, and integration support, as well as a Technical Data Package (TDP) to support future procurements. Milestone C is planned for FY 2019 to align G-BOSS(E), IGSSR-C, and Tactical Security System (TSS) in order to gain programmatic efficiencies. 

The Integrated Ground Security, Surveillance and Response Capability (IGSSR-C) provides a layered approach to integrate sensors, sensor systems and unmanned systems. The IGSSR-C Capability Design Document (CDD) was approved September 2013. IGSSR-C is made up of a suite of software that achieves integration, fusion and interoperability in support of the Army Acquisition Executive's Common Operating Environment (COE) Command Post Compute Environment (CPCE) and Sensor CE efforts. In FY 2014, the Department of Defense (DoD) Physical Security Enterprise and Analysis Group (PSEAG) provided funds to conduct pre-milestone B activities. IGSSR-C received an approved Materiel Development Decision (MDD) from the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) on 4 December 2015.  The acquisition strategy for FY 2017 is pending approval from the MDA, with plans to leverage the Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD), Fort Belvoir, Virginia to develop, integrate and test the Initial Capability (IC).  No production activities are planned for FY 2017. Milestone C is planned for FY 2019 to align Ground-Based Operational Surveillance System (Expeditionary) (G-BOSS(E)), Tactical Security System (TSS) and Integrated Ground Security, Surveillance and Response Capability (IGSSR-C) in order to gain programmatic efficiencies. 

The IBD acquisition strategy is to leverage existing IBD-related government organizations and to competitively award multiple contracts in support of IBD objectives for the development of holistic IBD architectures and products to support interoperability of fielded and emerging IBD-related systems.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Environmental Information Technology Management (EITM) Program is an Office of the Secretary of Defense sponsored program that was assigned to the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army for Environment, Safety and Occupational Health as the Department of Defense (DoD) Executive Agent by the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics in 2001.  The DoD Directive 4715.1E defined EITM mission is to ensure efficient use of enterprise environment, safety and occupational health (ESOH) corporate information management processes by providing and sustaining requirement-driven ESOH corporate data management, Congressional-reporting and public outreach tools to the DoD, and other DoD stakeholders.  Funding provided for this program will allow EITM to develop a Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Installations and Environment directed Chemical Management Enterprise Information Integration capability that will allow Army net-centric hazardous material and ESOH 2.0 NetCentric data management capabilities per the Secretary of the Army Directive 2009-03 "Army Data Management" and DoD Directive 8320.2 "Data Sharing in a Net-Centric Department of Defense."  Prior to funding being committed, Army and DoD environmental information technology stakeholders meet to determine which high priority EITM interface requirements need upgrades to incorporate new security and other information technology requirements.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The PATRIOT system includes a family of hardware, software, interceptors (GEM, PAC-2, PAC-3/MSE) and Ground Support Equipment.  As software and hardware improvements are developed, there is a continuing need for system level modeling, simulation, integration and testing.  Modeling and Simulation allow for performance assessment against all threats that would not be possible in flight tests due to cost, target and range constraints.  Flight testing is periodically required for validation of the Modeling and Simulation as well as satisfying Army Test and Evaluation Command/Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (ATEC/DOTE) requirements of segment improvements. 

PATRIOT is an integral part of the overall Air and Missile Defense (AMD) Architecture and enables the incremental fielding of the system capability for Army Air and Missile Defense Battalions.

FY2017 base dollars in the amount of $69.417 million continues program development with the integration of missile and ground system software and hardware to complete Post Deployment Build-8 (PDB-8) and continue with PDB-8.05 activities.  Continues the testing program to support the Test and Evaluation Master Plan (TEMP) and system testing/analysis for PDB-8/8.05 Development Test and Evaluation (DTE) and Initial Operational Test &amp; Evaluation (IOT&amp;E).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The PATRIOT system includes a family of hardware, software, interceptors (GEM, PAC-2,PAC-3/MSE) and Ground Support Equipment.  As software and hardware improvements are developed, there is a continuing need for system level modeling, simulation, integration and testing.  Modeling and Simulation allows for performance assessment against all threats that would not be possible in flight tests due to cost, target and range constraints.  Flight testing is periodically required for validation of Modeling and Simulation as well as satisfying ATEC/DOTE requirements of segment improvements. 

PATRIOT is an integral part of the overall Air and Missile Defense (AMD) Architecture and enables the incremental fielding of the system capability for Army Air and Missile Defense Battalions.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The design objective of the PATRIOT system is to provide an element of an integrated Air and Missile Defense system capable of being modified to cope with the evolving threat.  This strategy minimizes technological risks and provides a means of enhancing system capability through planned upgrades of deployed systems.  PAC-3 system development efforts further improve system capabilities against emerging and reactive threats.  The PAC-3 Missile Program focuses on developing, fabricating and testing the high velocity, hit to kill, surface to air missile and associated ground support equipment to provide essential increases in battle space, accuracy, lethality and firepower to counter and destroy evolving air defense threats.  The missile performance is demonstrated through a series of flight tests and modeling and simulation activities.  The PAC-3 MSE program evolves the PAC-3 system providing extended ranges, insensitive munitions enhancements, and greater logistical flexibility.  The PAC-3 MSE will be fielded to U.S. PATRIOT units.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>Beginning in FY2015, Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) has its own separate Program Element, 0205778A, to include Projects EG2 (GMLRS Alternative Warhead) and EG3 (Guided MLRS), previously under Program Element 0603778A Project Codes 78G and 784, respectively.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Projects EG2/EG3. GMLRS rockets are surface-to-surface artillery rockets fired from the Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) and High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) launchers.  GMLRS rockets provide 24/7, all-weather precision fires to engage both area and point targets at short, medium, and long ranges.  

The GMLRS Program consists of three separate increments: GMLRS Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munition (DPICM) cluster munition to engage area or imprecisely located targets; GMLRS Unitary utilizes a 200 lbs. high explosive warhead to engage point targets with limited collateral damage; and GMLRS Alternative Warhead (AW) which has been developed as a non-cluster munition to replace GMLRS DPICM.  GMLRS DPICM Production was terminated in response to the June 2008 Department of Defense (DoD) Cluster Munitions Policy.  GMLRS Unitary is currently in full rate production.  GMLRS AW completed Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) and entered full rate production in FY2015.  The GMLRS AW rocket is 90% common with the Unitary variant.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>Beginning in FY2015, Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) has its own separate Program Element, 0205778A, to include Projects EG2 (GMLRS Alternative Warhead) and EG3 (Guided MLRS), previously under Program Element 0603778A Project Codes 78G and 784, respectively.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The United States (U.S.) Army funded the development of the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) Alternative Warhead (AW) increment under the EG2-GMLRS AW project code.  GMLRS AW has been developed as a non-cluster munition to replace GMLRS Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munitions (DPICM) and service the same area and imprecisely-located targets.  GMLRS DPICM Production was terminated in response to the June 2008 Department of Defense (DoD) Cluster Munitions Policy.

GMLRS AW successfully completed the combined Milestone C (MS C) and Full Rate Production (FRP) decision review on 8 April 2015. Initial Operational Capability (IOC) is planned for December 2016. The acquisition strategy is to procure AW as part of the annual GMLRS FRP contract.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Joint Tactical Ground Station (JTAGS) is a post-production, ACAT III program and is designated as a DoD Space Program.  JTAGS provides missile warning message data for the Air and Missile Defense (AMD) architecture and improves performance for Integrated Air and Missile Defense Fire Control Systems/Composite Army Air and Missile Defense Brigades. The JTAGS Program Element (PE) supports development and test to meet JTAGS ORD thresholds using improved sensors and algorithms as Pre-Planned Product Improvements (P3I).  Presently, JTAGS Block 1 is a transportable information processing system, receiving and processing in-theater, direct down-linked data from Defense Support Program (DSP) and other Infrared (IR) satellites. JTAGS then disseminates near real time warning, alerting, and cueing information on ballistic missile launches and other tactical events of interest throughout the theater using existing communication networks, providing critical support to Combatant Commanders in their Areas of Responsibility (AOR).  Four OCONUS deployed JTAGS units constitute DoD's only in-theater system providing space-based missile warning.  The fifth CONUS system is being used as an institutional trainer but is a deployable asset.   JTAGS is designated as the in-theater element of the United States Strategic Command's Theater Event System (TES). JTAGS supports all Theater Missile Defense pillars and by being located in-theater, affords the shortest sensor to shooter connectivity.  P3I Improvements will upgrade JTAGS to a new Block 2 configuration for operation with the next generation of Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) satellites, and will improve warning tactical parameters and timeliness.  JTAGS Block 2 P3I is on contract for a two-Phase development effort. Phase 1 deshelters five systems, adds SBIRS Geosynchronous (GEO) scanner capability (FY 2012-16) and updates hardware/software/communication systems.  Phase 2 activities are broken into three spirals to expedite getting critical capabilities fielded sooner. Spiral 1 includes stereo SBIRS GEO starer sensor and P/L 4 data, and Net Centric capabilities (FY 2015-17). Spiral 2 includes Cobra Brass and "Walkers" data (FY2017-18). Spiral 3 includes software tuning and testing to the Operational Requirements Document (ORD)(FY2018-19).  JROC-Memos 197-12 and 113-13 directs fielding of JTAGS P3I Block 2 Phase 1 by FY15 and Phase 2 by FY 2017.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Under this program element, critical improvements will be developed making maximum use of Non-Developmental Items (NDI)/Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) components.  After design and integration, the system will be subject to thorough developmental and validation/verification testing to verify performance, operational effectiveness and suitability. P3I Improvements will upgrade JTAGS to a new Block 2 configuration for operation with the next generation of Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) satellites, and will improve warning tactical parameters and timeliness.  JTAGS Block 2 P3I is on contract for a two-Phase development effort. Phase 1 deshelters five systems, adds SBIRS Geosynchronous (GEO) scanner capability (FY 2012-16) and updates hardware/software/communication systems.  Phase 2 activities are broken into three spirals to expedite getting critical capabilities fielded sooner. Spiral 1 includes stereo SBIRS GEO starer sensor and P/L 4 data, and Net Centric capabilities (FY 2015-17). Spiral 2 includes Cobra Brass and "Walkers" data (FY2017-18). Spiral 3 includes software tuning and testing to the Operational Requirements Document (ORD)(FY2018-19).  JROC-Memos 197-12 and 113-13 directs fielding of JTAGS P3I Block 2 Phase 1 by FY15 and Phase 2 by FY 2017.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Information Assurance Development supports the implementation of the National Security Agency (NSA) developed Communications Security (COMSEC) technologies into the Army by providing COMSEC system capabilities through encryption, trusted software or standard operating procedures, and integrating these mechanisms into specific systems in support of securing the National Network Enterprise in as transparent a manner as possible.  This entails architecture studies, system integration and testing, developing installation kits, and certification and accreditation of Automation Information Systems. The program assesses, develops and integrates Information Assurance (IA)/COMSEC tools (hardware and software) which provide protection for fixed infrastructure post, camp and station networks as well as tactical networks.  The cited work is consistent with Strategic Planning Guidance and the Army Modernization and Strategy Plan.

Information Assurance Development funding Implements and establishes functional and technical boundaries of cryptographic, key management and IA capabilities In Coordination with (ICW) the National Security Agency (NSA), the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), and Joint Services, to secure National Security Systems (NSS), and National Security Information (NSI).  Technical evaluations assess the security, operational effectiveness and network interoperability of advanced concept technologies to develop policies, standards, and fundamental building blocks for Army COMSEC capabilities that reduce the risk of future materiel solutions that could underperform and disrupt classified operations. Develop and publish the Cryptographic Modernization strategy to identify, standardize, and govern the insertion of IA capabilities to bridge operational gaps and support the DoD and NSA mandated requirements to enhance network capacity while providing for secure information exchange of voice, video, and data IAW the Army Network Campaign Plan.  This will be accomplished by interoperability evaluation, standards testing, and IA System of System Network Vulnerability Assessments (IA SoS NVA) of Army Capability Sets for IA/COMSEC capabilities that provide protections for fixed infrastructure post, camp, and station networks. 

The Defensive Cyberspace Operations (DCO) program provides initial capabilities that enable passive and active cyberspace defense operations to preserve friendly cyberspace capabilities and protect data, networks, net-centric capabilities, and other designated systems.  Big Data Pilot provides an advanced analytics capability capable of ingesting structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data from multiple data sources (e.g., Joint Regional Security Stacks (JRSS), intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems, network device log files, trouble tickets, firewalls, proxies, web and applications server log files, etc) and proves situational awareness of cyberspace battlefield.  It provides the computer network defense provider with common analytic platform which informs and reduces risk associated with future material solutions and forms a blueprint for future Big Data Analytics.  Big Data (analysis-of-all DoD Information Network sensor data) provides two optimized and accredited clusters deployed in support of JRSS and Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN) with a tools suite accessible to Cyber Mission Forces via secure remote access.  The Army's DCO activities are a construct of active cyberspace defenses which provide synchronized, real-time capability to discover, detect, analyze, and mitigate threats to and vulnerability of DoD networks and systems. 

The Army Key Management System (AKMS) is the Army's implementation of the National Security Agency's (NSA) Electronic Key Management System (EKMS) program automating the functions of Communications Security (COMSEC) electronic key management, control, planning, and distribution.  AKMS supports the Army's ability to communicate and distribute data on the Army's tactical and strategic networks by limiting adversarial access to, and reducing the vulnerability of, Army Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence (C4I) systems.  The AKMS System of Systems (SoS) systems components are the Local COMSEC Management Software (LCMS), Automated Communications Engineering Software (ACES) and Simple Key Loader (SKL).  The NSA EKMS program is being replaced by the NSA Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) Program.  The transition of the legacy EKMS LCMS to the modern KMI Management Client Nodes (MGC)s began in FY12 and must be completed by the EKMS Tier 2 sunset date of December 2017.  AKMS supports the transition to Army Key Management Infrastructure (AKMI). 
 
The Army Key Management Infrastructure (AKMI) is the Army's implementation of the National Security Agency's (NSA) Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) ACAT IAM program.  AKMI supports Department of Defense (DoD) Global Information Grid (GIG) Net Centric and Crypto Modernization Initiatives and supports emerging requirements transitioned from the Army Key Management System (AKMS).  AKMI automates the functions of Communications Security (COMSEC) electronic key management, control, planning, and distribution.  AKMI supports the Army's ability to communicate and distribute data on the Army's tactical and strategic networks by limiting adversarial access to, and reducing the vulnerability of, Army Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence (C4I) systems.  The AKMI Program includes the Management Clients (MGC), Automated Communications Engineering Software (ACES) and Next Generation Load Device (NGLD) Family of devices to include the NGLD Small, Medium and Large.  AKMI provides an integrated, operational environment that brings essential key management functions in-band.  Objective AKMI will leverage NSA KMI program to provide secure software provisioning, will support legacy and modern ECU’s, simplifies all aspects of key provisioning and ECU management with traceability to individuals, expands operations to DoD unclassified networks, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and Coalition users, automates manual business processes to increase Soldier efficiency, transforms key delivery from manual to an automate enterprise service and will provide an Over the Network Keying (OTNK) capability to support Cryptographic Modernization Initiatives (CMI). 

The Crypto Modernization program supports using NSA developed COMSEC technologies within the Army providing encryption, trusted software, or standard operating procedures, and integrating these mechanisms into specified systems in support of securing the National Network Enterprise in as transparent a manner as possible.  This entails architecture studies, system integration and testing, developing installation kits, and certification and accreditation of Automation Information Systems.  The program assesses, develops and integrates emerging Information Assurance (IA)/COMSEC tools (hardware and software) which provide protection for fixed infrastructure post, camp, and station networks as well as tactical networks.  The cited work is consistent with Strategic Planning Guidance and the Army Modernization and Strategy Plan.

Embedded Cryptographic Modernization Initiative (ECMI) is an upgrade activity that will ensure enduring Army radios remain secure by operating with modern crypto keys.  Tactical radios using embedded cryptographic systems will no longer be able to communicate securely after Crypto Keys expire due to Cease Key dates documented in the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Staff instruction (CJCSI) 6510. In order to ensure Warfighters continue to have secured communications (i.e., encrypted data and voice), Army tactical radios are required to modernize their cryptographic capabilities by implementing the modern algorithms.  If cease key dates are not met, Army will be forced to communicate at risk.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program supports the implementation of National Security Agency (NSA) developed Communications Security (COMSEC) technologies into the Army by providing COMSEC system capabilities through encryption, trusted software, or standard operating procedures; and integrating these mechanisms into specified systems in support of securing the National Network Enterprise in as transparent a manner as possible. 

This entails architecture studies, system integration and testing, developing, installation kits, and certification and accreditation of Automation Information Systems. The program assesses, develops and integrates Information Assurance (IA)/COMSEC tools (hardware and software) which provide protection for fixed infrastructure post, camp and station networks as well as tactical networks.  The cited work is consistent with Strategic Planning Guidance and the Army Modernization and Strategy Plan. 

Implement and establish functional and technical boundaries of cryptographic, key management and IA capabilities In Coordination with (ICW) the National Security Agency (NSA), the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), and Joint Services, to secure National Security Systems (NSS), and National Security Information (NSI).  Technical evaluations assess the security, operational effectiveness and network interoperability of advanced concept technologies to develop policies, standards, and fundamental building blocks for Army COMSEC capabilities that reduce the risk of future materiel solutions that could underperform and disrupt classified operations. 

Develop and publish the Cryptographic Modernization strategy to identify, standardize, and govern the insertion of IA capabilities to bridge operational gaps and support the DoD and NSA mandated requirements to enhance network capacity while providing for secure information exchange of voice, video, and data IAW the Army Network Campaign Plan.  This will be accomplished by interoperability evaluation, standards testing, and IA System of System Network Vulnerability Assessments (IA SoS NVA) of Army Capability Sets for IA/COMSEC capabilities that provide protections for fixed infrastructure post, camp, and station networks. 

The Defensive Cyberspace Operations (DCO) program provides initial capabilities that enable passive and active cyberspace defense operations to preserve friendly cyberspace capabilities and protect data, networks, net-centric capabilities, and other designated systems.  Big Data Pilot provides an advanced analytics capability capable of ingesting structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data from multiple data sources (e.g., Joint Regional Security Stacks (JRSS), intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems, network device log files, trouble tickets, firewalls, proxies, web and applications server log files, etc) and provides situational awareness of the cyberspace battlefield.  It provides the computer network defense provider with a common analytic platform which informs and reduces risk associated with future material solutions and forms a blueprint for future Big Data Analytics.  Big Data (analysis-of-all DoD Information Network sensor data) provides two optimized and accredited clusters deployed in support of JRSS and Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN) with a tools suite accessible to Cyber Mission Forces via secure remote access.  The Army's DCO activities are a construct of active cyberspace defenses which provide synchronized, real-time capability to discover, detect, analyze, and mitigate threats to and vulnerability of DoD networks and systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>Army Key Management System (AKMS) (501) realigned to Key Management Infrastructure (KMI)PE/Project (373140)(DV4) in FY17.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Army Key Management System (AKMS) is the Army's implementation of the National Security Agency's (NSA) Electronic Key Management System (EKMS) program automating the functions of Communications Security (COMSEC) electronic key management, control, planning, and distribution.  AKMS supports the Army's ability to communicate and distribute data on the Army's tactical and strategic networks by limiting adversarial access to, and reducing the vulnerability of, Army Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence (C4I) systems.  The AKMS System of Systems (SoS) components are the Local COMSEC Management Software (LCMS), Automated Communications Engineering Software (ACES) and Simple Key Loader (SKL).

The NSA EKMS program is being replaced by the NSA Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) Program.  The transition of the legacy EKMS LCMS to the modern KMI Management Client Nodes (MGC)s began in FY12 and must be completed by the EKMS Tier 2 sunset date of December 2017.

AKMS supports the transition to Army Key Management Infrastructure (AKMI).  Some components of the AKMS SoS will be replaced under AKMI while others will be modified or adapted to meet the new AKMI requirements.  Two critical components required for the transition include the development of the Mission Planning Management Support System (MPMSS) and the ability to support Over the Network Keying (OTNK).

MP/MSS creates a secure, highly automated interface enabling secure transparent provisioning of KMI products.  MP/MSS service is being developed by NSA but each Service is responsible for interface development and final integration into their infrastructure.  ACES is the initial target for the interface to MPMSS.  NSA will be providing additional capabilities and updates to the MP/MSS interface specification through technology insertions in the out years.  The Army must then adjust to these changes delivered by NSA.   

One of the major enhancement in the KMI architecture is the ability to leverage OTNK.  The end state for the Army is to leverage AKMI capabilities (OTNK, Mission Plan/Mission Support System (MP/MSS), Delivery Only Client (DOC), Client Host Only (CHO)) to increase automation, reduce soldier oversight, manage, and deliver key products to from the tactical edge up through strategic ECU's.  Within AKMS this capability will be focused on ACES and SKL platform.  ACES and SKL will act as an interim solution for all legacy ECUs to be recognized on the KMI network until they can be upgraded to be fully KMI aware.  OTNK developments began in FY2015.

To support this transition, a new KMI compliant cryptographic engine must be developed for the SKL platform.  The KOV-21 card used in current Army Tier 3 fill devices has hardware obsolescence issues and does not support the new capabilities being delivered by KMI.  Redesigning and developmental efforts using modern and readily available components for use in the Army's SKL devices have been initiated.  The redesign of the current KOV-21 card is referred to as the KOV-21 Replacement and is an extension of the KOV-21 card as a technology insertion.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This release will include the 1) KMI product ordering, 2) distribution management and the Spin 1 backlog.  This installment will make it easier for the KMI Operating Account Manager (KOAM) to locally generate key for incoming requests where the key is not already on-hand.  Additionally, this release will virtualize all needed components for MPMSS.  The development of the Army Mission Planner software that will interface with the KMI MPMSS API will begin FY15 and be carried out through FY18.  The Army Mission Planner software will be integrated and tested with the KMI MPMSS API Spin 2 capabilities.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Army Key Management System (AKMS) is an ACAT III Program of Record (POR) under PL Network Enablers (PL Net E).  It is the Army's implementation of the National Security Agency (NSA)'s Electronic Key Management System (EKMS).  The AKMS allows the Army to manage, control, plan, and distribute electronic key for the ~1.5 million End Cryptographic Units (ECU)s necessary to communicate and distribute data on the Army's tactical and strategic networks. 

AKMS was initially approved for Milestone III in FY99.  The AKMS System of Systems originally included Local COMSEC Management Software (LCMS), Automated Communications Engineering Software (ACES) and Data Transfer Device (DTD) (AN-CYZ-10).  In 2QFY02, the PEO C3T Milestone Decision Authority approved the procurement of the Simple Key Loader (SKL) as the replacement for the DTD within the AKMS System of Systems (SoS) POR.  AKMS is a fully fielded POR that undergoes modifications to meet emerging operational needs.

The NSA EKMS program is being replaced by the NSA Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) Program.  As the DoD Key Management Lead, NSA is dictating the change from EKMS to KMI.  The Army's implementation of the NSA KMI is the Army Key Management Infrastructure (AKMI) program.  Some components of the AKMS SoS will be replaced under AKMI while others will be modified or adapted to meet the new AKMI requirements.  

The LCMS component of the AKMS SoS (AN/GYK-49) is fully fielded.  The LCMS is assigned to the COMSEC Account Manager/COMSEC Custodian.   LCMS most recent hardware refresh was completed in FY12.  The current software baseline is 5.1.0.5 with certain select accounts upgrading to v5.2 based on operational needs.  Further LCMS software releases are not anticipated.  LCMS workstations will be replaced by KMI Management Client (MGC) Nodes before the NSA mandated EKMS Tier 2 sunset of December 2017.  EKMS Common Tier 1 operations and Tier 1 operational support continues to be provided by CECOM.  LCMS hardware is sustained by CSLA until fully replaced by the KMI MGC.

The ACES component of the AKMS SoS (AN/GYK-33) current hardware platform is a Dell E6500 non-ruggedized laptop fielded to S6, Spectrum Managers and some COMSEC Account Managers at Battalion level and above.  ACES is undergoing a hardware technology refresh and will be replacing 1/5 quantity of laptops each year.  The current version of ACES is 3.4.  Software is released on an annual basis and coincides with the Capability Set delivery schedule.  PL Net E currently holds the software development contract.  As the Tier 2.5 component, ACES operates between the LCMS (Tier 2) and the SKL (Tier 3).  It links the key data from the LCMS with mission planning data for a single load by the SKL into the ECUs.  ACES will continue with modifications to support the AKMI System of Systems.  In order to support AKMI, ACES must be modified to seamlessly operate within the KMI architecture.

The SKL is the primary Army fill device and is the Tier 3 component of the AKMS SoS (AN/PYQ-10).  The SKL is fully fielded to the Army.  Army holds the sole full rate production procurement contract for the SKL, which is heavily utilized by other DoD and civil services as well as FMS customers.  The SKL repair capability is with the Original Equipment Manufacturer but TYAD is developing an organic depot repair support.  The SKL and its cryptographic engine are facing hardware obsolescence issues. SKL v3.1 in combination with a new KMI compliant cryptographic engine resolves these issues and lays the foundation for the Army's Next Generation Load Device- Medium capability.  The SKL v3.1 modifications will be made to the Army's existing fleet of the fill devices via a modification kit starting in FY15.  The KMI cryptographic engine is reliant on the CERDEC-led RESCUE RDT&amp;E effort that began in FY14.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) (DV4) was realigned from project 491 in FY2014.  Army Key Management System (AKMS) (501) realigned to Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) (DV4) in FY2017.  AKMI supports infrastructure requirements in support of Key Management.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Army Key Management Infrastructure (AKMI) is the Army's implementation of the National Security Agency's (NSA) Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) ACAT IAM program.  AKMI supports Department of Defense (DoD) Global Information Grid (GIG) Net Centric and Crypto Modernization Initiatives and supports emerging requirements transitioned from the Army Key Management System (AKMS).  AKMI automates the functions of Communications Security (COMSEC) electronic key management, control, planning, and distribution.  AKMI supports the Army's ability to communicate and distribute data on the Army's tactical and strategic networks by limiting adversarial access to, and reducing the vulnerability of, Army Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence (C4I) systems.  

The AKMI Program includes the Management Clients (MGC), Automated Communications Engineering Software (ACES) and Next Generation Load Device (NGLD) Family of devices to include the NGLD Small, Medium and Large.  AKMI provides an integrated, operational environment that brings essential key management functions in-band.  Objective AKMI will leverage NSA KMI program to provide secure software provisioning, will support legacy and modern ECU’s, simplifies all aspects of key provisioning and ECU management with traceability to individuals, expands operations to DoD unclassified networks, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and Coalition users, automates manual business processes to increase Soldier efficiency, transforms key delivery from manual to an automate enterprise service and will provide an Over the Network Keying (OTNK) capability to support Cryptographic Modernization Initiatives (CMI). 

One of the major enhancement in the AKMI architecture is the ability for to leverage the various capabilities and services from NSA KMI.  The end state for the Army is to leverage AKMI capabilities (OTNK, Mission Plan/Mission Support System (MP/MSS), Delivery Only Client (DOC), Client Host Only (CHO)) to increase automation, reduce soldier oversight, manage, and deliver key products to from the tactical edge up through strategic ECU’s.  The objective AKMI capabilities will be found in all of the products across the AKMI product line to include MGC, ACES and NGLD family of fill devices.  NGLD family will be an enduring solution to bridge the gap until legacy ECUs are fully modernized.  
   
The NGLD Medium and Large are reliant on the Reprogrammable Single Chip Universal Encryptor (RESCUE), a new KMI compliant cryptographic engine that is currently being developed.  The KOV-21 card currently used in Army Simple Key Loader (SKL) fill devices has hardware obsolescence issues and does not support OTNK.  Redesign and developmental efforts using modern and readily available components for use in the Army's SKL devices have been initiated under the RESCUE program.  The redesign of the current KOV-21 card is referred to as the KOV-21 Replacement and is an extension of the RESCUE program as a technology insertion.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>KMI Awareness initiative creates a secure, highly automated interface in providing future Over the Network Keying (OTNK) capability to legacy End Crypto Units (ECUs).  This initiative will allow ECUs to receive, authenticate, and decrypt OTNK messages and increases WarFighter survivability by minimizing the need for Soldiers to travel to obtain keys. The KOV 21 card, previously in production through NSA for use in the Simple Key Loader (SKL) and the Secure DTD 2000 System (SDS), is nearing the end of life due to unavailability of parts. Redesigning and developmental efforts using modern and readily available components for use in the Army's SKL and Next Generation Load Devices (NGLDs) are currently underway. The redesign of the current KOV 21 card is referred to as the KOV 21 Replacement and is an extension of the KOV 21 card as a technology insertion. The KOV 21 Replacement will also address requirements codified in the NGLD CPD and the AKMI CPD that were technologically unachievable with the KOV 21 card.</r2:Description>

The RESCUE effort is focused on the development, maturation, evaluation, and certification of the technology needed to meet the requirements of NSA and the Army.  The RESCUE technology can be reused, scaled, and/or repackaged to satisfy the cryptographic requirements for other programs/platforms requiring or needing a KMI aware or Product Delivery Enclave (PDE) enabled solution.  The KOV-21 replacement will be developed to be compatible with and installed in the SKL v3.1 to meet the Army's NGLD Medium requirement.  The KOV-21 replacement will also be used in the future Army NGLD Large device.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Army Key Management Infrastructure (AKMI) is a Non Program of Record (POR) under PD Network Enablers (PL Net E).  AKMI is the Army's implementation of the National Security Agency (NSA) Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) ACAT IAM Program of Record.  The AKMI will allow the Army to manage, control, plan, and distribute electronic key for the ~1.5 million End Cryptographic Units (ECU)s necessary to communicate and distribute data on the Army's tactical and strategic networks. 

AKMI initial Army Acquisition Program Baseline (APB) was approved 2QFY12.  The AKMI Program will include the Management Clients (MGC), Automated Communications Engineering Software (ACES) and Next Generation Load Device (NGLD) Family. Each component of the AKMI Program is in a different phase of the acquisition cycle.  

The NSA KMI Program is replacing the NSA Electronic Key Management System (EKMS) program.  As the DoD Key Management Lead, NSA is dictating the change from EKMS to KMI by a sunset date of December 2017.  Components of the AKMI Program will be retained and adapted from the legacy AKMS program while others will be developed and fielded to meet AKMI requirements.  

The NGLD family of devices will become the primary Army fill devices and Tier 3 component of the AKMI Program.  The NGLD Capability Production Document (CPD) was signed 4QFY13.  The NGLD CPD calls for a family of 3 devices (small, medium, and large) to meet the AKMI requirements.  The AKMI program has partnered with RDECOM CERDEC to develop a KMI compliant cryptographic engine, the Reprogrammable Single Chip Universal Encryptor (RESCUE).  The Army will gain the NGLD Medium capability through the SKL v3.1 in combination with a new KMI compliant cryptographic engine, the RESCUE, the first iteration of the RESCUE being the KOV-21 Replacement.  The redesign of the current SKL cryptographic engine, the KOV-21 card, is required due to parts obsolescence and inability to be KMI Aware.  The KOV-21 Replacement is an extension of the RESCUE program as a technology insertion into the SKL v3.1 which in turn meets the NGLD Medium CPD requirements.  The NGLD Medium will be available in FY18.  Additionally, the Army NGLD large strategy is highly reliant on the development of the RESCUE and will drive a final acquisition decision in FY18.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>DV5 - The Crypto Modernization line was established in Sept 2012.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program supports using National Security Agency (NSA) developed Communications Security (COMSEC) technologies within the Army providing encryption, trusted software, or standard operating procedures, and integrating these mechanisms into specified systems in support of securing the National Network Enterprise in as transparent a manner as possible.  

This entails architecture studies, system integration and testing, developing installation kits, and certification and accreditation of Automation Information Systems.  The program assesses, develops and integrates emerging Information Assurance (IA)/COMSEC tools (hardware and software) which provide protection for fixed infrastructure post, camp, and station networks as well as tactical networks.  The cited work is consistent with Strategic Planning Guidance and the Army Modernization and Strategy Plan.

The Embedded Cryptographic Modernization Initiative (ECMI) is designed to investigate Courses Of Action, conduct a Material Solution Analysis, and execute upgrade activities to ensure all enduring Army communications and data equipment that employs embedded cryptographic hardware will be able to accept and utilize modern cryptographic key.

Acquisition Strategy - The objective of this program is to integrate and validate hardware and software solutions to provide COMSEC superiority in order to protect against threats, increase battlefield survivability/lethality, and enable critical Mission Command activities. The objective of the Cryptographic Systems program is to provide adaptive, flexible, and programmable cryptographic systems using best practices, lessons learned and programmatic management to meet the challenge of modernizing the Army's aging cryptographic systems. The effort will support the network operations from end-to-end throughout the force and the Common Operating Environment (COE) thus mitigating Information Assurance (IA) networked vulnerabilities to National information security systems.  CDD, approved 15 Jul 10; ICD, approved 25 Mar 11; AAO; approved 15 Dec 11 and increased, 19 Jun 15. 

FY17 $10.659M from the RDT&amp;E line 0303140A-DV5 is required for a planned 4QFY17 solicitation of the ECMI development contracts, obligation of planned prior year funding expected 1QFY18 with contract awards.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Embedded Cryptographic Modernization Initiative (ECMI) is an upgrade activity that will ensure enduring Army radios remain secure by operating with modern crypto keys.  Tactical radios using embedded cryptographic systems will no longer be able to communicate securely after Crypto Keys expire due to Cease Key dates documented in the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Staff instruction (CJCSI) 6510. In order to ensure Warfighters continue to have secured communications (i.e., encrypted data and voice), Army tactical radios are required to modernize their cryptographic capabilities by implementing the modern algorithms.  If cease key dates are not met, Army will be forced to communicate at risk.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Global Combat Support System-Army (GCSS-Army) program has two components: a functional component titled GCSS-Army and a technology enabler component titled Army Enterprise Systems Integration Program (AESIP). GCSS-Army coupled with AESIP are information and communications technology investments that will provide key enabling support to the transformation of the Army into a network-centric, knowledge-based future force. The GCSS-Army approved Capability Description Document (CDD) and Capability Production Document (CPD) require an enterprise approach to replace current logistics and maintenance Standard Army Management Information Systems (STAMIS). GCSS-Army will provide the Army's Sustainment Support for the warfighter with a seamless flow of timely, accurate, accessible and secure information management that gives combat forces a decisive edge. AESIP will provide the system's enterprise hub services, centralized master data management and cross-functional business intelligence/analytics. GCSS-Army will implement best business practices to streamline supply, accountability, maintenance, distribution, and reporting procedures in support of the future force transition path of the Army Campaign Plan.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>GCSS-Army is the tactical unit / installation logistics and financial system for the U.S. Army. GCSS-Army is an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solution that will track supplies, spare parts and organizational equipment. It will track unit maintenance, total cost of ownership and other financial transactions related to logistics for all Army units. This modernized application will subsume outdated Standard Army Management Information Systems (STAMIS) that are not financially compliant and integrate about numerous local supply and logistics databases into a single, enterprise-wide authoritative system. GCSS-Army will be financially compliant and is a key component for the Army Enterprise strategy to be financially auditable by the end of FY17. When fully deployed, GCSS-Army will affect every supply room, motor pool, direct support repair shop, warehouse, Director of Operational Logistics (DOL) and property book office in the Army.
GCSS-Army will modernize automated logistics by implementing best business practices to streamline supply operations, maintenance operations, property accountability, and tactical logistics and financial management and integration procedures in support of the Future Force transition path of the Army Campaign Plan.  GCSS-Army is a key component of the Federated ERP Integration solution that will optimize tactical logistics and finance domain business processes into a single federated approach.  It will eliminate the need for extensive maintenance and modification of aging, diverse software systems resulting in improved and efficient change control and configuration management through implementation of an enterprise system.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>GCSS-Army has an evolutionary acquisition strategy as defined in DoD Directive 5000.01 and DoD Instruction 5000.02 and will define, develop, and deploy an initial operational capability based upon proven technology, time-phased requirements, projected threat assessments, and demonstrated manufacturing capabilities. Increment 1 will be a viable stand alone capability that will not require subsequent releases to be operational.  

GCSS-Army Increment I is being implemented in three releases.

Release 1.0 replaces: Standard Army Retail Supply System (SARSS) at one Direct Support Unit (DSU) in the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment (ACR), Fort Irwin, California. An Operational Assessment (OA) was conducted on Release 1.0 and information is gathered through Continuous Evaluation. 

Release 1.1 subsumes Release 1.0 and provides over 80% of the required GCSS-Army capability. 

Release 1.2 represents the complete baseline with all required capabilities provided.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Army Enterprise Systems Integration Program (AESIP), mission is to integrate Army business processes by providing a single source for enterprise hub services, centralized master data management, and business intelligence and analytics. AESIP is the principle GCSS-Army Business Intelligence system and will aggregate data for enterprise reporting. AESIP will support the Army's federated approach and enable the integration of end-to-end logistical and financial processes. The Army has successfully addressed concerns about the lack of integration of ERPs by leveraging AESIP core capabilities and expanding those benefits across the Army enterprise. AESIP will be an Army specific commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) web portal implementation via the NetWeaver Platform from developer Systems Applications and Products (SAP) American Group to support Army process scenarios and requirements that will provide core competencies:

Enterprise Service Bus (Hub Services) - For a Service oriented, Single Point of Entry to connect, mediate, and control the exchange of data.
Enterprise Business Intelligence/Business Warehouse - Aggregates data from ERP and non-ERP systems to provide flexible Enterprise level reporting.
Enterprise Master Data Management - For a single source of authoritative data and improved workflow and business processes. 

The AESIP solution establishes a framework for a fully integrated ERP centric environment that will ultimately provide Commanders Total Visibility from Factory to Battlefield thereby ensuring delivery of the right equipment to the right unit at the right time, while reducing backlogs of material on the battlefield.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Global Combat Support System-Army (GCSS-Army) program has two components: a functional component titled GCSS-Army and a technology enabler component titled Army Enterprise Systems Integration Program (AESIP). GCSS-Army coupled with AESIP are information and communications technology investments that will provide key enabling support to the transformation of the Army into a network-centric, knowledge-based future force. 
Building on the foundation of GCSS-Army Increment 1, Increment 2 will provide the Army Enterprise Aviation maintenance, enhanced Business Intelligence / Business Warehouse (BI/BW) and Army Pre-Positioned Stock (APS) functional capabilities to deliver greater efficiencies and to improve information flow and accuracy in real time to decision makers. Upon the completion of Increment II, the Unit Level Logistics System-Aviation (Enhanced) (ULLS-A(E)), Unmanned Aircraft System-Initiative (UAS-I), and Army War Reserve Deployment System (AWRDS) will be eligible for retirement since the necessary functionality will have been replaced by GCSS-Army increments. GCSS-A will provide the Army sustainment support for the warfighter with a seamless flow of timely, accurate, accessible and secure management information that gives combat forces a decisive edge.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Military Satellite Communication (MILSATCOM) systems are joint program/project efforts to satisfy ground mobile requirements for each Service, the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), the National Command Authority, the combatant commanders, the Office of the Secretary of Defense, and other governmental, non-DoD users.  The worldwide MILSATCOM systems are: the Super High Frequency (SHF) Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS); the Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS); the MILSTAR Extremely High Frequency (EHF) Low Data Rate (LDR) and Medium Data Rate (MDR); the Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF); and future MILSATCOM capabilities. All of these systems are required to support legacy, interim and emerging communication space architectures and Future Force requirements. The Army is responsible for materiel development, acquisition, product improvement, testing, fielding and integrated logistics support of ground satellite terminals and SATCOM control subsystems and all associated equipment used to provide range extension of Mission Command Networks and Systems. The Army also participates in the development of MILSATCOM programs, including architectures, payloads, waveforms, antennas and terminal developments to ensure US Army equities are appropriately addressed with our sister services.  This includes technology assessment efforts associated with the integration of MILSATCOM components to US Army Landwarnet. This responsibility also includes maintaining the life cycle logistics support required to achieve end-to-end connectivity and interoperability, satisfying JCS network operations in support of the President, JCS, combatant commanders, Military Departments, Department of State, and other government Departments and Agencies. Project EK 8 to support testing for Enroute Mission Command (EMC)has been added to SATCOM Ground Environment programs in FY16.  EMC supports Global Response Force (GRF) and other Army units with the requirement to conduct Airborne forcible entry operations with the ability to conduct mission command.  

This program is designated as a DoD Space Program.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>FY2017 funding in the amount of $5.164 million finances Project Manager, Defense Communications and Army Transmission Systems (PM DCATS) netcentric systems engineering, modem risk mitigation, and DoD Information Assurance Certification Accreditation Process (DIACAP) support.  Funding provides for SATCOM terminal upgrades, enhancement of baseband throughput capabilities, technology insertion and upgrades which enhance decision support capabilities, allowing for full utilization of Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) capabilities.  Both the Wideband SATCOM Operational Management System (WSOMS) and the Enterprise Wideband SATCOM Terminal System (EWSTS) Capability Production Documents (CPDs) contain Netcentric-Ready Key Performance Parameters (NR-KPPs) as required by CJCSI 6212.01C.  Netcentric efforts are required to facilitate the migration from the current trunk-based communications systems to Internet Protocol (IP) based systems and to engineer, test and integrate IP based capabilities into EWSTS and WSOMS systems.  Studies, risk mitigation, system integration and advanced demonstrations for netcentric baseband and policy based control will accommodate technology insertion, data sharing, remote operations, architecture efforts and use of commercial technology, thus ensuring the life of the Defense Enterprise Wideband System (DEWSS) terminal family beyond 2025 and reducing lifecycle costs and enterprise requirements on the WGS and Defense Satellite Communication System (DSCS) satellites in the future.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM)System Engineering (SE) assures that tactical Army Satellite Communications (SATCOM) and SATCOM On-The-Move (SOTM) systems are engineered to legally and efficiently operate worldwide. MILSATCOM SE shapes Joint SATCOM systems' design efforts, standards development and planning processes. MILSATCOM SE represents the Army's tactical interests within DoD, Commercial &amp; International forums to ensure affordable and scalable future SATCOM capabilities for maneuver forces. These efforts, performed by MILSATCOM SE, lead to savings for the overall Army in the out years.

FY 17 funds support the continued systems engineering required to support technology maturation, systems analysis, and planning associated with joint SATCOM development efforts including the outcomes of the Protected SATCOM communications Systems (PSCS) Analysis of Alternatives (AoA), the follow-on Wideband AoA, and ofther efforts that have impact on tactical Army use of military and commercial satellite constellations. These efforts have a direct impact in reducing technical and progammatic risk for the acquisition efforts for tactical Army SATCOM systems using these constellations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Transportable Tactical Command Communications (T2C2) extends the Warfighter Information Network Tactical (WIN-T) network to small company and team sized early entry units. The T2C2 system is based on combat proven capabilities and provides robust voice and data communication capabilities. The T2C2 systems will also integrate users into the higher capacity WIN-T network and extend that network to the tactical edge; T2C2 also enables warfighters in select small Command Posts (CP) (typically Company level) and select Army teams to send and receive time sensitive Situational Awareness (SA), Intelligence, and Mission Command (MC) information while At-the-Halt (ATH) in support of all Joint determined and defined operational phases.  These phases span from the initial Shaping Phase, designed to dissuade or deter adversaries and assure mission friends, to Deterrence, Initiative Seizure and Domination phases culminating with post maneuver Stabilization and Enabling of Civil Authorities enabling legitimate civil governance in safe and secure environment. FY17 funds are in support of T2C2 systems (Light and Heavy) Initial Operational Test &amp; Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) in support a Full Rate Production (FRP) decision scheduled for FY18.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Transportable Tactical Command Communications (T2C2) program Acquisition Strategy (AS) is based on integration of existing Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS)/Non-Developmental Items (NDI) into new integrated systems fielded in the needed configuration for small teams or small unit Command Posts (CP) to allow these units to receive and transmit data. T2C2 will provide a high bandwidth tactical network extension for small unit CPs operating beyond line-of-sight from their higher headquarters and for teams operating outside the full tactical network architecture. A competitive award using an existing IDIQ contract will take advantage of the competitive forces of the commercial marketplace which will result in lower prices, better quality, and reduced time from requirements identification to award. The systems will be improved over time through technology insertions/refreshments via new competitions every three to five years. T2C2 will utilize a two-level maintenance concept, will be Soldier-maintained, and initially supported by Interim Contractor Support. An analysis will be conducted to determine the ultimate supportability path. This strategy will allow a capability to be integrated and delivered quickly to support a limited deployment of Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) units in FY17 required for Production Verification and the Initial Operational Test and Evaluation, with FRP planned for FY18.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Enroute Mission Command (EMC) supports the Global Response Force (GRF) and other Army units with the requirement to conduct Airborne forced entry operations with the ability to conduct mission command, to include mission planning and rehearsal, while enroute on board US Air Force Air Mobility Command (AMC) aircraft. EMC provides a modernization to enroute communications to enable broadband reach-back data capability utilizing military or commercial networks with adequate bandwidth support required by Mission Command and Intelligence applications. EMC will provide commanders with the ability to obtain and share near real-time information regarding intelligence, situational awareness and command and control information while enroute to their objective.  The ability to adjust plans and strategize utilizing the latest Intel data will give the GRF the information dominance needed to execute their mission once they arrive at their objective.  FY17 funding will support test by the Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) during Operational Assessment (OA).   The OA supports the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) Disposition Decision (FY18) to continue procurement and fielding.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The continued procurement of the EMC full operational capability follows DoDI 5000.02, 7 Jan 2015, Enclosure 13, Rapid Fielding of Capabilities. The Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) and project manager will tailor and streamline program strategy based on the required timelines to meet urgent need capability requirements. The Army Executive Agent signed an Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) on 27 April 2015 delegating MDA to PEO C3T.  The MDA signed an ADM on 11 May 2015 selecting the KuKa Antenna and Radome for the Full Operational Capability. An ADM was signed on 20 May 2015 granting approval to enter into production and deployment phase.

Due to rephasing of FY17 OPA funding into FY18/19, program has been restructured. Initial Operational Capability met in May 2015 with modification of five C-17s with satellite antennae and installation kits, and roll-on/roll-off, battalion level, Key Leader Node (KEN).  Full Operational Capability (FOC) is 35 C-17s, seven KENs, and 21 company level Dependent Airborne Nodes (DAN), and an airborne command post suite (CASPAN).  FOC is currently projected for FY20.  Planning to field an interim capability and conduct an Operational Assessment in FY17.

FY17 RDT&amp;E funding will support test by the Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) during Operational Assessment (OA).   The OA supports the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) Disposition Decision (FY18) to continue procurement and fielding.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Global Command and Control System-Army (GCCS-A): This project is the Army component system that directly supports the implementation of the Global Command and Control System Family of Systems. GCCS-A provides automated command and control tools for Army Strategic and Operational Theater Commanders to enhance warfighter capabilities throughout the spectrum of conflict during joint and combined operations in support of National Security. The GCCS-A developed software systems dramatically improves the Army's ability to analyze courses of action; develop and manage Army Forces; and ensure feasibility of war plans. In accordance with Army Command Post Computing Environment and Joint Command and Control objectives, GCCS-A will be re-architected away from a scalable process architecture based server - thick client architecture to a virtualized server - web client architecture hosted on Battle Command Common Services (BCCS)/Tactical Server Infrastructure (TSI) and Mission Command Workstation by the end of Fiscal Year 2016. GCCS-A strategic tools for readiness reporting have been modernized and replaced with the Defense Readiness Reporting System - Army (DRRS-A), a suite of web based applications for Army Readiness, Force Registration and Force Projection.
 
Army Joint and Strategic Command and Control (AJaSC2) or "Ajax" is a modernization development effort for the Army's joint and strategic C2 capabilities. AJaSC2 provides the materiel solution in response to the Army Mission Command for Unified Action Capability Definition Package (AMCUA CDP). AJaSC2 enables Army operational headquarters to integrate with the Joint Force Commands and Unified Action Partners (UAP). AJaSC2 provides Army leaders: Joint Common Operating Picture (COP); Adaptive planning and execution capabilities for distributed, synchronous and asynchronous collaboration services to develop, revise, and execute their warfighting plans supported by theaterwide analytics; strategic Situational Awareness (SA) to coalition operations and other mission partners and Coordination and synchronization of Joint Execution Mission Management.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>GCCS-A is modernizing to meet the requirements defined in the Joint C2 Capability Development Document (CDD) and to align with the Joint and Army Enterprise architectures and Common Operating Environment (COE) standards.

In accordance with the Joint Requirements Oversight Committee (JROC) Memorandum (JROCM) 145-09 which states, "The JROC endorses efforts to develop and implement programmatic recommendations to support the "Do No Harm" Strategy", GCCS-A continues to synchronize and modernize along with the GCCS Family of Systems (FoS). 

The GCCS-A Modernization Strategy will consist of two separate program efforts. (1) A Bridge effort, Acquisition Category (ACAT) III level and (2) a Modernization development effort for the Army's Joint and Strategic command and Control capabilities and Common Operating Environment (COE) infrastructure software products. The GCCS-A modernization development effort will be in compliance with Joint Command and Control Capability Development Document (JC2 CDD) and Army Mission Command for Unified Action Capability Definition Package (AMCUA CDP). DRRS-A developmental efforts will continue to satisfy readiness reporting requirements from Army Readiness Division (DAMO-ODR). The Bridge Effort's acquisition approach consists of a support agreement with CECOM LCMC SEC as the prime software developer utlizing a mix of government and contractor support. 

In accordance with the Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) requirements document approved in 2011, entitled Net Enabled Mission Command (NeMC) Initial Capabilities Document (ICD), software capability will be developed in 3-year increments as capability sets designed to Collaborate, Collapse and Converge Mission Command products. The product development funded under this R-Form is an integral part of the Mission Command System of Systems, under a strategy designed to optimize opportunity for improved interoperability among the systems, to capture the benefits of competition where possible and to ensure the rapid integration of new capability into warfighter systems. This strategy is designed to reduce the physical footprint, logistics support requirements and increase operational efficiency through deployment as a virtualized server on Battle Command Common Services and web clients.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>In accordance with the Army Mission Command for Unified Action (AMCUA) CDP approved December of 2014. The AMCUA CDP provides an overarching structure for future Army Mission Command systems, to include the successor of GCCS-A. The AMCUA initiative will meet the requirements to enable planning and share situational awareness within an interdependent enterprise services network comprised of Unified Action Partners (UAP) and sister service components to achieve integrated mission operations. The AMCUA CDP defines the Land Component-unique Mission Command (MC) capabilities that the Army will develop to enable unified action through integration with existing and future Joint and Service command and control applications. MC capability contributions will enable Joint Forces Land Component Command (JFLCC) Commanders to gain and maintain Situational Awareness (SA), make decisions, and exercise authority and direction via a flexible, distributive and seamless system.

The acquisition strategy for AJaSC2 consists of the development, testing and fielding of Capability Packages implemented over time and synchronized with Command Post Computing Environment infrastructure. AJaSC2 will utilize the "Information Technology (IT) Box" construct. As such, evolutionary development of the software will continue as defined Capability Packages to meet emerging requirements that fall within the bounds of the approved IT Box. AJaSC2 strategy will consist of agile application development which will utilize and leverage existing and emerging technologies from Programs of Record and Common Operating Environment (COE) infrastructure. The product development under this R-Form will be accomplished in part under a Project Manager, Mission Command engineering services contract approach which will consist of multiple prime contractors competitively bidding on development efforts.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Joint Program Office (JPO) for IBS Terminals supports all of the Joint Services and SOCOM. The IBS is the worldwide DoD standard network enterprise for transmitting time-sensitive tactical and strategic intelligence and targeting data to all echelons of Joint Service operational Users. The JPO's role is to coordinate modernization and sustainment of IBS terminals compatible with the UHF SATCOM IBS broadcasts. The transmit/receive-capable Joint Tactical Terminal (JTT) systems currently consist of the JTT-Senior and JTT-IBS configurations, and they satisfy the radio communication KPPs for the IBS Program. The JTT is the official IBS producer system, and ensures continued IBS interoperability to a variety of tactical producers/consumers across the Joint Services.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Project 11A:   The Advanced Payloads Development project line is a shared funding line between multiple Payload programs.  These Payload programs support the Army's transformation by developing Reconnaissance, Surveillance and Target Acquisition (RSTA) and Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) payload systems for Brigade Combat Teams, Divisions, and Corps Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS).  This is in accordance with Headquarters Department of the Army (HQDA) and Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) UAS priorities. Additionally, this Program Element (PE) supports Future Advanced Payloads for Army UAS systems. 

Small Tactical Radar - Lightweight (STARLite) Synthetic Aperture Radar/Moving Target Indicator (SAR/MTI)is a lightweight, high performance, all weather, multi-functional radar system for the Gray Eagle UAS. The STARLite system provides wide area, near real time Reconnaissance, Surveillance and Target Acquisition (RSTA) capabilities. It operates throughout the UAS flight mission profile in adverse weather and through battlefield obscurants. The Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) mode generates quality images for the battlefield commander for detection, classification and location of stationary commercial wheeled vehicle-size targets. The MTI mode detects moving ground targets, to include man-sized detection, and provides location information and performs cross-cue with the Electro-Optic/Infrared (EO/IR) sensors.  STARLite is increasing its software capabilities based on Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) results which will increase automation and upgrade to a common Graphical User Interface (GUI) to align with the Common Operating Environment (COE) requirement to enable Sensor Processing and Exploitation (SPE).  The SPE software enhancements will improve performance, reduce operator workload and enhance operator effectiveness.  

Common Sensor Payload (CSP) - Electro Optical / Infra Red / Laser Designator (EO/IR/LD) provides High Definition (HD) Full Motion Video (FMV) in both the Electro Optical and Mid Wave IR spectrums with day/night capability to collect and display continuous imagery with the ability to designate targets of interest for attack by laser guided precision weapons.  It is the EO/IR/LD sensor for Gray Eagle UAS which supports force applications, battlespace awareness, force protection, and net-centric operations across the battlefield to provide wide area, near real time RSTA capabilities.  Additional initiatives will continue to focus on the transition of technologies directly supporting emerging requirements and the Army's Current and Future Force.  CSP is being procured for the Gray Eagle UAS program and has potential application to other platforms.   

Project 11B:   The Tactical Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) Payload (TSP) is a SIGINT sensor for the Gray Eagle that detects radio frequency (RF) emitters. The TSP system will provide a SIGINT capability to the tactical commander.  The TSP system will be a modular, scalable payload using an architecture that is software reconfigurable to allow for growth and flexibility as technology, and as the adversaries use of technology, changes.  This flexible architecture allows for third party software applications to be integrated into the TSP system. The TSP system processing, control and data dissemination is integrated into the Distributed Common Ground System - Army (DCGS-A) via the Operational Ground Station. It supports Manned/Unmanned (MUM) teaming with Brigade Combat Team ground SIGINT Terminal Guidance (STG) teams and manned airborne assets.  The TSP system improves situational awareness and shortens the targeting cycle by detecting and identifying emitters associated with high value targets (HVTs).  The TSP system is capable of processing conventional signals, standard military signals, and modern signals of interest.  This includes detection, recognition, identification, direction finding, and high confidence geo-location.  

Project 123:   The UAS Joint Technology Center/Systems Integration Laboratory (JTC/SIL) is a Joint facility that develops, integrates, and supports the enhancement of its Multiple Unified Simulation Environment (MUSE) capability for Army systems and operational concepts.  The JTC/SIL conducts prototype hardware and software development, builds the UAS Institutional Mission Simulator (IMS) trainers for the Shadow, Hunter, and Gray Eagle programs, and provides modeling and simulation support. The MUSE is a real-time, operator in-the-loop simulation that may be integrated with larger simulations in support of Army and Joint training and exercises.  The MUSE is also employed as a Mission Rehearsal Tool for ongoing combat operations.  This project funds the management of the JTC/SIL and MUSE enhancements.  This system supports the Legacy to Objective transition path of the Transformation Campaign Plan (TCP).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

These Payload programs support the Army's transformation by developing Reconnaissance, Surveillance and Target Acquisition (RSTA) and Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) payload systems for Brigade Combat Teams, Divisions, and Corps Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS).  This is in accordance with Headquarters Department of the Army (HQDA) and Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) UAS priorities. Additionally, this Program Element (PE) supports Future Advanced Payloads for Army UAS systems.

Small Tactical Radar - Lightweight (STARLite) ACAT III -  Synthetic Aperture Radar/Moving Target Indicator (SAR/MTI) is a lightweight, high performance, all weather, multi-functional radar system for the Gray Eagle UAS. The STARLite system provides wide area, near real time RSTA capabilities. It operates throughout the UAS flight mission profile in adverse weather and through battlefield obscurants. The Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) mode generates quality images for the battlefield commander for detection, classification and location of stationary commercial wheeled vehicle-size targets. The MTI mode detects moving ground targets, to include man-sized detection, and provides location information and performs cross-cue with the Electro-Optic/Infrared (EO/IR) sensors.  STARLite is increasing its software capabilities based on Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) results which will increase automation and upgrade to a common Graphical User Interface (GUI) to align with the Common Operating Environment (COE) requirement to enable Sensor Processing and Exploitation (SPE).  The SPE software enhancements will improve performance, reduce operator workload and enhance operator effectiveness.

Common Sensor Payload (CSP)- ACAT III - Electro Optical / Infra Red / Laser Designator (EO/IR/LD) provides Standard Definition (SD) or High Definition (HD)as an upgrade. Full Motion Video (FMV) in both the Electro Optical and Mid Wave IR spectrums with day/night capability to collect and display continuous imagery with the ability to designate targets of interest for attack by laser guided precision weapons.  It is the EO/IR/LD sensor for Gray Eagle UAS which supports intelligence gathering, force applications, battlespace awareness, force protection, and net-centric operations across the battlefield to provide wide area, near real time RSTA capabilities.  Additional initiatives will continue to focus on the transition of technologies directly supporting emerging requirements and the Army's Current and Future Force.  CSP is being procured for the Gray Eagle UAS program and has potential application to other platforms. Additional updates to enhance the CSP’s usability for the Warfighter is to reduce cognitive burden by providing improved situational awareness, while providing multiple fields of view in a simplified manner through Hardware (H/W) and Software (S/W) improvements.  

Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 base development dollars in the amount of $2.830 million is for STARLite SPE Software developmental test and integration onto Gray Eagle and enhanced CSP to reduce cognitive burden on the Warfighter.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>STARLite SAR/MTI is a threshold requirement for the Gray Eagle UAS.  The acquisition strategy for STARLite program was based on a full and open competition for the Army. Full Rate Production (FRP) was successfully achieved in June 2013. A follow-on production contract was awarded in April 2014 to procure all remaining STARLite Payloads required for the Gray Eagle platform.  Based on Initial Operational test and Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) results, STARLite is increasing its software capabilities to increase automation and upgrade to a common Graphical User Interface (GUI) and aligns SPE with the COE requirements. The SPE software enhancements will improve performance, reduce operator workload and enhance operator effectiveness. A competitive Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDTE) funded contract was awarded to Northrop Grumman in October 2013 to perform trade studies and begin the development of the software  improvements.  Integration onto the Gray Eagle will be done via a sole source cost-plus fixed fee contract with the UAS prime contractor, General Atomics ASI.

CSP EO/IR/LD enables the Gray Eagle to meet a Key Performance Parameter (KPP) requirement. The acquisition strategy for the CSP program was based on a full and open competition for the Army. A competitive contract was awarded in Nov 2007 to Raytheon for the build, integration, test and delivery of the CSP.  FRP was completed June 2013. A three year system support contract was awarded in July 2015 for sustainment and upgrade of the CSP to include retrofitting standard definition sensors with high definition sensors and to perform RDTE activities.  CSP is being procured for the Gray Eagle UAS program with fielding through FY2018 and has potential application to other platforms.

The acquisiton strategy is to complete STARLite SPE software developmental test and integration onto Gray Eagle; and Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE)support to the Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD) to continue enhancing CSP's usability for the Warfighter to reduce cognitive burden by providing improved situational awareness, while providing multiple fields of view in a simplified manner through Hardware (H/W) and S/W improvements.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Tactical Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) Payload (TSP) is a SIGINT sensor for the Gray Eagle that detects radio frequency (RF) emitters. The TSP system will provide a SIGINT capability to the tactical commander.  The TSP system will be a modular, scalable payload using an architecture that is software reconfigured to allow for growth and flexibility as technology, and as the adversaries use of technology, changes.  This flexible architecture allows for third party software applications to be integrated into the TSP system. The TSP system processing, control and data dissemination is integrated into the Distributed Common Ground System - Army (DCGS-A) via the Operational Ground Station. It supports Manned/Unmanned (MUM) teaming with Brigade Combat Team ground SIGINT Terminal Guidance (STG) teams and manned airborne assets.  The TSP system improves situational awareness and shortens the targeting cycle by detecting and identifying emitters associated with high value targets (HVTs). The TSP system is capable of processing conventional signals, standard military signals, and modern signals of interest.  This includes detection, recognition, identification, direction finding, and high confidence geo-location.

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>TSP is a threshold requirement for the MQ-1C Gray Eagle UAS. The TSP program entered the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase with a Milestone B decision in September 2011. The TSP Program EMD contract award was based on full-and-open competition and was focused on integration and test onto the Gray Eagle platform and integration and test of TSP software into the Operational Ground Station. The TSP EMD program is a derivative of systems that were fielded as a Quick Reaction Capability on the MQ-1C UAS and a variety of other manned platforms. The demonstrated scalability of these fielded materiel solutions allows the TSP EMD program to leverage effort that directly supports the TSP EMD program. 

The TSP Block 1 is the current Program of Record capability. TSP Block 2 will address objectives and remaining deferred Block 1 threshold requirements as reflected in the approved Capability Production Document (CPD). 

Block 1 Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) Milestone C was approved on 2 May 2014. TSP LRIP contract award was 12 Jun 2014.

Block 1 TSP EMD contract period of performance was completed on Oct 2015.

Improved Gray Eagle (IGE)- Program Manager Unmanned Aircraft Systems(PM UAS)received a Congressional plus up of $49M President's Budget15(PB15) to procure Extended Range UAS which increases the CPD objective endurance requirements for the current GE configuration to an Improved Gray Eagle (IGE). To meet the PM UAS IGE test schedule 1st QTR FY18 and first unit equipped date, TSP must be integrated and tested on the IGE and the A-kit must be modified before the IGE Follow on Test Evaluation#2 2QFY18.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Joint Technology Center/System Integration Laboratory (JTC/SIL) is a Joint facility that develops, integrates, and supports the enhancement of its Multiple Unified Simulation Environment (MUSE) capability for Army systems and operational concepts.  The JTC/SIL conducts prototype hardware and software development, builds the UAS Institutional Mission Simulator (IMS) trainers for the Shadow, Hunter, and Gray Eagle programs, and provides modeling and simulation support.  The MUSE is a real-time, operator in-the-loop simulation that may be integrated with larger simulations in support of Army and Joint training exercises.  The MUSE is also employed as a Mission Rehearsal Tool for ongoing combat operations.  This project funds the management of the JTC/SIL and MUSE enhancements.

This system supports the Legacy to Objective transition path of the Transformation Campaign Plan (TCP).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Redesign MUSE/ Air Force Synthetic Environment for regognizance and Surveillance (AFSERS) U2/GlobalHawk, Tactical Exploitation of National Capabilities (TENCAP), to meet the growing demands of the war fighter training audience and to optimize User Interface for ease of use, which will reduce training costs and the need for JSIL personnel to attend every event.    Design and implement a Heads Up Display (HUD) capability for the UAS platforms that MUSE/AFSERS simulates.  This will reduce costs since HUD modifications will be able to be modified without having to implement code changes.  Continued examination of all Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) to ensure maximum usability for the war fighter.</r2:Text>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Airborne Reconnaissance Low - Enhanced (ARL-E) is a worldwide self-deployable airborne Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance (ISR) system designed for timely, accurate, assured support to tactical forces over the full spectrum of operations. This system is a De Havilland DHC-8 aircraft replacing the DHC-7 in accordance with the Aerial ISR (AISR) 2020 Strategy. ARL-E will enhance the ARL-M sensor capability sets through the procurement of new and refurbished sensors to meet the ARL-E Capabilities Production Document (CPD) requirements. It provides a persistent capability to include: Broad-Area Surveillance and/or Focused Stare on Target Areas of Interest (Point or Objective Targets), Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR)/Full-Motion Video (FMV) , Multi-Mode Radar, Robust Communications Intelligence (COMINT), on-Board Collection, Analysis, Sensor Cross Cue and dissemination through Distributed Common Ground System-Army (DCGS-A) Enabled workstations. ARL-E will be assigned to the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command's Aerial ISR Brigade providing AISR support to combatant commanders. For the overall system, the Army Acquisition Objective and the Army Procurement Objective, is nine. The Mission Equipment Package (MEP) objective is eight.

The Enhanced Medium Altitude Reconnaissance and Surveillance System (EMARSS) is the Army's next generation C-12 based, direct support, manned airborne intelligence collection, processing, and targeting support system. It provides a persistent capability to detect, locate, classify/identify, and track surface targets with a high degree of timeliness and accuracy. EMARSS will be assigned to the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command's Aerial Exploitation Battalions, providing Aerial Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance support to combatant commanders. The Army Acquisition Objective for EMARSS is 36 systems, with an Army Procurement Objective of 24, to include the following variants: eight EMARSS-G (Geo-INT); four EMARSS-V (Vehicle and Dismount Exploitation Radar, VaDER); eight EMARSS-M (Multi-INT); and four EMARSS-S (SIGINT).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Enhanced Medium Altitude Reconnaissance and Surveillance System (EMARSS) is the Army's next generation C-12 based, direct support, manned airborne intelligence collection, processing, and targeting support system. It provides a persistent capability to detect, locate, classify/identify, and track surface targets with a high degree of timeliness and accuracy. EMARSS will be assigned to the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command's Aerial Exploitation Battalions, providing Aerial Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance support to combatant commanders. The Army Acquisition Objective for EMARSS is 36 systems, with an Army Procurement Objective of 24, to include the following variants: eight EMARSS-G (Geo-INT); four EMARSS-V (Vehicle and Dismount Exploitation Radar, VaDER); eight EMARSS-M (Multi-INT); and four EMARSS-S (SIGINT). 

This funding line supports enhancements to the following sensor capabilities in order to maintain relevancy to the Warfighter: Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR)/Full Motion Video (FMV); Communications Intelligence (COMINT); Wide Area Aerial Surveillance (WAAS); Light Imaging Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and improved Synthetic Aperture Radar / Moving Target Indicator (SAR/MTI) radar; line-of-site (LOS) and beyond line-of-site (BLOS) communications; and Processing Exploitation and Dissemination (PED) supporting two Distributed Common Ground System - Army (DCGS-A) enabled operator workstations. 

Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 funding in the amount of $130,000 provides Mission Equipment Packages (MEP) and PED Sensor Engineering Support.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>The EMARSS RDTE efforts are found in the following two (2) project lines; 0305206AEH2 EMARSS ADV DEV (MIP) (Fixed Wing Project Office) and 0305206AEH3 EMARSS Payloads ADV DEV (Project Manager Sensors - Aerial Intelligence). The supporting procurement lines are A02112 and AZ2054. Separate funding lines support the Army Acquisition Executive's directive, codified in the October 28, 2011 memorandum, to assign overall acquisition lead for manned airborne intelligence systems to Program Executive Officer for Aviation; and overall sensor, processing, exploitation, and dissemination responsibilities to Program Executive Officer for Intelligence, Electronic Warfare, and Sensors.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The acquisition strategy, supported by the EMARSS CPD, is to design and test 24 systems as well as provide enhancements to the following sensor capabilities in order to maintain relevancy to the Warfighter: EO/IR FMV; COMINT; WAAS; LiDAR and improved SAR/MTI radar; LOS and BLOS communications; and PED supporting two DCGS-A enabled operator workstations. The EMARSS fleet of 24 systems will consist of the following variants: eight EMARSS-G (Geo-INT); four EMARSS-V (Vehicle and Dismount Exploitation Radar, VaDER); eight EMARSS-M (Multi-INT); and four EMARSS-S (SIGINT).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Airborne Reconnaissance Low - Enhanced (ARL-E) is a worldwide self-deployable airborne Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance (ISR) system designed for timely, accurate, assured support to tactical forces over the full spectrum of operations. This system is a De Havilland DHC-8 aircraft replacing the DHC-7 IAW the Aerial ISR (AISR) 2020 Strategy. ARL-E will enhance the ARL-M sensor capability sets through the procurement of new and refurbished sensors to meet the ARL-E Capabilities Production Document (CPD) requirements. It provides a persistent capability to include: Broad-Area Surveillance and/or Focused Stare on Target Areas of Interest (Point or Objective Targets), Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR)/Full-Motion Video (FMV) , Multi-Mode Radar, Robust Communications Intelligence (COMINT), on-Board Collection, Analysis, Sensor Cross Cue and dissemination through Distributed Common Ground System-Army (DCGS-A) Enabled workstations. ARL-E will be assigned to the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command's Aerial ISR Brigade providing AISR support to combatant commanders. For the overall system, the Army Acquisition Objective and the Army Procurement Objective, is nine. The Mission Equipment Package (MEP) objective is eight.

This funding line supports non-recurring engineering (NRE), development of supplemental type certificates (STC), testing, and integration.  Funding provides for Department of Defense (DoD) mandated safety equipment to meet current and evolving International Standards. It also enhances aircraft communications, navigations and surveillance (CNS); aircraft survivability equipment (ASE) and the integration of the AISR mission equipment package (MEP) as well as obsolescence issues involved with the conversion of Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) to the ARL-E Program of Record (POR).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Airborne Reconnaissance Low - Enhanced (ARL-E) is a worldwide self-deployable airborne Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance (ISR) system designed for timely, accurate, assured support to tactical forces over the full spectrum of operations. This system is a De Havilland DHC-8 aircraft replacing the DHC-7 IAW the Aerial ISR (AISR) 2020 Strategy. ARL-E will enhance the ARL-M sensor capability sets through the procurement of new and refurbished sensors to meet the ARL-E Capabilities Production Document (CPD) requirements. It provides a persistent capability to include: Broad-Area Surveillance and/or Focused Stare on Target Areas of Interest (Point or Objective Targets), Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR)/Full-Motion Video (FMV) , Multi-Mode Radar, Robust Communications Intelligence (COMINT), on-Board Collection, Analysis, Sensor Cross Cue and dissemination through Distributed Common Ground System-Army (DCGS-A) Enabled workstations. ARL-E will be assigned to the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command's Aerial ISR Brigade providing AISR support to combatant commanders. For the overall system, the Army Acquisition Objective and the Army Procurement Objective, is nine. The Mission Equipment Package (MEP) objective is eight.

Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 funding of $11.669 million completes the Long Range Radar (LRR) effort, and initiates new signal enhancement efforts. This funding line supports development and testing of the LRR to replace the current ARL Phoenix Eye Radar to meet the increased performance requirements of the Appendix J Payload for ARL-E approved CPD.  LRR effort will add required SAR modes, address obsolescence, Information Assurance (IA) issues, and improved probability at greater required ranges. Effort will produce a prototype and conduct flight testing to characterize the prototype performance. Funding is planned for test and evaluation of LRR capability integrated in ARL-E system. Also, it supports the software development to enhance COMINT collection capabilities to effectively prosecute high priority and emerging modern signal emitters.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>The Airborne Reconnaissance Low- Enhanced (ARL-E) RDTE efforts are found in the following two (2) project lines; 0305206AEH4 ARL ADV DEV (MIP) (Fixed Wing Project Office) and 0305206AEH5 ARL Payloads ADV DEV (Project Manager Sensors - Aerial Intelligence). The supporting procurement lines are A02110 and AZ2050. Separate funding lines support the Army Acquisition Executive's directive, codified in the October 28, 2011 memorandum, to assign overall acquisition lead for manned airborne Intelligence systems to Program Executive Officer for Aviation; and overall sensor, processing, exploitation, and dissemination responsibilities to Program Executive Officer for Intelligence, Electronic Warfare, and Sensors.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>ARL-E will enhance the ARL-M sensor capability sets through the procurement of new and refurbished sensors to meet the ARL-E CPD requirements. It provides a persistent capability to include: Broad-Area Surveillance and/or Focused Stare on Target Areas of Interest (Point or Objective Targets), EO/IR FMV, COMINT, on-Board Collection, Analysis, Sensor Cross Cue and dissemination through DCGS-A Enabled workstations. 

The development and testing of LRR is required to replace the current ARL Phoenix Eye Radar to increase performance and meet the improved requirements of the Appendix J Payload for the approved ARL-E CPD. The remainder will fund software development to enhance COMINT collection capabilities.  The software will be added to the existing COMINT systems to effectively prosecute high priority and emerging modern signal emitters.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>The Distributed Common Ground Systems - Army (DCGS-A) is a designated Major Automation Information System (MAIS) program.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Distributed Common Ground System - Army (DCGS-A) is the Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) System of Systems (SoS) for Joint, Interagency, Allied, Coalition, and National data analysis, sharing and collaboration.  The core functions of DCGS-A are:  the vertical and horizontal synchronization of ISR Processing, Exploitation and Dissemination (PED) efforts; operations in a networked environment at multiple security levels; the control of select Army and joint sensor systems; the fusion of all acquired data and information, and distribution of relevant red (threat), gray (non-aligned), and environmental (weather and terrain) information; and providing the Warfighters' early warning, targeting, and sensor ground station capabilities.  DCGS-A provides a single integrated ISR ground processing system composed of common components that are interoperable with sensors, other information sources, all Warfighting Functions, and the Defense Information &amp; Intelligence Enterprise (DI2E) and Intelligence Community Information Technology Enterprise (ICITE).  DCGS-A is fielded in Fixed, Mobile, and embedded configurations emphasizing the use of reach and split based operations by improving accessibility of data in order to reduce forward deployed footprint.  As enhanced capabilities are developed and tested, a continuing series of software releases will be integrated into Army Common/commodity hardware and fielded to units IAW the Army Resourcing Priority List (ARPL) process.

The Army Acquisition Executive designated PEO IEW&amp;S and DCGS-A as the Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE) Lead.  As such, DCGS-A is defining the architecture to fit within the Common Operating Environment (COE) as described by the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology) (ASA(ALT)) COE Implementation Plan.  This is in accordance with the G-3/5/7 priority to align all Army networks, procurements, and enhancements under one COE and one vision leveraging intelligence community investments.

DCGS-A consolidated, enhanced, and modernized the Tasking, Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (TPED) capabilities formerly found in nine Army intelligence programs of record (Common Ground Station (CGS), Guardrail Common Sensor (GRCS), Counterintelligence &amp; Interrogation Operations Workstation (CI&amp;I OPS WS), All Source Analysis System (ASAS), Enhanced TrackWolf (ETW), Digital Topographic Support System (DTSS), Integrated Meteorological System (IMETS), Tactical Exploitation System (TES), and Prophet Control) and two Quick Reaction Capabilities (Joint Intelligence Operations Center – Iraq (JIOC-I) and Imagery Work Station(IWS)).  DCGS-A provides these technologically advanced PED capabilities in tailored and scalable mobile, fixed, and embedded configurations in all maneuver and maneuver support units from Company Intelligence Support Team to Army Service Component Command, and in select maneuver sustainment units battalion and above.  The program develops software packages to be embedded in mission command and other select systems to provide required ISR/analytic capabilities.  DCGS-A is one of the Army's top modernization priorities.

DCGS-A software is tailored by echelon and scalable to each unit's mission.  DCGS-A provides commanders and staffs the ability to maintain an accurate and up to date understanding of the operational environment.  The DCGS-A contribution to commanders' visualization and situational awareness, rapid planning, and the synchronization of all warfighting functions, enable Army units to operate within the enemy's decision cycle.  This capability enhances tactical and operational maneuver and the conduct of full spectrum operations across the range of military operations from humanitarian to major combat operations and campaigns through all phases of the Joint Continuum of Military Operations.

The DCGS-A configurations range from laptops to systems integrated in tactical shelters and mounted on tactical vehicles to large commodity servers operating in a sanctuary based processing environment.  The fundamental intent and tenet of this approach is to reduce forward deployed equipment/footprint by co-locating the advanced analytics capabilities within the DCGS-A baseline with the regional data centers, where the data is stored.  This infrastructure consolidation simultaneously reduces processor and communications requirements in tactical units by limiting the number of large data files transported across tactical communications systems.  Following a successful operational assessment and Milestone C in 2QFY12/Full Deployment Decision in 1QFY13, the program is deploying DCGS-A Increment 1 Release 1 Software Baseline capability throughout the Army.

Project 956 does not have funds in FY17.

FY17 Base funding in the amount of $32.284 million for D07, will continue the iterative DCGS-A software releases that will increase the Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination capability our Army requires.  Increment 2 of the DCGS-A program will continue critical updates to the Army's ISR PED and multi-intelligence planning, analysis, and production capabilities through the exploitation of Cloud Computing and advanced analytics capabilities.  This approach will achieve Information Technology efficiencies through alignment with the Intelligence Community Information Technology Environment, while developing the incremental software updates required to remain current.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>The Distributed Common Ground System - Army (DCGS-A) is designated a Major Automation Information System (MAIS) program.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Distributed Common Ground System - Army (DCGS-A) is the Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) System of Systems (SoS) for Joint, Interagency, Allied, Coalition, and National data analysis, sharing and collaboration.  The core functions of DCGS-A are:  the vertical and horizontal synchronization of ISR Processing, Exploitation and Dissemination (PED) efforts; operations in a networked environment at multiple security levels; the control of select Army and joint sensor systems; the fusion of all acquired data and information, and distribution of relevant red (threat), gray (non-aligned), and environmental (weather and terrain) information; and providing the Warfighters' early warning, targeting, and sensor ground station capabilities.  DCGS-A provides a single integrated ISR ground processing system composed of common components that are interoperable with sensors, other information sources, and all Warfighting Functions. DCGS-A is fielded in Fixed, Mobile, and embedded configurations emphasizing the use of reach and split based operations by improving accessibility of data in order to reduce forward deployed footprint.  As enhanced capabilities are developed and tested, a continuing series of software releases will be integrated into Army common/commodity hardware and fielded to units in accordance with the Dynamic Army Resourcing Priority List (DARPL) process.

The Army Acquisition Executive designated PEO IEW&amp;S and DCGS-A as the Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE) Lead.  As such, DCGS-A is defining the architecture to fit within the Common Operating Environment (COE) as described by the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology) (ASA(ALT)) COE Implementation Plan.  This is in accordance with the G-3/5/7 priority to align all Army networks, procurements, and enhancements under one COE and one vision leveraging intelligence community investments.

DCGS-A consolidated, enhanced, and modernized the Tasking, Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (TPED) capabilities formerly found in nine Army intelligence programs of records (Common Ground Station (CGS), Guardrail Common Sensor (GRCS), Counterintelligence &amp; Interrogation Operations Workstation (CI&amp;I OPS WS), All Source Analysis System (ASAS), Enhanced TrackWolf (ETW), Digital Topographic Support System (DTSS), Integrated Meteorological System (IMETS), Tactical Exploitation System (TES), and Prophet Control) and two Quick Reaction Capabilities (Joint Intelligence Operations Center – Iraq (JIOC-I) and Imagery Work Station(IWS)).  DCGS-A provides these technologically advanced PED capabilities in tailored and scalable mobile, fixed, and embedded configurations in all maneuver and maneuver support units from Company Intelligence Support Team to Army Service Component Command, and in select maneuver sustainment units battalion and above.  The program also develops software packages to be embedded in mission command and other select systems to provide required ISR/analytic capabilities.  DCGS-A is one of the Army's top modernization priorities.

DCGS-A software is tailored by echelon and scalable to each unit's mission.  DCGS-A provides commanders and staffs the ability to maintain an accurate and up to date understanding of the operational environment.  The DCGS-A contribution to commanders' visualization and situational awareness, rapid planning, and the synchronization of all warfighting functions, enable Army units to operate within the enemy's decision cycle.  This capability enhances tactical and operational maneuver and the conduct of full spectrum operations across the range of military operations from humanitarian to major combat operations and campaigns through all phases of the Joint Continuum of Military Operations.

The DCGS-A configurations range from laptops to systems integrated in tactical shelters and mounted on tactical vehicles to large commodity servers operating in a sanctuary based processing environment.  The fundamental intent and tenet of this approach is to reduce forward deployed equipment/footprint by co-locating the advanced analytics capabilities within the DCGS-A baseline with the regional data centers, where the data is stored.  This infrastructure consolidation simultaneously reduces processor and communications requirements in tactical units by limiting the number of large data files transported across tactical communications systems.  Following a successful operational assessment and Milestone C in 2QFY12/Full Deployment Decision in 1QFY13, the program is deploying DCGS-A Increment 1 Release 1 Software Baseline capability throughout the Army.

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Distributed Common Ground System-Army (DCGS-A) program was created in response to the Department of Defense (DoD) Distributed Common Ground/Surface System (DCGS) Mission Area Initial Capabilities Document (MA ICD) dated 13 Aug 2004, which captured the overarching requirements for an Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) Family of Systems (FoS) that will contribute to Joint and combined Warfighter needs. That ICD was updated as the Distributed Common Ground/Surface System (DCG/SS) Enterprise ICD, and approved by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) 27 Feb 2009. The Army requirements were refined in the DCGS-A Capabilities Development Document (CDD), and approved by the JROC 31 Oct 2005. The DCGS-A program is currently in the Production and Deployment phase and was designated as a Major Automated Information System (MAIS) in OSD (AT&amp;L) Memorandum, 29 Mar 2010. 

DCGS-A is following an evolutionary acquisition approach to develop and field system capabilities over time to satisfy the requirements of the DCGS-A Capability Development Document (CDD). Following this approach, the first increment was defined and a Capability Production Document (CPD) was created with full consideration of all of the preceding supporting documents and analysis. As part of its initial staffing, a Cost Benefit Analysis was completed in support of the DCGS-A CPD. This analysis projected a significant cost avoidance/savings over the life cycle by not limiting the hardware configuration to a one size fits all unit types design but rather integrating the DCGS-A Software capabilities into common servers and other IT components fielded at that echelon. This approach was validated during the Milestone C and Full Deployment Decision process in FY2012 through the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE) approval of the Economic Analysis.  This Economic Analysis validated the cost savings achieved utilizing the acquisition approach outlined above. 

PM DCGS-A has been designated as the Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE) Lead for PEO IEW&amp;S. As such, DCGS-A is currently aligning it's architecture to fit within the Common Operating Environment (COE) as described by the ASA(ALT) COE Implementation Plan. This alignment is in accordance with the G-3/5/7 priority to align all Army networks, procurements, and enhancements under one COE and one vision. Our acquisition strategy supports this initiative as we continue to collapse PORs and reduce footprint following our capability migration path and iterative development of software releases which continue to increase capabilities to satisfy the remaining CPD requirements beyond Initial Minimal Capability. As DCGS-A continues the path through Increment 1 and beyond, each release will focus on the COE and continually align the Command Post activities with POR migration activities.  The program office expects to continue as the DCGS-A System Integrator for software development and hardware integration for Increment 1, and will continue to access multiple vendors by leveraging a variety of competitively awarded contracts.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>The Distributed Common Ground System - Army (DCGS-A) is designated a Major Automation Information System (MAIS) program.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Distributed Common Ground System - Army (DCGS-A) is the Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) System of Systems (SoS) for Joint, Interagency, Allied, Coalition, and National data analysis, sharing and collaboration.  The core functions of DCGS-A are:  the vertical and horizontal synchronization of ISR Processing, Exploitation and Dissemination (PED) efforts; operations in a networked environment at multiple security levels; the control of select Army and joint sensor systems; the fusion of all acquired data and information, and distribution of relevant red (threat), gray (non-aligned), and environmental (weather and terrain) information; and providing the Warfighters' early warning, targeting, and sensor ground station capabilities.  DCGS-A provides a single integrated ISR ground processing system composed of common components that are interoperable with sensors, other information sources, all Warfighting Functions, compliant with standards providing the Defense Information &amp; Intelligence Enterprise (DI2E) and Intelligence Community Information Technology Enterprise (ICITE).  DCGS-A is fielded in Fixed, Mobile, and embedded configurations emphasizing the use of reach and split based operations by improving accessibility of data in order to reduce forward deployed footprint.  As enhanced capabilities are developed and tested, a continuing series of software releases will be integrated into Army Common/commodity hardware and fielded to units IAW the Army Resourcing Priority List (ARPL) process.

The Army Acquisition Executive designated PEO IEW&amp;S and DCGS-A as the Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE) Lead.  As such, DCGS-A is defining the architecture to fit within the Common Operating Environment (COE) as described by the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology) (ASA(ALT)) COE Implementation Plan.  This is in accordance with the G-3/5/7 priority to align all Army networks, procurements, and enhancements under one COE and one vision leveraging intelligence community investments.

DCGS-A provides technologically advanced Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (PED) capabilities through iterative software releases delivered in tailored and scalable mobile, fixed, and embedded configurations in all maneuver and maneuver support units from Company Intelligence Support Team to Army Service Component Command, and in select maneuver sustainment units battalion and above.  The program develops software packages to be embedded in mission command and other select systems to provide required ISR/analytic capabilities.  DCGS-A is one of the Army's top ten modernization priorities.

FY17 Base funding in the amount of $32.284 million will continue the iterative DCGS-A software releases that will increase the Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination capability our Army requires.  Increment 2 of the DCGS-A program will continue critical updates to the Army's ISR PED and multi-intelligence planning, analysis, and production capabilities through the exploitation of Cloud Computing and advanced analytics capabilities.  This approach will achieve Information Technology efficiencies through alignment with the Intelligence Community Information Technology Environment, while developing the incremental software updates required to remain current.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>Continue efforts to design &amp; develop DCGS-A Inc 2 software. Increment 2 expands on the capabilities provided by Increment 1 by adding capabilities at the Army and below echelons while developing new, enhanced, and leap-ahead Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) and Standard and Shareable Geospatial Foundation (SSGF) enterprise capabilities to align with the Intelligence Community (IC) and Army's Common Operating Environment (COE) and transformation objectives.  Increment 2 and beyond will leverage the investment made in previous DCGS-A increments and include emerging technologies related to: Tasking of sensors; controlling select Army sensor systems; Processing, fusing, and Exploiting data and information; supporting knowledge generation; providing ground station capabilities; automated support to intelligence product generation; Disseminating information and intelligence about the threat, weather, and terrain at all echelons; automating intelligence synchronization, including ISR planning, reconnaissance and surveillance integration and assessment; supporting situation understanding; supporting targeting and effects; providing the Standard and Sharable Geospatial Foundation (SSGF) to COE Computing Environments (CEs). These requirements will be defined in the DCGS-A Requirements Data Package (RDP) and Capability Drops (CDs) as necessary to ensure DCGS-A provides the data, information, intelligence, situation awareness, and interoperability needed to support the Warfighter.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>DCGS-A Increment 2 is an ACAT IAM, Major Automated Information System (MAIS) program entering Milestone B decision for the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) acquisition phase. The DCGS-A Increment 2 program will consist of multiple software releases structured to meet DCGS-A Increment 2 Requirements Definition Package (RDP) requirements. These releases will be referred to as DCGS-A Increment 2, Releases 1, 2, etc. as defined by the Army Requirements Oversight Council (AROC) Process Review Board (APRB).  The APRB will identify the capabilities associated with each release in a Capability Drop (CD) document.  The DCGS-A Increment 2 program will follow the Information Technology (IT) Box concept for an agile acquisition strategy to iteratively develop and field Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities, hosted on Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) equipment/hardware, providing a low risk, efficient, time-phased releases of capability to satisfy the Army’s operational needs.  

The DCGS-A capabilities developed under Increment 1 will be leveraged to the maximum extent where applicable to meet the Increment 2 requirements set.  The DCGS-A Increment 2 will also leverage the Increment 1 configuration platforms fielded across the Army.

DCGS-A Increment 2 is a collection of software packages (developmental, COTS, and GOTS products) selected to provide each Army echelon (from Battalion up to Echelon Above Corps (EAC)) the capability to synthesize and exploit intelligence data.  DCGS-A Increment 2 delivers these software packages on COTS and GOTS hardware components, tailored to meet each Army Echelon’s intelligence mission requirements. DCGS-A Increment 2 will deliver these capabilities by fielding software releases with incremental increases in capabilities with each release.  DCGS-A Increment 2 is the Army's ISR Foundation Layer for Tasking, Processing, Exploitation, Dissemination (TPED) and development of situation understanding using intelligence information about the threat, weather, and terrain at all Army Echelons. DCGS-A Increment 2 provides the capabilities necessary for Commanders to access information, task organic sensors, and synchronize non-organic sensor assets with their organic assets. DCGS-A Increment 2 will continuously acquire and synthesize data and information from Joint, Interagency, Intergovernmental, and Multi-national (JIIM) sources to maintain an updated and accurate understanding of the operational environment to inform critical and time sensitive command decisions.

The DCGS-A Increment 2 software baseline will be updated and fielded every 24-36 months to address emerging and prioritized operational requirements as approved by the APRB.  PM DCGS-A, in coordination with the operational user community, chose the 24-36 month release time phasing to align releases with the technological readiness of targeted enhancements, and to support low-risk development and test cycle times in accordance with an agile acquisition approach. The time phasing of planned content of each release will be based upon an assessment of available and projected technological solution sets; this assessment will result in the approach to complete additional releases beyond Release 1 of Initial Minimum Capability (IMC) to satisfy the entire DCGS-A Increment 2 RDP.  The DCGS-A Increment 2 software design will be hardware agnostic that the software is virtualized and can be deployed in any processing hardware equipment.  This allows the DCGS-A Increment 2 software to be scalable and deployable in different hardware system configurations, as required by the Army at different echelons.  The implementation of the Virtual Machine technology also allows leveraging of the latest COTS hardware server technology and procurement through the Army Common Hardware System (CHS) program with the established post-deployment hardware sparing, sustainment, and maintenance provisions, resulting in significant cost efficiencies.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>An Extended Range Multi-Purpose (ERMP) Operational Requirement Document (ORD) was approved by the Joint Requirement Oversight Council (JROC) 6 Apr 2005.  Milestone B occurred on 20 Apr 2005, and the System Development and Demonstration contract was awarded 8 Aug 2005, as a result of a competitive solicitation which included a vendor system capabilities demonstration.  A Capabilities Production Document (CPD), version 8.7 was approved on 17 Jul 15.  MQ-1C Gray Eagle completed FOTE 12 Jun 2015.  On 14 Jul 2015, the trigger Configuration Steering Board (CSB) concurred with the Course of Action (COA) to validate the revised requirement for the Echelons Above Division (EAD) Gray Eagle and grant authorities through a new Acquisition Decision memorandum (ADM) to pursue the extended range capable Gray Eagle (Improved Gray Eagle) configuration.  IGE is an enhanced derivative of the MQ-1C Gray Eagle UAS and closes the capability gap by delivering extended surveillance coverage which supports Army RSTA missions in excess of 27 hours.  IGE’s extended range provides the capacity for multi-intelligence payloads, precision strike capability, special reconnaissance in support of Special Operations Forces (SOF), Mission command from Aerial Intelligence Brigade (AIB) and U.S. Army Special Operations Command (USASOC).  The Gray Eagle Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDTE) acquisition strategy emphasis will be to complete Developmental test events (Environmental, E3, Transportability, &amp; Performance Tests) to define and address system risks, followed by a FOTE II for the IGE.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Small Unmanned Aircraft System (SUAS) provides the battalion and below ground maneuver elements critical situational awareness and enhance force protection.  The system provides the small unit commander an organic and responsive tactical Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and Target Acquisition capability through the ability to view real-time Full Motion Video and sensor data via the system ground control stations.  Other compatible receivers, such as the One System Remote Video Terminal and appropriately equipped manned platforms may also receive the SUAS products.

A SUAS includes three hand-launched aircraft that do not require an improved launch/recovery location.  In addition to the aircraft, the system contains ground control equipment, which includes an interoperable hand controller.  The equipment is fully transportable in or on rucksack type packs that are organic to the unit.  SUAS is transitioning to a Capabilities Production Document (CPD) that will utilize existing RQ-11 and RQ-20 in a system of systems fielding concept, with a Short Range Micro (SRM) to be included later.

Justification: Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDTE) Base funding of $1.613 million will be utilized for Program Management Engineering support and to meet CPD Increment II Block II related requirements.  Specifically, the development of Tactical Open Government Architecture (TOGA) functionality to support new capabilities for mobile operations (embedded radio) and interface/control features including Interface Control Document (ICD) needed for SRM control and also perform developmental testing requirements as TOGA software is updated.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Small Unmanned Aircraft System (SUAS) provides the battalion and below ground maneuver elements critical situational awareness and enhance force protection.  The system provides the small unit commander an organic and responsive tactical Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and Target Acquisition capability through the ability to view real-time Full Motion Video and sensor data via the system ground control stations.  Other compatible receivers, such as the One System Remote Video Terminal and appropriately equipped manned platforms may also receive the SUAS products.

A SUAS includes three hand-launched aircraft that do not require an improved launch/recovery location.  In addition to the aircraft, the system contains ground control equipment, which includes an interoperable hand controller.  The equipment is fully transportable in or on rucksack type packs that are organic to the unit.  SUAS is transitioning to a Capabilities Production Document (CPD) that will utilize existing RQ-11 and RQ-20 in a system of systems fielding concept, with a Short Range Micro (SRM) to be included later.

Justification: Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDTE) Base funding of $1.613 million will be utilized for Program Management Engineering support and to meet CPD Increment II Block II related requirements.  Specifically, the development of Tactical Open Government Architecture (TOGA) functionality to support new capabilities for mobile operations (embedded radio) and interface/control features including Interface Control Document (ICD) needed for SRM control and also perform developmental testing requirements as TOGA software is updated.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Tactical Unmanned Aerial System (TUAS) RQ-7 provides the Army Brigade Commander with dedicated Reconnaissance, Surveillance and Target Acquisition (RSTA), Intelligence, Battle Damage Assessment (BDA), and Force Protection.  In line with the Army's Aviation Restructure Initiative (ARI) three Shadow Platoons are being integrated into the Combat Aviation Brigade's (CAB) Apache Reconnaissance Battalion.  This will provide Aviation Brigades with Manned-Unmanned-Teaming (MUM-T) and enhanced Aerial Scout capabilities.  The RQ-7B Shadow has logged over 945,600 flight hours, most of which were flown in support of Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO).  

The full Shadow system consists of four air vehicles with payload, two Universal Ground Control stations, two Universal Ground Data Terminals, one Portable Ground Control Station with Portable Ground Data Terminal, Ground Support Equipment, two launchers, ten High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWVs) with trailer(s), and a Light Medium Tactical Vehicle.  Each system is equipped with one Maintenance Section Multifunctional (MSM) and is supported at the division level by a Mobile Maintenance Facility (MMF).  The baseline fielded payload was the electro-optic infrared (EO/IR), but half of those were replaced with a Laser Designator (LD) payload.  All 104 systems required by the Army Procurement Objective (APO) have been procured.  In 2010 the Army G8 established an RQ-7B Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) MODs program.  This budget line procures modifications including the Shadow v2, System Modifications, Mission Simulators, and One System Remote Video Terminal upgrades (OSRVT).

Implements Shadow v2: Tactical Common Data Link with Type 1 Encryption and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) interoperability; solves obsolescence associated with legacy computer hardware and the SOLARIS operating system. Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) and spares are also included. 

Justification:  Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 RQ-7 UAV Base funding of $4.597 million will be used for capability and reliability improvements, specifically: Air Vehicle modifications development of the ability to operate in Global Positioning System (GPS) denied environment.  Additionally, funds will be for system engineering and system test and evaluation support.  Base funding will also be used to incorporate enhanced performance and interoperability into the OSRVT.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

All 104 systems required by the Army Procurement Objective (APO) have been procured.  In 2010 the Army G8 established an RQ-7B Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) MODs program.  This budget line procures modifications including the Shadow v2, System Modifications, Mission Simulators, and One System Remote Video Terminal (OSRVT) upgrades.

Implements Shadow RQ-7BV2: Tactical Common Data Link with Type 1 Encryption and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) interoperability; solves obsolescence associated with legacy computer hardware and the SOLARIS operating system. Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) and initial spares are also included. 

Justification:  Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 RQ-7 UAV Base funding of $4.597 million will be used for capability and reliability improvements. Air Vehicle Improvements include the ability to operate in Global Positioning System (GPS) denied environments.  Additionally, funds will be for system engineering and system test and evaluation support.  Base funding will also be used to incorporate enhanced performance and interoperability into the OSRVT.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>A System Capability Demonstration (SCD) was conducted with four contractors.  The results from the SCD in conjunction with proposal evaluations resulted in the competitive down select of a Best Value TUAS.  A successful Milestone II Army Systems Acquisition Review Council (ASARC) was conducted 21 Dec 1999 and a Milestone III Decision was reached on 25 Sep 2002.  The full rate production contract was awarded 27 Dec 2002 and in FY2009 the last of the authorized 104 systems was placed on contract.  Continued development of the selected Tactical Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (TUAV) system will be accomplished through a series of modifications and retrofits such as Shadow v2,  Communications Relay, Laser Designator, Block III engine, and reliability upgrades.  Development/integration of these improved capabilities will be through individual efforts on an engineering services contract with Shadow contractors.  Development of the Block III engine is being accomplished through a competitive process.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Army has two biometric tactical collection devices, the Biometric Automated Toolset-Army (BAT-A) Kit and BAT-A Handheld (HH).  These two devices support the Army Force Protection Mission and Identity Dominance Mission.  Product Manager (PM) Joint Personnel Identification (JPI) supports the Biometric Enterprise database system which delivers these innovative and emergent biometric solutions.  The BAT-A system is the Army’s biometric tactical collection devices which collect, match, store and share biometric and contextual information on Known &amp; Suspected Terrorists, potential adversaries, host nation personnel, and third country nationals.  Recipients of collected information include DoD organizations, other U.S. government agencies, and Coalition Partners.  The BAT-A devices are also used by non-Military Intelligence personnel (Infantry and Military Police).   The capability was originally deployed as a Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) and has been deployed in a combat zone and other OCONUS contingency operations for the past decade.  The original acquisition strategy for JPIv2 was to incorporate lessons learned through the QRC program; however, the Army refined the program acquisition strategy.  In accordance with the current guidance from the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army, the current BAT-A systems will serve as the Army biometrics enduring capability through FY22.  The Army Acquisition Executive approved the BAT-A Materiel Development Decision.  All research and development efforts are now concluded for JPIv2.  PM JPI will continue to serve as the Office of Primary Responsibility as the BAT-A is now a program of record in sustainment.

The additional FY17 RDT&amp;E OCO funding supports developmental activities to create vehicle-independent and tailorable Multi-INT Collection, Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination capability packages that can be installed and removed in a matter of minutes on any vehicle type to meet specific mission needs. In addition, the funds will enable development and testing of software code integrating new voice matching algorithms to deliver improved technical capabilities of stand-off voice biometric collection and speaker identification within the Voice Identity Biometrics Exploitation System (VIBES) QRC in order counter ever-changing threats facing deployed operational forces.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Army has two biometric tactical collection devices, the Biometric Automated Toolset-Army (BAT-A) Kit and BAT-A Handheld (HH).  These two devices support the Army Force Protection Mission and Identity Dominance Mission.  Product Manager (PM) Joint Personnel Identification (JPI) supports the Biometric Enterprise database system which delivers these innovative and emergent biometric solutions.  The BAT-A system is the Army’s biometric tactical collection devices which collect, match, store and share biometric and contextual information on Known &amp; Suspected Terrorists, potential adversaries, host nation personnel, and third country nationals.  Recipients of collected information include DoD organizations, other U.S. government agencies, and Coalition Partners.  The BAT-A devices are also used by non-Military Intelligence personnel (Infantry and Military Police).   The capability was originally deployed as a Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) and has been deployed in a combat zone and other OCONUS contingency operations for the past decade.  The original acquisition strategy for JPIv2 was to incorporate lessons learned through the QRC program; however, the Army refined the program acquisition strategy.  In accordance with the current guidance from the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army, the current BAT-A systems will serve as the Army biometrics enduring capability through FY22.  The Army Acquisition Executive approved the BAT-A Materiel Development Decision.  All research and development efforts are now concluded for JPIv2.  PM JPI will continue to serve as the Office of Primary Responsibility as the BAT-A is now a program of record in sustainment.

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Warfighter Information Network - Tactical Increment 2 (WIN-T Inc 2) provides the Army with On-The-Move (OTM) networking capability. The WIN-T Inc 2 network retains capabilities delivered by WIN-T Inc 1 and by leveraging proven Government and commercial technologies, adds greater network throughput and automated network management to optimize planning (to include spectrum use), initialization, monitoring and troubleshooting. WIN-T Inc 2 employs Satellite Communications OTM to extend the network in maneuver Brigade Combat Teams to Company-level through FY2018. Using equipment mounted on combat platforms, WIN-T Inc 2 delivers a mobile capability that reduces reliance on fixed infrastructure and allows Commanders to move on the battlefield while retaining situational awareness and mission command capabilities. Using the Highband Networking Radio, with the Highband Networking Waveform and high performance antennas, the WIN-T Inc 2 Line-of-Sight network offers an adaptive 30-Megabit per second aggregate throughput to Commanders in their Command Post or in their vehicle. The WIN-T Inc 2 network is self-forming, which means it automatically creates transmission paths based on terrain and environmental conditions; and self-healing, meaning that transmission paths will automatically re-route traffic to complete network transactions and calls even if one or more nodes break down or lose connectivity. This capability offers greater network reliability and better end-to-end connectivity than traditional point-to-point networks. WIN-T Inc 2 introduces the network management capability needed to keep mobile and dispersed forces networked through automated planning, initialization, monitoring, and troubleshooting. Finally, WIN-T Inc 2 adopts "Colorless Core" technology that encrypts both classified and unclassified user information in the network and minimizes the number of users on the "core" of the network. The Colorless Core allows commanders to utilize the tactical network without fear of the enemy intercepting information. Colorless Core is a technical insertion in the WIN-T Inc 1b network which enables information sharing between WIN-T Inc 1b and WIN-T Inc 2.

Inc 3 developed NetOps software and NetCentric Waveform (NCW) updates will be inserted into Inc 2 equipped units.

FY17 funds support Operational Testing (NIE 17.2) and continues tech insertion of NetOps Build 5 and upgrade to NCW 10.x.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Warfighter Information Network - Tactical Increment 2 (WIN-T Inc 2) provides the Army with On-The-Move (OTM) networking capability. The WIN-T Inc 2 network retains capabilities delivered by WIN-T Inc 1 and by leveraging proven Government and commercial technologies, adds greater network throughput and automated network management to optimize planning (to include spectrum use), initialization, monitoring and troubleshooting. WIN-T Inc 2 employs Satellite Communications OTM to extend the network in maneuver Brigade Combat Teams to Company-level through FY2018. Using equipment mounted on combat platforms, WIN-T Inc 2 delivers a mobile capability that reduces reliance on fixed infrastructure and allows Commanders to move on the battlefield while retaining situational awareness and mission command capabilities. Using the Highband Networking Radio, with the Highband Networking Waveform and high performance antennas, the WIN-T Inc 2 Line-of-Sight network offers an adaptive 30-Megabit per second aggregate throughput to Commanders in their Command Post or in their vehicle. The WIN-T Inc 2 network is self-forming, which means it automatically creates transmission paths based on terrain and environmental conditions; and self-healing, meaning that transmission paths will automatically re-route traffic to complete network transactions and calls even if one or more nodes break down or lose connectivity. This capability offers greater network reliability and better end-to-end connectivity than traditional point-to-point networks. WIN-T Inc 2 introduces the network management capability needed to keep mobile and dispersed forces networked through automated planning, initialization, monitoring, and troubleshooting. Finally, WIN-T Inc 2 adopts “Colorless Core” technology that encrypts both classified and unclassified user information in the network and minimizes the number of users on the “core” of the network. The Colorless Core allows commanders to utilize the tactical network without fear of the enemy intercepting information. Colorless Core is a technical insertion in the WIN-T Inc 1b network which enables information sharing between WIN-T Inc 1b and WIN-T Inc 2.

Inc 3 developed NetOps software and NetCentric Waveform (NCW) updates will be inserted into Inc 2 equipped units.

FY17 funds the development efforts for the Distributed Embedded SATCOM On-The-Move (OTM) Standard Terminal Architecture (DESSTA) for ABCTs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>
