                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The mission of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is to safeguard the United States and its allies from global weapons of mass destruction (WMD) threats by integrating, synchronizing, and providing responsive expertise, technologies, and capabilities.  This mission directly aligns with several national and Department of Defense (DoD) level guidance/vision documents.  For Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation (RDT&amp;E), these documents include the National Security Strategy, Defense Strategic Guidance (Sustaining U.S. Global Leadership: Priorities for 21st Century Defense), 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review, National Strategy for Combating Terrorism, National Strategy to Combat WMD, Defense Planning Guidance, Guidance for Employment of the Force, 2014 DoD Strategy for Countering WMD, National Military Strategic Plan for the War on Terrorism, and Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan (including the Nuclear Annex).  To achieve this mission, the DTRA has established strategies and tasks to meet the principal objectives of the above referenced documents.  These objectives are: 1) Ensure a safe, secure, and effective nuclear deterrent; 2) Anticipate emerging WMD threats; 3) Provide Combating WMD situational awareness; 4) Assess infrastructure and personnel vulnerabilities; 5) Prevent proliferation and use of WMD; 6) Defend against WMD threats; 7) Defeat WMD threats; 8) Recover from WMD consequences; and 9) Synchronize countering WMD activities. 

The Basic Research Initiative provides for the discovery and development of fundamental knowledge and understanding by research performers comprised from academia and world-class research institutions in Government and industry.  This leverages the DoD's $2 billion plus annual investment in basic research by ensuring a motivation within the scientific community to conduct research benefiting WMD-related defense missions and by improving knowledge of research efforts that benefit nonproliferation, counter proliferation, and consequence management efforts.  These efforts are closely coordinated with DTRA’s Chemical and Biological Technologies Department, which executes a chemical/biological basic research program under DoD’s Chemical and Biological Defense Program.  DTRA’s research interests are coordinated with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and the Services’ basic research programs through the Defense Basic Research Advisory Group.  DTRA reviews research interests annually to focus on technological areas which are not clearly addressed by other basic research efforts.

DTRA’s Basic Research portfolio supports several National and DoD initiatives directly related to Countering WMD (CWMD) including: Office of Science and Technology Policy Nuclear Defense Research and Development Roadmap, FY 2013-2017; Defense Budget Priorities and Choices for FY 2014;  Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Science and Technology Priority Steering Council Roadmap;  2012 Defense Strategic Guidance (Sustaining U.S. Global Leadership: Priorities for 21st Century Defense), and the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review.  In general, these documents direct capability enhancements, projects, and science and technology (S&amp;T) investments that support CWMD and reduce global nuclear dangers. Specifically they include: accelerating the development of standoff radiological/nuclear detection capabilities; researching countermeasures and defenses to non-traditional agents; enhancing nuclear forensics; securing vulnerable materials; developing new verification technologies; developing an in-depth understanding of the capabilities, values, intent, and decision making of potential foes, whether they are states, networks, or individuals; defeating WMD agents; researching biologically-based or inspired materials for DoD applications; and leveraging science, technology, and innovation through domestic and international partnerships and agreements.  Basic research supporting all of these needs is included in this program element under Project RU-Fundamental Research for Combating WMD.

This project supports several national and Department initiatives directly related to countering WMD including: Office of Science and Technology Policy, Nuclear Defense Research and Development Roadmap, FY 2013-2017; Defense Budget Priorities and Choices for FY 2014; Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Science and Technology Priority Steering Council Roadmap; 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance (Sustaining U.S. Global Leadership: Priorities for 21st Century Defense), and the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review.  In general, these documents direct capability enhancements, projects, and Science and Technology (S&amp;T) investments that support Countering WMD (CWMD) and reduce global nuclear dangers.  Specifically, they include: accelerating the development of standoff radiological/nuclear detection capabilities; researching countermeasures and defenses to non-traditional agents; enhancing nuclear forensics; securing vulnerable materials; developing new verification technologies; developing an in-depth understanding of the capabilities, values, intent, and decision making of potential adversaries, whether they are states, networks, or individuals; defeating WMD agents; researching biologically-based and inspired materials for DoD applications; and leveraging science, technology, and innovation through domestic and international partnerships and agreements. Specific activities for Project RU include: Sensing and Recognition – Generation of information that provides knowledge of the presence, identity, and/or quantity of material or energy in the environment that may be significant; Network Sciences – Enhance fundamental knowledge of theory, representations, and mapping to improve the WMD-related robustness, resiliency, recovery of, and informational and operational utility associated with and derived from, complex disparate but interdependent networks; Protection Sciences – Advance knowledge for protection of personnel, resources, sensitive systems and infrastructure from WMD; Sciences to Defeat WMD – Phenomena that improves success of defeat actions (use of weapons) including explosives, accessing and defeating target WMDs, such as biological agents and weapons modeling; and Sciences to Secure WMD – Improve understanding of phenomena for verification and compliance with treaties, including test detection.  Additional activities for Project RU include the discovery of revolutionary control methods to monitor and secure components, materials, and weapons, and disrupt proliferation pathways; and cooperative research with global partners – research to reduce the global threat of WMD in collaboration with a broad range of international partners. Finally, this project supports and administers the Cooperative Biological Engagement Program for academic engagements which has the core goals of securing dangerous pathogens, promoting open and active disease reporting and response, advancing transparent research to understand pathogens, and developing potential countermeasures.

The decrease from FY 2014 to FY 2015 reflects a reduced effort in combating WMD basic research resulting in reductions to the number of active basic research awards.  The increase from FY 2015 to FY 2016 maintains the investment in basic research to keep pace with inflation.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The mission of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is to safeguard the United States and its allies from global weapons of mass destruction (WMD) threats by integrating, synchronizing, and providing responsive expertise, technologies, and capabilities.  This mission directly aligns with several national and Department of Defense (DoD) level guidance/vision documents.  For Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation (RDT&amp;E), these documents include the National Security Strategy, Defense Strategic Guidance (Sustaining U.S. Global Leadership: Priorities for 21st Century Defense), 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review, National Strategy for Combating Terrorism, 2014 DoD Strategy for Countering WMD, National Strategy to Combat WMD, Defense Planning Guidance, Guidance for Employment of the Force, 2006 National Military Strategy for Combating WMD, National Military Strategic Plan for the War on Terrorism, and Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan (including the Nuclear Annex).  To achieve this mission, DTRA has established strategies and tasks to meet their principal objectives.  These objectives are: 1) Ensure a safe, secure, and effective nuclear deterrent; 2) Anticipate emerging WMD threats; 3) Provide Combating WMD situational awareness; 4) Assess infrastructure and personnel vulnerabilities; 5) Prevent proliferation and use of WMD; 6) Defend against WMD threats; 7) Defeat WMD threats; 8) Recover from WMD consequences; and 9) Synchronize countering WMD activities. 

A focused and strong WMD threat reduction technology base is critical to meeting these objectives.  This technology base is closely tied with the operational support programs that make up DTRA’s combat support mission.  DTRA's has taken the steps to develop this technology base and provide a foundation for transformational activities within the WMD arena.

Activities funded by Program Element 0602718BR implement a wide set of National Security Presidential Directive 17 and emerging Presidential Policy Directive guidance for prevention of proliferation of WMD and WMD terrorism.  Projects support the prevention and adversary use of WMD through the development of technology to locate and identify nuclear threats, post-detonation forensics, and treaty verification.  Through development of new sensor systems, sensor networks, counterforce and fundamental Counter-WMD (CWMD) research, these programs contribute to securing and interdicting WMD, WMD delivery systems, and related materials.  Finally, programs in this area fund the development of tools for the DTRA Technical Reachback analysis center which supports United States and allied forces, interagency, and civil authorities with 24 hour/7 days per week Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High-yield Explosives (CBRNE) event analysis support.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The detection mission is to conduct Research, Development, Test, &amp; Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) to 1) identify, develop, and exploit signatures associated with nuclear threat enablers such as nuclear expertise, financing, or unique materials to advance U.S. capabilities to detect and interdict such threats; and 2) locate, identify, and track special nuclear material and improve detection factors such as range, time, sensitivity, or accuracy to enhance Service/Special Mission Unit capabilities. These efforts support Department of Defense (DoD) requirements for combating terrorism, counter/nonproliferation, and homeland defense. 

The increase from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to the subdivision of Project RF-Detection and Forensics Technologies into Projects RD-Detection Technologies and RF-Forensics Technologies beginning in FY 2016.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>*Project RF-Detection and Forensics Technologies subdivides into Projects RD-Detection Technologies and RF-Forensics Technologies beginning in FY 2016.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports the attribution process through development, demonstration, and transition of improved post-detonation National Technical Nuclear Forensics (NTNF) capabilities in the areas of materials collection, debris diagnostics, materials analysis, prompt diagnostics, and device reconstruction.  Starting in FY 2016, detection-related technologies transition to Project RD (Detection Technologies).  Project RF includes Research, Development, Test, &amp; Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) to detect, locate, identify, track, and interdict nuclear and radiological threats. This includes weapons, material, and enablers to their acquisition, and development such as nuclear expertise, financing, or unique technologies. These efforts support Department of Defense (DoD) requirements for combating terrorism, counter/nonproliferation, and homeland defense.

The increase from FY 2014 to FY 2015 is due to increased investments in both nuclear detection Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance efforts and nuclear forensics.  The decrease from FY 2015 to FY 2016 in Project RF is due to the realignment of nuclear threat detection activities into Project RD-Detection Technologies.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Defeat Technologies project develops, integrates, demonstrates and transitions innovative kinetic and non-kinetic weapon capabilities to expand traditional and asymmetric options available to Combatant Commanders to deny, disrupt, and defeat adversarial use of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) while minimizing collateral effects.  Technology development focuses on the physical or functional defeat of (1) chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threat materials, (2) an adversary's ability to deliver the same, and (3) the physical and non-physical support networks enabling both. This project achieves its goals through the systematic identification and maturation of technologies capable of defeating WMD agents or agent based processes, then integrating them into weapons delivery systems for rapid WMD elimination.  This project includes developing specific WMD agent/agent-based process simulants, test infrastructure, and sampling capability required for effective development, testing, and evaluation of next-generation Counter-WMD (CWMD) technologies.

The project places a high priority on understanding, characterizing, and validating potential weapon effects within mathematical confidence as it relates to the unintended release of hazardous threat materials.  

The decrease from FY 2014 to FY 2015 is due to reduced investment in next generation CWMD technologies to balance other priorities.  The increase from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to increased investment in component demonstrations and sub-scale and field testing of WMD defeat and assessment technologies.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Nuclear Survivability project provides innovative technologies for DoD nuclear and conventional forces, associated control and support systems, and facilities to protect and deter nuclear threats to enable mission-essential functions to continue during and after the onset of hostile action by extremists and rogue states. The Nuclear Survivability project provides electromagnetic pulse (EMP) research and standards, Nuclear Weapons Effects (NWE) experimentation, advanced Radiation Hardened Microelectronics (RHM), and human survivability research.  The research from this project supports the 487 mission critical systems identified under DoDI 3150.09, Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Survivability Policy.

DTRA is the DoD designated EMP center of excellence to provide electromagnetic pulse survivability assessments to support national and military operational planning, weapons effects predictions, and national strategic system designs.  DTRA publishes nuclear related military standards and handbooks for the strategic and non-strategic warfighters and program offices as the DoD NWE subject matter expert.

The RHM program responds to DoD space and missile system requirements for nanoelectronics and photonics technology to support DoD strategic mission needs.  This program develops and demonstrates radiation-hardened, high-performance prototype microelectronics to ensure their availability from both private sector and government organizations. Further, the program develops DoD space and satellite nuclear survivability standards and handbooks that provide engineering level detail and defined metrics for all entities with space asset equities.

Pulsed power and laser-driven NWE simulators are available to validate nuclear survivability requirements for DoD missile and space systems, conduct radiation effects research in materials and electronics, and validate computational models.  The Experimental Capabilities Program is working with the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) and the United Kingdom's (UK) Atomic Weapons Establishment to jointly develop new enabling technologies for improved NWE experimentation capabilities for x-rays, gamma rays, and neutrons.

Human survivability conducts research to develop and validate mortality and morbidity models associated with radiological and nuclear weapons effects in urban environments.

The decrease from FY 2014 to FY 2015 is due to reduced investment in nuclear effects simulation/experimentation capability and radiation hardened nanoelectronics.  The increase from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to the realignment of the system vulnerabilities and assessment activities from Project RL-Nuclear &amp; Radiological Effects to Project RI.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The increase from FY 2014 to FY 2015 is due to the net effect of the cancellation of the Experimental Situational Awareness Center, a shift in priorities from weapon effects modeling to electromagnetic pulse modeling, and increased investment in full effects modeling.  The decrease from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to an administrative realignment of the System Vulnerability and Assessment program to Project RI-Nuclear Survivability due to the nature of that effort.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Counterforce Technologies Project provides applied research to support 1) full and sub-scale testing required to investigate countering WMD weapon effects and sensor performance, 2) weapon effects modeling algorithm development, and 3) development of visualization and situational awareness tools to support the next generation Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) Technical Reachback analysis cell.

This project provides Combatant Commanders with the prediction capability and the attack options to engage WMD targets.  The project conducts weapon effects phenomenology tests, analyzes data, conducts high performance computer simulations, and creates/modifies software to more accurately model and simulate weapons effects on WMD and related targets.  These efforts will lead to advanced capabilities in countering WMD planning tools.  The Advanced Energetics Program develops new novel energetic materials and weapon design technology for rapid, directed, and enhanced energy release, providing new capability to defeat difficult WMD/Hard and Deeply Buried Targets. The Advanced Energetics Program develops new high energy systems well above current chemical energy levels to defeat WMD targets beyond the reach of traditional high explosive blast/frag warhead technology.

The decrease from FY 2014 to FY 2015 is due to reduced investment in small and medium-scale validation and parametric study experiments for advanced energetics.  The decrease from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to decreased investment in weapons effects modeling.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>RR Project title changed from Test Infrastructure to Combating WMD Test and Evaluation starting in FY 2015.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Combating Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Test and Evaluation Project provides a unique national test bed capability for simulated WMD facility characterization, weapon-target interaction, and WMD facility defeat testing to respond to operational needs by developing and maintaining test beds used by the Department of Defense (DoD), the Military Services, the Combatant Commanders, and other Federal Agencies to evaluate the implications of WMD, conventional, and other special weapon use against United States military or civilian systems and targets.  It leverages 50 years of testing expertise to investigate weapons effects and target response across the spectrum of hostile environments that could be created by proliferate nations or terrorist organizations with access to advanced conventional weapons or WMD (nuclear, biological, and chemical).  The project provides capabilities that support the testing requirements of warfighters, other government agencies, and friendly foreign countries.  It creates testing strategies and a WMD Test Bed infrastructure focusing on the structural response of buildings and Hard and Deeply Buried Targets that house nuclear, biological, and chemical facilities.  It provides support for full and sub-scale tests that focus on weapon-target interaction with fixed soft and hardened facilities to include above ground facilities, cut-and-cover facilities, and deep underground tunnels.  This capability does not exist anywhere else within the DoD and supports the counterproliferation pillar of the National Strategy to Combat WMD.

The decrease from FY 2014 to FY 2015 is due to the cancellation of the Infrastructure Development and Improvement program to balance priorities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The advancement of technology and science into applied technology development efforts focuses upon increasing the stability and utility of mid-to-long term, moderate risk but high payoff science, and emerging technologies for transition to other DTRA applied technology programs.  This effort serves as the bridge between the bench scientist and the applied technologist.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The mission of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is to safeguard the United States and its allies from global weapons of mass destruction (WMD) threats by integrating, synchronizing, and providing responsive expertise, technologies, and capabilities.  This mission directly reflects several national and Department of Defense (DoD) level guidance/vision documents.  For Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation, these documents include the National Security Strategy, Defense Strategic Guidance (Sustaining U.S. Global Leadership: Priorities for 21st Century Defense), 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review, National Strategy for Combating Terrorism, 2002 National Strategy to Combat WMD, Defense Planning Guidance, Guidance for Employment of the Force, 2014 DoD Strategy for Countering WMD, National Military Strategic Plan for the War on Terrorism, Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan (including the Nuclear Annex), and 2010 Nuclear Posture Review.  To achieve this mission, DTRA has identified principal objectives along with strategies and tasks to ensure the objectives are met.  These objectives are: 1) Ensure a safe, secure, and effective nuclear deterrent; 2) Anticipate emerging WMD threats; 3) Provide Combating WMD situational awareness; 4) Assess infrastructure and personnel vulnerabilities; 5) Prevent proliferation and use of WMD; 6) Defend against WMD threats; 7) Defeat WMD threats; 8) Recover from WMD consequences; and 9) Synchronize countering WMD activities.

The Counterproliferation Initiatives - Proliferation, Prevention, and Defeat program element reduces WMD proliferation and enhances WMD defeat capabilities through advanced technology development.  To accomplish this objective, the DTRA established the following projects:  RA-Information Sciences and Applications, RD-Detection Technologies, RE-Counter-Terrorism Technologies, RF-Forensics Technologies, RG-Defeat Technologies, RI-Nuclear Survivability, RM-WMD Counterforce Technologies, and RT-Target Assessment Technologies.  These projects support technology requirements in line with the Joint Functional Concepts (Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 3170.01).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Information Sciences and Applications project provides technical reachback support to create decision advantage for the United States and our allies through improved situational understanding across the complete Combating Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) mission space. The Technical Reachback effort provides 24 hour/7 days per week information and analyses on potential impacts of a weapon of mass destruction (WMD) event to warfighters and first responders in consult with the DTRA’s CWMD research and development subject matter experts. This effort develops and integrates capabilities and processes to support assessment and estimation of WMD effects and consequences, to include secondary and tertiary effects.  This project has also provided support (through FY 2014) to international CWMD science and technology cooperation by developing modifications, improvements, or new technologies and information tools suitable for foreign release and cooperative efforts. 

The decrease from FY 2014 to FY 2015 was due to the completion of efforts in building partner capacity development activities.  The increase from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to the realignment of funding for Technical Reachback from Project RM-WMD Counterforce Technologies to Project RA to better reflect the nature of those activities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The United States has long recognized the challenges associated with a state actor losing custody of a nuclear weapon or of a violent extremist organization gaining control of such a device.  The Defense Threat Reduction Agency’s research and development mitigates these challenges by enabling Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction efforts through advancing radiation detection capabilities.  There are physical limits to the efficacy of traditional radiation detection, and the successful recovery or interdiction of a weapon may depend on detection capabilities that apply much earlier in the nuclear threat chain continuum.  The nuclear threat chain continuum can be defined as the entire spectrum of activities that might lead to the state loss or violent extremist organization acquisition of a nuclear weapon.  Beginning FY 2016, Project RD will conduct research, development, test, &amp; evaluation (RDT&amp;E) to 1) advance detection—both sensor technology and related methodologies—for signatures/indicators associated with nuclear threat enablers such as nuclear expertise, financing, or unique materials in order to advance U.S. Government capabilities to detect and interdict such threats; and 2) locate, identify, and track Special Nuclear Material by integrating new technologies into detection systems and delivering prototypes for evaluation and further procurement by Services/Special Mission Units. These efforts support Department of Defense (DoD) requirements for combating terrorism, counter/nonproliferation, and homeland defense.

The increase from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to the subdivision of Project RF-Detection and Forensics Technologies into projects RD-Detection Technologies and RF-Forensics Technologies beginning in FY 2016.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Counter-Terrorism Technologies project is an over-arching project that develops and transitions a full spectrum of new technologies to counter emergent weapons of mass destruction (WMD) thus enabling warfighters to improve their ability to detect, disable, interdict, neutralize, and destroy chemical, biological, nuclear production, storage, and weaponization facilities and systems.  This high priority project focuses on support to the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM).  Through enhancing USSOCOM capabilities, this project supports the highest priority mission areas in the National Security Strategy, the National Strategy to Combat WMD, the National Military Strategy to Combat WMD, the Quadrennial Defense Review, and the Guidance on the Employment of the Force.  The following efforts are included:

The CWMD-T technologies program builds upon collaborative efforts with the warfighter.  This program develops proofs of concept and subsequent advancements in research, development, testing, and evaluation and provides multi-mission capabilities that may be applied throughout the entire spectrum of warfare while significantly eliminating collateral damage.  The CWMD-T technologies program develops technologies to enable the warfighter to locate, identify, characterize, and access Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear WMDs, their production and storage facilities, and associated enablers at multiple nodes along the terrorist development/acquisition pathway in order to disrupt, delay, degrade, destroy, or deny WMDs while minimizing risk to U.S. forces.

The Counter WMD-Terrorism (CWMD-T) Counterproliferation research and development (R&amp;D) program is a collaborative effort with USSOCOM in which DTRA manages and sub-allocates a portion of this funding directly to USSOCOM to develop warfighter-unique technologies in support of USSOCOM’s counterterrorism and counterproliferation mission.  New counterterrorism and counterproliferation technologies are developed under USSOCOM management, and in coordination with DTRA, to provide warfighters with the operational capability to counter WMD threats.

Under Project RE, the USSOCOM CWMD-T Support Program integrates and federates all-source intelligence and other information with operational analysis to support Combatant Command (CCMD) planning processes related to CWMD-T.  Research is focused on developing and improving technologies to ingest, organize, interpret, and operationalize large amounts of data from many sources, multiple formats, and all relevant classification levels to provide the warfighter with a dynamic picture of the WMD-T operational environment.

The increase from FY 2014 to FY 2015 was due to increased investments in technology solutions supporting operations in subterranean environments.  The decrease from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to the deferment of lower priority projects until further maturation in technology readiness level.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>*Project RF-Detection and Forensics Technologies subdivides into Project RD-Detection Technologies and Project RF-Forensics Technologies beginning in FY 2016.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Forensics Technologies project under the Counterproliferation Initiatives - Proliferation, Prevention and Defeat Program Element emphasizes the advanced technology development and engineering portion of the overall National Technical Nuclear Forensics (NTNF) effort. This project supports the attribution process through development, demonstration, and transition of improved post-detonation NTNF capabilities in the areas of materials collection, debris diagnostics, materials analysis, prompt diagnostics, and device reconstruction. Efforts under this project also support international peacekeeping and nonproliferation objectives, on-site and aerial inspections and monitoring, on-site sampling and sample transport, and on- and off-site analysis to meet forensic, verification, monitoring, and confidence-building requirements.  Prior to FY 2016, Project RF included funding to detect, locate, identify, track, and interdict nuclear and radiological threats.  This included weapons, material, and enablers to their acquisition and development, such as nuclear expertise, financing, or unique technologies.  Efforts support Department of Defense (DoD) requirements for combating terrorism, counter/nonproliferation, and homeland defense.

The decrease from FY 2014 to FY 2015 was due to reduced investment in novel advanced nuclear/radiological detection technologies and restructuring DoD-relevant monitoring and verification activities in support of the DoD proliferation monitoring mission. The decrease from FY 2015 to FY 2016 in Project RF is due to the realignment of nuclear threat detection activities into Project RD-Detection Technologies.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Defeat Technologies project develops, integrates, demonstrates and transitions innovative kinetic and non-kinetic weapon capabilities to expand traditional and asymmetric options available to Combatant Commanders (CCDRs) to deny, disrupt, and defeat adversarial use of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) while minimizing collateral effects from incidentally released agents.  Technology development focuses on the physical or functional defeat of (1) chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threat materials, (2) an adversary's ability to deliver the same, and (3) the physical and non-physical support networks enabling both.  It does so through the systematic identification and maturation of advanced technologies capable of defeating WMD agents or agent based processes, then integrating them into weapons, delivery systems or rapid WMD elimination capabilities.  This project includes developing specific WMD agent/agent-based process simulants, test infrastructure, and sampling capability required for effective development, testing, and evaluation of next-generation capabilities to ensure optimum weapon solutions are achieved based on this technology.  The project addresses defeat of adversaries' offensive WMD programs through integration of current conventional weapons capabilities and next generation kinetic and non-kinetic solutions to provide full-spectrum asymmetric defeat options.  The project addresses requirements delineated in the Quadrennial Defense Review and Strategic Planning Guidance as codified in the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System, Service requirements documents, and Combatant Command and Agency Priority Lists for lethal and non-lethal Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) capability.

The increase from FY 2014 to FY 2015 was due to increased investment in CWMD Hard Target Defeat Weapons Technologies.  The increase from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to increased investment to build and conduct the initial full-scale testing of the Next Generation of CWMD weapon concept.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Nuclear Survivability project develops Radiation Hardened Microelectronics and survivability standards; provides radiation dose assessments; and provides for the execution of force-on-force evaluations and nuclear weapons surety efforts to enhance the protection of nuclear resources.

The Nuclear Test Personnel Review (NTPR) Program, established in public law, confirms participation in nuclear testing and related events and provides radiation dose assessments for atomic veterans.  The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) provides subject matter expertise for the dose reconstructions.  The NTPR is administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Justice for radiogenic disease compensation programs.

The Mighty Guardian force-on-force tests aid in satisfying requirements for the Military Services by providing denial of access to nuclear resources in all environments: operational, storage, and in transit.  The results of the evaluations identify security vulnerabilities to weapons systems that are then addressed through targeted application of research and development projects requested by the resource owners.  These projects are designed to demonstrate, test, and evaluate security enhancement systems prior to the Services' procurement.

Nuclear Weapons Surety, as tasked by the Department of Defense (DoD) Nuclear Weapon System Safety Program, provides Combatant Commands (CCMDs), Military Services, and Joint Chiefs of Staff with technical analyses, studies, research, and experimental data necessary to identify and quantify risks of plutonium dispersal and loss of assured safety due to accidents, fires, or natural causes during peacetime operations of the nation’s nuclear weapon systems.  Additionally, this will provide studies necessary to quantify the probability of success against targeted terrorist attacks on DoD facilities, while leveraging these risk assessment advances.  It also provides new and innovative technologies for the protection of nuclear resources in support of CCMDs and Military Services.  

The decrease from FY 2014 to FY 2015 was due to the net impact of increased investment in stockpile logistics and decreased investment in nuclear surety in FY 2015.  The increase from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to increased investment in the nuclear surety program.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Counterforce Technologies project develops, integrates, demonstrates and transitions emerging/innovative technologies to find, characterize, plan for the defeat of, and assess WMD threats.  The two major components of this project are: (1) WMD battlespace awareness and (2) counter WMD (CWMD) weapons effects and planning tools.  WMD battlespace awareness efforts seek to provide warfighters with capabilities to find, characterize, and assess WMD threats.  This project provides capabilities through the development and integration of multi-mission Unmanned Aerial Systems payloads to emplace sensing technologies, and remotely sense, identify, track, and target WMD-related threats; and, through the development and integration of low visibility, stand-off, and man-portable chemical agent and biological agent intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance technologies to sense, identify, track, target, and assess WMD-related threats. The CWMD weapons effects and planning tools effort develops modernized, fast-running, and validated CWMD planning tools and integrates modeling and simulation software to aid Combatant Commanders’ targeting and aid weapons officers in choosing the proper weapon, fuze, and employment parameters to optimize the defeat of WMD and related hard targets.

The decrease from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to the realignment of funding for Technical Reachback from Project RM to Project RA-Information Sciences and Applications.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>For some weapons of mass destruction (WMD) targets and hard and deeply buried targets (HDBTs), physical destruction may not be possible, practical, or desirable with current conventional weapons and employment techniques.  It may be possible or preferable to achieve operational objectives by denying or disrupting the mission or function of the target facility.  Functional defeat, however, requires extensive and highly detailed analysis of the target.  The functional defeat process includes finding and identifying a facility, characterizing its function and physical layout, determining its vulnerabilities to available defeat mechanisms, planning and executing an attack, assessing damage, and if necessary, suppressing reconstitution efforts and re-attacking the facility.  Target Assessment Technologies develops for both the Combatant Commands (CCMDs) and the Intelligence Community (IC), the analytical tools and processes required to find and characterize WMD targets and HDBTs; and then, in near-real-time, assess the results of attacks against those targets.  Overall objectives are to develop new methodologies, processes and technologies for detecting, locating, identifying, physically and functionally characterizing, modeling, and assessing new and existing hard and deeply buried targets to support physical or functional defeat.  Applying these processes to WMD time-dependent target characterization and threat analysis presents a further technical challenge.  

The increase from FY 2014 to FY2015 was due to increased investment in the development and integration of high-priority find, characterize and assess sensor technologies and supporting algorithms and software.  This project has the only identified solution capable of meeting a time sensitive mission critical technology gap.  The increase from FY 2015 to FY 2016 reflects the continuing increased investment in the development and integration of high-priority find, characterize and assess sensor technologies and supporting algorithms and software.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

*Integrated Weapons of Mass Destruction Toolset investments are to be completed in FY 2014.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The mission of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency is to safeguard the United States and its allies from global weapons of mass destruction (WMD) threats by integrating, synchronizing, and providing responsive expertise, technologies, and capabilities.  This mission directly aligns with several National and Department of Defense (DoD) level guidance/vision documents. For Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation, these documents include the National Security Strategy, Defense Strategic Guidance (Sustaining U.S. Global Leadership: Priorities for 21st Century Defense), Quadrennial Defense Review, National Strategy for Combating Terrorism, 2014 DoD Strategy for Countering WMD, National Strategy to Combat WMD, Defense Planning Guidance, Guidance for Employment of the Force, National Military Strategic Plan for the War on Terrorism, and Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan (including the Nuclear Annex).  To achieve this mission, DTRA established strategies and tasks to meet their principal objectives.  These objectives are: 1) Ensure a safe, secure, and effective nuclear deterrent; 2) Anticipate emerging WMD threats; 3) Provide Combating WMD situational awareness; 4) Assess infrastructure and personnel vulnerabilities; 5) Prevent proliferation and use of WMD; 6) Defend against WMD threats; 7) Defeat WMD threats; 8) Recover from WMD consequences; and 9) Synchronize countering WMD activities. 

This program element supports the development of system capabilities for the countering weapons of mass destruction (CWMD) mission.  This funding specifically supports technologies to meet International Monitoring System technology requirements in support of nuclear arms control activities under the Nuclear Arms Control Technology program. Through FY 2014, funding also supported the development of collaborative CWMD analysis capabilities between the DoD and key interagency and international partners through a globally accessible net-centric framework in the form of the Integrated Weapons of Mass Destruction Toolset.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports the development of verification and monitoring capabilities for the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) to counter proliferation and weapons of mass destruction (WMD).  DTRA’s Nuclear Arms Control Technologies (NACT) program performs Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) to improve the sustainability, reliability, and effectiveness of capabilities related to its operational mission to install, operate, maintain, and sustain the waveform and radionuclide nuclear detonation detection stations comprising the U.S. portion of the International Monitoring System (IMS).  This delivers data to the U.S. monitoring and verification community and enables U.S. compliance with the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) in support of U.S. and Department of Defense (DoD) nonproliferation objectives.  
  
The project addresses WMD monitoring, implementation of, and compliance with arms control agreement requirements validated by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics.  This project conforms to the administration’s research and development priorities related to WMD arms control and disablement.  Technical assessments are made against CTBT implementation requirements and U.S. objectives to provide the basis for sound project development, evaluate existing programs, provide data required to inform compliance assessments and support U.S. monitoring policy, decision-makers, and negotiation teams. 
 
The primary RDT&amp;E program emphasis is on improvements that enable the installation of treaty-specific stations, which reduce costs and increase the reliability in diverse and often harsh environments; improve efficiency, performance, reliability, and sustainability of existing stations and treaty-specified verification capabilities; and improve capabilities to detect, characterize, and enable discrimination of, nuclear weapons tests.  The NACT program directly supports U.S. and allied warfighter and national technical monitoring requirements and provides vital data used by the treaty monitoring community, warfighter planners, DoD, other U.S. Government agencies, and international agencies.  

The increase from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is for an enhanced level of investment in research on radionuclide sampling and analytical capabilities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>The goal of the NACT RDT&amp;E program is to enable full compliance of all emerging data quality requirements and other requirements as documented in CTBT treaty language, CTBT-issued Radionuclide and Waveform Operations Manuals, and other CTBT Organization communications.  RDT&amp;E is conducted in support of NACT’s operational mission to operate, maintain, and sustain the Provisional Technical Secretariat certified waveform and radionuclide CTBT monitoring stations in accordance with CTBT requirements. CTBT IMS data availability/timeliness performance specifications/requirements are currently 98% data availability for IMS waveform and 95% for IMS radionuclide systems.  Data quality metrics continue to evolve as the entire CTBT IMS capability is exercised and tested.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                            <r2:Remarks>The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) Nuclear Arms Control program installs, operates, maintains, and sustains the waveform and radionuclide nuclear detonation detection stations comprising the U.S. portion of the International Monitoring Systems (IMS) in order to deliver data to the U.S. monitoring and verification community and to enable U.S. compliance to the terms of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) in support of U.S. and Department of Defense (DOD) nonproliferation objectives.  The project addresses weapons of mass destruction (WMD) monitoring requirements validated by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics.  This project conforms to the administration’s research and development priorities as related to WMD arms control and disablement. Technical assessments are made against CTBT implementation requirements and U.S. objectives to provide the basis for sound project development, evaluate existing programs, and provide the data required to inform compliance assessments, and support U.S. monitoring policy and decision-makers, and negotiation teams.  NOTE:  As this program and its requirements mature and legacy contract vehicles expire, the composition of the performer base under DTRA program management will be dynamic.</r2:Remarks>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Efforts in this Project were completed in FY 2014. Under Project RL, the Net-Centric Architecture program integrated legacy capabilities and facilitated data sharing through a net-centric framework. It provided near-real time collaborative analysis capabilities between the Department of Defense (DoD) and key interagency and international partners through a globally accessible net-centric framework known as the Integrated Weapons of Mass Destruction Toolset.  This toolset migrated the Defense Threat Reduction Agency's (DTRA's) chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear modeling and simulation codes to provide an integrated suite of Combating WMD decision support capabilities. The framework was the only operational chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high-yield explosives (CBRNE) framework in the world that provided capabilities through web applications, net-centric web services, and stand-alone mobile deployments which are validated and accredited for operational use by international, National, state, and local authorities.  

The decrease in FY 2015 is due to the completion of Integrated Weapons of Mass Destruction Toolset investments.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:Remarks>All prior year costs and activities for Integrated Weapons of Mass Destruction Toolset (IWMDT), Nuclear Capability Server (NuCS), and Consequence of Execution (COE) were assigned under Project BD of PE 0602716BR.  IWMDT was funded in 2004 by a competitive Cost Plus Award Fee (CPAF) contract for $12.425M over a 3-year period.  At end of FY 2006, its follow-on contract was awarded with an initial $0.300M increment.  IWMDT efforts continued into FY 2013 with $58.555M applied.  The Joint Collaborative Analysis Model, a subcomponent within IWMDT will be openly competed under one of the new DTRA Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contracts for approximately $2.500M for FY  2014.</r2:Remarks>
