            <proc:Description>The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program will develop and field a family of aircraft that meets the needs of the United States and its international partners.  Specifically, the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) will meet the USAF Conventional Take Off and Landing (CTOL) requirements with the F-35A variant, the USMC Short Take-Off and Vertical Landing (STOVL) requirements with the F-35B variant, and DoN Carrier Variant (CV) requirements with the F-35C variant.  Commonality among the three variants is expected to reduce life cycle costs.  This is a joint program with no executive service.  Service Acquisition Executive (SAE) authority alternates between the Department of Navy (DoN) and the Department of the Air Force (DAF) and currently resides with the Navy.  The F-35 is the next generation strike fighter which entails increased aero performance, stealth signature and countermeasures.  Its advanced avionics, data links and adverse weather precision targeting incorporate the latest technology available.  The highly supportable, affordable, state-of-the-art aircraft commands and maintains global air superiority.  The production cost and quantities are interdependent due to one manufacturer for the program.  USAF regular procurement commenced in FY07 with Long-Lead in FY06 and DoN regular procurement commenced in FY08 with long lead in FY07.

Notes:

(1) Funding for this exhibit contained in PE 0207142F

(2) Funding may be used to alleviate Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues. 

(3) The F-35 is a code B item (pre full rate production decision).  Refer to the R4 budget exhibit for PE 0604800F for the Developmental Test and Evaluation and the Initial Operational Test and Evaluation schedules.

(4) FY16 procurement quantity includes congressional add of 3 aircraft.</proc:Description>

                    <proc:Remarks>1)  Airframe Unit Recurring Flyaway (URF) is directly affected by USAF, USN and International Partners quantity profile changes year over year.

(2) Non-recurring cost includes such items as the USAF share of Production Non-Recurring Tooling per the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) Production, Sustainment, and Follow-on Development (PSFD) Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the United States and eight partner nations cooperating in the production, sustainment, and follow-on development of the JSF. In addition, it includes funding for Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (e.g."Life-of-type" part buys), concurrency engineering, technical assistance and Cost Reduction Initiatives (CRI).

(3) Year-over-year changes in Ancillary Equipment costs are due to changes in annual aircraft quantities. Equipment includes Gen III Helmet Mounted Displays, launchers, and pilot flight equipment.

(4) Peculiar Ground Support Equipment (PGSE) costs driven by squadron standup and unit deployment package schedules.

(5) Peculiar Training Equipment costs driven by the stand up of full complement of Full Mission Simulators (FMS) for one OPS site in FY17 (7 FMS), the phased procurement of Lakenheath between FY18 (3 FMS) &amp; FY19 (2 FMS). Also USAF will stand up three OPS sites with FMS procurements in FY20 (4 FMS) and FY21 (8 FMS).

(6) Year-over-year increase in support cost is greater than OMB/OSD inflation rate due to site and squadron stand-up of aircraft, and ramp-up to full operational capability.

(7) ALIS (Autonomic Logistics Information System) funding is now reflected within the Pubs/Tech Data/ALIS cost element reflected in the P-5.

            <proc:Description>Replacement of the legacy tanker fleet will take place in three stages, known as the KC-X (now the KC-46), KC-Y, and KC-Z. The initial Tanker Replacement increment of KC-46s will replace roughly a third of the current capability. The Air Force completed an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) in Apr 2006 to determine the most appropriate strategy to recapitalize the aging fleet of aerial refueling aircraft. Based on this analysis, the Air Force concluded a strategy of full and open competition to select a commercial derivative replacement tanker aircraft would result in a best value tanker contract. To initiate the first phase of the tanker replacement, the KC-46 program released a final Request for Proposal (RFP) on 24 Feb 2010, and entered source selection on 9 Jul 2010. The KC-46 program held a Milestone B (MS B) Defense Acquisition Board (DAB) on 23 Feb 2011, received approval to enter Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) from the Undersecretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology and Logistics) (USD(AT&amp;L)) on 24 Feb 2011, and awarded the KC-46 EMD contract to Boeing on 24 Feb 2011 to develop and procure 179 KC-46 aircraft. The program is procuring four RDT&amp;E aircraft for integration and demonstration of capability which will ultimately be operationally fielded. During production, the program plans to procure 175 aircraft throughout 13 lots. Initial sustainment efforts will be provided via Interim Contractor Support (ICS). KC-46 funding also supports Training Systems, Support Equipment, Operational Site Activation, Depot Stand-Up, Alternate Mission Equipment, Direct Mission Support, Program Management Administration (PMA) activities, Other Government Costs (OGC), various studies and analyses, KC-Y/KC-Z planning activities, long lead items, and potential Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) and obsolescence planning activities.  

The KC-46 will provide the capability to fuel joint and coalition receivers via a boom or drogue system on every mission and will also augment the airlift fleet with cargo, passenger, and aeromedical evacuation capabilities. The KC-46 will operate in day/night and adverse weather conditions to enable deployment, employment, sustainment, and redeployment of U.S. joint, allied, and coalition forces. The KC-46 will have communication, navigation, and surveillance equipment for world-wide operations; the capability to perform missions in chemical and biological environments; the ability to operate in up to medium threat environments with self-defense/protection (both active and passive) capabilities; and the necessary battle space awareness to mitigate survivability threats. 

The Aircrew Training System (ATS) and Maintenance Training System (MTS) are being developed and procured using KC-46 funding. The ATS entered source selection on 31 May 2012, and a contract was awarded on 1 May 2013 to FlightSafety Services Corporation. The ATS contract will provide Aircrew Training Devices (ATDs), to include Weapon System Trainers (WSTs), Boom Operator Trainers (BOTs), Fuselage Trainers (FuTs), and Part-Task Trainers (PTTs) at each Main Operating Base (MOB) and the Formal Training Unit (FTU). The ATS contract will also support Distributed Mission Operations (DMO), provide aircrew instruction, develop courseware, provide logistics support, acquire a technical data package to support future competition efforts, and manage training device concurrency with the aircraft.  The ATS initial production options were exercised on 19 Aug 2015.  The Maintenance Training System (MTS) entered source selection on 8 Jun 2015, with an anticipated contract award date of the third quarter of FY2016, based upon ongoing source selection activities.  The MTS acquisition focuses on designing, developing, testing, producing, and fielding an optimized training system for KC-46 maintainers by integrating various forms of training media and Maintenance Training Devices (MTDs) into a "blended" solution.  This blended solution includes the appropriate mix of hardware and software, "high-fidelity" Augmented Hardware Training Devices (AHTDs), PTTs, Interactive Multimedia Instruction (IMI), and emerging technologies to meet validated Air Mobility Command (AMC) maintenance training requirements.  MTS production devices will commence in FY2017 as Firm Fixed Price (FFP) options to support ready for training dates.

The acquisition strategy requires sufficient aircraft to be designed, tested, and delivered to meet a Required Assets Available (RAA) date of 78 months after contract award. The acquisition strategy defines RAA as 18 aircraft meeting final product support baseline with all required training and support in place. Initial Operational Capability (IOC) will be attained when the Commander, AMC determines the unit is operationally ready for war. AMC has established an objective of IOC in FY2017 and Full Operational Capability (FOC) in FY2018.

The MS B Acquisition Strategy planned for two Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP) lots followed by 11 Full-Rate Production (FRP) lots for a total aircraft procurement of 175 Production aircraft.  An update to the Acquisition Strategy is in process to support Milestone C (MS C) plans for three LRIP lots and ten FRP lots with the total aircraft buy remaining at 175 Production aircraft.

Production will begin with two FFP and one Not to Exceed (NTE) LRIP options (LRIP-1 Qty 7, LRIP-2 Qty 12, &amp; LRIP-3 Qty 15) followed by 10 FRP options [via NTE values + Economic Price Adjustment (EPA)].

Note: Initial Spares are included in Exhibit P-5 because the KC-46 will initially employ ICS before transitioning to a 100% organically-managed maintenance capability. Initial Spares were procured with Aircraft Procurement, Air Force (APAF), Aircraft Weapon System funding in 2015 and transitioned to APAF, Aircraft Initial Spares and Repairs funding in 2016. Spare engines are included within the Initial Spares line. 

KC-46 is code B as it has not yet completed a FRP decision.  The KC-46 program successfully completed Critical Design Review (CDR) in Aug 2013, one month ahead of the contractual requirement. Live Fire Testing began in Apr 2011 and will continue through FY2016. Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&amp;E) is scheduled for the first quarter of FY2015 through the second quarter of FY2017 with plans to utilize LRIP aircraft. KC-46 First Flight occurred on 25 Sep 2015.  Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) is scheduled to begin in the third quarter of FY2017 with the use of LRIP aircraft and Tech Orders delivery is scheduled for the third quarter of FY2017.

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), the KC-46 is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities. 

Funding for this exhibit contained in PE 0401221F.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>The FY2017 budget supports the procurement of 15 KC-46 aircraft along with other necessary associated expenses to deliver, sustain, and maintain the Lot 3 aircraft buy to include Support Equipment, Operational Site Activation, Depot Stand-Up, ICS, Alternate Mission Equipment, and Direct Mission Support.  The KC-46 FY2017 funding will include ATS procurement of ATDs and compulsory elements required to support throughput levels as identified by AMC.  PMA activities for contractor services and OGC are included in the FY2017 funding.  The FY2017 funding will also support various studies and analyses, long lead items, and potential DMS and obsolescence planning activities.</proc:Justification>

                    <proc:Remarks>Initial Spares are included in Exhibit P-5 because the KC-46 will initially employ ICS before transitioning to a 100% organically-managed maintenance capability. Initial Spares will be procured with Aircraft Procurement, Air Force (APAF), Aircraft Weapons System funding in 2015 and transitioned to APAF, Aircraft Initial Spares and Repairs funding in 2016. Spare engines are included within the Initial Spares line. 

AMC's current operational strategy is for all KC-46 aircraft to be capable of utilizing Wing Aerial Refueling Pods (WARPs), but there is currently no requirement to procure an equal number of WARPs to aircraft. Instead, the WARPs will be used on select missions, as needed. The program will procure a total of 42 WARP kits.</proc:Remarks>

                    <proc:OverallHistoryPlanningRemarks>An update to the Acquisition Strategy is in process to support MS C plans for 3 LRIP lots which will allow the 2017 contract award for LRIP-3 to be accelerated to Jan 2017 since it will no longer be tied to an FRP decision.

Specs Available Now: These lots are pre-negotiated options to the KC-46 EMD contract based on the current aircraft system specification. The initial product baseline established at CDR will support the MS C decision and LRIP. Boeing is responsible for the correction of any deficiencies discovered in the KC-46 weapon system components (e.g. air vehicle, support equipment, training, etc.) during EMD to include the periods of integrated test (DT, OT, FAA, AR Cert) through IOT&amp;E or after collection of receiver certification data for nineteen (19) receiver aircraft pairings during Phase 3 AR Cert, whichever occurs later.  This product baseline will be finalized and validated at the Physical Configuration Audit.</proc:OverallHistoryPlanningRemarks>
                    <proc:OverallDeliveryScheduleRemarks>Minimum Sustaining Rate (MSR) for production is 12 aircraft/year. 

Economic Rate does not reflect 1 shift of 8 hours 5 days a week; aligns to Boeing's operating plan. 

Admin Lead Time to exercise pre-priced option is less than 1 month. 

Admin Lead Time to definitize Not to Exceed (NTE) production options is 18-24 months; definitization of NTE does not have to occur prior to option award.</proc:OverallDeliveryScheduleRemarks>

            <proc:Description>FY15 funding totals include $70M appropriated for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO).

The C-130J is a medium-size transport aircraft capable of performing a variety of combat delivery (tactical airlift) operations across a broad range of mission environments. The C-130J aircraft, with its extended (by 15 ft) fuselage, provides additional cargo carrying capacity for the USAF combat delivery mission compared with legacy C-130E/Hs and the C-130J (short). 

Other variants of the USAF C-130J fleet are all short-bodied aircraft and include the EC-130J (airborne psychological operations), WC-130J (weather reconnaissance), HC-130J (combat search and rescue), MC-130J (special operations), and the AC-130J (close air support and armed reconnaissance). These variants are addressed in their own budget documents. 

17 C-130Js have been procured with National Guard, Reserve Equipment Account (NGREA) funds and are not included in the "Prior Years" section of this document. 

Funding for this exhibit is contained in PE 0401132F which also contains associated Research Development Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) funding. 

Program funding includes Diminishing Manufacturing Sources.  

This funding request incorporates a Multiyear Procurement (MYP) for FY14 thru FY18. In support of the FY14 MYP, $92M of Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) funding was part of the FY14 request. 

Advance procurement items are limited to components whose long-lead times require early purchase in order to reduce the overall procurement lead-time of the major end item. These long lead items include structural components, engine mounts, engine components, flap shafts, and generators.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>The FY17 budget continues the five-year MYP and supports the production of two C-130J aircraft, logistics support for the USAF C-130J fleet, logistics support for aircrew and maintenance training devices, and program management support. FY17 budget also includes one OCO, combat loss replacement C-130J aircraft

The multiyear includes 72 USAF aircraft (29 C-130J, 25 MC-130J, 13 HC-130J, 5 AC-130J) and 6 United States Marine Corps KC-130J aircraft. The contract has an option for 5 United States Coast Guard HC-130J aircraft.</proc:Justification>

                        <proc:Description>HC-130 recapitalization will replace and augment the aging USAF fleets of combat rescue HC-130P/N aircraft which are experiencing airworthiness, maintainability and operational limitations. A common
baseline aircraft configuration is being provided for the HC-130 Recap, the MC-130 Recap and new AC-130 Recap programs.

Beginning with the FY11 President's Budget, the HC-130 Recap and MC-130 Recap programs are being reported separately for improved visibility. FY08-10 HC-130 Recap program details are reported as part
of the HC/MC Recap program.

Advance procurement items are limited to components whose long-lead times require purchase early in order to reduce the overall procurement lead-time of the major end item. These long lead items include structural components, engine mounts, engine components, flap shafts, and generators.

            <proc:Description>MC-130 recapitalization will replace and augment the aging USAF fleets of special operations MC-130E/H/P/W aircraft which are experiencing airworthiness, maintainability and operational limitations.  A common baseline aircraft configuration is being provided for the MC-130 Recap, the HC-130 Recap, and AC-130 Recap programs.   

Beginning with the FY11 President's Budget, the HC-130 Recap and MC-130 Recap programs are being reported separately for improved visibility.  Prior year MC-130 Recap program details are reported as part of the HC/MC Recap program.  Fifteen MC-130J were procured under the combined HC/MC-130 Recap program.

Program funding includes Diminishing Manufacturing Sources.

                        <proc:Description>MC-130 recapitalization will replace and augment the aging USAF fleets of special operations MC-130E/H/P/W aircraft which are experiencing airworthiness, maintainability and operational limitations. 

A common baseline aircraft configuration is being provided for the MC-130 Recap, the HC-130 Recap, and AC-130 Recap programs.  Beginning with the FY11 President's Budget, the HC-130 Recap and MC-130 Recap programs are being reported separately for improved visibility. Prior year MC-130 Recap program details are reported as part of the HC/MC Recap program. Fifteen MC-130J were procured under the combined HC/MC-130 Recap program.

Funding for this exhibit is contained in PE 0207230F.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>The UH-1N Replacement program will replace the Air Force fleet of 62 UH-1N aircraft, which have significant capability gaps in the areas of speed, range, endurance, payload capacity, and aircraft self-protection.  The Air Force intends to replace these UH-1Ns with modern helicopters that will eliminate these capability gaps.  The replacement aircraft will provide vertical airlift and support the requirements of five Air Force major commands and operating agencies: Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC), Air Force District of Washington, Air Education and Training Command, Pacific Air Forces, and Air Force Materiel Command. AFGSC is the Air Force lead command and operational capability requirements sponsor. This program is an element of the Air Force's nuclear enterprise reform initiatives.

In the FY2016 President's Budget, this program was funded in the Aircraft Procurement, Air Force, Modification of Inservice Aircraft appropriation (APPN 3010F, BA 05) based on an assumption the UH-1N Replacement solution was likely to involve the modification of in-service military helicopters.  Based on subsequent analysis of this assumption and other programmatic options, the Air Force determined that modification of in-service aircraft was a sub-optimal solution for this requirement.  The FY2017 President's Budget reflects the Air Force's intent to fund this program in the Aircraft Procurement, Air Force, Aircraft Procurement appropriation (APPN 3010F, BA 04) in the Budget Year and beyond.

This program has associated RDT&amp;E, AF funding in the Budget Year to provide for one-time systems engineering activities to integrate non-developmental military equipment into the UH-1N Replacement solution's existing technical and manufacturing baseline, and to revise the aircraft type and airworthiness certifications accordingly.  FY2017 RDT&amp;E, AF funding also provides for the initiation of live fire test and evaluation activities necessary to assess compliance with aircraft self-protection and survivability requirements.  The UH-1N Replacement solution is expected to undergo qualification and operational test and evaluation in FY2019-FY2020 to validate the aircraft's operational performance, effectiveness, and suitability.       

Funding for this exhibit contained in PE 0102110F.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>FY2015 funding ($15.0M) resulted from a Congressional add to protect the CV-22 fleet against undue risk from Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS). 

FY2016 funding ($64.5M) resulted from a Congressional add to fully fund one additional aircraft for attrition reserve.

The CV-22 is the US Air Force Special Operations Forces (SOF) variant of the joint multi-mission V-22 tilt-rotor aircraft.  The aircraft provides long-range infiltration, exfiltration, and re-supply of SOF in politically sensitive and hostile/denied areas.  The Navy is the lead service for the joint V-22 program and has overall responsibility for managing all V-22 variants, including the Air Force CV-22 variant.  Including the FY2016 Congressional add, the program will field a total of 51 CV-22 aircraft (2 Production Representative Test Vehicles funded with RDT&amp;E, 49 production aircraft, plus two replacement aircraft procured with FY2011 and FY2014 Overseas Contingency Operations supplemental funds).    

Funding for this exhibit contained in PE 0401318F.

Flyaway unit cost includes recurring and non-recurring flyaway costs.

Funding may be used to address Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues.</proc:Description>

Some aircraft components purchased with the FY2015 Congressional add ($15.0M) will be incorporated into the FY2016 added aircraft.</proc:Remarks>

            <proc:Description>The Civil Air Patrol (CAP) is a Congressionally chartered non-profit corporation that serves as the Auxiliary of the Air Force.  CAP uses federally provided resources to provide assistance requested by the DoD, federal, state or local government authorities and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to perform emergency or non-emergency public purpose missions and activities.                                                                                            

Pursuant to US Code (Title 10 &amp; 36) the purpose of CAP Corporation is to encourage and aid citizens of the US in contributing their efforts, services, and resources in developing aviation and in maintaining air supremacy; and to encourage and develop, by example, the voluntary contribution of private citizens to the public welfare.                                                                                               

CAP provides aviation education and training, as well as encourages and fosters civil aviation in local communities.  CAP also provides an organization to assist in meeting local emergencies and assists the Dept. of the Air Force in non-combat program/missions.                                                                                         

This program has no initial spares cost.  The weapon system cost, flyaway unit cost, and weapon system unit cost do not apply. 

Funding for this exhibit contained in PE 0901223F.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY17 funding of $2.661M supports a contract award for the procurement of 4 Cessna (four or six-seat) fixed-wing single engine aircraft equipped with satellite digital imaging systems, automatic direction finder, emergency locator transmitter, FM radio, camera port window, ground power unit, and appropriate training material.                                                                                                                                                                                                     Aircraft type quantities procured during execution are a continuing requirement but may change based on critical equipment needed to support current mission requirements, market availability, and budget changes due to mark-ups, fall-out funds availability, or cost fluctuations.  

Congress generally approves mark ups for the procurement of additional aircraft.                                                                                              

CAP is a grant recipient; as such, AF central procurement processes are not applicable.

            <proc:Description>Full-scale and subscale Aerial Targets assure warfighters weapon systems will perform effectively against real-world enemy fighters and cruise missiles. Aerial Targets provide adherence to Public Law Title 10, Section 2366 "Live Fire/Lethality" developmental/operational test requirements. Target drones are used to validate operational missile/weapon system effectiveness and fighter Operational Flight Program (OFP) updates. Target drones are essential for development testing/operational testing for all air-to-air (e.g., AMRAAM, AIM-9x, etc.) and surface-to-air missiles (e.g.PAC 3, FIM 92 Stinger), and for the F-22A, F-35, F-18, F-16, and F-15 aircraft. The objective is to provide realistic targets for missile testing to enable the development of offensive counter-air systems (air-to-air and surface-to-air) capable of defeating changing enemy airborne threats. This program provides funds for the procurement of subscale aerial targets (BQM-167A Air Force Subscale Aerial Target-AFSAT), full-scale aerial targets (QF-16), Target Control System (TCS), and includes procurement of associated mission and support equipment. Funding supports associated systems such as target control and scoring systems essential to aerial target operations. The TCS program ensures software interoperability among service ranges, the encryption of range/aircraft data links, and associated communication devices. Aerial targets and associated systems are required for Congressionally mandated testing and Air Force developmental and operational testing. Funding also provides for capabilities to meet current and future threats identified by OSD. Program funding may also be used to address Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues.

            <proc:Description>The RQ-4 Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) provides high altitude, deep look, long-endurance intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance (ISR), and Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI) capability that complements space and other airborne collectors during peacetime, crisis, and war-fighting scenarios. In two related Acquisition Decision Memorandums (ADM) signed by USD (AT&amp;L) in January and June 2011, the RQ-4 program was directed to restructure into four major sub-programs: (1) RQ-4 baseline, (2) Block 30, (3) Block 40, and (4) Ground Segment/Communications System. Additionally, the Air Force created a RQ-4 Preplanned Product Improvement (P3I) for the Airborne Sense and Avoid line item (name has been changed to RQ-4 Common Airborne Sense &amp; Avoid (C-ABSAA)) to accommodate inclusion of required capability to meet warfighter needs beyond those requirements satisfied in the directed sub-programs. 

The RQ-4B is the successor to the RQ-4A, and is designed to employ 3,000 pounds of payload and enable multi-intelligence (multi-INT) collecting. The RQ-4B has three configurations: Block 20, Block 30, and Block 40. The Block 20 employs upgraded Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR) sensors - Enhanced Integrated Sensor Suite (EISS) - in an imagery intelligence only configuration. One SAR capable Block 20 remains in the fleet. Additionally, 4 Block 20's have been converted to Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN) of which 3 remain active. These aircraft are not SAR capable. The remaining Block 20 aircraft support test projects for all RQ-4 Blocks. The Block 30 employs the same EISS sensors as the Block 20, and integrates a wide spectrum signals intelligence (SIGINT) sensor, the Airborne Signals Intelligence Payload (ASIP). EISS and ASIP are used simultaneously to create a multi-INT platform. The Block 40 integrates the Multi-Platform Radar Technology Insertion Program (MP-RTIP) radar that has GMTI capability. The ground segment includes the Mission Control Element (MCE) and the Launch Recovery Element (LRE). The support segment includes aerospace ground equipment, tech orders, spares, support equipment, and training to enable operation of the RQ-4 System. The RQ-4 program will incorporate applicable synergies with other platforms, including the U.S. Navy's Triton, and other RPA weapon systems. 

To protect production schedules from Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) and material shortages issues, the program will perform schedule protection buys when appropriate. Funding may be used to alleviate DMS issues for which there are not sufficient Government spares and/or the ability to repair organically or commercially is not viable.

Remaining efforts for RQ-4 procurement include support to complete delivery of the RQ-4s on contract and incorporation of any modifications required to bring the aircraft up to current operational configuration, support equipment, change requests, production line disposition, acceptance testing, logistics and program management support and related tasks to support the entire RQ-4 fleet, as well as technology insertion activities in support of Better Buying Power initiatives.
The flyaway unit cost is not included on the P-40 exhibit because there are multiple P-5 Cost Analysis exhibits. Funding for this exhibit contained in PE 0305220F. This program has associated Research Development Test and Evaluation funding in PE 0305220F.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY17 procurement funding required for procurement activities to include logistics support, change requests, production acceptance testing, program management support, production line disposition, support equipment, other related tasks, and support to complete delivery of the RQ-4s on contract. Funding may also be used to alleviate Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues for which there are not sufficient Government spares and/or the ability to repair organically or commercially is not viable.

Production disposition will be captured in P-1 RQ4DIS RQ-4 Post Production Charges following the final deliveries of Lot 11 production.

NOTE:  FY16 funding procures one Ground Segment.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>FY16 funding totals include $13.5M appropriated for Overseas Contingency Operations.
FY17 OCO request includes $87M for Initial Spares.

MQ-9 Reaper procurement includes all components of the MQ-9 weapon system. The basic MQ-9 Reaper system consists of the aircraft, sensors, a Ground Control Station (GCS), communications equipment, weapon kits, support equipment, simulator and training devices, Readiness Spares Packages (RSP), technical data/training, and personnel required to operate, maintain, and sustain the system. The system is designed to be modular and open-ended. Mission-specific equipment is employed in a plug-and-play mission kit concept allowing specific aircraft and control station configurations to be tailored to fit mission needs. Due to the nature of the platform, all future production requirements may vary based on warfighter necessity and available funding. 

The MQ-9 Reaper aircraft is a single-engine, turbo-prop Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) designed to operate over-the-horizon at medium-to-high altitude for long endurance sorties. The aircraft is being designed primarily to prosecute critical emerging Time-Sensitive-Targets (TST) as a radar, Electro-Optical/Infra-Red (EO/IR), and laser designator-based attack asset with on-board hard-kill capability (hunter-killer) while performing Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Target Acquisition (ISR TA). In the hunter-killer role, the aircraft will employ fused multi-spectral sensor information to find, fix, and track ground targets and assess post-strike results using Automatic Target Cuing (ATC), Target Location Accuracy (TLA), Metric Sensor and other capabilities. 

The GCS functions as the aircraft cockpit and can control the aircraft from either within Line-of-Sight (LOS) or Beyond Line-of-Sight (BLOS) via a combination of satellite relay and terrestrial communication architectures. The GCS is either mobile to support forward operating locations or fixed at a facility to support Remote Split Operations (RSO). The GCS has the capability to perform mission planning functions; provides a means for manual and/or autonomous command and control; allows personnel to launch, recover, and monitor aircraft, payloads, and system communications status; secure data links to receive payload sensor data and command links; monitor threats to the aircraft; display common operational picture information; and provide support functions. Additionally, a Launch and Recovery GCS (LRGCS) allows for servicing, systems checks, maintaining, launching, and recovering aircraft under LOS control for hand-off to a mobile or fixed GCS. The GCS will continue to evolve and upgrade its capabilities to keep pace with MQ-9 system capabilities, Concept of Operations (CONOPS), and the missions they perform. Near-term upgrades include new LINUX processors, high definition monitors, and ergonomic improvements. Future planned upgrades include integrating improved human-machine interfaces, open systems architecture, improved crew habitability, and multiple aircraft control. Future GCS configurations will leverage the Unmanned Aerospace System (UAS) Command and Control (C2) Initiative (UCI) government-owned open system standard to enable improved capabilities for situational awareness and multi-mission management monitoring and oversight. 

Flyaway cost subtotal includes GCS, Ground Data Terminals (GDTs), and Predator Primary Satellite Links (PPSLs) which are not procured in the same quantities as aircraft. Thus, the unit flyaway cost will fluctuate from year to year as different quantities of GCSs, GDTs, and PPSLs are procured. 

MQ-9s are procured sole-source with General Atomics-Aeronautical Systems Incorporated (GA-ASI). GA-ASI is responsible for the aircraft and GCS, The Raytheon Company for the MTS-B EO/IR sensor, and L3 Communications for the Operator Simulator and satellite communication (SATCOM) infrastructure components. 

This program has associated Research Development Test and Evaluation AF funding in PE 0205219F MQ-9 Reaper UAV.

The FY 2017 funding request was reduced by $19.2 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.  

Funding for this exhibit contained in PE 0205219F. 

MQ-9 is Code B because, although the majority of projected procurement is complete, it has not yet completed an In-Process Review (IPR) in lieu of a Full Rate Production (FRP) decision. IOT&amp;E for the Block 1 aircraft system was completed in March 2009. FOT&amp;E for the Block 5 aircraft system is currently scheduled for completion no later than September 2016 which will be followed by an IPR. A formal FRP will not be completed due to the de facto production decision provided by continued funding beyond Low Rate Initial Production.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>A.  Aircraft Production - FY17 "Other Contingency Operations" funding procures 12 aircraft to replace combat losses and 12 aircraft to support the stand-up of 10 Government Owned, Contractor Operated Combat Air Patrols (CAPs).

B.  Production Support - FY17 funding included in Production Support consists of Engineering Change Orders (ECO) urgent services, and non-recurring production costs associated with diminishing manufacturing sources, reliability and maintenance (R&amp;M) safety enhancements, and higher level initiatives directed by the Air Force.

C.  Fixed Ground Control Station &amp; GFE - FY17 funding will procure 26 fixed Ground Control Stations used for MQ-9 operations to support the standup, fielding, and sustainment of 60 Combat Air Patrols (CAPs). This effort procures fixed Ground Control Stations (GCS). The GCS functions as the aircraft cockpit and can control the aircraft from either within line-of-sight (LOS) or beyond LOS (BLOS)
via a combination of satellite relay and terrestrial communication architectures. Fixed GCS are used primarily to support Remote Split Operations (RSO) from Continental United States locations. There is an analysis ongoing to determine if Mobile Ground Control Stations, Fixed Ground Control Stations  or some combination needs to be procured in FY17 to support warfighter needs.

D.  Other Government Costs (OGC) - FY17 funding for OGCs includes direct mission support and Program Management Administration (PMA).  PMA includes program office costs such as Management Information System (MIS) support, travel, training, security, and facility management.  In addition, costs for Advisory and Assistance Services (A&amp;AS) for program management, logistics, integration and test, and administration support services are included. 

E.  Training Device/Simulator - FY17 funding will procure Brief/Debrief Stations and local area network (LAN) cabinets to support aircrew training.  Predator Mission Aircrew Training Simulators (PMATS) quantities are various configurations of Instructor Operator Stations (IOS) with mission coordination capabilities, Brief/Debrief Stations and LAN cabinets to support aircrew training.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>FY 2015 funding totals include $45.410M appropriated for Overseas Contingency Operations.

Program Description:  Aircraft Initial Spares are required to fill the initial pipeline or inventory for all new aircraft systems, including modifications, support equipment, and other production categories.  Initial spares include peculiar repairable and consumable components, assemblies, and sub-assemblies that must be available for issue at all levels of supply in time to support newly fielded end items.

The following Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAP) have funding in this line:
F-35,198 
FAB-T, 199
V-22, 212
B-2 EHF Inc I, 224
AWACS UPGRADE, 277
C-5 RERP, 327
KC-46A, 387
MQ-9 UAS Reaper, 424
F-22 Inc 3.2B Mod, 474
F-15 EPAWSS, 485
RQ-4A/B Global Hawk, 252

Initial spares are funded in the two program segments described below.

Working Capital Fund (WCF) Spares.  Since FY 1994, some programs have used obligation authority in the WCF to procure initial spares.  When the spares are delivered this central procurement account will reimburse the WCF.  Types of spares in this program segment are Readiness Spares Packages, New Acquisition Spares, Modification Spares, Support Equipment, Other Production, and Consumables.

Exempt Spares.  This program segment finances spares that are not purchased through the WCF.  The budget authority is a direct cite on the contract.  Types of spares in this program segment are Whole Spare Engines, Whole Spare Quick Engine Change Kits, Contractor Logistics Support, Simulators/Trainers, New Acquisition Spares, Modification Spares, Support Equipment, Classified Equipment, and Munitions.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>In FY 2017, the funding request for F-35 and KC-46A Tanker Squadrons increased significantly in preparation for fielding.  MQ-9 continues to have large initial spare requirements.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>This program provides funding for the procurement of replacement organizational and intermediate level support equipment for out-of-production aircraft. These items, common (used on more than one weapon system) and peculiar (unique to one weapon system), directly support aircraft maintenance and servicing requirements. These replacement requirements ensure continuation of serviceable, supportable equipment over the life of a weapon system. Items requiring replacement typically range in age from 10 to 35 years old. As a result, this equipment suffers frequent failures, is uneconomical to repair, and requires spare parts that are no longer available. Many items have become technologically obsolete or must be replaced due to environmental operating constraints. Items of equipment budgeted within this program include: avionics test stations, air conditioners, munitions handling equipment, electronic test sets, maintenance platforms, and automatic test systems. These items support multiple Air Force weapon systems. Failure to procure these items will negatively affect mission capable rates, increase maintenance costs, and increase sortie turn times. 

SUPPORT EQUIPMENT AND AUTOMATIC TEST SYSTEMS 
Items Less Than $5M 
The Items Less Than $5 Million line procures replacement organizational and intermediate (common and peculiar) support equipment for out-of-production aircraft. Common items (used on more than one weapon system) and peculiar items (unique to one weapon system) directly support aircraft maintenance and servicing requirements. These replacement items ensure continuation of serviceable equipment over the life of a weapon system, and consist of over 2,800 national stock numbered (NSN) items as well as numerous items which are non-stock listed (NSL). Items for procurement include, but are not limited to, ammunition loaders, test adapter kits, Common Aircraft Portable Reprogramming Equipment (CAPRE), transponder test sets, Common Munitions Built-in Test Reprogramming Equipment (CMBRE), Common Organizational Level Tester (COLT), Bomber Armament Tester (BAT), universal maintenance stands, 250kW motor generators, universal hydraulic test stands, munitions trailers, etc. These programs require Program Management Administration (PMA) for TDY and other government costs associated with program/contract required activities.

SUPPORT EQUIPMENT PROGRAMS 
Large Air Conditioner 
The Large Flight-Line Air Conditioner replacement program will procure a trailer-mounted, diesel powered, deployable air conditioner. Its purpose is to provide conditioned air for supporting pre-flight activities and ground maintenance efforts for heavy electronics laden weapon systems including, but not limited to: B-1B, C-32, E-3, E-8C, and RC-135. The Large Flight-Line Air Conditioner program will replace three legacy systems: ACE-802, PD-501 (in certain applications) and DAC-110. These legacy systems represent the majority of the Air Force inventory of large flight line air conditioners (400ea). Operational assessments determined that legacy air conditioners were not performing to their specified operating temperatures. These air conditioners are approaching the eighteenth year of a twenty year life expectancy. The age of this equipment, high temperatures, and other environmental conditions in the Middle East have caused legacy air conditioners to fail, affecting operational readiness and jeopardizing critical missions. Modifications to legacy equipment have been implemented; however, these modifications introduced water into the system that caused premature corrosion resulting in unit failures. Lack of dependable air conditioning equipment continues to cause operational impacts such as rescheduling maintenance activities to nighttime operations or delaying sorties in order to avoid overheating of critical electronic warfare/avionics systems and personnel. Consequently, the warfighter has established a critical need for a Large Flight-Line Air Conditioner replacement program. The Air Force needs to replace poor performing and obsolete flight line air conditioners supplying conditioned air for aircraft flying in and out of the Area of Responsibility supporting Operation Enduring Freedom as well as other current/future warm climate operations around the world.

Aircraft Replacement Support Equipment Mods 
The munitions handling units (MHU) MHU-196/M and MHU-204/M are nuclear certified, self-powered, heavy duty, U-type frame trailers with a 40,000 pound lift capacity. The MHUs are used for transporting conventional and nuclear munitions, rotary launchers, pylons, and adapters for loading/unloading them on B-1, B-2 and B-52 aircraft, necessary to accomplish the Air Force's strategic mission. The service life extension program (SLEP) will correct discrepancies identified in the April 2009 Air Force Comprehensive Assessment of Nuclear Sustainment (AFCANS) II report and the April 2013 Defense Science Board Air Force Nuclear Enterprise Follow-on Review and is critical to sustaining the Air Force's nuclear deterrence posture and the readiness of our bomber forces. The SLEP will extend the service life by assessing the structural integrity, replacing the legacy control and power system with COTS Compact RIO programmable automation controllers. Funding may be used to address diminishing manufacturing sources (DMS) issues and alleviate parts obsolescence. The MHUs have met and exceeded the original service life of 20 years, and this effort is to provide an additional 20 years of service. The users consist of AFGSC, ACC, AETC, and AFMC. These trailers are field level repaired units. 

AUTOMATIC TEST SYSTEMS PROGRAMS 
USM670 Core Test Set (CTS) 
The Joint Service Electronic Combat Systems Tester (JSECST) provides an organizational level (O-level) flight line capability for verifying the operational status of aircraft installed
Electronic Combat (EC) systems including their associated installed antennas, transmission lines, radomes, cockpit displays, controls and EC suite communication buses. It also provides EC system malfunction diagnostics. The JSECST provides end-to-end (ETE) functional testing to determine the status of EC system installed in or on operational aircraft. It automatically determines the go/no-go status of the EC system with minimal technician interaction. In cases where the EC system has a critical fault, the JSECST detects the critical failure, identifies the ETE test that failed, and provides the diagnostics to isolate the failed aircraft transmission line path/component or line replaceable unit (LRU). The JSECST can be operated in automatic or manual mode to provide identification and isolation of failed EC systems. This equipment support Air Force weapon
systems A-10, F-15, and F-16 aircraft. Failure to procure this item would compromise the safety of more than 53 units supporting A-10s, F-15s, and F-16s. The JSECST is a defensive system tester, equipping the warfighter with safe and fully functional electronic combat systems.

Versatile Depot Automatic Test Station (VDATS) 
Versatile Depot Automatic Test Station (VDATS) is a tester that is used for maintenance and testing of advanced avionics components that supports multiple aircraft platforms and systems. Initially, VDATS was developed to reduce Automatic Test Systems (ATS) proliferation by standardizing depot avionics test stations. VDATS has been named the first Air Force Family of testers. As a family of testers which standardized ATS support within the Air Force, VDATS now supports intermediate level ATS requirements. VDATS has flexible hardware and software architectures that are fully expandable and tailorable. VDATS provides workload transportability and increased sustainability through common commercial components with latest technologies and open architecture design. The system has a Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) System of Automatic Test Equipment (ATE), with architecture and Virtual Modular Equipment (VME) Extensions for Instrumentation (VXI) technology. Using standardized commercial components on VDATS reduces the number of diverse components which eases sustainability and obsolescence management allowing production units to run on any VDATS of the same configuration utilizing interface test adapters and test program sets.  The equipment within the VDATS family of tester is the Digital Analog, Radio Frequency and Calibration Equipment. VDATS Digital Analog (DA-1) is the standard configuration. It includes the Cross Point Matrix (CPM) which provides a true hybrid test capability to the Test Program Set (TPS) developer and provides the switching technology required to connect any digital pin on VDATS to the appropriate analog instrumentation without additional ITA complexity.  VDATS Digital Analog (DA-2) is the standard DA-1 configuration with additional Hybrid/Digital pins. VDATS Radio Frequency (RF-1) is used to test systems with RF requirements and will work with either DA configuration. The RF-1 is not stand-alone. VDATS Tech Refresh will support updates to the VDATS System Integration Laboratory (SIL) requirements. This effort will consist of future instruments updates, Interface Test Adapters (ITAs), testing, technical data, and overall station software support. Station software includes all applications necessary for complete station operations with all associated drivers and ADE. As additional unit under test (UUT) requirements are identified, the SIL will provide a means to verify suggested instrument modifications to the VDATS configurations. Instrument requirements over and above the current VDATS configuration will be tested and approved to ensure commonality among customers. This would include, but not be limited to, the current digital and radio-frequency (RF) test capability and any future capability enhancements deemed necessary to support future test requirements, as well as, any other sub-system or instrumentation that will contribute to the continuous overall functionality of the VDATS as a family of testers. VDATS Calibration Equipment consists of the standard Portable Automatic Test Equipment Calibrator with unique augmentation and self-test. 
The VDATS requirements are to support system repairs, testing and development of test program sets (TPS). Modern combat missions rely on rapid repair of the Unit Under Test (UUT). Without VDATS, testing and repair of system assets will be hampered. Therefore, aircraft mission capabilities rates are degraded, rapid response to combat mission is impeded and risk of mission failure and possible loss of aircraft substantially increases.

Portable Automated Test Station (PATS) 
The Portable Automated Test Station (PATS) provides the user capability to trouble shoot the Avionics System, Weapons bus, and Armament system on the A-10A/C aircraft. It also provides capabilities to load Operational Flight Programs to the various Avionics components on the A-10-A/C aircraft. All A-10 aircraft are being upgraded to A-10C configuration. The PATS model -30 (P/N 04852-0100-30) is facing obsolescence challenges and becoming quickly unsupportable. The PATS model -70 (P/N 04852-0100-70) increases capability, reduces equipment down time, and enhances maintainer trouble shooting capability on the aircraft, ensuring that A-10 mission capability is maintained.
Increasing maintenance costs and downtime due to obsolescence have made the PATS model -30 uneconomical and practically impossible to support. The original vendor for the main parts no longer produces these parts. As the PATS model -30 becomes less supportable than it already is, it will be unable to accommodate the required testing of the various A-10 systems. Consequences include increased Mission Capability hours, higher Re-Test OK (RTOK) rates, reduced aircraft availability, greater repair costs and fewer assets in the pipeline. The PATS model -70 provides improved diagnostic capabilities resulting in less erroneous pulls of avionics components on the A-10 and overcomes our obsolescence issues. The PATS model -70 reduces the amount of time required to trouble shoot the A-10 Avionics significantly with more accuracy. The PATS model -70 significantly reduces supportability requirements while increasing maintenance capabilities, ensuring the sustainment and mission capability of the A-10 aircraft.

Versamodule Extensions for Instrumentation Improved Avionics Intermediate Shop (VXI-IAIS) 
The Versamodule Extensions for Instrumentation Improved Avionics Intermediate Shop (VXI-IAIS) is a mobile test station which provides performance and diagnostic testing of F-16 avionics Line Replaceable Units (LRUs). The VXI-IAIS test station is self-contained in two-man portable cases, greatly improving mobility for deployment purposes. Its predecessor, the IAIS, is used throughout the United States Air Force. The VXI-IAIS enhances and greatly improves the test capability previously maintained by the IAIS through the implementation of versatile modern technology in a modular, standards-based Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) instruments design. The VXI-IAIS test station consists of an upgraded Control and Display Unit (CDU) with the incorporation of Serial Attached Small Computer Serial Interface (SAS SCSI) bus architecture and associated media storage devices, along with new VXI Instrument Unit A (IUA), Instrument Unit B (IUB), and Radio Frequency Microwave Unit (MU) measurement upgrades. The F-16 Improved Avionics Intermediate Shop (IAIS) test station was fielded in 1994 with production ending in 2002. Its shelf life was specified to be 15 years. Test stations are now 13 to 21 years old. Disk drives are obsolete and unsupportable. Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS) pose a significant risk as available repair and/or replacement parts continue to decrease. 66% of IAIS Tester Replaceable Units (TRUs) and Shop Replaceable Units (SRUs) contain known obsolete parts. DMSMS issues have resulted in failed test stations which have become unavailable for extended periods of time. Consequences include increased Mission Capability (MICAP) hours resulting in reduced aircraft capability, greater repair costs, and fewer assets in the pipeline. IAIS sustainment costs are projected to be $237M through 2030. The VXI-IAIS implements versatile modern technology in a modular, standards-based COTS instruments design that facilitates future supportability. VXI-IAIS procurement and sustainment is projected to require $112M through 2030 with investment cost payback in 5 years, resulting in a cost savings of $125M to the United States Air Force.

C-17 Strategic Airlift Squadrons (AFR-EQ)
Funding required in FY17 to procure support equipment at Pittsburgh IAP ARS for 8 C-17 aircraft transferring from Air Force Active-Duty Backup Aircraft Inventory (BAI) to the Air Force Reserve as Primary Aircraft Authorization (PAA  This FY17 action is a part of the Air Force's Rapid Global
Mobility (RGM) Force Mix Option (FMO) Delta (or RGM FMO-D) that mitigates the retirement of C-130H aircraft at Pittsburgh IAP ARS with transferred C-17 aircraft.


Advanced Radar/Electronic Warfare Test Station (ARTS) 
The Advanced Radar/Electronic Warfare Test Station (ARTS) replaces 1970s vintage Radar/Electronic Warfare (REW) test stations and the Defensive Avionics Augmentation Equipment (DAAE). ARTS is a fully automated, programmable, stimulus generating, response measuring, intermediate automatic test equipment that will checkout, align, and fault isolates 21 avionics Line Replaceable Units (LRUs). ARTS interfaces to the LRU's via Test Program Sets (TPS). TPS's are required to perform the automated testing and faults isolation of the Unit Under Test (UUT). A TPS consists of test software, an Interface Adapter (ITA), cables used to connect the ITA to UU, and supporting documentation.  This test station supports B-1 Radar/Electronic Warfare LRUs, and ultimately impacts B-1 mission capability for Global Attack missions. Failure to provide funding for ARTS will reduce B-1 mission capability due to non-availability of serviceable assets. The Automatic Test Equipment (ATE) presently supporting B-1 LRU troubleshooting and repair is no longer supportable due to diminished manufacturing sources and obsolescence caused by the age of the equipment. The average REW and DAAE mission capable rate is 67%.

Stores System Tester
The Stores System Tester (F-16 SST)replaces the Stores Release Equipment tester and directly impacts the Air Force's ability to safely load, carry, and launch weapons on combat aircraft. The current tester accomplishes intermediate level testing of combat Alternate Mission Equipment (AME), which includes aircraft launchers, pylons, bomb racks, gun pods, and associated relays/adapters. The tester performs AME functional and fault isolation tests. F-16 legacy tester shortages are creating severe limitations on mission accomplishment. Procurement of existing testers is not an option due to Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS). Procurement of the SSTI fills the existing tester shortages and precludes further DMS complications. The current test set is uneconomical to maintain due to obsolete and outdated parts. Older test sets are failing at higher rates, are becoming increasingly more difficult to repair,and are no longer reliable in determining the cause of AME failures. If a replacement tester is not made available, essential AME maintenance will lag, impacting timely weapons loading on the aircraft; thus reducing combat mission and aircraft capability.


F-15 Secondary Power Source Test Set(SPSTS)
The F-15 SPSTS provides organizational level fault isolation testing of the F-15 C/D/E model landing gear, secondary power, and engine starting system. The F-15 SPSTS will reduce retraction cycles from three to one. It will allow test procedures to become automated and decreases the maintenance time up to 50 percent. The SPSTS will replace a legacy test system that is obsolete and no longer supportable.  In 2010, WR-ALC issued an engineering services contract to develop a USAF Prototype of the DCS SPSTS. The USAF prototype SPSTS, P/N A05G0717-1 was developed with modification to support the USAF F-15C/D/E aircraft with the -7 Generator Control Unit (GCU) wiring, unique F 15C/D aircraft landing gear control system test connector, and fault isolation differences unique to the USAF F-15C/D/E aircraft configurations. SERD, Nomenclature, NSN, provisioning data, and manuscript technical publication and IETMs updates were developed and delivered along with the USAF prototype SPSTS that would pave the way for a future follow-on production contract. Nomenclature and National Stock number were assigned for the design solution unit which is identified as A/E-24T-258 Secondary Power System Test Set, P/N A05G0717-1, NSN 4920-01-581-2240. The design solution prototype contract and associated deliveries were completed in April 2011. Boeing responded to a follow-on production WR-ALC Secondary Power System Test Set ROM estimate request dated 31 March 2011. This request included several enhancements to the design solution SPSTS. Enhancements included developing updates to support the -8 GCU (which was still in flight test), adding 115VAC 60 Hz operating power support, and software download support using an EIA STD 578/RS 232 interface which is the same interface as used on the A/E24T-250 Flight Control System Test Set (FCSTS). These enhancements will most likely be incorporated into a modified version of P/N A05G0717-1, NSN 4920-01-581-2240 when the new contract is awarded in FY17. The USAF is currently awaiting a new ROM for cost to include these enhancements.  Without funding, there will be reduced testing capacity and increased maintenance cost associated with extended cycle time man-hours for F-15 C/D/E models. The central gear box and jet fuel starter have been the top MICAP drivers for the F-15. There is currently no tester available that can test the modified secondary power system post TCT) 850 - Installation of Upgraded JFS/GCU Write Group A into F-15 C/D aircraft (Prerequisite TCTO 1551). There are 18 critical backorders at this time and a total of 43.

The ATS described in this document were evaluated/approved by the ICLM executive agent for the Automatic Test Systems (ATS) and are in line with the USAF ATS objective. The ATS program office if focused on reducing weapon system unique ATS through replacement with a Common Versatile ATS testers that can perform similar testing across multiple weapon system platforms. The ATS Program Management Office ensures collaborative requirements planning on new ATS fielding to reduce proliferation of new weapon system unique ATS.

The ATS portfolio consists of 7,775 individually configured pieces of test equipment. The ATS division is responsible for the modernization, sustainment and recapitalization of this equipment.  Included in this portfolio are 6 nuclear certified testers. They are  B-2 &amp; B-52 Electronic Systems Test Set (ESTS), B-2 Common Organizational Level Tester (COLT), B-52 Multi-Use Systems Tester Armament Next Generation (MUSTANG), F-15 Armament Testers (T-198 &amp; T-199), F-16 Aircraft Circuits Preload Test Set (ACPTS), and F-16 Stores System Tester (SST). 

Requirement for cyber security:  Increased emphasis and new direction regarding cyber security of off-network information systems (platform information technology, PIT) is driving the requirement to perform certification and accreditation (C&amp;A) of new and legacy Automatic Test Systems (ATS) in order to obtain an authority-to-operate (ATO) for the system.  The new requirement to perform C&amp;A on PIT involves an analysis of system architecture and a subsequent risk-based assessment of vulnerabilities.  A mitigation plan for identified vulnerabilities is developed resulting in a Plan of Action and Milestones (POAM) for the system.  This is an engineering intensive activity.

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.

                    <proc:Description>The modification via service life extension program (SLEP) will extend the service life by assessing the structural integrity and replacing the legacy control and power system with commercial programmable automation controllers. Program also alleviates obsolescent parts and diminishing manufacturing sources. The munitions lift trailers have met and exceeded the original service life of 20 years, and this effort is to provide an additional 20 years of service. The legacy munitions handling units (MHU) MHU-196/M and MHU-204/M will be replaced by the modified MHU-196A/M and MHU-204A/M units. The legacy MHUs are unsustainable due to parts obsolescence and are experiencing uncommanded responses due to antiquated electronic and hydraulic systems as identified in the requirements documents (AF IMT 1067, Modification Proposals, ACC 09-175 and ACC 09-176). The total objective is to modify 146 MHU-196/M and MHU-204/M MLTs at an estimated cost of $2M each or total cost of $292M. To meet MAJCOM operational needs, the depot is expanding their facility production, investing in additional space, support equipment and manpower. To support modification effort, PMA funding may be used for A&amp;AS support, tech data validation/verification and program travel requirements. Assets are used in support of nuclear and conventional operations.

Milestone/Development Status

Studies have been accomplished providing necessary technical data to extend the service life of the fleet to meet mission needs. These studies addressed obsolescence and component level repair and sustainment issues.

The program has accomplished maintainer/operator evaluation of the prototype trailer and is executing changes as a result of user feedback. Additionally , the depot started disassembly of a legacy trailer, allowing them to create the production control documents and processes required to produce the final SLEP trailers.</proc:Description>

                    <proc:Remarks>The Versatile Depot Automatic Test Station (VDATS) Test Program Set (TPS) Software Rehost requirement supports current weapon system test requirements being migrated to VDATS.  VDATS provides a means to ensure operational availability.  Rehost of legacy test program software to VDATS reduces the large variety of unique software languages, as well as the huge quantity of unique legacy automatic test systems currently maintained within the Air Force inventory.  As a result reduces the AF ATS footprint, and reduces the ATS total ownership costs.

The PMA account was established to fund requirements associated with the day-to-day operations and sustainment of the VDATS Program office.  Defined requirements that fit within the scope of this account are program travel, as well as miscellaneous material purchases associated with the program management operations of the VDATS program office are supported from the PMA account.</proc:Remarks>

            <proc:Description>Interim Contractor Support (ICS) provides maintenance and repair capability for depot-level repairs to meet Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC) operational requirements for the B-2 weapon system. The ICS program is an on-condition and limited overhaul repair capability repairing Line Replaceable Units (LRUs) and Shop Replaceable Units (SRUs) associated with legacy airframe structures, hydro-mechanical components and avionics components until permanent depot repair capability is established. ICS also provides travel support and interim repair to new or modified components stemming from B-2 aircraft modification programs until a permanent source of repair has been achieved either organically or through Contractor Depot Maintenance (CDM).

This B00200 Post Production line is an FY17 new start.

The amounts include ICS efforts for CVR Inc 1 and weapons modifications (Flexible Strike Phase 1). CVR Increment 1 will enter OT&amp;E 4Q FY16 and Flexible Strike will enter IOT&amp;E 2Q FY17.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>ICS will continue to provide interim maintenance and repair capability to B-2 LRUs/SRUs as well as new aircraft modification components until either an organic repair capability or contractor repair capability is established.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>Interim Contractor Support (ICS) provides maintenance, and repair capability for depot-level repairs to meet Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC) operational requirements for the B-2 weapon system. The ICS program is an on-condition and limited overhaul repair capability repairing Line Replaceable Units (LRUs) and Shop Replaceable Units (SRUs) associated with legacy airframe structures, hydro-mechanical components, and avionics components until permanent depot repair capability is established. ICS also provides travel support and interim repair to new or modified components stemming from B-2 aircraft modification programs until a permanent source of repair has been achieved either organically or through Contractor Depot Maintenance (CDM).

Post Production Support funds are used to acquire, replace, upgrade, integrate, and test  B-2 peculiar support equipment (PSE), Special Test Equipment (STE) and their sub-components, for the Weapon System Support Center (WSSC) Ground Test Facility (GTF), Program Depot Maintenance, Test Range, and AFGSC operational support facilities.  The B-2 WSSC GTF is a one-of-a-kind facility that develops, maintains, sustains, integrates, tests, and certifies the B-2 Spirit software.  The B-2 WSSC GTF combines flight controls, radar, weapons, navigation, traffic control, communications, displays, flight management, external interfaces, and defensive management functionality in a test environment to conduct component, subsystem, and end-to-end software tests before deployment to the test aircraft and/or the operational fleet.  This funding also supports replacement, upgrade, travel requirements, and integration of other peculiar support equipment such as, but not limited to, the VIPER Memory Load Verifier, Portable Compressed Air Heating System, Laboratory Assets, Program Depot Maintenance sustainment equipment, and Test Range special test equipment and support systems.

The FY2017 funding request was reduced by $8.809 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.”</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>ICS will continue to provide interim maintenance and repair capability to legacy B-2 LRUs/SRUs as well as new aircraft modification components until either an organic repair capability or contractor repair
capability is established.

Post Production Support funds are used to acquire, replace, upgrade, integrate, and test obsolete B-2 Peculiar Support Equipment, Special Test Equipment and their sub-components required to support the
WSSC GTF, Programmed Depot Maintenance, Test Range, and AFGSC support facilities.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>The B-52 Combat Network Communication Technology (CONECT) acquisition project supports nuclear and conventional operations by upgrading the B-52 fleet with data link and voice communications capabilities along with improved threat and situational awareness to support participation in network centric operations. The CONECT upgrade installs new Multi-Functional Color Displays (MFCDs) and a digital interphone system, which will survive and function through the nuclear environment to enhance crew interaction and situational awareness. To enable net centric operations, the CONECT upgrade installs on-board client/server architecture supporting distributed processing with independent control functions;  UHF Beyond Line-Of-Sight (BLOS) Joint Range Extension (JRE) capability via ARC-210 Warrior radio to exchange J-Series messaging within theater; Intelligence Broadcast Receiver (IBR); limited Internet Protocol (IP)-based UHF BLOS link supporting voice, email and file transfers; and Improved Data Modem (IDM)-based digital Variable Message Format (VMF) data link to significantly enhance close air support (CAS) missions. This integrated suite, when produced and installed, will provide the B-52 fleet with a machine-to-machine capability supporting aircraft re-tasking and re-targeting of Conventional Air Launched Cruise Missile (CALCM) and J-series weapons across the range of military operations the B-52 is assigned. 
  
This modification is planned to be done in conjunction with Programmed Depot Maintenance (PDM).  In addition, training devices will be upgraded to include CONECT functionality to meet user training requirements.

Post Production Support funds Interim Contract Support (ICS) until the depot is established for CONECT.  

The FY2017 funding request was reduced by $1.062 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances

This program has associated Research Development Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) funding in PE 0101113F.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>This program, Item B-52 RADAR MODERNIZATION ICS, is a new start.

FY17 funding was increased (+19.115M) for Interim Contractor Support as B-52 CONECT fielding ramps up.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>The PPPI program funds material improvement projects that were discovered during aircraft production. There have been over 275 projects incorporated into production aircraft. About 60 projects remain to
be retrofitted to post production aircraft to bring them up to production aircraft configuration. The projects are worked in conjunction with aircraft depot maintenance cycle every 5 years. 

Material improvement projects approved after FY12 are funded with O&amp;M.

In FY16, the Peculiar Support Equipment purchase supported the stand up of Martinsburg ANG base in West Virginia.

This budget line has been used to support the Transition to Post Production program in the past. That program is complete.

Funds remaining in the FYDP will be used to complete PPPI projects initiated with APAF.

Funding may be used to address Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues.

Funding for this exhibit is contained in PE 0401130F.

The FY 2017 funding request was reduced by $12.6 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>The FY 2017 budget supports PPPI for 16 projects to be installed on 47 aircraft and the procurement of common support equipment (CSE) and peculiar support equipment (PSE) for the C-17.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>CV-22 post production support funding enables the seamless transition from the production phase of the program to the operations and support (O&amp;S) phase.  This funding will support the activation of the operational CV-22 squadron in the U.S. Pacific Command (PACOM) area of responsibility, specifically the procurement of integrated logistics support (ILS) items needed to stand up that unit, including ground peculiar support equipment.  Post production support funding may also be used to support ILS requirements necessary to sustain the worldwide CV-22 fleet during this transition.  

Funding for this exhibit contained in PE 0401318F.

Funding may be used to address Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>The KC-135 Pacer CRAG (Compass, Radar, &amp; GPS) modification upgraded the KC-135 avionics suite from "round dial" to a digital backbone. The modification was installed from 1999-2002 and was supported by a 10 year "no fault" warranty for all repairs which expired in November 2011. The Global Air Traffic Management (GATM) modification was installed from 2002-2011 and is supported by a 10 year warranty which expires 30 June 2017. Funding is required to perform a GAP Analysis study/Depot study on a total of 27 LRUs to find the best long-term strategy in supporting, maintaining and repairing these components.  

Funding for this exhibit is contained in PE 0401218F.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>No FY 2017 funding requested.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>The program continues post-production support of the F-15C/D and F-15E Electronic Systems Test Set (ESTS) and post production support for the F-15 tooling storage.

The F-15C/D Eagle is a highly maneuverable all-weather air superiority fighter. The F-15E Strike Eagle retains the basic air-to-air capability of the F-15C/D Eagle, but adds a weapon systems operator (WSO), rear cockpit, conformal fuel tanks and advanced systems for all-weather, day/night, all-altitude, deep penetration air-to-surface attack.

Provides continued support of post production tooling storage at Granite City, IL. This equipment is used for the manufacture, test, support, or repair of the F-15 aircraft and/or its associated system components. The retention of Special Tooling/Special Test Equipment (ST/STE) is based on past usage history, current spare/repair parts contracts, and projections for future requirements.

Funding may be used to resolve Diminishing Manufacturing Sources/Material Shortages (DMSMS) and/or obsolescence issues. DMSMS activities may include, but are not limited to, bridge buys, life of type buys, buys to protect production schedule, and minor engineering efforts for redesign.
DMSMS costs are included in Group B NRE; SE/PM costs are include in the Group B recurring; and Depot Costs are included in the Support Equipment.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY16 Funding provides continued support of the Electronic Systems Test Set (ESTS). Grounding of aircraft would result without this repair support. 

Provides continued interim contractor support of post production tooling storage at Granite City, IL. Tooling is loaned/leased to support manufacturing of spares, as well as to support the execution of modification programs, life extension activities, and sustainment efforts.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>Provides funding for F-16 support equipment, facilities support, interim contractor support, and production line shutdown activities for F-16 aircraft.

Funding for this exhibit is budgeted in PE 0207133F</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>This appropriation is for the continuation of prime contractor post production support, procurement of deferred peculiar ground support equipment, peculiar training equipment, mission support, interim contract support, and activities associated with F-16 production line shutdown. 

The USG stores tooling identified as required to be re-utilized to manufacture spares, support aircraft modifications, or other purposes.  It would require millions of dollars to re-manufacture these tools and the delivery lead-time of the required tool/part would take several years to reproduce.  Funding for these contracts is essential since the F-16 Program Offices require specialized engineering services to ensure continued fleet support capability during, and beyond, the Production Line Shutdown (PLS). The requirement is annual funding to maintain the Electronic Tool Inventory Management System (eTIMS) in cooperation with the Lexes Inc. and Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Inc, as well as the actual teardown, shipping and storage of unique aircraft manufacturing equipment.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>FY17 funding will procure necessary support equipment for F-22 aircraft contingency and home station operations. The Raptor is the USAF top priority for ensuring air dominance in support of Joint Forces' operational access and homeland defense for the next 25+ years. The F-22 is the first and only multi-mission fighter that combines stealth, super cruise, advanced maneuverability and integrated avionics to make it the most capable anti-access, area denial combat aircraft.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY17 funding will procure various common and unique F-22 support equipment includes but is not limited to the following:
1)  SWAT (SMS Wrap Around Test cables/testers) capability to test the aircraft armament system utilizing F-22 on board diagnostics which reduces test, aircraft turn and repair time over current system.  2)  Next Generation Polyalphaolefin (NextGen PAO) Carts required to cool and protect aircraft avionics systems during ground operations and maintenance checks.  The PAO carts are needed to begin the replacement of legacy carts suffering reliability and diminishing manufacturing source issues.  3)  A Mission Training Center (MTC) to enable the USAF Weapons School, at Nellis AFB, to develop, create and train high-end advanced tactics for the F-22.  4)  A Multi-Bus Fault Isolation (MBFI) organically modified test program sets providing enhanced diagnostic test capabilities for the Raptor's 1553 avionics bus systems, reducing repair times for wiring/electronics issues.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>RQ-4 post-production funding will support production line shutdown and disposition activities, Ground Segment Modernization Program (GSMP), sensor procurement and related activities, as well as technology insertion activities in support of Better Buying Power initiatives. 

Funds will support sensor procurement to include, but not limited to, the installation of two (2) Multi-Spectral (MS) 177 sensors, four (4) MS-177 Sensor Interface Modules (SIM), eight (8) Optical Bar Camera (OBC) SIMs, sensor calibration, support related activities and other government costs. Additionally, funds will support Global Hawk costs to shut down the production line upon completion of the production phase. Post-production costs include production equipment disposition, contract closeout, sustaining engineering ramp down, mission support, production closeout costs, and other related costs. 

Funding may be used to alleviate Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues for which there are not sufficient Government spares and/or the ability to repair organically or commercially is not viable.

Neither the MS-177 nor the OBC are replacing systems currently flown on the RQ-4. Presently, there are no developmental test results as the Program Office only awarded a contract to integrate the MS-177 onto the RQ-4 at the beginning of FY16.

                    <proc:Remarks>This project supports production and fielding of a modernized Ground Segment in support of the planned 20 year operational life cycle and next generation communications system. The Ground Segment Modernization Program (GSMP) resolves fleet grounding Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) and obsolescence issues associated with legacy ground segment equipment and provides critical warfighter capabilities such as building-based multi-aircraft control. It will also enhance interoperability and data dissemination, and will provide training capability. GSMP integrates previous modifications and improvements to the Global Hawk weapon system and will employ the USAF Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) Command and Control Initiative (UCI) and the DoD's Unmanned Control Segment standards (UCS), using a service-oriented open architecture approach.</proc:Remarks>

            <proc:Description>1.  The Air Force Industrial Preparedness program element combines the resources of several appropriations (Aircraft Procurement, Missile Procurement, and Operation and Maintenance) to create a comprehensive program that aids in ensuring the defense industry can supply reliable, affordable systems to operational commanders.  The Aircraft Procurement part of Industrial Preparedness supports 1) management and upkeep of government-owned industrial plants; 2) management of industrial base assessments; and 3) environmental compliance program at government-owned industrial plants.

2. Three basic activities are funded in this appropriation: Industrial Facilities, Industrial Base Assessments and Environmental Activities (Environmental Compliance).

Industrial Facility Capital Type Rehabilitation cost element (MPC 3000): Provides for repair and expansion, major capital rehabilitation, construction, equipment movement and energy conservation at government-owned, contractor-operated industrial facilities.  These plants are the backbone of defense weapon system assembly and maintenance for the B-2, U-2, F-16, F-15SA, P-3 C-130, C-5B, RQ-4 Global Hawk, and F-35 Joint Strike Fighter.

Industrial Base Assessment cost element (MPC 6000): Provides for the identification, analysis and assessment of industrial base concerns dealing with aircraft research and development, production, and sustainment.  These assessments provide timely and accurate industrial base information to support Air Force decisions on 1) aircraft weapon system acquisition risks; 2) budget allocation investments; 3) weapon system sustainment and logistics support; and 4) defense industry mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures.  Supports joint-Service industrial base planning on shared commodities, technologies, and facilities.

Environmental compliance cost element (MPC 7000) provides for the efforts needed to maintain compliance with federal, state, and local regulatory requirements regarding operation of the government-owned contractor-operated industrial facilities.

Funding for this exhibit is contained in PE 78011F.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2017 requirements are for MPC 3000 Capital Type Rehabilitation, MPC 6000 Industrial Base Assessment, and MPC 7000 Environmental Compliance.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>This program provides funding for the procurement of initial/replacement War Consumables and includes commodities such as Miniature Air Launched Decoy Jammers (MALD-J), Fiber Optic Towed Decoys (FOTD), Rocket-Assisted Take-Off (RATO) motors. These items support War Reserve Materiel (WRM) requirements and fleet inventory objectives across multiple weapon systems. 

DESCRIPTION: 
The Miniature Air Launched Decoy (MALD) and Jammer (MALD-J) configurations are key enablers supporting Air Force Global Strike, Global Response, Space and C4ISR, and Air and Space Expeditionary Force Concepts of Operation. MALD is a low cost, powered, expendable decoy designed to represent the kinematics and radar signature characteristics of various combat aircraft. The MALD will be employed from various aircraft platforms to stimulate, saturate, and deceive integrated air defense systems (IADS) thus increasing the survivability of strike aircraft. MALD production is complete and transitioned to sustainment. MALD-J is currently in production and is the DODs only stand-in jamming capability for Airborne Electronic Attack Systems. MALD-J is designed to degrade or deny the IADS detection of friendly aircraft or munitions, and is able to operate in both decoy and jammer modes. 

The MALD program plans to use some funds to address Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS), material shortages, obsolescence issues, and reliability improvements, including flight testing. 

DESCRIPTION:
The ALE-70 Towed Decoy is a countermeasures dispenser system designed to fit into the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) aircraft. The ALE-70 provides aircraft self-protection against radar guided missiles.  Funds procure all system components: decoys, canisters, and explosive cartridges to deploy the decoys.

DESCRIPTION:
Items Less Then $5M: The Rocket-Assisted Take-Off (RATO) motor is a solid propellant rocket used to provide launching thrust to the Air Force Subscale Aerial Target (AFSAT) drone (BQM-167).  Support items include reefing line cutters, igniters, and initiators. The RATO and the associated support items are single use items.


Funding for this exhibit contained in Program Element PE 0207442F, 0305116F, 0207040F, and 0208030F.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>The FY17 funds allow for a procurement quantity of 200 missiles with no warranty, continue the reliability program and also continue to address DMS. 

Items Less Than $5M: FY17 funding required to procure RATOs, Initiators, Cutter Cartridges, and MK-17 Igniters for BQM-167s.</proc:Justification>

The OC-135B aircraft supports the implementation of the United States Government (USG) Open Skies Treaty. Mission equipment on the OC-135B includes wet film optical framing and panoramic cameras. Open Skies Sensors program addresses the requirements in the Presidential Policy Directive-15 (PPD-15), which states," The United States shall begin budgeting no later than Fiscal Year 2014 to upgrade the sensors on the current aircraft by replacing film-based cameras with available electro-optical sensors.(U)" Additionally, current cameras are nearly obsolete, frequently unreliable, hard and increasingly expensive to maintain, and repair parts must be individually manufactured. In addition, the web film manufacturers are discontinuing production of the film stock.

This camera replacement program will replace the wet film cameras with modern, digital cameras. This program will result in modern, digital cameras with higher reliability, maintainability and cost effectiveness. The customer of the imagery will be able to more readily use the imagery products and the equipment service life will be extended significantly.

OC-135B fleet consists of two aircraft. Both aircraft will be modified. One aircraft will be modified during development using RDT&amp;E funds. Each aircraft will receive one A-kit and two B-kits to comply with treaty requirements.</proc:Remarks>

                    <proc:Remarks>The P5 Combat Training System (P5CTS) provides instrumentation to train aircrews in air-to-air, air-to-ground, and ground-to-air combat under simulated combat conditions in any available airspace worldwide and eliminates the need to fly over highly instrumented ground ranges.  The system also provides the capability to train aircrews in electronic warfare during joint-force training exercises. FY 17 funding is being requested for replacement ground subsystems.</proc:Remarks>

The UH-1N is a 45+ year old helicopter (oldest in DoD), and this work is necessary to address concerns identified in multiple studies and to prevent the aircraft from being grounded.   The funds budgeted over the FYDP will enable the SLEP of 30 aircraft that are needed in order to bridge the gap until a UH-1N replacement helicopter can be fielded.</proc:Remarks>

                    <proc:Remarks>This budget item covers two categories of pollution prevention activities at USAF industrial (government owned, contractor operated) facilities. These activities reduce emission of hazardous materials to air, land, and water, while reducing the cost to the Air Force as facility owner, as a customer for products manufactured in the plants, and through process improvements that can be transitioned to Air Force users.  The first category covers the demonstration, validation, and procurement of improved equipment and services provided by the Air Force as facility owner and direct manager of common areas and services at these facilities. These activities meet Air Force pollution prevention goals and reduce the AF ownership cost of the facilities and weapon systems (WS).  They include typical landlord initiatives such as recovery/recycling equipment, energy conservation initiatives, and pollution prevention opportunity assessments. The second category of expenditure invests in the demonstration and validation of improved manufacturing processes for plant contractors that reduce emissions, regulatory burdens, and WS life cycle costs. These are usually cost-sharing initiatives, undertaken with the contractor because the government has required the use of hazardous materials through specifications, standards, drawing, contracts, and technical orders. In addition, the process improvements innovated at the plants often can be transitioned to Air Force depots, resulting in reduced operation &amp; maintenance costs, reduced depot flow time, and increases asset availability. This budget activity supports Air Force goals under the Pollution Prevention Act, Executive Orders 13423 and 13514, the AF/CV and SAF/IE Pollution Prevention Policy, the USD(AT&amp;L) hexavalent chromium reduction policy, and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.  Prior to FY15, these funds were previously provided through PE 078054F.

Funding for this exhibit is contained in PE 78011F.</proc:Remarks>

                    <proc:Remarks>Advanced Targeting Pods (ATPs) provide long-range target acquisition and expanded weapon delivery envelopes for greater aircraft survivability.  ATPs feature an infrared (IR) sensor, charged coupled device television (CCD-TV), laser designator, eye-safe laser, laser spot tracker, infrared marker, and real-time video data link for connectivity with ground forces.   ATP capabilities, such as high resolution imagery, eye safe laser, high system reliability and smaller deployment footprint provide greater combat effectiveness across several mission areas, including suppression/destruction of enemy air defenses (SEAD/DEAD), precision air interdiction, close air support (CAS), non-traditional intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (NT-ISR), reconnaissance, and time-sensitive targeting.  This funding supports the production, qualification and integration of ATPs to include all activities necessary for fielding. It includes, but is not limited to, Advanced Targeting Pod (ATP) procurements, OFP verification/qualification testing and integration efforts, Interim Contractor Logistics (ICS) support, containers, site activations, technical data packages, depot standup and program management support. Laser Infrared Targeting and Navigating (LITENING) and Sniper are ATPs currently used by the active duty, Air National Guard (ANG), and Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC).  Advanced Targeting Pod - Sensor Enhancement (ATP-SE) is the next increment in ATP capability.  Low-Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infrared for Night (LANTIRN) and Pave Penny systems will be phased out as new ATP and ATP-SE systems are acquired.

FY17 OCO funds of $8.4M will be used for procurement modification on the Advanced Targeting Pods to add Eye-Safe Spot Tracker/Laser Spot Search.  Eye-safe Laser Spot Tracker/Laser Spot Search is essential for protection of US ground and coalition forces during the combat identification process.  The capability will prevent  potential eye damage to friendly forces during ID of targets in urban Environments.

                    <proc:Remarks>NATO E-3 aircraft provide air and maritime surveillance and air control for allied forces in the NATO area of operations.  Fiscal Year Defense Plan funding provides the required U.S. contribution for projects defined by the NATO Airborne Early Warning and Control (NAEWC) Board of Directors and approved by the U.S. government.  These projects include but are not limited to the Follow-on Upgrade Program (FUP I) and future modernization projects.  The Follow-on Upgrade program satisfies international airspace mandates for upgraded Communications Navigation Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) as well as transponder upgrades for Mode 5 and Enhanced Mode S and includes planning activities for a FUP II effort.  Future efforts include but are not limited to FUP II efforts and other modernization projects.  These future projects will enable the aircraft to maintain interoperability, meet emerging military requirements and sustain the NATO fleet for the future needs of NATO.</proc:Remarks>
