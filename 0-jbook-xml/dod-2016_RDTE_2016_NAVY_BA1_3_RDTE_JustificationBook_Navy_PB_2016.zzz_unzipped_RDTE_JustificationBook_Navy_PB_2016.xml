                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program includes support for multidisciplinary basic research in a wide range of scientific and engineering disciplines that enable the U.S. Navy to maintain
technological superiority, and for university research infrastructure to acquire research instrumentation needed to maintain and improve the quality of university
research important to the Navy. Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative (MURI) efforts involve teams of researchers investigating high priority topics and
opportunities that intersect more than one traditional technical discipline. For many military problems this multidisciplinary approach serves to stimulate innovation,
accelerate research progress and expedite transition of results into Naval applications. The Defense University Research Instrumentation Program (DURIP) supports
university research infrastructure essential to high quality, Navy-relevant research. The instrumentation program complements other Navy research programs by
supporting the purchase of high cost research instrumentation that is necessary to carry out cutting-edge research. The program supports Presidential Early Career
Awards for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE), single investigator research efforts performed by outstanding academic scientists and engineers early in their research
careers. This program provides the knowledge base, scientific concepts, and technological advances for the maintenance of Naval power and national security.


Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Title>DEFENSE UNIVERSITY RESEARCH INSTRUMENTATION PROGRAM (DURIP)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>DURIP funds are provided to universities to purchase relatively high cost research instrumentation that is normally not included in single-investigator type research grants. Individual grants range from $50K to $1.5M. The DURIP program is an Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) interest item and OSD directs that funding for the DURIP efforts be awarded after OSD announces the awardees, which typically takes place towards the second half of the fiscal year. In turn, universities need to purchase the instrumentation and take delivery before any billings are generated. It frequently takes several months for delivery and billing to be completed.  DURIP is a one year program.

The increase of funds from FY 2014 to FY 2015 is for the growth in research programs needing instrumentation.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Title>MULTIDISCIPLINARY UNIVERSITY RESEARCH INITIATIVE (MURI)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>Research efforts include high priority topics that intersect more than one traditional discipline. MURI topics are selected to address Naval Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Focus Areas as described in the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan. 
The MURI program is an OSD interest item and OSD directs that funding for the MURI efforts be awarded after OSD announces the awardees, which typically takes place towards the second half of the fiscal year. Since the MURI program funds academic researchers, execution of the efforts typically ramps up during the summer academic break months. MURI projects make significant contributions to Navy and DoD objectives by; speeding up scientific programs by cross-fertilization of ideas, hastening the transition of basic research to practical applications, and training students in cross-disciplinary approaches to science and engineering research of importance to DoD. MURI is a five year program.

The increase in funding from FY 2014 to FY 2015 reflects increase in research programs in FY 2014.

The increase in funding from FY 2015 to FY 2016 reflects the increased number of programs in FY 2015.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element (PE) sustains U.S. Naval Science and Technology (S&amp;T) superiority by providing new technological concepts for the maintenance of Naval power and national security, and by helping to avoid scientific surprise while exploiting scientific breakthroughs and providing options for new Future Naval Capabilities (FNCs). The Department of Navy (DON) component responds to S&amp;T directions of the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan for long term Navy and Marine Corps improvements and is in consonance with future warfighting concepts and doctrine developed at the Naval Warfare Development Command and the Marine Corps Combat Development Command. It enables technologies that significantly improve the Joint Chiefs of Staff's Future Joint Warfighting Capabilities. The In-house Laboratory Independent Research (ILIR) program also adds increased emphasis to the revitalization of the scientist and engineer workforce component at the Navy's Warfare Centers and Laboratories by attracting superior candidates and retaining our best members through the provision of exciting and meaningful work.

This PE addresses DON Basic Research, which includes scientific study and experimentation directed toward increasing knowledge and understanding in national-security related aspects of physical, engineering, environmental, and life sciences, and is the core of Discovery and Invention. Basic research projects are developed, managed, and related to more advanced aspects of research in some hundred-plus technology and capability-related 'thrusts', which are consolidated in thirteen research focus areas: Power and Energy; Operational Environments; Maritime Domain Awareness; Asymmetric and Irregular Warfare; Information, Analysis and Communication; Power Projection; Assure Access and Hold at Risk; Distributed Operations; Naval Warfighter Performance and Protection; Survivability and Self-Defense; Platform Mobility; Fleet/Force Sustainment; Affordability, Maintainability and Reliability.

This portion of the DON Basic Research Program provides participating Naval Warfare Centers and Laboratories with funding for: basic research to support the execution of their assigned missions; developing and maintaining a cadre of active researchers who can distill and extend results from worldwide research and apply them to solve Naval problems; promoting hiring and development of new scientists; and encouragement of collaboration with universities, private industry, and other Navy and Department of Defense laboratories.

ILIR efforts are selected by Naval Warfare Centers/Lab Commanding Officers and Technical Directors near the start of each Fiscal Year through internal competition. Efforts typically last three years, and are generally designed to assess the promise of new lines of research. Successful efforts attract external, competitively awarded funding. Because the Warfare Centers and Labs encompass the full range of naval technology interests, the scope of ILIR topics roughly parallels that of PE 0601153N, Defense Research Science.

In FY15 the ILIR PE 06011652N was simplified from seven Naval technology interests (advanced materials, electronics sensor sciences, energy sciences, human performance sciences, information sciences, naval platform design sciences, and ocean/space sciences) into one encompassing ILIR program.  It is still possible to report which naval technology interest each project falls under.  Due to the number of efforts in PE 06011652N, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Participating students will spend eight to ten weeks during the summer doing research at approximately 19 to 20 DoN laboratories.  Participants will receive a stipend distributed by the Contractor.  The stipend is a monthly allowance paid to interns for their participation in the research efforts.

This activity was separated from ILIR in FY 2013 to highlight Science Technology Engineering and Math (STEM) efforts at Navy labs previously funded within the Ocean/Space Sciences activity in this PE. Funding increase in FY 2015 results from temporary augmentation of STEM within the PE, but the FY 2016 decrease plan rebalances the PE to focus on the NREIP and SEAP programs, scaling back on other STEM efforts.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>The ILIR initiative seeks to improve the quality of defense research conducted predominantly through the Naval Warfare Centers/Laboratories.  It also supports the development of technical intellect and education of engineers and scientists in disciplines critical to national defense needs through the development of new knowledge in a military laboratory environment.  Initial research focus is often conducted in an unfettered environment since it is basic research, but many projects focus on applying recently developed theoretical knowledge to real world military problems with the intention of developing new capabilities and improving the performance of existing systems.  Individual project metrics then become more tailored to the needs of specific applied research and advanced development programs.  The National Research Council of the National Academies of Science and Engineering's Congressionally directed "Assessment of Department of Defense Basic Research" concluded that the DoD is managing its basic research program effectively.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element (PE) sustains U.S. Naval Science and Technology (S&amp;T) superiority, provides new technological concepts for the maintenance of naval power and national security, and helps avoid scientific surprise.  It is based on investment directions as defined in the Naval Science &amp; Technology Strategy approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (Sep 2011).  This new strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It exploits scientific breakthroughs and provides options for new Future Naval Capabilities (FNCs) and Innovative Naval Prototypes (INPs).  

This PE addresses basic research efforts including scientific study and experimentation directed toward increasing knowledge and understanding in national security related aspects of physical, engineering, environmental and life sciences.  Basic research efforts are developed, managed, and related to more advanced aspects of research on the order of a hundred technology and capability-related 'thrusts', which are consolidated into about fifteen research areas.  These in turn support the major research areas of the Navy and Marine Corps: Autonomous Systems; Command, Control, Communications and Computers (C4); Marine as a System; Information Analysis and Decision Support; Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance; Logistics; Materials; Operational Environments; Platforms; Power and Energy Technology; Sensors and Electronics; Warrior Performance and Protection; Weapons and Support (Education and Outreach).

S&amp;T investment in basic research also includes the National Naval Responsibilities (NNRs), fields upon which a wide range of fundamental Naval capabilities depend.  There are currently five NNRs.

S&amp;T investment in basic research also includes the Basic Research Challenge Program which was established to competitively select and fund promising research programs in new areas not addressed by the current basic research program.  The Basic Research Challenge Program stimulates new, high-risk basic research projects in multi-disciplinary and departmental collaborative efforts, and funds topics that foster leading edge science and attracts new principal investigators and organizations.  Basic Research Challenge awards are for a period of four years.

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>The ONR Basic Research Challenge (BRC) program was established in 2008 to competitively select and fund promising research programs in new areas not addressed by the current basic research program. In the past, the Basic Research Challenge Program has been integrated into the legacy R2 Activities to illustrate its alignment with the mainstream Naval research disciplines, but with this update BRC is being identified as its own R2 Activity to call attention to the significance it provides to new areas of Naval importance. The program stimulates new, high-risk basic research projects in multidisciplinary and departmental collaborative efforts, and funds topics that foster leading edge science and attract new principal investigators and organizations. Basic Research Challenge awards are for a period of four years. Topics are submitted by ONR program officers and are selected for BRC awards by ONR's director of research. Basic Research Challenge award topics are then issued as a broad agency announcement. 

In FY 2014 the BRC is being identified under its own Research Activity to highlight its more prominent role in stimulating competitive multidisciplinary research between ONR departments. BRC research by its nature will likely cross the traditional Research Activity boundaries and produce standout results worthy of specific focused attention.

Funding decrease in FY 2015 is due to normalization of annual investment following initial emphasis in program research.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Defense Basic Research seeks to improve the quality of defense research conducted predominantly through universities and government laboratories.  It also supports the education of engineers and scientists in disciplines critical to national defense needs through the development of new knowledge in an academic environment.  Initial research focus is generally conducted in an unfettered environment because of the nature of basic research, but as more is learned and applications emerge, individual research projects take on a more applied focus.  Individual project metrics then become more tailored to the needs of specific applied research and advanced development programs.  Example metrics include a biporous wick structure for thermal management of power electric modules capable of removing 900 watts per square centimeter which was recently developed by an academia/industry team.  The National Research Council of the National Academies of Science and Engineering's congressionally directed "Assessment of Department of Defense Basic Research" concluded that the DoD is managing its basic research program effectively.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (Sep 2011).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare.

This PE supports both advanced technology research and near to mid-term transition opportunities.  The advanced research focus is primarily on high energy lasers, Electromagnetic Railgun (EMRG) development, Hyper Velocity Projectiles (HVP), high speed weapon propulsion, and electro-optic/infrared (EO/IR) sensor technologies. 

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>The goal of this activity is to develop Directed Energy (DE) technology for Navy applications. The DE program addresses the requirements of future Navy combatants to provide ship defense against the emerging threats that are proliferating throughout the Navies of the world. The Directed Energy portion of this activity consists of two elements. The first element involves applied research and development of technologies supporting advanced accelerators with applications to directed energy weapons. This activity also includes the Free Electron Laser (FEL) Innovative Naval Prototype (INP) which will deliver multi-mission capability. 
 
FY 2014 to FY 2015 increases in funding are due to increased work on the Solid State Laser (SSL) program. The SSL-QRC program was initiated during FY 2013 and is planned to complete during FY 2015 with plans to demonstrate the system at sea in CY 2014.

FY 2015 to FY 2016 decrease in funding is due to completion of the Solid State Laser - QRC program as well as a continued realignment of FEL activities.</r2:Description>

                                            <r2:Text>Directed Energy and Accelerator Research:
-Continued to develop the most promising component technologies such as normal conducting and super conducting RF electron beam injectors, advanced high power cathode technologies, high power compact amplifiers, and advanced mirrors, coatings and optical components capable of handling the significantly higher energies. Consider analysis of smaller FEL system designs.

Solid State Laser - Technology Maturation (SSL-TM): 
-Continued the development of technologies suitable for a solid state laser weapon system, including technologies for maritime beam director, targeting and laser subsystems, which are capable of supporting future Navy missions to defeat small boat swarms, UAV swarms, and provide potential ISR disruption and/or defeat.  This work supports future prototype developments and will include laser subsystem (potentially both slab and fiber solid state systems) and required beam director scientific studies. The focus of the effort will be to support the development and advancement of future Navy Solid State Laser prototypes, including the development of lethality studies and atmospheric characterization. These scientific studies are critical to understand and support missions identified for a layered defensive capability, in the maritime environment, which shall include robust modeling and simulation of atmospheric absorption and turbulence.
-Conduct lethality testing for notional solid state laser designs. This will include scientific studies of laser erosion, pitting, and ablation of various target materials for improved modeling and simulation that will support development of the governing technical requirements for a beam director and targeting system capable of performing Navy surface ship self-defense missions.  
-Continued and conducted studies of atmospheric absorption and turbulence, suitable to evaluate notional maritime beam director subsystems, and including studies in adaptive optics for improved lethality performance in low altitude, maritime surface conditions. These scientific studies are critical to understanding the impact of boundary layer and sea-water-air turbulent mechanics on future laser weapons systems and interfaces.
-Continued and conducted trade studies on innovative solid state laser subsystems designs, based off industry available technologies or those technologies identified by the High Energy Laser Joint Technology Office (HEL JTO). These investments will be considered "break through" type of investments, which require additional scientific study to determine their potential for near term capability improvements in a future naval prototype system.
-Continued and conducted scientific studies on laser subcomponents, including laser pump diodes and laser gain media, which have the potential to support future acquisition programs, but are based on solid state laser technologies. Efforts in this area will focus on emerging commercial technologies and government sponsored research, which are suitable for use in a maritime domain. Research and technology developments will include advancements suitable for use by either solid state slab or solid state fiber optic laser subsystems - and which if matured, would enable rapid scientific advancements and improve specific systems performance against key performance parameters.
-Continued and conducted scientific trade studies of notional predictive avoidance systems, which examine the control interfaces between sensors and future prototypical naval laser weapons, which would provide an inherent "safe-arm" function for the projecting of laser power at long range (potentially beyond typical visible, line of sight distances.) Of particular concern is the designs for safety in future laser weapons to halt laser energy propagation, while performing Navy surface ship self- defense missions, and avoid inadvertent illumination of non-threat forces (e.g. friendly sensors or platforms.)</r2:Text>

                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>This PE develops early components technologies that can be integrated into weapon systems that meet warfighter requirements.  Most of the work in this PE can be classified between Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 2 (technology concept and/or application formulation) and TRL 4 (component and/or breadboard validation in laboratory environments).  The metrics used to evaluate 6.2 programs are necessarily less precise than those used in 6.3 programs. 

The metrics for this PE can be divided into two categories:  technological and organizational/functional.  Technological metrics address the success of the work performed.  The primary technological metrics used in this PE involve laboratory experiments/tests demonstrating proof of the concept for the technology.  This demonstration is frequently a hand-assembled functioning breadboard of the concept.  The organizational/functional metrics applied to this PE include:  transition of the technology to advanced development in a 6.3 PE and applicability of the technology to documented warfighter problems or requirements.  Successful implementation of these categories would result in the application of a pass/fail metric and further evaluation for possible transition to a 6.3 development/demonstration program.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this program element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (Sep 2011).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare.

This PE addresses applied research associated with providing the capability of Platform and Force Protection for the U.S. Navy.  It supports the development of technologies associated with all naval platforms (surface, subsurface, terrestrial, and air) and the protection of those platforms.  The goal is to provide the ability to win or avoid engagements with other platforms or weapons and, in the event of engagement, to resist and control damage while preserving operational capability.  Within the Naval Transformational Roadmap, this investment directly supports the Theater Air and Missile Defense transformational capability required by Sea Shield and the Ship to Objective Maneuver key transformational capability.  This is accomplished by improvements in platform offensive performance, stealth, and self-defense.  

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project addresses applied research associated with providing the capability of Platform and Force Protection for the U.S. Navy.  It supports the development of technologies associated with all naval platforms (surface, subsurface, terrestrial, and air) and the protection of those platforms.  The goal is to provide the ability to win or avoid engagements with other platforms or weapons and, in the event of engagement, to resist and control damage while preserving operational capability.  Within the Naval Transformational Roadmap, this investment directly supports the Theater Air and Missile Defense transformational capability required by Sea Shield and the Ship to Objective Maneuver key transformational capability by virtue of improvements in platform offensive performance, stealth, and self-defense.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>The Aircraft Technology activity develops technologies for reduced observables technology and enhanced capability of naval aviation aircraft platforms in terms of mission effectiveness, platform range, responsiveness, survivability, observability, readiness, safety and life cycle cost. It also develops new Naval air vehicle concepts and high impact, saleable naval air vehicle technologies, such as - autonomous air vehicle command and control, helicopter and tilt rotorsystems, aerodynamics, propulsion systems, materials, structures and flight controls for future and legacy air vehicles. This activity directly supports the Naval Aviation Enterprise Science and Technology Objectives and the Naval Science and Technology Strategic Plan, principally in the Autonomy and Unmanned Systems, Platform Design and Survivability, Power and Energy and Total Ownership Cost Focus Areas, Sea-Based Aviation was designated as a National Naval Responsibility (SBA NNR) in FY 2011 and will refocus investments beginning in FY 2014 in areas that are Naval unique or dominated by Naval requirements. 

Variable Cycle Advanced Technology (VCAT) will identify and mature critical, relevant variable/adaptive cycle propulsion system technologies for the next generation carrier-based TACAIR/ISR systems. Autonomous Aerial Cargo/Utility System (AACUS) will develop advanced autonomous capabilities to enable rapid resupply of distributed forces in the short term. The SBA NNR Structures and Materials program will develop the next generation structural capability and material response science for aircraft technology in fixed and rotary wing, manned and unmanned airframe technology to achieve reduced weight, increased durability, strength, streamlined manufacturability, reduced life-cycle cost and maintenance/readiness gaps improvements. Program payoffs include increased availability/readiness, reduced sustainment requirements, fatigue/loads life enhancement, reduced weight and improved range, and advanced prognostics design tools. 

Beginning in FY 2014, applied research efforts began under the Sea-Based Aviation National Naval Responsibility (SBA NNR) Propulsion thrust area. 

These efforts addresses unique attributes to propulsion and power technologies for Naval Aviation, as well as those having higher importance to Naval Aviation and some that are more pervasive to all of military aviation. Related basic research efforts are addressed under 0601153N. 

The funding decrease from FY 2014 to FY 2015 is due to the completion of a portion of the INP-Advanced Autonomous Cargo Utility System (AACUS) effort.
The funding increase from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to the initiation of the joint Tern program and an increase in AACUS activities as the program enters phase 3.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Title>FLEET FORCE PROTECTION AND DEFENSE AGAINST UNDERSEA THREATS</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>Fleet Force Protection and Defense against Undersea Threats efforts include applied research for complementary sensor and processing technologies for platform protection.  Current small platforms (both surface and airborne) have little to no situational awareness (SA) or self-protection against air, surface, and asymmetric threats.  A goal of this activity is to provide these platforms with effective self-protection.  The technology areas specific to platform protection will develop individual, multispectral electro-optical (EO), infrared (IR), radio frequency (RF), electro-magnetic (EM), visual and acoustic or chemical sensors/biosensors and associated processing.  To defend platforms from current and advanced threats in at-sea littoral environments and in port, these technologies must improve multispectral detection and distribution of specific threat information. 

The funding increases from FY 2015 to FY 2016 are due to re-prioritization of the S&amp;T investments.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Efforts include: signature reduction, hull life assurance, hydromechanics, distributed control for automated survivability (includes damage control), and advanced naval power systems. 

Signature reduction addresses electromagnetic, infrared, and acoustic signature tailoring, both topside and underwater.

Hull life assurance addresses development of new structural system approaches for surface ships and submarines, including the management of weapons effects to control structural damage and the improvement of structural materials.

Hydromechanics addresses hydrodynamic technologies, including the signature aspects of the hull-propulsor interaction and maneuvering. 

Distributed intelligence for automated survivability addresses both the basic technology of automating machinery control systems, as well as, distributed control of systems utilizing autonomy for mission context based reconfiguration. 

Unmanned Sea Surface Vehicle applied research includes short-term motion forecasting for recovery of USSVs on a host ship in higher sea states and determination of slamming loads on high-speed planing hulls for structural weight reduction.   

Advanced naval power systems efforts address electrical and auxiliary system and component technology to provide improvement in energy and power density, operating efficiency and recoverability from casualties. Advanced Naval Power efforts include: developing technologies to improve warfighting capability with more energy efficient systems; reducing the time &amp; cost to certify alternative fuels, and mitigate adverse alternative fuel impacts on Naval platforms and equipment; developing sustainable biomass models to support alternative fuel availability to Naval forces; utilizing the Electric Ship Research and Development Consortium (ESRDC) efforts to develop modeling and simulation tools to provide critical design &amp; operational capabilities for the all-electric ship program, accelerate development and demonstration of technologies, reduce risk of new technology insertion and address the national shortage of electrical power engineers. Efforts for ONR Science Advisors are also funded in this R-2 Activity. Long Endurance UUV technologies will deliver to the Office of Naval Research modular fuel cell systems for UUVs, including practical systems demonstrations, and a path forward for future developments. It will also keep the US Navy at the forefront of advanced electric propulsion technologies. 

The funding increase from FY 2014 to FY 2015 is due to the increase in the Applied Research Challenge and an increase in Counter-IED effort.  The funding decrease from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to the completion of the INP - Advanced UUV Power &amp; Energy effort.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) encompasses the Independent Applied Research (IAR) efforts focused on solving a wide range of Naval Science and Technology (S&amp;T) fleet issues utilizing unique Naval Warfare Center (WC) laboratory capabilities. Efforts under this activity address the full spectrum of the DON S&amp;T Strategic Plan technology using focus areas which engage Naval aviation, sea surface, undersea, space, weapons, communication, information, and human systems. The IAR Program provides participating WCs with in-house funding for applied research to support the execution of their assigned missions by: 
-Developing and maintaining a cadre of active researchers who can distill and extend results from worldwide research and apply them to solve Naval problems.
-Promoting the hiring and development of talented new scientists and engineers (S&amp;E) with the insurance of proper mentoring with senior personnel.
-Encouraging collaboration with universities, private industry, and other Navy and Department of Defense laboratories. 

Funded projects are chosen through rigorous internal competition by each WC's selection committee and typically last two to three years.  IAR projects are generally designed to promote investment in high-risk/high-payoff research and also allow young S&amp;Es to manage Navy relevant research projects. A limited number of successful efforts developed under the In-House Laboratory Independent Research (ILIR) basic research Program Element 0601152N are matured and further developed under the IAR program with the goal of transitioning these technologies to the warfighter. 

The IAR R2 activity was stood up in FY 2013 as the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) to consolidate all NRE related IAR investments. Projects funded in this R2 Activity are intended to be approximately 2-3 years in length.  Based on historical trends approximately 30% of these projects will turn over each year.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (June 2012).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare. This PE also directly supports Expeditionary Force 21 (EF 21), which  is now the Marine Corps' capstone concept that establishes  the vision and goals for USMC S&amp;T over the next 10 years and provides a plan for guiding the design and development of the future force.  One third of the Marine Corps operating forces will be forward  deployed.  These forces will be task-organized into a greater variety of formations, capable of operating from a more diverse array of ships dispersed over wider areas, in order to meet the Combatant Commanders' security cooperation and partner engagement requirements.  In the event of crises, those forces will be able to composite these distributed formations into larger, cohesive naval formations.  This presents both challenges and opportunities for USMC S&amp;T. Expeditionary Force 21 will inform future decisions regarding how the Marine Corps will adjust organizational structure to exploit the value of regionally focused forces.  A fixed geographic orientation will facilitate Marine Commanders and their staffs with more frequent interactions with theater- and component-level organizations, establishing professional bonds and a shared sense of the area's challenges and opportunities.  Expeditionary Force 21 provides the basis for future Navy and Marine Corps capability development to meet the challenges of the 21st Century.  The vision for Expeditionary Force 21 is to provide guidance for how the Marine Corps will be postured, organized, trained, and equipped to fulfill the responsibilities and missions required around the world.  Through Expeditionary Force 21, the Marine Corps intends to operate from the sea and provide the right sized force in the right place, at the right time.

This PE is organized into nine activities which are represented as seven Expeditionary Warfighting Capability Areas, as well as Future Concepts, Technology Assessment and Roadmapping, and the Littoral Combat/Power Projection (LC/PP) FNC.  The primary objective of this PE is to develop and demonstrate the technologies needed to meet the Marine Corps unique responsibility of training and equipping the Marine Air/Ground Task Force (MAGTF) for Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare.  In the post-September 11 world, irregular warfare (IW) has emerged as the dominant form of warfare confronting the United States, its allies and its partners; accordingly, this PE has been structured to account for distributed, long-duration operations, including unconventional warfare, counterterrorism, counterinsurgency, and stabilization and reconstruction operations.  IW emphasizes the use of indirect, non-conventional methods and means to subvert, attrite, and exhaust an adversary, or render irrelevant, rather than defeat him through direct conventional military confrontation.   IW is now institutionalized in Marine Corps planning, investment, and capability development.  This PE provides the knowledge base to support Advanced Technology Development (6.3) and is the technology base for future expeditionary warfare capabilities.  This PE supports the Expeditionary Force Development System of the Marine Corps Combat Development Command (MCCDC) and responds directly to the Marine Corps Science and Technology (S&amp;T) process as well as supporting related Littoral and Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare capabilities developed by the Navy's Mission Capability Program.  The Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) process is supported and funds are programmed accordingly.  The FNC program explores and demonstrates technologies that enable Sea Strike, Sea Shield, Sea Basing, FORCEnet and Force Health Protection pillars, Space, Naval Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare and the Enterprise and Platform Enablers.  The FNC program comprises Enabling Capabilities (ECs) which develop and deliver quantifiable products (i.e., prototype systems, knowledge products, and technology improvements) in response to validated requirements for insertion into acquisition programs of record after meeting agreed upon exit criteria within five years. The core 6.2 program also supports Discovery and Invention (D&amp;I) and Innovation and Transformation (I&amp;T).  Within the Naval Transformation Roadmap, this investment will achieve key transformational capabilities required by the Sea Power 21 Pillars, as well as enable Ship to Objective Maneuver (STOM), Persistent Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO).  The Marine Corps Service Campaign Plan (MCSCP) is the lens through which USMC S&amp;T priorities are acted upon to guide the future development of the Total Force.
Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>This activity addresses the applied research associated with the Marine Corps participation in the Department of the Navy's (DoN) Science and Technology Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) Program.  The FNC Program represents the requirements-driven, delivery-oriented portion of the DoN Science and Technology (S&amp;T) portfolio.  FNC investments respond to Naval S&amp;T Gaps that are generated by the Navy and Marine Corps after receiving input from Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders.  The funding is aligned with the Naval challenges associated with projecting power despite anti-access and area denial, specifically the Sea Shield, Power and Energy, FORCEnet, and the Naval Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare warfighting capability gaps. The funding profile reflects the alignment of the FNC program investments into Enabling Capabilities (ECs); ECs respond to priority Naval warfighting capability gaps.  Funding for each EC is aligned to a 6.2 or 6.3 Budget Activity (BA) as appropriate.  Concurrent funding for Naval Expeditionary Warfare capability ECs is also provided from Navy PE0602750N and PE0603673N. Both of the Navy PE's were included in the FY 2013 President's Budget Request and are now the only program elements funding Navy FNC work.  In previous submissions 7 Navy 6.2 PEs and 8 Navy 6.3 PEs funded FNC efforts.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>This activity supports Marine Corps Expeditionary Logistics which is the practical discipline and real world application of the deployment, sustainment, reconstitution, and re-deployment of forces engaged in expeditionary operations.  Expeditionary Logistics replaces mass with assured knowledge and speed, is equally capable ashore or afloat in austere environments, and is fully scalable to meet uncertain requirements.  Expeditionary Logistics logically divides into five pillars:  deployment support, force closure, sustainment, reconstitution/redeployment, and command and control.  These pillars are thoroughly integrated and perpetually related in execution.

The FY 2014 to FY 2015 funding decrease is due to the early completion and transition of a solid oxide fuel cell capable of directly oxidizing liquid logistic fuels.

The FY 2015 to FY 2016 funding increase is due to the acceleration and early completion of the logistics C2 systems for optimizing the transportation of materiel across multiple intra and inter-theater connector vehicles (aka: Transportation Exploitation Tool).</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Maneuver thrust area focuses on the development, demonstration, and transition of technologies that will increase the warfighting capabilities and effectiveness of the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF).  This thrust aims at capturing emerging and "leap ahead" technologies in the areas of mobility, materials, propulsion, survivability, durability, signature reduction, modularity, and unmanned systems.  Special emphasis on survivability technologies for the defeat of small arms, IEDs, mine blast, and RPGs continue to be incorporated into this thrust area.  Efforts also continue in the development of modeling and simulation tools that integrate many different physics based modeling systems with rigorous operational analysis simulations to accurately define a system's performance characteristics.  These tools will aid in defining the trade space for emerging technologies and assist in providing the program manager insight and guidance into pursuing future technologies.  Finally, this technology thrust area also seeks to develop technologies to enhance combat vehicle crewman effectiveness and situational awareness through the incorporation of advanced autonomous vehicle functions triggered directly by the cognitive state of the operator.

The FY 2014 to FY 2015 decrease in funding is due to a decrease in the plans to initiate and develop autonomous technologies transcribing vision-based perception data.

The FY 2015 to FY 2016 increase in funding is due to the initiation of autonomous technologies automating behavior generation and enabling adaptive behavior using virtual environments.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>This activity supports S&amp;T investment in Command and Control and is focused in three main areas:  (1) Implementing the FORCEnet concept; (2) Developing decision support systems that enable warfighters to take advantage of the FORCEnet and MAGTF C2, and tactically extend Net-Enabled Command and Control (NECC) for shared situational awareness; and (3) Providing effective combat identification of enemy combatants, friendly forces, and non-combatants.  FORCEnet is the operational construct and architectural framework for naval warfare in the information age that integrates warriors, networks, command and control, and weapons into a networked, distributed, combat force that is scalable across all levels of conflict from the seabed to space, and from sea to land. The Marine Corps instantiation of FORCEnet is Marine Air Ground Task Force Command and Control (MAGTF C2), with technologies to exchange data and information with, and among, distributed tactical forces. Activities in this program area provide technologies for secure, robust, self-forming, mobile communications networks and distributed computing to support information dissemination to all echelons; and sensors, software and data processing to support formation of an appropriate common picture.  Marine Corps specific efforts include power management, low detectability, size and weight constraints, and interoperability within the joint environment.</r2:Description>

Ongoing Human Factors research is more closely aligned to Warfighter Sustainment objectives.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (Sep 2011). This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps). It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century. The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare. 

Activities and efforts in this program examine concepts and technologies that enable the transformation to network centric warfare. Network centric capabilities rely on information to connect assets and provide timely and accurate understanding of the environment. The mission area requirements for rapid, accurate decision-making; dynamic, efficient, mission-focused communications and networks; and pervasive and persistent sensing drive network centric S&amp;T investments. 

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (Sep 2011). This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps). It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century. The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare. 

Activities and efforts in this program examine concepts and technologies that enable the transformation to network centric warfare. Network centric capabilities rely on information to connect assets and provide timely and accurate understanding of the environment. The mission area requirements for rapid, accurate decision-making; dynamic, efficient, mission-focused communications and networks; and pervasive and persistent sensing drive network centric S&amp;T investments.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Title>COMMUNICATION AND NETWORKS</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The overarching objective of this activity is to develop high throughput dynamic wireless communications and network technologies critical to the mission performance and robustness of naval communications for widely dispersed, mobile air, land, surface and submerged platforms.  These platforms are often size, weight and power (SWaP) limited, and will operate under constraints of cluttered RF spectrum, harsh electro-magnetic interference (EMI) and Beyond Line Of Sight (BLOS) conditions.  The technical payoff is increased network data rates, interoperability across heterogeneous radios, dynamic bandwidth management, and greater mobile network connectivity.  The operational payoff is that warfighters from the operational command to the tactical edge have near real-time access to information, knowledge and decision-making necessary to perform their tasks, including coalition and allied forces.  Emphasis is on tactical edge communications and networks to fully realize net-centric warfare, bridging the Global Information Grid (GIG) and the 'disadvantaged user', e.g., small-deck combatants, submarines, unmanned vehicles, distributed sensors and ground units in urban and radio frequency (RF) challenged environments.  

The current specific objectives are:
a) Radios and Apertures: Develop technologies for high band radio, electrically-small and actively scanned antennas, addressing critical issue of radio spectrum bandwidth efficiency, spectrum contention and clutter, agile frequency communications with dynamic spectrum access, all-digital front-end with wide dynamic range, power amplifier efficiency, multipath effects, saltwater propagation and BLOS communications. Develop algorithms and signal processing for space-time-frequency diversity communications, including measures for electronic protection, such as low-intercept, antijam waveforms and modulation.  Develop affordable antenna technologies for small size and weight, high radiation efficiency, and wideband operation with rapid beam-steering.  Develop alternatives to RF communications in airborne and terrestrial environments as well as high data rate underwater communications for undersea warfare (distributed sensor netting, unmanned underwater vehicle data exfiltration, submarine Communications at Speed and Depth) using electro-optic/infra-red (EO/IR) technologies.  Develop secure, high bandwidth communications systems and the exploitation of existing and emerging network protocols that will avail development of new, Low Earth Orbit (LEO) based data transport mechanisms.

b) Tactical Networking and Network Control/Management: 
Develop advanced networking techniques for robust, highly dynamic environments; interoperable networks for secure communications and protocols, bandwidth and network management techniques that manage and allocate bandwidth across tactical and theater levels in support of net-centric operations. Develop rapidly auto-configuring and self-organizing networks with efficient and survivable routing, secure authentication, mobility management and Quality-of-Service guarantee, while optimizing network resources.  Address low bandwidth, synchronization and reliability for Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)/middleware architecture in both mobile ad-hoc networks (MANET) and infrastructure-based Internet Protocol (IP) backbone networks. Develop cognitive network planning and operations engines whose criteria are based directly on mission objectives, while self-adapting and managing the spectrum allocation and radio resources in such a way that network operations, SOA community of interest, and computer network defense are integrated to form a single common tactical network picture that requires a minimum of human intervention and skill.  Develop technology for improving tactical edge networking and for improving voice communications.

The decrease from FY 2014 to FY 2015 is the reprioritizing of the Development of optical communications technologies for underwater platforms and research into multi-modal networking across undersea platforms with acoustic, optical, and RF communications.

                                    <r2:Title>APPLIED INFORMATION SCIENCES FOR DECISION MAKING</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The goal of this activity is to develop enablers for decision making and mission execution, to achieve battlespace superiority.  It focuses on the development of algorithms and software technologies that identify and integrate informational content from multiple sources, leading to decision aids that support user-cognitive processes.  Because persistent sensors are generating massive amounts of data, the focus is on technologies that not only integrate information from diverse sources, but also provide indications of information significance in ways that support the user's decision needs, regardless of location and operational situation.  To achieve this, it must be possible to automate understanding of the battlespace by identifying objects, determining relationships among the objects, assessing intent, and automatically generating courses of action with associated risks and uncertainty.  Effort will also be devoted to developing technology for increasing assurance and security for C3 information systems and technology for improving information discovery and information presentation in such systems.  The Nano Electronics Technology activity is focused on developing ultra-low power, higher performance computing devices and components that are based on novel functionalities of nanometer scale materials and are enabled by improved understanding of nanomaterials, new devices and circuit design concepts, as well as new architectures uniquely suited for nanoscale systems.  

Effective in FY 2013, this activity title has been changed from Computational Framework and Methods for Rapid Accurate Decision Making to Applied Information Sciences for Decision Making in order to completely capture the work being performed.  

The current specific objectives are:

a) Data Understanding: Develop automated, image and signal intelligence understanding tools based on rigorous mathematical and statistical methods that lead to improved change detection, improve object and activity detection and recognition capabilities, context and scene understanding, and inferring of the threat levels to support decision making and persistent and adaptive surveillance.

b) Information Integration: Develop innovative methods for combining traditional and non-traditional data from sensors and disparate sources to provide the best estimate of objects, events, and conditions in the battlespace, in terms of their identity, associated error or uncertainty, context, impact, while inferring relationships and their intentions.

c) Data Analytics (Formerly titled: Mission Focused Autonomy (MFA)): Develop proactive situational awareness and rapid decision making applications and analytics with information PUSH as well as PULL, where joint human controlled and automated analytic processes can collaboratively work together to solve tactical and strategic problems within a multi-level, secure environment.  Areas addressed include the following elements: a) access to enterprise level structured and unstructured data repositories and automated search and discovery of evidence collected across these heterogeneous databases; b) analytics that automate the ability to infer the meaning of evidence that is discovered; c) structured process (hypothesis or argument) that provides context in order to constrain and guide the search and analytic techniques toward goals that are focused on proving the hypothesis right or wrong; d) knowledge repository that maintains pedigree and state of hypothesis satisfaction or refutation; e) Collaborative environment wherein all analytic participants can share the state of hypothesis satisfaction and collectively contribute evidence data to solve the common problem. Develop rigorous and efficient methods for building sophisticated situational models, and develop automated reasoning techniques to categorize and recognize situations under a variety of conditions leading to methods that predict situations under different settings including capabilities to address growing cyber-related threats.

d) Resource Optimization: Develop automated decision tools based on mathematically rigorous techniques (e.g., mathematical optimization) that support decision-making to ensure the best use of scarce and/or expensive resources, achieving optimal allocations for large complex scenarios, including ones that contain uncertainty, in drastically reduced amounts of time.  Develop methods that support decision making in networked sensor management and allocation to ensure sensor assets are deployed in an optimal, or near optimal, manner.

e) Cyber Defense (Formerly titled Trusted Systems &amp; Networks): Develop tools and methods to securely handle information without exposing intelligence information about the networks or systems to adversaries. 

f) Nanoscale Electronics: To develop novel nanometer scale (feature size near or below 10nm) logic/memory devices and related circuits and architectures to deliver ultra-low power, light weight and high performance computational capability for autonomous vehicles and individual warfighters. Effective in FY 2014, Nanoscale Electronics has been transferred from Electromagnetic Systems Applied Research to Applied Information Sciences for Decision Making in order to completely capture the work being performed.

g) Quantum Information Sciences: Conduct research supporting the efficacy of a free space optical quantum key distribution that would operate in a maritime environment. Understand the implications of imperfect hardware implementations upon the vulnerability of the known protocols. Develop new protocols and encoding schemes that lead to robust performance with high throughput. Conduct research that leads to an understanding of, and develop methods that compensate for atmospheric effects.  

The increase of funds from FY2014 to FY2015 is for the development and demonstration  of new naval capabilities providing improved cyber situational awareness and cyber toolkit development to assess vulnerabilities in Naval networks.  The funds will also explore new technologies to prevent/ isolate intrusions to Naval networks and explore automated approaches to cyber policy implementation management.

                                            <r2:Text>Robotics Platform Research:
This addresses development of autonomous robotic systems capability to interact with and service other platforms and autonomous vehicles.

Micro-Robotic Servicing - advanced highly dexterous control of extremely lightweight and flexible robotic arms, with specific application to EOD, surveillance and on-orbit servicing robotic communities. This research would extend ongoing research in lightweight robotic arms.

Autonomous Refueling - development of hardware, algorithms, and sensors for hybrid rigid-compliant robotic arms in rapidly changing environments, with specific application to autonomous refueling of USVs, UAVs and UGVs while moving in their environments, advancing beyond the DARPA-sponsored "Rapid Autonomous Fuel Transfer Project".

Low Power Micro-robotics - development of onboard sensors, control electronics, and actuators requiring very low power, with specific application to robotic missions over long durations.

Advanced Manipulators and Tool-Changers - development of innovative robotic manipulators, tool changers, and associated sensors for challenging robotic manipulation tasks, with specific application to EOD and other robotic missions in difficult environments. This research would extend previous research by providing robust end effector technology and tool changing capability. The overall research outcomes will enhance DoD capability in the areas of explosive ordnance disposal, autonomous vehicle refueling, and innovative robotic arm control. Research deliverables will include hardware development in the areas of lightweight robotic arms, end effector tools and tool changers, and low
power electronics and actuators.

Autonomous Vehicles:
- This effort will draw from current research and push the technology development to the next level to provide a leap-ahead capability in long endurance, deployable, autonomous, robotic air vehicle using fuel cell electric propulsion systems for high efficiency, even in small vehicles, which can provide robust airborne sensor capabilities for submarines, UUVs, small naval platforms and small dismounted units.

Undersea Vehicles:
- Funding would be used to acquire a medium sized (12.5 inch diameter) Autonomous Underwater Vehicle as an at sea test platform to advance the state of art of onboard intelligent autonomy. This medium sized UUV is readily amenable to vehicle and sensor testing in the wave pool in the Laboratory for Autonomous Systems Research facility. Subsequently, this would allow at sea testing of State of the art autonomy algorithms (e.g. goal driven autonomy, human cognitive models, Markov decision processes) that allow Navy underwater vehicles to carry out complex mission in denied areas by understanding the environment and adapting mission goals in the context of the commander's intent, with
little or no human operator intervention.

Autonomous Systems Integration:
- To support the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering) (ASD(R&amp;E)) priorities in autonomous systems, and specifically to advance the state of the art in heterogeneous teams of autonomous platforms, (including sensor networks and mobile communication nodes) that can work seamlessly with the warfighter, funding will be applied to small air platforms and militarily relevant unmanned ground vehicles to integrate sensors and advanced power sources, and to develop the autonomy software that allows the individual platforms to work together, as well as to work at a peer-to-peer level with the warfighter. This includes advanced human-robot interaction techniques and information
processing and presentation techniques that reduce the warfighter's cognitive load and allows him to work with a team of autonomous systems.</r2:Text>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (Sep 2011).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare.

This PE supports innovation-based efforts that will provide technology options for future Navy and Marine Corps capabilities.  Efforts focus on advanced Naval materials; biocentric technologies; environmental quality; human factors and organizational design; medical technologies; and Naval training technologies. Within the Naval Transformation Roadmap, this investment maps to future transformational capabilities and the FORCEnet pillar of the Chief of Naval Operations and the Commandant of the Marine Corps vision for the future -- Naval Power 21. 

The ONRG International Science Program mission is to search the globe for emerging scientific research and advanced technologies to enable the Office of Naval Research (ONR) and the NRE to address effectively the current needs of the Fleet/Forces, and investigate and assess revolutionary, high-payoff technologies for future Naval missions and capabilities. Within this Global mission, funding for the Naval Science Advisor Program ensures the Fleet/Force (F/F) helps shape the Department of the Navy (DoN) investment in Science and Technology (S&amp;T), develops teaming relationships to rapidly demonstrate and transition technology, supports development of technology-based capability options for naval forces, and enables warfighting innovations based on technical and conceptual possibilities. Science Advisors provide insight into issues associated with Naval Warfighting Capabilities that influence S&amp;T program decision making. The program develops leaders among civilian scientists and engineers in the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE). Upon completion of their tours, Science Advisors return to the NRE with first hand knowledge of the F/F, warfighting issues, and strategic decision making. The Office of Naval Research (ONR) Science Advisor program enables continuous communication and collaboration between the warfighters, the technical community, and strategic development commands. 

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The CNO's new Maritime Strategy and the Commander Fleet Forces Command complementary plan to revise organization of Maritime Operations Centers (MOC) place high priority on the aforementioned FORCEnet and Sea Power 21 goals. Specific objectives focus on improving small team, platform, task force, and battle group operations by developing advanced human factors technologies for incorporation into operational systems. The goals and payoffs are to enhance human performance effectiveness; improve the timeliness and quality of decision making; develop strategies to mitigate high workload and ambiguity; reduce manning; improve situational awareness and speed of command through a deeper understanding of human capabilities and limitations; and improvement of team decision making in ad-hoc, complex problem solving scenarios. The current specific objectives are:

a) Human Computer Interaction/Visualization: Develop an understanding of the limitations of human perceptual and attentional systems in relation to maximizing user performance when interacting with complex Naval displays. A combination of computational cognitive modeling and psychological studies are employed to determine the capacity limitations on human performance that will undoubtedly have impact in reduced manning requirements, including information-rich weapons platforms. Develop technology for improving human interaction with autonomous systems and for improving virtual reality systems for training purposes.

b) Command Decision Making (CDM): This is a new sub-project that consolidates the previous Collaboration and Knowledge Interoperability (CKI) and Organizational Design and Decision Support Systems sub-projects. The CDM sub-project is focused at the development of dynamic decision support systems that recognize and are responsive to changing mission and task demands, and adapt to present information appropriately.  This focus is explicitly intended to deliver decision support that will be more timely and responsive to rapidly evolving operational needs.  Current thrusts within the sub-project are to: 1) Conduct research on the application of theory to exploit relevant information for effective decision making; 2) Develop models that are operationally context and task sensitive; 3) Study and apply research for the effective management of highly complex &amp; time critical decision making; 4) Develop and demonstrate decision support tools that address the timely management of risk and uncertainty.

c) Social Network Analysis:  Develop computational models, algorithms and technologies for the analysis of conflict and crisis environments and the development of strategies against novel threats, such as terrorism, information warfare, and deception operations.  Develop computational approaches to handling very large, social and socio-cultural information and datasets. Develop computational social science approaches to the study of factionalism in social movements and the novel approaches to crowd calming and peacebuilding for civil affairs operations and disaster response. The following are non-inclusive examples of accomplishments and plans for projects funded in this activity.

                                    <r2:Description>This program supports the development of field medical equipment, diagnostic capabilities and treatments; technologies to improve warfighter safety and to enhance personnel performance under adverse conditions; and systems to prevent occupational injury and disease in hazardous, deployment environments; including regenerative medicine technologies and therapeutic/restorative practices for the treatment of combat-related traumatic injuries. Navy investment in these areas is essential because Navy/USMC mission needs are not adequately addressed by the civilian sector or other Federal agencies. For example, civilian emergency medicine does not address casualty stabilization during long transit times to definitive care. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) focuses on the basic science of disease processes and not applied research related to development. Programs are coordinated with other Services through the Armed Services Biomedical Research Evaluation and Management (ASBREM) Committee, and Joint Technical Coordinating Group (JTCG) process, to prevent duplication of effort.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>ONR has a presence overseas, with an overarching purpose to search the globe for promising, emerging scientific research and development efforts to address the current needs of the Fleet/Forces, and investigate high-payoff technologies for future naval missions and capabilities. To accomplish this task, ONR capitalizes on global innovation and investment to solve U.S. Navy and Marine Corps science and technology (S&amp;T) challenges, builds global S&amp;T awareness to mitigate risk of potential technological surprise, ensures Fleet/Forces capability needs are communicated to the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE), and facilitates delivery of Naval S&amp;T solutions to the Fleet/Forces.  

ONR Applied Research (6.2) requirements prior to FY 2014 were funded in another R-2 activity within this PE and also in PE 0602123N and 0206568N.  Starting in FY 2014, these requirements have been consolidated into this separate R-2 activity to provide greater visibility for ONR international collaboration and research efforts. 

The decrease from FY 2014 to FY 2015 is due to reprioritization of requirements. All efforts will continue to the greatest extent possible.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan, approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (Sep 2011).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare.

The Electromagnetic Systems Applied Research Program addresses technology needs associated with Naval platforms for new capabilities in EO/IR Sensors, Surveillance, Electronic Warfare, Navigation, Solid State Electronics, Vacuum Electronics Power Amplifiers, and Nanoelectronics. The program supports development of technologies to enable capabilities in Missile Defense, Directed Energy, Platform Protection, Time Critical Strike, and Information Distribution. This program directly supports the Department of Defense Joint Warfighter Plan and the Defense Technology Area Plans. Activities and efforts within this Program have attributes that focus on enhancing the affordability of warfighting systems. The program also provides for technology efforts to maintain proactive connectivity and collaboration between Department of the Navy (DON) Science and Technology (S&amp;T) and Joint, Navy, and Marine Corps commands worldwide.  

Also included in this PE is the Netted Emulation of Multi-Element Signatures against Integrated Sensors (NEMESIS) Innovative Naval Prototype (INP).  NEMESIS technology addresses the need to generate the appearance of a realistic naval force to multiple adversarial surveillance and targeting sensors simultaneously. 

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Title>ELECTRONIC WARFARE TECHNOLOGY</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The overarching objective of this activity is to develop technologies that enable the development of affordable, effective and robust Electronic Warfare (EW) systems across the entire electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) that will increase the operational effectiveness and survivability of U.S. Naval units.  Emphasis is placed on passive sensors and active and passive countermeasure (CM) systems that exploit and counter a broad range of electromagnetic threats.  The focus is on maintaining near perfect, real-time knowledge of the enemy; countering the threat of missiles against deployed Naval forces; precision identification and location of threat emitters; and development of technologies that have broad application across multiple disciplines within the EW mission area.  This activity also includes developments to protect these technologies from external interference, and modeling and simulation required to support the development of these technologies.  Also included is technology development in support of the Integrated Distributed Electronic Warfare System (IDEWS) concept.  

The objectives reported in prior years under this R-2 Activity have been consolidated into the current objectives described below.

The current objectives are:

- EW RF Technology: Develop and demonstrate technologies in the Radio Frequency (RF) spectrum (covering frequencies from kilohertz to terahertz) that include developments in detection, signal processing and passive/active techniques for wideband Electronic Attack (EA), Electronic Protection (EP) and the Electronic Support (ES) mission areas. 

- EW EO/IR Technology: Develop and demonstrate technologies in the Electro-Optic and Infrared (EO/IR) spectral domain (extending from the ultraviolet to the far infrared spectral bands) that include advances in multispectral sensors, multiband sources, beam forming/steering, and signal processing and transmission. 

- EW Integrated and Networked Technology: Develop and demonstrate technologies that will enable an increased situational awareness and response across the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) with broad spatial coverage using all available EW assets to provide coordinated, adaptive and networked EW sensing, protection and attack.

- Advanced EW Enabling Technologies (Formerly Titled: Electronic Warfare (EW) Roadmap: Develop classified advanced electronic warfare technology in support of current and predicted capability requirements.

- Electromagnetic Maneuver Warfare Command &amp; Control (EMC2) (FY16-FY20): Enable a battle group to work cooperatively in the EM Spectrum (EMS) to optimize Electronic Warfare (EW), Information Operations (IO), Communications (Comms) and Radar performance.  EMC2 will build upon the Resource Allocation Manager (RAM) that was previously developed for single multifunction systems under the InTop program to optimize spectrum and functional use across a platform and an entire battle group.

Increase from FY 2014 to FY 2015 is due to:
- An increased emphasis on exploratory research into advanced technologies and techniques to counter emerging threats operating in higher bands of the radio frequency spectrum and utilizing extreme spectral and temporal agility. 
- Added new scope to the Backfield project.  This new effort under the EW Backfield project is to develop technologies to disrupt data links to pass information from hostile passive sensors to hostile engagement systems. The following are non-inclusive examples of accomplishments and plans for projects funded in this activity.

Increase from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to:
- Added new INP Electromagnetic Maneuver Warfare Command &amp; Control (EMC2)

                                    <r2:Title>SOLID STATE ELECTRONICS</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The overarching objective of this activity is to develop higher performance components and subsystems for all classes of military RF systems that are based on solid state physics phenomena and are enabled by improved understanding of these phenomena, new circuit design concepts and devices, and improvements in the properties of electronic materials.  An important subclass are the very high frequency (VHF), ultra-high frequency (UHF), microwave (MW), and millimeter wave (MMW) power amplifiers for Navy all-weather radar, surveillance, reconnaissance, electronic attack, communications, and smart weapon systems.  Another subclass are the analog and high speed, mixed signal components that connect the electromagnetic signal environment into and out of digitally realized, specific function systems.  These improved components are based on both silicon (Si) and compound semiconductors (especially the wide bandgap materials and narrow bandgap materials), low and high temperature superconductors, novel nanometer scale structures and materials.  Components addressed by this activity emphasize the MMW and submillimeter wave (SMMW) regions with an increasing emphasis on devices capable of operating in the range from 50 gigahertz (GHz) to 10 terahertz (THz).  The functionality of the technology developed cannot be obtained through Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) as a result of the simultaneous requirements placed on power, frequency, linearity, operational and instantaneous bandwidth, weight, and size.  Effort will involve understanding the properties of engineered semiconductors as they apply to quantum information science and technology. 

This activity also includes Anti-Tamper development of innovative techniques and technologies to deter the reverse engineering and exploitation of our military's critical technology and critical program information in order to impede technology transfer and alteration of system capability and prevent the development of countermeasures to U.S. systems. The current specific objectives are:

a) Solid State Transistors and Devices: Develop solid state transistors and devices for high frequency analog and digital operation.

b) High Efficiency, Highly Linear Amplifiers: Develop high efficiency, highly linear amplifiers for microwave, millimeter-wave, low-noise, and power applications.

c) Superconducting Electronics: Develop components for RF systems utilizing superconducting and other technologies which are designed to deliver software defined, wide band, many simultaneous signal functionality over a wide range of frequencies, in increasingly field-ready packaging and demonstrate the ability of these components to be combined into chains to deliver superior functionality in conventional system contexts, including, but not limited to, SATCOM, Electronic Warfare (EW), signal intelligence (SIGINT), and communications.

d) Control, Reception, Transmission, and Processing of Signals: Develop electronics and photonics technology that provides for the control, reception, transmission and processing of signals.

e) Novel Nanometer Scale Logic/Memory Devices and Related Circuits and Architectures: Develop novel nanometer scale (feature size at or below 10nm) logic/memory devices and related circuits and architectures to deliver ultra-low power, light weight and high performance computational capability for autonomous vehicles and individual warfighters.

f) Anti-Tamper: Develope innovative techniques and technologies to deter the reverse engineering and exploitation of our military's critical technology and critical program information in order to impede technology transfer and alteration of system capability and prevent the development of countermeasures to U.S. systems.

                                    <r2:Title>VACUUM ELECTRONICS POWER AMPLIFIERS</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The overarching objective of this activity is to develop millimeter wave (MMW) and sub-MMW power amplifiers for use in Naval all-weather radar, surveillance, reconnaissance, electronic attack, and communications systems.  The technology developed cannot, for the most part, be obtained through commercial off the shelf (COTS) as a result of the simultaneous requirements placed on power, frequency, bandwidth, weight, and size.  Responding to strong interests from the various user communities, efforts are focused on the development of technologies for high-data-rate communications, electronic warfare and high-power radar applications at MMW and upper-MMW regime.  The emphasis is placed on achieving high power at high frequency in a compact form factor.  Technologies include utilization of spatially distributed electron beams in amplifiers, such as sheet electron beams and multiple-beams, and creation of simulation based design methodologies based on physics-based and geometry driven design codes.

The current specific objectives are:

a) High Power Millimeter and Upper Millimeter Wave Amplifiers: Develop science and technology for high power millimeter and upper millimeter wave amplifiers including high current density diamond cathodes, sheet and multiple electron beam formation and mode suppression techniques in overmoded structures.

b) Lithographic Fabrication Techniques: Develop lithographic fabrication techniques for upper-millimeter wave amplifiers.

c) Accurate and Computationally Effective Device-Specific Multi-Dimensional Models for Electron Beams: Develop accurate and computationally effective device-specific multi-dimensional models for electron beam generation, large-signal and stability analysis to simulate device performance and improve the device characteristics.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (Sep 2011).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare.

This PE provides the unique, fundamental programmatic instrument by which basic research on the natural environment is transformed into technological developments that provide new or enhanced warfare capabilities for the Battlespace Environment (BSE).  The objectives of this program are met through measuring, analyzing, modeling and simulating, and applying environmental factors affecting naval material and operations in the BSE.  This program provides for BSE technological developments that contribute to meeting top joint warfare capabilities established by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, with primary emphasis on Joint Littoral Warfare and Joint Strike Warfare. 

This PE fully supports the Director of Defense Research and Engineering's Science and Technology Strategy and is coordinated with other DoD Components through the Defense Science and Technology Reliance process.  Work in this program is related to and fully coordinated with efforts in accordance with the on-going Reliance joint planning process.  There is close coordination with the US Air Force and US Army under the Reliance program in the BSE categories of Lower Atmosphere, Ocean Environments, Space &amp; Upper Atmosphere, and Terrestrial Environments.  Within the Naval Transformation Roadmap, the investment will contribute toward achieving each of the "key transformational capabilities" required by Sea Strike, Sea Shield, and Sea Basing.  Moreover, environmental information, environmental models, and environmental tactical decision aids that emerge from this investment will form one of the essential components of FORCEnet (which is the architecture for a highly adaptive, human-centric, comprehensive maritime system that operates from seabed to space).  The Navy program includes efforts that focus on, or have attributes that enhance, the affordability of warfighting systems.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides technologies that form the natural environment technical base on which all systems development and advanced technology depend.
Furthermore, this technical base provides developments that may be utilized in the Future Naval Capabilities programs: Organic Mine Countermeasures (MCM) and
Autonomous Operations. This project contains the National Oceanographic Partnership Program (NOPP) (Title II, subtitle E, of Public Law 104-201) and efforts aimed
at understanding and predicting the impacts of underwater sound on marine mammals.

Major efforts of this project are devoted to: gaining real-time knowledge of the BSE, determining the natural environment needs of regional warfare, providing the on-scene commander with the capability to exploit the environment to tactical advantage and, developing atmospheric research related to detection of sea-skimming missiles and strike warfare. This project provides natural environment applied research for all fleet operations and for current or emerging systems. Major developments are routinely transitioned to the Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center and to the Naval Oceanographic Office where they are used to provide timely information about the natural environment for all fleet operations.

Joint Littoral Warfare efforts address issues in undersea, surface, and air battlespace. Efforts include ocean and atmospheric analysis and prediction for real-time description of the operational environment, shallow water acoustics, multiple-influence sensors for undersea surveillance and weapon systems, and influences of the natural environment on MCM and Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) systems. Joint Strike Warfare efforts address issues in air battlespace dominance. Efforts include influences of the natural environment on air operations, electromagnetic (EM)/electro-optic (EO) systems used in intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, targeting, bomb damage assessment, and detection of missile weapon systems. They also include improvements in tactical information management about the BSE.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>Research on the sensitivity of Marine Mammals to sound produced by Naval operations and training will continue. The research in this program supports Navy environmental compliance information needs and facilitates acquiring LOAs from NOAA that enable all Navy training and testing operations, and the development of appropriate state-of-the-art mitigation measure.  The goal of this activity is to support: (1) marine mammal research related to understanding impacts of sound (especially sonar) on marine mammal behavior, hearing, physiology, distributions and ecology; (2) development and testing of new technologies for the detection of marine mammals at sea; The marine mammals research conducted in this PE represents part of a total effort executed in coordination with complementary research performed in PE 0602747N. The emphasis of efforts within PE 0602435N are Marine Mammals and Biology thrusts that include Integrated Ecosystem Research/Sensor and Tag Development, Controlled Exposure Experiments (captive, free-ranging European waters), part of the Monitoring &amp; Detection thrust (DCL algorithm development), and effects of chronic stress (free-ranging animal studies). 

Funding decreases from FY2014 to FY2015 due to completion of studies to examine sensitivity of fish to anthropogenic sound and completion of bioluminescence studies.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The marine atmosphere affects most aspects of naval operations. This activity develops observing technologies, models, Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) systems and Tactical Decision Aids (TDA) that describe the atmospheric environment and its impacts on naval sensors and operations. This activity focuses on uniquely marine aspects of atmospheric science such as air-sea interaction, coupled ocean-atmosphere modeling, EM and EO propagation, coastal meteorology, Tropical Cyclone (TC) prediction, and the use of remote sensing to obtain quantitative observations of atmospheric properties. Aspects of the atmospheric environment of particular interest include near-surface phenomena that affect refractivity, marine boundary layer dynamics that affect clouds, rain, visibility and fog, and processes that control TC structure, track, and intensity. Objectives of this activity are improved NWP systems and TDAs that provide NOWCAST and forecast skill at global, regional, and tactical scales for operational support, sensor and system development, and performance prediction.

Funding increase from FY 2014 to FY 2015 due to increased  research towards developing a predictive capability for the impact of clouds, aerosols, and  moisture gradients in littoral areas on electromagnetic and electro-optic propagation in support of new Naval sensors and weapons as part of Electromagnetic Maneuver Warfare. Also, to increase capability to assimilate non- traditional data sources such as those from autonomous systems and remote sensing for prediction of conditions in denied and degraded areas. Also an improved application for probabilistic prediction of air and sea conditions for ship routing and operational planning that enables increased energy efficiency and operational effectiveness.

Funding decreases from FY 2015 - FY 2016 due to Completion of the development of the ability to accurately detect, monitor and forecast the 3-D areal extent of global airborne dust, volcanic ash, and smoke and improve aerosol optical depth analyses and forecasts through the use of a suite of satellite sensors and the Navy Atmospheric Aerosol Prediction System (NAAPS).</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>This activity is dedicated to the determination of the impact of the natural ocean environment on acoustic wave phenomena in support of naval undersea warfare and underwater force protection operations. This activity studies underwater acoustic propagation, scattering from ocean boundaries, and ambient noise issues that impact the development and employment of acoustic systems. The Littoral Zone (LZ) has been the ocean environment of greatest interest. Aspects of this environment, that greatly impact underwater acoustic systems, are the shallow water included in the Littoral Zone, the consequent closeness and physical significance of the ocean bottom, and the complexities inherent to rapid changes of the ocean structure. The objectives of this program are met through measuring, analyzing, modeling and simulating, and exploiting ocean acoustic factors to gain advantage over potential adversaries using undersea acoustic systems. Results of this activity support acoustic sensor and system development, performance prediction, and tactical decision aids.

Funding decrease from FY 2014 to FY 2015 is due to the completion of efforts associated with acoustic noise shielding and acoustic propagation models.

Other applications utilize knowledge of the interaction of the water column hydrodynamics and the acoustics to predict the undersea transmission characteristics and sources of uncertainty in these statistics. Utilizing knowledge of the ocean surface physics, the physical oceanography program seeks to exploit the combination of remotely sensed data, in-situ data, and adaptively sampled data to optimize predictions of ocean currents and water column structure. These predictions, custom databases, adaptive sampling schemes and data programs serve ASW, Naval Special Warfare (NSW), Sea-Basing, and mine warfare needs.

Funding increase from FY 2014 to FY 2015 due to the implementation and integration of coastal forecast models into the TOPSIDE command and control and mission planning system.  These models will have a data assimilation to utilize the data sets featured in the data fusion section of the software.  The system is of interest to Naval Special Warfare and to Naval Oceanographic Office for their Glider Operations Center.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The DOD Non-Lethal Weapons Program was established by the Office of the Secretary of Defense, which designated the Commandant of the Marine Corps (CMC) as the DoD NLW Executive Agent (EA). The EA exercises centralized responsibility for joint research and development of non-lethal weapons and technology through the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Program (JNLWP).  The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics provides direct oversight of the JNLWP.

The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) reflect science and technology (S&amp;T) investment decisions provided by the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons (NLW) Integrated Product Team, a multi-service flag level corporate board that provides executive oversight and management for the JNLWP for the CMC. This direction is based on the needs and capabilities of the Services, the Special Operations Command, and the Coast Guard, as identified in the DoD's Non-Lethal Weapons Joint Capabilities Based Assessment Document. This coordinated joint S&amp;T development approach addresses mutual capability gaps and assures the best non-lethal technologies, capabilities and equipment are provided to the operating forces while eliminating duplicative service S&amp;T investment.  These applied research initiatives feed non-lethal capabilities which directly support the three pillars of the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review and comprise a fundamental part of DoD's security cooperation efforts to build partner capacity.  The resulting capabilities will facilitate a fully integrated non-lethal competency as a complement to lethal firepower, providing force application options for short-of-lethal scenarios.  

This program funds the applied research, study, assessment, and demonstration of technologies that could provide a non-lethal capability or target effect. Investment areas include applied research related to: non-lethal directed energy weapons (lasers, millimeter wave and high power microwave) for counter-personnel and counter-materiel missions; non-lethal acoustic and optical technologies; advanced non-lethal materials (including materials for vehicle/vessel stopping and counter-facility applications); associated human effects and effectiveness for new non-lethal stimuli; injury potential and effectiveness of directed energy, electric stun, ocular, and acoustic based non-lethal technologies; and developing models of crowd behavior and dynamics. This program transitioned from PE 0602114N, Power Projection Applied Research, by order of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition,
Technology, and Logistics, to this separate PE for Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Applied Research. 

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (Sep 2011).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare.

This PE funds applied research efforts in undersea target detection, classification, localization, tracking, and neutralization.  Technologies being developed within this PE are aimed at enabling Sea Shield, one of the core operational concepts detailed in the Naval Transformational Roadmap.  Associated efforts focus on new Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) operational concepts that promise to improve wide-area surveillance, detection, localization, tracking, and attack capabilities against quiet adversary submarines operating in noisy and cluttered shallow water environments.  Related efforts are aimed at leveraging technologies that will protect the country's current capital investment in surveillance, submarine, surface ship, and air ASW assets. Research focused on understanding the impacts on marine mammals of manmade underwater sound is also conducted in the Program Element.

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This PE funds applied research efforts in undersea target detection, classification, localization, tracking, and neutralization. Technologies being developed within this project are aimed at enabling Sea Shield which is one of the core operational concepts detailed in the Naval Transformational Roadmap. Associated efforts focus on new ASW operational concepts that promise to improve wide-area surveillance, detection, localization, tracking, and attack capabilities against quiet adversary submarines operating in noisy and cluttered shallow water environments. Related efforts are aimed at leveraging technologies that will protect the country's current capital investment in surveillance, submarine, surface ship, and air ASW assets.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Title>ANTI-SUBMARINE WARFARE (ASW) DISTRIBUTED SEARCH</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>ASW Distributed Search focuses on the development of technologies for the non-covert tactical search for undersea targets ranging from hours to weeks, using automated sensor systems deployed around operating areas, including along key transit routes to protect naval/maritime forces, around temporarily fixed sea base regions and naval force operating areas, or around fixed defensive regions and areas of interest, such as key US/Allied ports. "Non-covert" implies availability of airborne assets for sensor deployment (although other means may also be used), and the ability to employ active sonar along with passive and non-acoustic methods. "Search" is conducted in concentrated areas, typically exploiting cues received from surveillance systems. The submarine target must be detected beyond its weapons release range. The objective is to develop rapidly deployable systems employing automated detection and classification capabilities for use in both shallow and deep water operating environments. Distributed Search supports the ASW protected passage Maritime Shield operational constructs. Related efforts include the development of distributed systems employing optimization as well as active acoustic sensing and processing techniques, navy-unique transduction and underwater networking technology. Efforts also include the development of Unmanned Undersea Vehicle-based and affordable off-board deployable sensing systems employing persistent detection concepts and components. These efforts provide an extended reach of organic platform-based systems through the use of new sensor concepts, improved materials for advanced sensors, optimized deployment, employment, and automated operation of distributed sensor fields. The cornerstone of Distributed Search is the development of rapidly deployable, long-endurance active sensors with automated processing suitable for use in a wide variety of operational environments. 

Funding increase from FY 2014 to FY 2015 is due to realignments required to re-prioritize S&amp;T investments resulting in an increase in ASW Initiatives.  

Funding increase from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to 3 new programs funded in this PE: The Virtual Acoustic Sensing Array (VASA),  Forward Deployed Energy &amp; Communications Outpost (FDECO) (FY16-FY19) INP, and the Anti Submarine Warfare Mission Packages (ASW MP) (FY16-FY20).</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Precision Localization focuses on the development and demonstration of technologies which use information from surveillance or search systems to determine an area of uncertainty (AOU) relative to target range, bearing, and depth adequate to handoff to an attack system. Precision Localization employs non-acoustic techniques such as magnetic and optical sensing to highly localize submerged threats. The objective is to increase magnetic sensor range and robustness, enable deployment on Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs), and increase optical sensing search rates. Efforts include the development of non-traditional tracking and advanced magnetic and electric field sensors and processing. These technologies will provide a decreased AOU size thus enabling the effective use of smaller, more versatile torpedoes as well as increased performance gain in detection, targeting, tracking/trailing, and homing via target acquisition and covert prosecution.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>ASW Surveillance focuses on dramatically improving detection, classification, and localization capabilities in large ocean areas relative to the capabilities of legacy ASW surveillance systems. The related technologies support the conduct of covert, wide-area surveillance ranging from one day to six months. The objectives are to develop and demonstrate technologies that provide clandestine indications and warnings in far forward and contested operating areas, and in complex operational environments against all submarine threats, including new threats with unknown target signatures and tactics. Covertness implies use of non-observable platforms and/or deployed automated sensors employing passive sonar, or other non-detectable methods. The surveillance process includes initial detection and classification. Efforts include the development of Unmanned Undersea Vehicle-based and affordable, off-board deployable sensing systems employing a wide variety of surveillance concepts and components. These efforts focus on alternative detection phenomena, vector/tensor sensors, automated acoustic processing, more compact and longer lasting power sources, and high bandwidth, acoustic communications links.

FY 2014 to FY 2015 decrease is due to the INP LD UUV moving from the 6.2 portion of applied research to the 6.3 applied development portion of the program in PE 0603747N and completion of the ATLAS Imaging Sonar and the Modular Undersea Heavyweight Vehicle (MUHV) efforts.  

FY 2015 to FY 2016 increase is due to the development of technology for integration of large UUVs on Navy platforms.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Title>MARINE MAMMALS</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The goal of this activity is to support: (1) marine mammal research related to understanding impacts of underwater sound (especially sonar) on marine mammal behavior, hearing, physiology, distributions and ecology; (2) development and testing of new technologies for the detection of marine mammals at sea; (3) research on the bio-acoustic properties, use of sound for detection of, and effects of sound on fish and lesser marine organisms; and (4) research on optically important biota in the coastal ocean in support of Naval Mine, Undersea, and Special Warfare (including oceanic bioluminescence and the development and testing of bioluminescence sensors).

The marine mammals research conducted in this Program Element (PE) represents part of a total effort executed in coordination with complementary research performed in PE 0602435N.

The emphasis of efforts within PE 0602747N Marine Mammals Activity focuses on the effects on the behavior of marine mammals of manmade sound transmitted underwater which includes Integrated Ecosystem Research, Controlled Exposure Experiments (free-ranging US waters), Marine Mammal Hearing, and part of the Monitoring &amp; Detection thrust (Autonomous platform development; gliders, profilers, etc.), Population-level Consequences of Acoustic Disturbance, effects of chronic stress (captive/modeling studies), and risk assessment modeling.

This Activity has been created specifically to address the work associated with determining and mitigating the effects on the behavior of marine mammals of manmade sound transmitted underwater.

Funding decreases from FY 2014 to FY 2015 due to completion of studies to examine sensitivity of fish to anthropogenic sound and completion of bioluminescence studies.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) address the Applied Research associated with the Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) Program.  The FNC Program represents the requirements-driven, delivery-oriented portion of the Navy Science and Technology (S&amp;T) portfolio.  FNC investments respond to Naval S&amp;T Gaps that are identified by the Navy and Marine Corps after receiving input from Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders. The Enabling Capabilities (ECs) and associated technology product investments of the FNC Program are competitively selected by a 3-star Technology Oversight Group (TOG), chartered by the S&amp;T Corporate Board and representing the requirements, acquisition, research and fleet/forces communities of the Navy and the Marine Corps.  

This was a new PE in FY 2013 that consolidated all Navy 6.2 FNC Program investments into a single Navy 6.2 PE.  Marine Corps FNC 6.2 investments are consolidated in a single Marine Corps 6.2 PE (0602131M). In FY 2011 and FY 2012, Navy 6.2 FNC Program investments were spread across 7 separate 6.2 PEs:  0602114N, 0602123N, 0602235N, 0602236N, 0602271N, 0602747N and 0602782N.  The consolidation in this PE allows all investments to be viewed by FNC Pillar, Enabling Capability (EC) and Technology Product.  It greatly enhances the visibility of the FNC Program by providing an easily navigable overview of all 6.2 FNC investments in a single place.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>FNC investments are typically 3-5 years in duration.  They provide a continuance of basic research by maturing technologies from a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 3 or 4 to a TRL of 6.  All FNC products require BA2 and BA3 funded technology development, which is coordinated to ensure tangible technology products are delivered upon completion of each investment.  Each year the TOG refreshes the FNC Program by approving new ECs and technology products as older ones get delivered.  After transition to an acquisition program, FNC products are further engineered, integrated and, ultimately, delivered to the warfighter. The development and delivery of each FNC product is guided by a Technology Transition Agreement (TTA) that is signed by the requirements and acquisition sponsors, as well as the S&amp;T developer.

This project supports the naval pillars of Capable Manpower, Enterprise and Platform Enablers, Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare, Force Health Protection, Forcenet, Power and Energy, Sea Basing, Sea Shield and Sea Strike.  Each of these pillars is listed as a separate R-2 Activity, as is FNC Management.  Under each R-2 Activity, the BA 6.2 accomplishments and plans for every Enabling Capability (EC) and Technology Product in the FNC Program are listed.  ECs are composed of one or more interrelated technology products, so for clarity, each product is shown under its EC.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>This R-2 Activity includes the Science and Technology (S&amp;T) analyses and studies required to take new Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) Program Enabling Capabilities (ECs) approved by the Technology Oversight Group and produce the detailed technology specifications and performance metrics needed to procure the component level technologies that must be developed and tested in order to deliver technology products to the acquisition community.  This activity includes development and implementation of innovative and dynamically changing technology management business processes required to manage FNC investments supporting the naval capability pillars.  

The FY 2014 FY 2015 increase was due to a Technology Oversight Group decision to delay the start of some ECs which required ONR to align additional FY15 new start preparation funds to accommodate an increased number of ECs expected to receive initial technical funds.

The FY 2015 to FY 2016 decrease was due to the FY15 increase new start preparation funds noted above and a subsequent return in FY16 to normal funding levels.</r2:Description>

In all cases, these technology products support the Department of the Navy FNC Program and are managed at the Office of Naval Research.  All FNC investments in this PE are subjected to management oversight by 2-star chaired Integrated Product Teams (IPTs) that control the naval pillars of Sea Shield, Sea Strike, Sea Basing, Forcenet, Naval Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare, Enterprise and Platform Enablers, Power and Energy, Capable Manpower, and Force Health Protection.  Each EC is aligned to a pillar and each technology product is aligned to an EC.  At the lowest level, each technology product is measured against both technical and financial milestones on a monthly basis.  Annually, each technology product is reviewed in depth for technical performance and development status by the Chief of Naval Research against goals that have been approved by the Navy's 3-star Technology Oversight Group (TOG).  Also annually, each technology product is reviewed by its 2-star chaired pillar IPT for transition planning adequacy and transition commitment level.   Products must meet TOG required transition commitment levels for S&amp;T development to continue.  Transition issues and required adjustments are reported annually by the Chief of Naval Research to the TOG, which establishes investment priorities for the FNC Program.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

All FNC investments in this PE are subjected to management oversight by 2-star chaired Integrated Product Teams (IPTs).  Each EC is aligned to a pillar and each technology product is aligned to an EC.  At the lowest level, each technology product is measured against both technical and financial milestones on a monthly basis.  Annually, each technology product is reviewed in depth for technical performance and development status by the Chief of Naval Research against goals that have been approved by the Navy's 3-star Technology Oversight Group (TOG).  Also annually, each technology product is reviewed by its 2-star chaired pillar IPT for transition planning and adequacy and transition commitment level.   Products must meet TOG required transition commitment levels for S&amp;T development to continue.  Transition issues and required adjustments are reported annually by the Chief of Naval Research to the TOG, which establishes investment priorities for the FNC Program.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (Sep 2011).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare.

This PE provides technologies for Naval Mine Countermeasures (MCM), Expeditionary Warfare, U.S. Naval sea mining, Naval Special Warfare (NSW), and Joint Tri-Service Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD). This program is strongly aligned with the Joint Chiefs of Staff Joint Warfighting Capability Objectives through the development of technologies to achieve military objectives with minimal casualties and collateral damage. Within the Naval Transformation Roadmap, this investment will achieve one of three "key transformational capabilities" required by "Sea Shield" as well as technically enable the Ship to Objective Maneuver (STOM) key transformational capability within "Sea Strike" by focusing on technologies that will provide the Naval Force with the capability to dominate the battlespace, project power from the sea, and support forces ashore with particular emphasis on rapid MCM operations. These efforts concentrate on the development and transition of technologies for the MCM-related and Urban Asymmetric/Expeditionary Warfare Operations (UAEO)-related Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) Enabling Capabilities (ECs). The Mine and Obstacle Detection/Neutralization efforts include technologies for clandestine and overt minefield reconnaissance, organic ship self-protection, organic minehunting and neutralization/breaching. The Urban Asymmetric Operation effort includes critical warfighting functions such as Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR), fires, maneuver, sustainment, etc. The Naval Special Warfare and Explosive Ordnance Disposal technology efforts concentrate on the development of technologies for safe near-shore mine detection, diver mobility and survivability, and ordnance disposal operations.

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Title>MINE/OBSTACLE DETECTION</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>This activity focuses on applied research to enable longer detection ranges and precise mine location with fewer false alarms in a variety of challenging environments. It supports Discovery and Invention (D&amp;I) and MCM-related FNC ECs. Efforts in Synthetic Aperture Sonar (SAS) technologies for longer range detection and classification of mine-like targets and magnetic gradiometer sensing and electro-optic (EO) technology for buried mine identification, and sensor integration onto Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are being addressed. EO sensor research develops algorithms to enable image processing for rapid overt reconnaissance from an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). Other processing, classification and data fusion techniques to reduce operator workload, and a mine burial prediction "expert system" are also being developed. Efforts also support development of MCM Mission Modules for Littoral Combat Ships (LCS).

Funding increase from FY2014 to FY2015 for the Mine Obstacle Detection Area is due to plans to investigate several new and promising technology areas with respect to their applications to this mine reconnaissance.  These efforts will examine feasibility of employing acoustic radiation forces or vibro-acoustography to generate new target discrimination feature sets. These investigative efforts include the audition based object formation and attention models for MCM. In addition applied research into sensor-generic architectures for multi-session minefield mapping with multiple UUVs will initiate along with research into model-based MCM sonar performance estimation.

Funding increase from FY2015 to FY 2016 will support improvements for the Airborne Laser Mine Detection System (ALMDS).</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (Sep 2011).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare.

This program develops and demonstrates advanced technologies, including Electromagnetic (EM) Rail Gun for naval weapon systems.  

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Solid State Laser program funding continues in PE 0602114N for FY 2015. 

The Solid State Laser Technology Quick Reaction Capability (SSL-QRC) program was initiated during FY13 and is planned to complete during FY 2015.  The reduction of funding from FY 2014 to FY 2015 is due to the completion of procurement and design activities during FY 2014.

FY 2015 to FY 2016 increase in funding is due to Solid State Laser Technology Maturation Program (SSL-TM) program entering its fabrication and testing phase.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (Sep 2011). This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps). It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century. The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare. 

This PE addresses advanced technology development associated with providing the capability of Platform and Force Protection for the U.S. Navy. This program supports the development of technologies associated with all naval platforms (surface, subsurface, terrestrial and air) and the protection of those platforms. 

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (Sep 2011).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare. 

Activities and efforts in this Program Element (PE) address technologies critical to enabling the transformation of discrete functions to network centric warfare capabilities, which simultaneously perform Radar, Electronic Warfare (EW), and Communications and Network functions across platforms through multiple, simultaneous and continuous communications/data links.  The Electromagnetic Systems Advanced Technology program addresses Radio Frequency (RF) technology for Surface and Aerospace Surveillance sensors and systems, EW sensors and systems, RF Communication Systems, Multi-Function sensor systems, and Position, Navigation and Timing (PNT) capabilities.  Within the Naval Transformational Roadmap, this investment offers affordable options for the transformational capabilities required by the Sea Shield (Theater Air and Missile Defense), Sea Strike (Persistent Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance), and ForceNet (Communications and Networking) SeaPower 21 Naval Warfighting Pillars. 

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>The overarching objective of this activity is to develop, test, and demonstrate communications, electronic attack (EA), electronic surveillance (ES), electronic warfare (EW), and radar functions.  This activity also includes development of affordable wideband, high performance Advanced Multifunction Radio Frequency (AMRF) apertures.  A portion of this PE is devoted to mid-term technology development in close concert with acquisition programs of record.  The products of these efforts are expected to transition at the end of their schedule into the associated acquisition program of record.

a) Advanced EW Enabling Technologies (Formerly Titled: Electronic Warfare (EW) Roadmap) - Develop classified advanced electronic warfare technology in support of current and predicted capability requirements. 

b) Integrated Topside (InTop): Develop wide-band array and electronic systems to support EW capability and other functions, including but not limited to IO and LOS Comms, for surface combatants with potential application to other platforms.

c) Electromagnetic Maneuver Warfare Command &amp; Control (EMC2) (FY16-FY20)- Enable a battle group to work cooperatively in the EM Spectrum (EMS) to optimize Electronic Warfare (EW), Information Operations (IO), Communications (Comms) and Radar performance.  EMC2 will build upon the Resource Allocation Manager (RAM) that was previously developed for single multifunction systems under the InTop program to optimize spectrum and functional use across a platform and an entire battle group.

The decrease from FY 2014 to FY 2015 is due to funds provided only in FY 2014 to accelerate the development of Integrated Topside (InTop) efforts.

Increase from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to:
- Added new INP Electromagnetic Maneuver Warfare Command &amp; Control (EMC2)

                                    <r2:Description>The overarching objective of the INTOP INP is to develop and demonstrate a set of prototypes that integrate RF functionality (EW, Radar, Communications, Navigation) into a common set of multi-function apertures electronics and software through an architecture that is modular, scalable across all platforms, and open at the RF as well as computer and software level.  The apertures are capable of providing multiple simultaneous, independent beams which can together perform any of the above functions.

The major objectives of this activity are:

a) Submarine SATCOM Array - Develop wide-band SATCOM array capable of supporting EW for submarines.

b) Electronic Warfare (EW)/Information Operations (IO)/Line of Sight (LOS) Communications (Comms) for Surface Combatants - Develop wide-band array to support EW capability and other functions, including but not limited to IO and LOS Comms, for surface combatants with potential application to other platforms.

c) Architecture, Standards and Devices - Develop architecture and standards for wide-band multi-beam, multi-band arrays and below deck systems and the technology and electronic devices needed to make integrated array systems affordable.

d) Surface Combatant Communication Array - Develop wide-band surface combatant communication array capable of supporting other RF functions.

e) Resource Allocation Manager - Develop enterprise common Resource Allocation Manager.

f) Digital Radar - Develop an all digital radar to demonstrate advanced concepts for coherent radar networking and control, which will increase radar coverage and provide new levels of electronic protection (EP), while maximizing radar resources and reducing cost.

g) Low Band Communications, IO and EW - Develop low band technology development and concept studies leading to development of an Advanced Development Model (ADM).

The increase in funding from FY 2014 to FY 2015 is to design and develop the LowRIDR to cover the bands below SEWIP Block III, to build the highly adaptable FLEXDAR Radar.

The decrease between FY 2015 and FY 2016 is representative of the InTop program coming to an end. The funding provided in FY 2016 is to complete all efforts under the InTop program originally scheduled to be completed in FY 2015.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (June 2012). This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps)to include specific Marine Corps objectives defined by the USMC S&amp;T Strategic Plan. It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential S&amp;T efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of United States Naval forces in the 21st century. The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare. It also directly supports Expeditionary Force 21 (EF 21), which is now the Marine Corps' capstone concept that establishes  the vision and goals for USMC S&amp;T over the next 10 years and provides a plan for guiding the design and development of the future force.  One third of the Marine Corps operating forces will be forward  deployed.  These forces will be task-organized into a greater variety of formations, capable of operating from a more diverse array of ships dispersed over wider areas, in order to meet the Combatant Commanders' security cooperation and partner engagement requirements.  In the event of crises, those forces will be able to composite these distributed formations into larger, cohesive naval formations.  This presents both challenges and opportunities for USMC S&amp;T. Expeditionary Force 21 will inform future decisions regarding how the Marine Corps will adjust organizational structure to exploit the value of regionally focused forces.  A fixed geographic orientation will facilitate Marine Commanders and their staffs with more frequent interactions with theater- and component-level organizations, establishing professional bonds and a shared sense of the area's challenges and opportunities.  Expeditionary Force 21 provides the basis for future Navy and Marine Corps capability development to meet the challenges of the 21st Century.  The vision for Expeditionary Force 21 is to provide guidance for how the Marine Corps will be postured, organized, trained, and equipped to fulfill the responsibilities and missions required around the world.  Through Expeditionary Force 21, the Marine Corps intends to operate from the sea and provide the right sized force in the right place, at the right time.

As a key component of naval expeditionary forces, the Marine Corps has unique and technologically stressing requirements because of its expeditionary mission and intensive operational tempo, Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) structure, and conduct of maneuver warfare. Critical requirements in this PE are: Command, Control, Communications, Computers (C4); Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR); maneuver techniques and means; force protection; logistic sustainment; human performance, training and education; and firepower. There are ongoing actions to develop and demonstrate advanced technologies and concepts in operational environments. Joint service efforts are aligned with Defense Technology Objectives and Joint Warfighting Capability Objectives. In addition, there is funding for experimentation in warfighting concepts as well as operational assessment of emerging technologies, to include technical support of operating forces to assess military utility of selected technologies. This PE specifically supports: continued development of enhanced warfighting capabilities through field experiments with Marine operating forces; rapid response to low-, mid-, and high-intensity conflicts as well as methods for countering irregular threats; and expansion of seabasing and naval force packaging capabilities. The investment directly assists in fulfilling the forward presence requirements of Sea Shield and the transformational capabilities prescribed by Sea Strike. The Future Naval Capability (FNC) process is supported and funds are programmed accordingly. This PE is largely focused on demonstration of products and capabilities from the knowledge base and Discovery and Invention (D&amp;I) phases of Naval S&amp;T. As Naval partners, the Navy and Marine Corps S&amp;T Team strive to transition technologies that will implement objectives outlined in the Naval Operations Concept. This PE also funds technical solutions designed to increase Naval force capability, such as the Naval Expeditionary Combat Command. Investments in S&amp;T provide the opportunities for future capabilities and will prevent technological surprise. The PE as a whole will advance the amphibious and expeditionary capabilities for the Combatant Commanders. The Marine Corps Service Campaign Plan (MCSCP) is the lens through which USMC S&amp;T priorities are acted upon in order to support the future development of the Total Force.

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Critical Marine Corps requirements/imperatives addressed in this Project are: Maneuver; Force Protection; Human Performance, Training and Education; Logistics; Command, Control, Communications and Computers (C4); Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) and Firepower.   These are ongoing efforts to develop and demonstrate advanced technologies and system concepts in an operational environment.  Multiple transitions into the Sub-system/Component Advanced Development Phase are planned, as well as fieldable prototyped to reduce risk in System Concept Development and Demonstration.  A tactically effective Mine Countermeasures (MCM) capability is vital to Force Protection and necessary if Maneuver on land is to become a functional component of Naval Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare.  Maneuver, supported by MCM provides synchronization and speed of detection, breaching, clearance, proofing, and marking operations.  This project supports: 1) engaging regional forces in decisive combat on a global basis; 2) responding to all other contingencies and missions in the full spectrum of combat operations (high, middle, and low intensity), in Military Operations in Urban Terrain (MOUT), and in Operations other than War (OOTW); and 3)  warfighting experimentation.  By providing the technologies to enable these capabilities, this project supports the goals and objectives of the Strike, Littoral Warfare and Surveillance Joint Mission Areas.  These are ongoing efforts to develop and demonstrate advanced technologies and system concepts in an operational environment. 

In addition, this project supports the goals and objectives of the Littoral Combat/Power Projection related Enabling Capability (EC) within the Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) portfolio.  The focus of the EC within this PE is technology related to Urban, Asymmetric, and Expeditionary Operations (UAEO).  The UAEO Capability Gap is a science and technology developmental area that is of the highest importance to Marine Corps operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and is one of the highest ranked Capability Gaps prioritized by the Chief of Naval Operations and the Marine Corps Combat Development Command (MCCDC).

                                    <r2:Description>This activity addresses the advanced technology development associated with associated with the Marine Corps participation in the Department of the Navy's (DoN) Science and Technology Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) Program.  The FNC Program represents the requirements-driven, delivery-oriented portion of the DoN Science and Technology (S&amp;T) portfolio.  FNC investments respond to Naval S&amp;T Gaps that are generated by the Navy and Marine Corps after receiving input from Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders.  The funding is aligned with the Naval challenges associated with projecting power despite anti-access and area denial, specifically the Sea Shield, Power and Energy, FORCEnet, and the Naval Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare warfighting capability gaps. The funding profile reflects the alignment of the FNC program investments into Enabling Capabilities (ECs); ECs respond to priority Naval warfighting capability gaps.  Funding for each EC is aligned to a 6.2 or 6.3 Budget Activity (BA) as appropriate.  Concurrent funding for Naval expeditionary warfare capability ECs is also provided from Navy PE0602750N and PE0603673N. Both of the Navy PE's were included in the FY 2013 President's Budget Request and are now the only Navy program elements funding Navy FNC work.  In previous submissions 7 Navy 6.2 PEs and 8 Navy 6.3 PEs funded FNC efforts.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Title>LOGISTICS</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>This activity supports Marine Corps Expeditionary Logistics which is the practical discipline and real world application of the deployment, sustainment, reconstitution, and re-deployment of forces engaged in expeditionary operations.  Expeditionary Logistics replaces mass with assured knowledge and speed, is equally capable ashore or afloat in austere environments, and is fully scalable to meet uncertain requirements.  Expeditionary Logistics logically divides into five pillars:  deployment support, force closure, sustainment, reconstitution/redeployment, and command and control.  These pillars are thoroughly integrated and perpetually related in execution.

The FY 2014 to FY 2015 decrease in the Logistics Thrust Activity is due to a reduction in the scope and size of anti-fouling and non-fouling water purification components to enable enduring performance of small water purification systems.

The FY 2015 to FY 2016 increase in the Logistics Thrust Activity is due to the initiation of the intelligent microgrid systems effort in support of Expeditionary Force-21.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Maneuver Thrust Technology Area focuses on the development, demonstration, and transition of technologies that will increase the warfighting capabilities and effectiveness of current and future Marine Corps maneuver systems.  This Thrust aims at capturing emerging and "leap ahead" technologies in the areas of mobility, materials, propulsion, survivability, durability, signature reduction, modularity, and unmanned systems.  Beginning in FY 2009, Mine Countermeasures (MCM) efforts are funded under the Force Protection activity.  Presently, MCM supports and enhances the maneuver and force protection Marine landing forces with the development of technologies to enable detection, neutralization, breaching, and clearing of mines, Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), and unexploded ordnance from the beach exit to inland objectives.  MAGTF MCM is a functional component of Naval Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare and includes Ship to Objective Maneuver (STOM), Expeditionary Operations from a Sea Base, sustained Operations Ashore, Urban and Asymmetric Operations, and OOTW.

The FY 2014 to FY 2015 decrease in the Maneuver Thrust Activity is due to a reduction in scope of development of a vehicle demonstrator that focuses on enhanced crew survivability.

The FY 2015 to FY 2016 increase in the Maneuver Thrust Activity is due to increased cost associated with development of a vehicle demonstrator that focuses on enhanced crew survivability.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>During FY 2013, due to an internal Marine Corps reorganization (Marine Administrative Message (MARADMIN) 177/13), the Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory (MCWL) was incorporated into the establishment of a broader Futures Directorate (FD).  Therefore, to accurately reflect enhanced synergy within the Deputy Commandant, Combat Development and Integration (DC, CD&amp;I), this project, 2297 (MCWL), was renamed FD.

As part of the DC, CD&amp;I, the mission of the FD is to identify plausible future security environments and develop and explore warfighting concepts and Concepts of Operations (CONOPS).  It does this in order to identify potential future capability gaps and opportunities in order to inform future force development.  FD executes its' mission through three divisions:

Futures Assessment Division's (FAD's) mission is to:  research, examine, and describe plausible future security environments 15 to 30 years into the future.  Knowledge of these future security environments will provide an estimate of possible future threats, challenges, and opportunities, to include:  the rise of possible partners and adversaries, emerging disruptive technologies, and likely sources of conflict.  This work is largely accomplished through research, seminar participation, and coordination with various experts in academia, the intelligence community, and think tanks.

Emergent Force Development's (EFD's) mission is to:  explore select future security environments, emerging warfighting opportunities and challenges in order to guide development of Marine Corps Service concepts and CONOPS.  EFD is responsible for the production of formally published concepts, CONOPS, and options for future force organization and posture that describe how the Marine Corps will operate and fight.

MCWL's mission is to:  explore and analyze Marine Corps service concepts using an integrated combination of research, modeling and simulation, wargaming, live force experimentation, science and technology (S&amp;T) discovery, assessment and integration, and analysis in order to better understand how these concepts expose gaps and create opportunities for future force development.

FD uses the following competencies to accomplish its mission:  

Wargames are conducted to frame emerging warfighting concepts, establish the Joint context for the Marine Corps Force Development System, and establish priorities for development of experimental and non-experimental capabilities.

Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S)-based events allow the FD to examine capabilities with larger scale venues and forces than is practical with live forces at lower cost in terms of funding and in terms of operating force personnel and equipment.  M&amp;S also enables assessment of proposed capabilities before making investments in costly concept demonstrator technologies required in live force experiments. 

Live force experimentation permits exploration of prototype and surrogate technologies, as well as Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs), in order to better refine equipment requirements and to identify Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership, Personnel, and Facilities (DOTMLPF) initiatives needed to produce future capabilities.  Experimentation encompasses inquiries into multiple warfighting areas, including:  Combat Service Support (CSS) and Force Protection; Command, Control, Communications, and Computers (C4); Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR); Fires, Targeting, and Maneuver; and Warfighting Excellence.

Technology investigations, investments, and assessments are conducted to identify, modify where appropriate, and evaluate technological capabilities that support advanced warfighting concepts, and to explore the military utility of promising new commercial or government technologies in support of urgent and compelling needs.  MCWL's S&amp;T Division will investigate the relevance to Expeditionary Force 21 (EF21) capabilities and gaps of advanced technologies according to the following EF21 derived Thrust Areas:  C4ISR, Autonomy and Robotics, Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) Fires, Maneuver, Expeditionary Logistics (to include Expeditionary Energy), Expeditionary Medicine, Cyber and Electronic Warfare (EW), and Force Protection. 

DC, CD&amp;I is designated as the United States Marine Corps (USMC) Advocate for S&amp;T.  As Director FD, the Commanding General (CG) of the MCWL is the DC, CD&amp;I designated Proponent of USMC S&amp;T and serves as the USMC Executive Agent for Marine Corps S&amp;T.

The FD also serves as the Marine Corps' liaison to the Joint Staff for Joint Concept Development and Experimentation; thereby facilitating service-specific experiments as well as participation in joint service experimentation.

The current Futures Directorate Campaign Plan (FDCP) addresses  how the Naval Services must reshape their capabilities in order to meet the concepts and CONOPS called for in the Secretary of the Navy's "Cooperative Strategy 21" and the Marine Corps' follow-on "Expeditionary Force 21 (EF21)" concept.  The FD was created in 2013 to be the organization within the Marine Corps with the unique mission of anticipating future operating environments, determining the demands they will place on our naval services, and informing the capabilities development process on how to operate and maintain the tactical advantage in these environments.  In doing so, the FD makes recommendations to Marine Corps advocates and proponents so that they may more cohesively and logically structure the future Navy and Marine Corps team.  FD will pursue exploration of concepts that support flexible and sustainable MAGTFs employing distributed tactical formations across the range of military operations.  FD will also examine future enhancements in training, organization, and equipment for immediate crisis response.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>This activity includes FD/MCWL CSS and force protection experimentation efforts including assessment of equipment, new TTPs, training programs, and proposed organizational changes associated with enhanced capabilities.  Although this category covers several small (less than $500K per FY) efforts being pursued by FD/MCWL, most programs listed below are considered major (valued at $500K or more) or have near real-time operational impact.  Investments in this activity will be conducted under the Thrust Areas of Expeditionary Logistics, Force Protection, and Autonomy and Robotics.

The FY 2014 decrease in category funding is mainly due to a reduced contribution to the MCWL-Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) legged robot effort, in addition to reductions in assessment of technologies that reduce the demand required to support the MAGTF.  FY 2014 to FY 2015 increases are mainly attributable to an increased emphasis on providing enhanced medical care over a distributed battlefield.  Other increases are due to expanded efforts in unmanned ground logistics delivery technologies.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>This activity encompasses all FD/MCWL C4 related experimentation efforts including assessment of equipment, new TTPs, training programs, and proposed organizational changes associated with enhanced C4 capabilities.  Although this category covers several small (less than $500K per FY) efforts being pursued by FD/MCWL, most programs listed below are considered major (valued at $500K or more) or have near real-time operational impact.  Investments in this activity will be conducted under the Thrust Areas of C4ISR and Cyber/EW.

The FY 2014 increase in category funding is mainly due to expanded development, testing, and assessment of a configurable L-class shipping C2 suite and integrated C2 application enhancements pursued in support of EF21 experimenation.  FY 2014 to FY 2015 decreases also reflect these adjustments, as costs were modified, resulting in a cost savings in FY 2015.  

FY 2015 to FY 2016 increases also support EF21, with development and testing of a configurable C2 suite that enhances operations from aviation platforms and evaluation and experimentation with emerging technologies that support future maritime C2 capabilities.</r2:Description>

The FY 2014 decrease in category funding is mainly due to reduced levels of investment in experimentation technical and managerial support as well as results synthesis and DOTMLPF recommendation support.  These reductions were made available due to capitalizing on untapped resources.  Program investments were then re-reviewed, assessed, and adjusted, resulting in overall level normalization in FY 2015 and beyond.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>This activity includes FD/MCWL efforts in the development and assessment of joint and service warfighting concepts, joint and service missions, analysis of emerging threats and opportunities, and joint capability experimentation.  It also includes FD/MCWL service experimentation in areas that impact multiple warfighting functions.  Although this category covers several small (less than $500K per FY) efforts being pursued by FD/MCWL, most programs listed below are considered major (valued at $500K or more) or have near-real-time operational impact. 

The FY 2014 to FY 2015 increase in category funding is mainly due to increased focus on M&amp;S-based hardware, software, and training capabilities that support planning/experimentation processes, as well as investments to improve Wargaming abilities.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The DOD Non-Lethal Weapons Program was established by the Office of the Secretary of Defense, which designated the Commandant of the Marine Corps (CMC) as the DoD NLW Executive Agent (EA). The EA exercises centralized responsibility for joint research and development of non-lethal weapons and technology through the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Program (JNLWP).  The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics provides direct oversight of the JNLWP.

The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) reflect science and technology (S&amp;T) investment decisions provided by the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons (NLW) Integrated Product Team, a multi-service flag level corporate board that provides executive oversight and management for the JNLWP for the CMC. This direction is based on the needs and capabilities of the Services, the Special Operations Command, and the Coast Guard, as identified in the DoD's Non-Lethal Weapons Joint Capabilities Based Assessment Document. This coordinated joint S&amp;T development approach addresses mutual capability gaps and assures the best non-lethal technologies, capabilities and equipment are provided to the operating forces while eliminating duplicative service S&amp;T investment. These advanced technology development initiatives feed non-lethal capabilities which directly support the three pillars of the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review and comprise a fundamental part of DoD's security cooperation efforts to build partner capacity.  The resulting capabilities will facilitate a fully integrated non-lethal competency as a complement to lethal firepower, providing force application options for short-of-lethal scenarios.
  
This program funds Advanced Technology Development of next-generation non-lethal capabilities and includes performing analysis, technology development efforts, and modeling and simulation necessary to ensure optimum weaponization and use of these capabilities.  Investment areas include research and development of next-generation NLWs such as: non-lethal directed energy weapons (lasers, millimeter wave and high power microwave) for counter-personnel and counter-materiel missions; non-lethal counter-personnel technologies (acoustic, optical, and human electro-muscular disruption technologies), and advanced non-lethal materials (including materials for vehicle/vessel stopping and counter-facility applications). Next-generation non-lethal systems focus on long-range localized non-lethal effects to identified threat individuals (or groups of individuals) and/or their threat weapons systems operating in complicated environments such as urban areas, crowds, buildings, vehicles, vessels, and also in close proximity to high-value civilian facilities. 

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) address the Advanced Technology Development associated with the Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) Program.  The FNC Program represents the requirements-driven, delivery-oriented portion of the Navy's Science and Technology (S&amp;T) portfolio.  FNC investments respond to Naval S&amp;T Gaps that are identified by the Navy and Marine Corps after receiving input from Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders. The Enabling Capabilities (ECs) and associated technology product investments of the FNC Program are competitively selected by a 3-star Technology Oversight Group (TOG), chartered by the S&amp;T Corporate Board and representing the requirements, acquisition, research and fleet/forces communities of the Navy and the Marine Corps.  

This was a new PE in FY 2013 that consolidated all Navy 6.3 FNC Program investments into a single Navy 6.3 PE.  Marine Corps FNC 6.3 investments are consolidated in a single Marine Corps 6.3 PE (0603640M). In FY 2011 and FY 2012, the Navy's 6.3 FNC Program investments were spread across 8 separate 6.3 PEs:  0603114N, 0603123N, 0603235N, 0603236N, 0603271N, 0603279N, 0603747N and 0603782N.  The consolidation in this PE allows all investments to be viewed by FNC Pillar, Enabling Capability (EC) and Technology Product.  It greatly enhances the visibility of the FNC Program by providing an easily navigable overview of all 6.3 FNC investments in a single place.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>FNC investments are typically 3-5 years in duration.  They provide a continuance of basic research by maturing technologies from a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 3 or 4 to a TRL of 6.  All FNC products require BA2 and BA3 funded technology development, which is coordinated to ensure tangible technology products are delivered upon completion of each investment.  Each year the TOG refreshes the FNC Program by approving new ECs and technology products as older ones get delivered.  After transition to an acquisition program, FNC products are further engineered, integrated and ultimately, delivered to the warfighter. The development and delivery of each FNC product is guided by a Technology Transition Agreement (TTA) that is signed by the requirements and acquisition sponsors, as well as the S&amp;T developer.

This project supports the naval pillars of Capable Manpower, Enterprise and Platform Enablers, Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare, Force Health Protection, Forcenet, Power and Energy, Sea Basing, Sea Shield and Sea Strike.  Each of these pillars is listed as a separate R-2 Activity.  Under each R-2 Activity, the BA 6.3 accomplishments and plans for every Enabling Capability (EC) and Technology Product in the FNC Program are listed.  ECs are composed of one or more interrelated technology products, so for clarity, each product is shown under its EC.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>- Acoustic waves may be detected by the particle motions of small parcels of seawater as the longitudinal wave passes a point.   Lasers hold the promise of very finely detecting these particle motions, but this detection has to overcome large amounts of ambient particle motions which are not due to acoustic energy at particular frequencies.  Research experimentation is attempting to overcome these extraneous signals.

- Recent at-sea efforts showed that refracted acoustic energy in the upper ocean leads to regions which are quieter than others.  This phenomenon will be examined further with experiments at higher latitudes.  The physical nature of these quiet regions will be investigated to construct a predictive model.

-  Details of the ocean surface wave field hold clues to signatures of shallow submerged objects.  Fluid dynamical studies of wave-wave and wave-turbulent interactions over larger areas, to connect with remote sensing methods, are being incorporated into parallel algorithmic formulations for rapid processing.   Such modeling holds the promise of reducing clutter for the remote sensing methodologies.</r2:Text>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Manufacturing Technology (ManTech) Program is intended to improve the productivity and responsiveness of the U.S. defense industrial base by funding the development, optimization, and transition of enabling manufacturing technologies to key naval suppliers.  In general, investments transition emerging S&amp;T results to acquisition programs; improve industrial capabilities in production, maintenance, repair and industrial base responsiveness; and advance manufacturing technology to reduce cost, improve performance, and responsiveness.  Currently, the ManTech Program is focused on affordability improvements for specific key acquisition platforms as defined in the Navy ManTech Investment Strategy. Key platforms currently targeted include: VIRGINIA Class Submarine (VCS)/OHIO Replacement Program (ORP); DDG 51 Class Destroyer; CVN 78 Class Carrier; Joint Strike Fighter (JSF); and CH-53K Heavy Lift Helicopter.  ONR ManTech helps these Navy programs achieve their respective affordability goals by transitioning developed manufacturing technology which, when implemented, results in needed cost reduction or cost avoidance.

This Program Element, new as of FY16, is the result of the re-alignment of funds from PE Industrial Preparedness 0708011N and the Manufacturing Science and Technology activity from PE 0603758N.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Currently, the ManTech Program is focused on affordability improvements for specific key acquisition platforms as defined in the Navy ManTech Investment Strategy. Key platforms currently targeted include: VIRGINIA Class Submarine (VCS)/OHIO Replacement Program (ORP); DDG 51 Class Destroyer; CVN 78 Class Carrier; Joint Strike Fighter (JSF); and CH-53K Heavy Lift Helicopter.  ONR ManTech helps these Navy programs achieve their respective affordability goals by transitioning developed manufacturing technology which, when implemented, results in needed cost reduction or cost avoidance.

This Program Element, new as of FY16, is the result of the re-alignment of funds from PE 0708011N and the Manufacturing Science and Technology R2A activity from PE 0603758N.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (Sep 2011).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare.

This program supports the development and demonstration of field medical equipment and technologies to improve warfighter safety and to enhance personnel performance under adverse conditions. Navy investment in these areas is essential because Navy/USMC mission needs are not adequately addressed by the civilian sector or other Federal agencies. These projects support funds future capabilities within the Force Health Protection Program, a Future Naval Capability (FNC) that will provide technology options for the future Navy and Marine Corps by reducing morbidity and mortality when casualties occur.

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Navy investment in these areas is essential because Navy/USMC mission needs are not adequately addressed by the civilian sector or other Federal agencies.  For example, civilian emergency medicine does not address casualty stabilization during long transit times to definitive care.  The NIH focuses on the basic science of disease processes and not product development.  Programs are coordinated with other Services through the Armed Services Biomedical Research Evaluation and Management (ASBREM) Committee to prevent duplication of effort.  This project funds the Force Health Protection program a Future Naval Capability (FNC)that will provide technology options for future Navy and Marine Corps capabilities and supports the "Sea Warrior" component of the Naval Transformation Roadmap, medical logistics aspects of "Sea Basing" and expeditionary force medical support associated with "Sea Strike".</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>NMDP continued to expand participation of transplant centers. Hospitals that participate in both the NMDP Network of treatment centers as well as the NDMS that is managed by the Department of Health and Human Services were invited to join the RITN.  As a result of this targeted recruitment, eight additional transplant centers joined; unfortunately two centers were lost to attrition resulting in a total composition of: 47 transplant centers, 6 donor centers, and 7 cord blood banks.

During this period, the C. W. Bill Young Marrow Donor Recruitment and Research Program, BMRD, NMRC directly contributed to donor recruitment and transplantation and science and technology developments including over 5,000 transplants coordinated by the NMDP of which over 500 were provided by DoD volunteers through the NMRC / Georgetown part of the program.  

The NMDP added over 700,000 volunteer donors to the national registry, of which over 40,000 were from DoD volunteers from the NMRC / Georgetown.  

Probe Testing Progress:
The laboratory tested 17,885 new volunteers for HLA-A,-B; 17,885 for HLA-C, and 20,805 for HLA-DRB1. In the first three months the laboratory has typed 18,615 donors for HLA-DQB1 and is currently working on providing HLADPB1 typing for those donors. They are currently working on establishing and validating robust assays for DQB1 and DPB1 because of recent studies suggesting that these loci may impact outcome of transplantation; DQB1 when a mismatched donor is selected and DPB1 when a donor with a T cell epitope mismatch is selected.

Sequencing Progress Report:
Through this grant they continue to improve the robotics and reagents to test samples flow by typing large numbers of donors at recruitment. The PI and team are currently typing 1000 volunteers of European ancestry for the registry using a one step SBT typing method. They previously sequenced 196 loci from patients and potentially matched family members.</r2:Text>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (Sep 2011).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare.

All Navy advanced technology development in undersea target detection, classification, localization, tracking and neutralization is funded through this PE.  The related technologies being developed are aimed at enabling Sea Shield, one of the three core operational concepts detailed in the Naval Transformational Roadmap.  Associated efforts focus on new Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) operational concepts that promise to improve wide-area surveillance, detection, localization, tracking and attack capabilities against quiet adversary submarines operating in noisy and cluttered shallow water environments.  The focus is on leveraging technologies that will protect the country's current capital investment in surveillance, submarine, surface ship and air ASW assets.

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Technologies being developed within this project are aimed at enabling Sea Shield, one of the three core operational concepts detailed in the Naval Transformational Roadmap. Associated efforts focus on new ASW operational concepts that promise to improve wide-area surveillance, detection, localization, tracking and attack capabilities against quiet adversary submarines operating in noisy and cluttered shallow water environments. Related efforts are aimed at leveraging technologies that will protect the country's current capital investment in surveillance, submarine, surface ship and air ASW assets.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Improve target detection, localization, and tracking and increase attack capabilities by providing the following capabilities:
- Localization of 85% or more of enemy submarines in far forward or contested waters with false locations of less than 10% of total calls.
- Effective cueing of an attack from a distance of up to 200nm.
- Improvement of the Lightweight Torpedo (Mk 54). Specific improvements are classified.
- Extending deep water active distributed system lifetime to a few months with a probability of detection (Pd) of 90% within 4 hours (field configuration) or 90% per crossing (barrier configuration), with a False Alarm Rate (FAR) of no more than 4/day.
- Delivery from a Vertical Takeoff Unmanned Air Vehicle (VTUAV) and/or a long-range, high-speed Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) a compact undersea weapon capable of a high Probability of Kill (PK) given precise target localization.
- Detection and localization performance with a single-line vector sensor array nominally equivalent or superior to that of two coherently processed TB-29A arrays. Acquisition costs to be competitive with the cost of a current TB-29A and at least 30% less than the cost of two arrays. Sensor and telemetry packaging will be adequate to achieve neutral buoyancy in an existing TB-29A form factor with array power efficiency greater than 75%. Array handling will be compatible with the existing TB-29 handling system.

Increase sensor to shooter performance and the effective lifetime of distributed ASW search systems by:
- Achieving a drifting active distributed system lifetime of at least two days in areas of tactical significance while maintaining required system performance with a minimum number of sensor nodes.
- Maintaining an effective lifetime of a month for mobile active distributed systems when subjected to the action of eddies from a major ocean current.
- Predicting reseed 6 hours before performance degrades.
- Holding the Area of Uncertainty (AOU) to no larger than 10 nm2 for an hour after initial detection through the control of the coherent sources.

Through a combination of better Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) command-level training and improved operator training provide the following:
- Improve the ability of active sonar operators to detect targets and reject potential false alarms compared to current simulation based training.
- Increase Pd by 50%.
- Provide a decrease in FAR by a factor of two.
- Provide a reduction in the probability of a hit on a High Value Unit (HVU) by a factor of two.
- Improve the ability of the ASW Commander to position assets to increase coverage, reduce active system interference and deal effectively with competing missions.
- Reduce training cost by greater than 80% and increase the frequency of training opportunities by greater than 600% relative to live training.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) addresses the development of recent technology breakthroughs to meet current operational needs from a subscale proof-of-principle into a full-scale prototype for warfighter experimentation during laboratory and operational demonstrations, Fleet Battle Experiments (FBE), Limited Objective Experiments (LOEs) and sea trial exercises.  The key aspects of this PE are divided into four areas: (1) SwampWorks develops and demonstrates newly invented or recently discovered technologies that address emergent and enduring operational problems in an accelerated timeframe; (2) Naval Warfare Experimentation develops rapid prototypes and provides them to the warfighter for experimentation during laboratory and operational demonstrations; (3) TechSolutions develops rapid response science and technology prototypes addressing Fleet/Force needs identified by Sailors and Marines at the deckplate level; (4) Operations Analysis provides the Navy and Marine Corps the means to identify capability needs that can be addressed with science and technology solutions, and (5) Manufacturing Technology Science and Technology (S&amp;T) to accelerate recently discovered manufacturing technologies to reduce the acquisition and ownership costs of current and future platforms.

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE. 

Although the PE shows an overall decrease in FY16 from the FY15 PRESBUD due to higher Naval priorities, there is an increase in FY2016 to accommodate increased Naval Warfare Experimentation to  support emergent opportunities to meet fleet needs with potential technology solutions and SwampWorks due to the increased research and fleet interest in the areas of Autonomy, Electromagnetic Warfare and the exploitation of unmanned systems.  Also, in Manufacturing Technology the funds in FY 2016 ($7.495M) and beyond have moved to new PE 0603680N Manufacturing Technology Program.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (Sep 2011) and investment directions as defined by Department of Defense (DoD) Directive 5160.62 "Single Manager Responsibility for Military Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technology and Training (EODT&amp;T)" and approved by the DoD Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Program Board (Sep 2012).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance, input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps). The strategy is also based on the unique needs and capabilities identified by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) and the DoD EOD Program Board. It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval and Joint EOD forces in the 21st century.  The strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions, DoD EOD S&amp;T with Joint EOD missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare.

This PE primarily develops and demonstrates prototype Mine Countermeasures (MCM), Expeditionary Warfare and Joint EOD system components that support capabilities enabling Naval and Joint EOD Forces to influence operations ashore.  Adversarial nations have the capability to procure, stockpile and rapidly deploy all types of naval mines, including new generation mines having sophisticated performance characteristics, throughout the littorals. They also have the capability to develop or modify explosive devices such as mines and unexploded ordnance to construct Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) for the purpose of targeting Joint Forces.  Real world operations have demonstrated the requirement to quickly counter the mine threat.  Current operations have also demonstrated the requirement to quickly counter the threat from explosive hazards and IEDs during DoD operations.  Advanced technologies must rapidly detect and neutralize all mine types, from deep water to the inland objective.  Advanced technologies must enable Joint EOD forces to detect/locate, gain access, diagnose, render safe, neutralize, recover, exploit and dispose of a broad spectrum of explosive hazards including unexploded ordnance and IEDs.  This program supports the advanced development and integration of sensors, processing, warheads, and delivery vehicles to demonstrate improved Naval Warfare capabilities. It supports the advanced development and integration of sensors and tools for standoff capabilities such as detection and location of IEDs (particularly in dismounted operations), dismounted diagnosis of buried munitions and other explosive hazards, precision render safe and neutralization of surface munitions and other explosive hazards, and enhanced access to IEDs.  It supports the MCM-related FNC Enabling Capabilities (ECs).  Within the Naval Transformation Roadmap, this investment will achieve one of three key transformational capabilities required by Sea Shield as well as technically enable the Ship To Objective Maneuver (STOM) key transformational capability within Sea Strike.

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>The overall metrics of this advanced technology program are the development of technologies supporting the Mine and Expeditionary Warfare challenges of reducing the MCM tactical timeline from months to days and eliminating the need for Navy divers and manned equipment to enter minefields.  Another important metric is the scheduled transition of 6.3 advanced technology projects from the FNCs program into Navy and Marine Corps acquisition programs at agreed upon Technology Readiness Levels.  Technology-specific metrics include: Mine warfare data fusion capabilities yielding a 10%-25% reduction in time and risk to mine hunting activities; Mine hunting sensors - Probability of Detection = 95%, Probability of Identification of Proud Mines = 90%, Probability of Classification of Buried Mines = 80%; Unmanned Systems for MCM sized for inclusion in the Littoral Combat Ship Mine Warfare Mission Package; MCM sensors sized, packaged and capable of 12 hour missions with a search rate greater than .05 square nautical mines per hour; Mine sweeping: Modular magnetic and acoustic influence sweeping systems packaged for deployment from Unmanned Surface Vehicles; Minesweeping single sortie coverage > 9.4 square nautical miles at 20 nautical miles per hour during a 4 hour mission up to Sea State 3; Surface-laid mine and obstacle breaching capability > 90% in the Beach Zone (BZ) using unitary warheads, and > 80% in the Surf Zone (SZ).</r2:PerformanceMetrics>
