This will be accomplished by supporting ongoing efforts that provide the most realistic operating environment available to perform technology gap and cost reduction analysis of space, missile defense, and high altitude systems.  Realistic operating environments will be available to determine the ability of the specific technologies to fill capability gaps in terms of utility to the warfighter.  Support of technology demonstrations, Analysis and Demonstration Tools/Test Beds for evolving space superiority and operationally responsive space concepts will address emerging needs and continue to be expanded to ensure that advanced technology development can adequately enhance address space, missile defense and high altitude. The FWC will continue to update EADSIM to provide the required high fidelity synthetic operating environment to provide the capability to perform system and cost benefit analysis.</r2:Text>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program supports the overall Air and Missile Defense (AMD) architecture and provides a robust intercept capability against rocket, artillery, and mortar (RAM) and residual Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) threats for deployed forces supporting stability and counterinsurgency operations.  Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment II -Intercept (IFPC2) will integrate with current Counter-Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar (C-RAM), and RAM Warn Capability.  When implemented, IFPC2 will provide 360 degree protection against RAM and residual UAS threats simultaneously attacking from multiple azimuths.  Anticipated system will consist of a kinetic (missile or gun) and/or directed energy Interceptor, Fire Control Sensor, Technical Fire Control, Command Vehicle and control interfaces between major components.  The specific system concept will be determined by an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) to be completed in FY 2012.  Tactical Command and Control is an external interface to the IFPC2 program to be provided by supported forces.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Tactical Data Terminals (Space), a Program Office assigned to the PEO for Intelligence, Electronic Warfare, and Sensors (PEO IEW&amp;S)  is developing a mobile, ground-based, tactically-centric space information superiority capability to meet Joint Requirements and validated Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) capability gaps.  The system is a forward-deployed platform to generate, receive, monitor, analyze and store satellite communications in direct support of the ground force Commander.  The system is centered on a Modular and Open System Approach (MOSA) that will enhance (less time, less cost) future upgrades to meet emerging space capabilities.  System mobility (using government-off-the-shelf (GOTS) tactical vehicles such as the potential Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) or the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP)) will enable the system to move to positions of geographical advantage to establish and maintain assured space data access and information superiority in support of Brigade tactical operations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Product entered the Technology Development (TD) Phase in 3QFY09 following a successful Material Development Decision and Milestone A.  The Program Office leveraged a Small Business Set Aside Competition to award two competitive prototype contracts.  The Program is managing the competitive prototype contracts and leveraging Army and Other Government Agency Science &amp; Technology efforts to retire maximum risk (cost, schedule, and performance) prior to competing and awarding a contract in support of the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase.  

In FY12, the Product Office will complete Developmental Testing for the TD Phase (proving Technology is at TRL 6) and finalize documentation and entry criteria to support a subsequent Milestone B decision.  Intent of the Acquisition Strategy is to capitalize on Open competition for the EMD contract with a goal of maximizing fixed price incentive firm (FPIF) contracts for post Milestone B efforts and firm-fixed-pricing (FFP) for production.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project 990 funds United States Army Space and Missile Command/Army Strategic Command (USASMDC/ARSTRAT) efforts to develop, analyze and mature warfighting concepts, and conduct warfighting experiments for space and high altitude capabilities.  The program also funds development and integration of new data sources and data services into the Joint Friendly Force Tracking Mission Management Center.  The Mission Management Center (MMC) injects real-time Joint Friendly Force Tracking (J-FFT) information into the Common Operating Picture for Combatant Commands (COCOMs), Joint Task Forces (JTFs) and Coalition partners.  USASMDC/ARSTRAT is the proponent for space / high altitude capabilities and is responsible for determining and integrating Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership and Education, Personnel and Facilities (DOTMLPF) for the Army. 

USSTRATCOM, in accordance with CJCSI 3910.01 (reference V.4.) is designated one of three coordinating agencies for J-FFT within DOD.  CJCSI 3910.01 directs eight specified tasks to USSTRATCOM.  USSTRATCOM SI 534-5 (reference V.6.) and annually published USSTRATCOM operations orders have designated USASMDC/ARSTRAT as the lead USSTRATCOM component command for J-FFT.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project enables component development of new counter explosive hazard systems that focus on detecting, marking, and neutralizing mines and Improvised Explosive Devices (IED).  These capabilities will enhance the effectiveness of the Route Clearance Platoon within the Engineer Company, the Brigade Combat Team as well as other related Army missions.  The Autonomous Mine Detection System (AMDS) provides stand-off detection for the dismounted soldier via the development of three payloads for an existing small robotic platform.  The payloads are for surface laid and buried threat detection and marking, explosive hazards trace detection and marking, and neutralization.  In FY2011, AMDS will continue tchnology development with component prototypes of each of the three payloads being developed.  The Husky Mounted Detection System (HMDS) provides state of the art detection of surface laid and shallow buried explosive hazards, deep buried explosive hazard detection, and semi-autonomous operation in support of route clearance missions.  HMDS is a mission equipment package mounted on HUSKY route clearance vehicles.

In FY2012, AMDS will continue technology development efforts with component prototypes of each of the three payloads being delivered for evaluation.  These efforts will lead to a pre-Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) in process review in 4QFY12 in preparation for EMD to begin in FY2013.
 
The Forward Reconnaissance and Explosive Hazard Detection (FREHD) system will provide a suite of modular payloads to enhance route clearance capabilities.  In FY2013, FREHD system will begin transition of Advanced Technology Objective efforts from the Science and Technology community and conduct program initiation activities to a material development decision in 2QFY2013.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project supports Screening Obscuration Module (SOM), and Projected and Generated Obscuration Capability (PGOC), devices to improve survivability of the combined armed forces, support extended range capability, complement combined weapon systems, and enhance force effectiveness and combat power. SOM is a small smoke generator that degrades the visual through near infrared portion of the Electro-Magnetic Spectrum. PGOC will integrate an obscuration generator and grenade launcher(s) onto an unmanned platform to provide the capability of obscuring the Visual/IR spectrum.

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Acquisition Strategy: Development of PGOC and SOM systems to include design, construction, modeling and testing of prototypes. 

PGOC acquisition strategy follows an evolutionary strategy with two increments.  The first increment will integrate an obscuration generator and grenade launcher(s) onto an unmanned platform to provide the capability of obscuring the Visual/IR spectrum.  The second increment will add the capability of obscuring the Millimeter Wave (MMW) spectrum to the obscuration generator. Award of two contracts for Competetive prototyping during TD phase. Development of two prototype designs, integration of grande launchers, robotic control packages onto already developed obscuration platforms (M56E1 and M56E2). Development of a government designed advanced grenade launcher.  

SOM acquisition strategy is to develop a small smoke generator that degrades the visual through near infrared portion of the Electro-Magnetic Spectrum. SOM program will focus on replacing current smoke pots to provide the Joint Land Forces with a medium area screening obscuration device.  The initial increment, Increment 1, will focus on developing a SOM system capable of obscuring the Visual through Near IR wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum.  Future SOM Increments 2 and 3 will incorporate bi-spectral and multi-spectral effects. The SOM has the capability to quickly produce (less than 15 seconds) medium duration (20 minutes), medium area (11 meters wide x 20 meters length x 5.25 meters height) screening obscuration effects, screening an area equivalent to three times the size of a large combat vehicle.  The individual Soldier or team will employ the SOM devices on open and complex terrain; excluding enclosed areas.  SOM will be deployed to accomplish the following mission types:  avoid observation, defense of a battle position, and assault position.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Direct Fire Advanced Technology (DFAT) Program Element (PE) encompasses a comprehensive program to develop, rapidly transition to production, and field advanced tank, medium and small caliber munitions. These programs will ensure continued battlefield overmatch and lethality of U.S. maneuver forces despite worldwide development and proliferation of enhanced armored vehicle protection technologies. To achieve this, DFAT will identify and develop promising technologies through competitive development and streamlined acquisition procedures. All ammunition development funds within this PE are managed to facilitate transitions between phases, avoid administrative delays, and focus resources on the most promising areas. 

The M829E4 cartridge is an unguided, direct fire, platform-delivered Line of Sight (LOS) munition that will provide fast response lethality to rapidly destroy threat targets with Explosive Reactive Armor (ERA) and Active Protection Systems (APS) in the close fight from 0-2km (T) and to 0-4km (O). The M829E4 will be compatible with the 120mm Current Force Abrams Main Battle Tank. FY 2011 M829E4 AKE Cartridge funding supports the completion of Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase I and Phase II initiation of the M829E4. FY 2012 funding supports design finalization, design verification, testing and fabrication of Design, Test and Evaluation hardware and beginning of testing. FY 2013 will feature building of test hardware for final qualification testing.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The M829E4 cartridge is a platform-delivered Line of Sight (LOS) munition that will provide capability for the current force Heavy Brigade Combat Team's (HBCT) commander to conduct decisive operations and destroy current and future enemy Main Battle Tanks (MBTs) equipped with Explosive Reactive Armor (ERA) and Active Protection Systems (APS) at ranges from 0-2km (T) and 0-4km (O). The M829E4 will provide the capability to destroy and or neutralize the adversary armor and capabilities. After a competitive shoot off in FY 2011 ATK was awarded the option to continue EMD Phase II until its conclusion in FY 2014. FY 2012 supports the continuation of Phase II of the M829E4 cartridge Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD). FY 2013 funding supports design finalization, design verification, fabrication and testing of Design, Test and Evaluation hardware. The full performance of the M829E4 is obtained with an Ammuntion Data Link breech modification firing from the Abrams equipped tank.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The M829E4, Advanced Kinetic Energy cartridge is at Technology Readiness Level 6 (TRL6). The Milestone B Decision was obtained in 4Q FY 2009, and the program entered Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) in FY 2010. EMD consists of two phases; the Phase I contract was awarded in 2Q FY 2010 and the Phase II contract was awarded in 3Q FY 2011. During Phase I (15 months), the Government awarded two separate Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contracts culminating in a demonstration test and competitive source selection to down select to one contractor for the 31 month Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF) Phase II. The down select was based on the demonstrated performance of the cartridge design, proposed systems engineering and management approach for Phase II, and the total program cost estimate for each contractor at the time of the demonstration test. ATK was awarded the option to continue EMD Phase II until its conclusion in FY 2014. Upon successful completion of Milestone C, a Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) option will be awarded to ATK in 3Q FY 2014. The contract will also contain options for two additional production years. All production options are Firm Fixed Price (FFP).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

FY2013:  Project C51 - Stryker Modernization, Program eliminated</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) supports the development of the Stryker Family of vehicles (FOV) in three separate projects: 
 
The Interim Amored Vehicle Project (C03) supports the use of the common platform/common chassis design reducing requirements for repair parts and logistics support in the area of operations.  Funding in this project will continue to address Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO), survivability, Operational Needs Statements (ONS) issues, and integrating Targeting Under Armor (TUA) for the Stryker Fire Support Vehicle (FSV).

Stryker Modernization Project (C51) will enable the Stryker FOV (to include DVH) to host the future network without further degrading vehicle performance.  The upgrade will increase available electrical power while ensuring adequate mechanical power, weight margin, and cooling.  Combined with a digital backbone, this will ensure the FOV can host the future network while retaining its protection and mobility.

Stryker Double V Hull (DVH) Project (VT2) was established in FY 10.  The DVH design is in response to a G-3 directed requirement for survivability enhancements on Stryker vehicles used in Operation Enduring Freedom to provide a total integrated solution of increased protection and survivability against Improvised Explosive Devices (IED).  DVH will be fielded as Theater Provided Equipment (TPE) and support deployments of Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (SBCT's) to Afghanistan.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Interim Armored Vehicle (IAV) Family Project (C03) supports the development of the Stryker Family of vehicles (FOV).  A critical need exists to improve the deployability and operational effectiveness of rapid response/early entry forces.  The Stryker equipped Brigade Combat Team (BCT) is capable of deployment to anywhere on the globe in a combat ready configuration.  Immediate response by a lethal, versatile, tactically agile joint force capable of operational maneuver once in the Area of Operations has been essential in fulfilling the warfighting needs of the U. S. Army.  The Stryker family includes: Infantry Carrier Vehicle (ICV), Reconnaissance Vehicle (RV), Mobile Gun System (MGS), Mortar Carrier (MC), Commander's Vehicle (CV), Fire Support Vehicle (FSV), Engineer Squad Vehicle (ESV), Medical Evacuation Vehicle (MEV), Anti-Tank Guided Missile Vehicle (ATGM), and Nuclear/Biological/Chemical Reconnaissance Vehicle (NBCRV).  The use of the common platform/common chassis design reduces requirements for repair parts and logistics support in the area of operations.  Funding in this project will continue to address Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO), survivability, Operational Needs Statements (ONS) issues, and integration of Targeting Under Armor (TUA)on the Stryker FSV.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides for the advanced component development and prototyping of joint service food and combat feeding equipment designed to reduce the logistics burden and Operation and Support (O&amp;S) costs of subsistence support to service personnel.  Project supports development of rations and rapidly deployable field food service equipment.  Project conducts demonstration and validation of improved subsistence and subsistence support items used to enhance soldier effectiveness and quality of life in all four Services, as part of an integrated Department of Defense (DoD) Food Research, Development, Test, Evaluation and Engineering Program.  The Program is reviewed and validated twice annually by the DoD Combat Feeding Research and Engineering Board (CFREB) as part of the Joint Service Food Program.  This project develops critical enablers that support the Joint Future Force Capabilities and the Joint expeditionary mindset by maintaining readiness through fielding and integrating new equipment.  This equipment enhances the field soldier's well-being and provides the soldier with usable equipment, in addition to reducing sustainment requirements, related Combat Support/Combat Service Support (CS/CSS) demands on lift, combat zone footprint, and costs for logistical support.

This PE/Project supports Field Feeding Programs for all the services.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Packaging materials will be down-selected then integrated with new formulations of high demand acidic condiments. The effort involves reformulating and optimizing pH of acidic condiments for acceptability, then integrating those new formulations with the down-selected packaging material for evaluation of package integrity, product quality, and shelf life. Producibility testing will then be initiated for commercial scale-up of the reformulated high acid condiments in the new packaging materials. Technical data and prototypes will transition to individual &amp; group ration improvement projects for field testing.</r2:Text>

(b)  REF- Resource Management Capabilities Needs equipment and funding execution details will be provided in the Secretary of Army report to the Congressional Defense Committees in March and October of each year (per House Appropriations Committee (HAC)Report #108-553, DoD Appropriations Bill 2005, June 18, 2004, page 134.)</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The REF was established in 2003 as a unique, singular organization designed to address an Army-wide, systemic deficiency in providing immediate technology solutions. The REF adds value for the Army by rapidly providing urgent capabilities to U.S. Army Forces employed globally by harnessing technologies in order to improve operational effectiveness. The REF canvasses the military, industry, academia and science communities for readily available commercial and government solutions that do not currently exist in the Army inventory, and then transitions successes to Army Materiel Command (AMC) for sustainment and in appropriate cases back to the Army Acquisition community as a Program of Record, for future life-cycle management. Additionally, the REF facilitates the early deployment of Army-managed solutions to meet emerging requirements.

The REF bridges the gap between the lengthy acquisition process and immediate equipping needs.  We pursue tangible solutions that can be equipped within a goal of 90 days. REF focuses on finding effective game-changing capabilities to increase Soldier effectiveness, protection and lethality in any operational environment. The REF process provides the mechanism to respond rapidly to an adaptive enemy who changes in days and months, not years. The REF Teams deployed in theater work with Combatant Commanders (COCOMs) to understand their urgent needs, for which the REF acquisition capability may identify, procure and deliver solutions to the deployed units. A key element of this process is fiscal flexibility, permitting the REF to allocate funds against emerging threats and requirements in the year of fiscal execution.  

The REF works directly with Operational Commanders at Brigade and below to find solutions to identified equipping requirements. These solutions may result in procurement of new or existing military/commercial materiel equipment, or accelerated development of a Future Force materiel solution for insertion into the current force now.  The REF key tasks are:
- Be responsive to tactical unit commanders engage Brigade Combat Team/Brigade Commanders (BCT/BDE CDRs)early and often
- Bridge specific Operational Needs Statement/Joint Urgent Operational Needs Statement (ONS/JUONS)Gaps meet urgent needs
- In coordination with Asymmetric Warfare Group (AWG)develop materiel solutions to counter Asymmetric Threats
- Ensure adequate training and sustainment are provided with every capability
- Cultivate and rapidly insert emerging technologies into Soldiers hands
- Conduct operational assessments to provide useful operator feedback to the Army 
- Transition effective projects through Capability Development for Rapid Transition (CDRT) to support long-term sustainment
- Be aggressive and push the acquisition envelope, but operate within the law
- Integrate with existing Army organizations and systems to enable them to recognize and solve problems for tactical units 

The REF Integrated Priority List (RIPL) (Top 11 Priorities driven by input from Deployed Units) drives all REF efforts. The priorities with metrics are shown below:
1.Dismounted Improvised Explosive Device (IED) Defeat Measures (Requirements 34; Projects 57)
2.Dismounted Support Operations (Requirements 36; Projects 44)
3.Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) Shortfalls in Environmentally Inhospitable Operational Environments(OEs) (high wind/high altitude, sewers, tunnels, etc.) (Requirements 93; Projects 97)
4.Small Combat Outpost (COP)/Patrol Base Force Protection and Village Support Operations (Requirements 82; Projects 97)
5.Dismounted Blue Force Tracking and Mission Command (Requirements 18; Projects 20)
6.Counter Ambush (precision (Small Arms Fire (SAF) and Rocket Propelled Grenade (RPG) (Requirements 33; Projects 36)
7.Non-Lethal Messaging (Requirements 9; Projects 9)
8.Advanced Escalation of Force Equipment (Requirements 22; Projects 19)
9.Entry control point operations and Vehicle Search Operations (Requirements 13; Projects 19)
10.Route Clearance Support for non Combined Joint Task Force (CJTF) Paladin/Engineer Units (Requirements 1; Projects 1)
11.Other (Requirements 129; Projects 79) Additional areas of focus in this priority include reducing energy dependence in small tactical units and understanding the causes of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)
The REF FY13 RDT&amp;E Request of $5.994 million (base) $19.860 million (OCO) integrates, coordinates, deploys and provides urgent material capabilities to deployed and pre-deploying units in support of Joint and Army Forces Commanders to enhance the combat effectiveness of the operating force and enable the defeat of asymmetric threats. The emphasis for RDT&amp;E funding is on Testing and Evaluation that supports projects in the areas of Force Protection, IED Detection and Defeat, enhanced ISR capabilities, Tactical Command, Control and Communication tools. 
 
RDT&amp;E funding also provides the REF the flexibility to invest in near-term, innovative solutions. RDT&amp;E funds are necessary in the vast majority of all REF projects. REF uses RDT&amp;E funds to work with industry and Other Governmental Agencies (OGAs) in order to further develop high (>6) Technology Readiness Level (TRL) or advanced technologies that often only need small amounts of funding in order to help them achieve a maturity level that is suitable to solve a Warfighter problem with low investments for high payoffs. REF requires RDT&amp;E funds to integrate several different Commercial Off The Shelf/Government Off The Shelf (COTS/GOTS) technologies into one capability that solves the tougher and more complex problems. REF uses RDT&amp;E funds to conduct demonstrations and tests to validate technology solutions.  REF requires RDT&amp;E funds in order to modify existing technologies that were developed for one purpose but now may be suitable to solve another problem. REF Expeditionary Labs use RDT&amp;E funds to develop and adapt technologies that meet immediate requirements forward in the theaters of operation with the active assistance of the Warfighter in the solution development process. REF requires RDT&amp;E funds to test technologies in order to ensure suitability and safety before equipping the Warfighter - Any modified COTS/GOTS item has to be tested.
 
The Asymmetric Warfare Group (AWG) integrates, coordinates, deploys and provides trained and ready forces in support of Joint and Army Forces Commanders' to enhance the combat effectiveness of the operating force and enable the defeat of asymmetric threats. The AWG observes, collects, develops, validates, and disseminates emerging tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to supported units. AWG povides Train-the-Trainer for countering asymmetric threats, to include Improvised Explosive Devices, suicide bombers and bioweapons. AWG identifies and coordinates the fielding of rapid prototyping and/or Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) solutions to counter asymmetrical threats. By providing the tools, expertise, and experience necessary to improve and quicken a units' reaction to rapidly changing TTPs, the AWG supports the rapid targeting and target execution of asymmetric warfare threats. The AWG also provides service procedures for identifying and disseminating lessons learned in order to support the need for rapid adaptation. Additionally, the AWG provides service acquisition and develops fielding procedures in support of Commanders' requirements for new technologies and materiel solutions for Asymmetric threa</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

All capabilities are safety tested prior to insertion into operational environments. Training and sustainment is provided for every capability until it is transitioned to an approved program of record or terminated through the CDRT process. Operational assessments are conducted to provide feedback in support of Army fielding decisions. REF capabilities routinely serve to bridge specific ONS and JUONS gaps to meet urgent requirements.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Tactical Exploitation of National Capabilities (TENCAP) program serves as the Army's centralized lead to perform National Intelligence cross-agency engineering to evaluate, enhance, prototype, and transition Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) technologies/capabilities developed by Science and Technology (S&amp;T) and other activities across the National Intelligence Community into Army systems and architectures.  TENCAP (1) ensures continued access to current National and Theater sensors and supporting tactical architectures; and (2) exploits new developments that focus on improving the tasking, analysis, processing, exploitation, and dissemination of the intelligence data collected.  This includes efforts to: (1) shorten targeting timelines down to Platoon level; (2) enhance target identification; (3) provide better target location (accuracy); (4) provide continued coverage of a target; and (5) develop in-theater analytic tools to enable data exploitation in near-real-time support to contingency operations.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Army's Tactical Exploitation of National Capabilities (TENCAP) mission is a congressionally mandated and chartered enduring requirement to leverage National intelligence capabilities useful to the tactical Army.  The Army's TENCAP acquisition strategy is driven by an annual TENCAP General Officer Steering Group (TGOSG), co-chaired by the Army G2; Army G8; and the Military Deputy to the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology [ASA(ALT)], and includes representatives from the Army G3, Army G6, Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) and the Program Executive Office for Intelligence, Electronic Warfare and Sensors (PEO IEW&amp;S).  The TGOSG validates, prioritizes, and guides TENCAP efforts according to Army and Defense strategy. Based on TGOSG guidance, TENCAP collaborates across the Intelligence Community and within the Army to partner and facilitate transfer and integration of advanced capabilities into Army Programs of Record (POR).  With acquisition discipline and oversight by PEO IEW&amp;S, TENCAP executes those TGOSG approved efforts through multiple contracts or agreements with military and National agencies, Labs, Industry Partners and Academia to maximize Army leverage of National intelligence and technology development and minimize redundancy and cost.  TENCAP manages these acquisition efforts, including rapid development and delivery of advanced capabilities, to meet Army validated but unforeseen warfighter requirements (including efforts referred to as Quick Reaction Capabilities), for the duration required to transition emerging and developmental capabilities into enduring Army programs.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

Fiscal Year 2011-Program Increase of $4.975 million for Project D131 for CSP TLA Laser technology maturity.

Fiscal Year 2013-Program Increase of $10.715 million for Project VT7 Soldier Maneuver Systems Advanced Development efforts.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element focuses on efforts to evaluate and integrate technologies and representative prototype systems that facilitate the development of Soldier-borne sensor devices transitioning from the laboratory to operational use. Efforts focus on proving out commonality across as broad a spectrum of users as possible to provide enhanced Soldier products, giving them superiority on the battlefield.

Project 131 (Night Vision Systems Advanced Development) This project supports the Army's transformation by developing payloads for brigade combat team, division, and corps Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) and unmanned systems in accordance with Headquarters Department of the Army (HQDA) and Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) priorities.  The funds associated with Project 131 are for the technology maturity of the Common Sensor Payload Target Location Accuracy (CSP TLA) Laser.  Once this laser technology has been matured to the appropriate Technology Readiness Level (TRL), it will be cut into the CSP TLA development effort and eventual production to replace the baseline payloads on the Gray Eagle platform.

Project VT7 (Soldier Maneuver Sensors-Advanced Development)  Efforts focus on proving out commonality across as broader spectrum of users as possible to provide enhanced Soldier products, giving them superiority on the battlefield. Near term efforts include the integration of goggles with the weapon sights for Rapid Target Acquisition (RTA) in a realistic operating environment, thereby increasing Soldier lethality. This project also develops a Family of Weapon Sights (FWS) with fused electro-optical performance, including focal plane arrays and high resolution micro-displays.  FWS enabling technologies increase product resolution, range, and imaging performance. New technologies will improve Soldier lethality, survivability, reduce weight, and improve affordability, mobility and comfort to combat and training environments. In addtion this project will explore insertion of technology that improves the Soldier's ability to detect Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) Detection.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

CSP Target Location Accuracy (TLA) is the final upgrade to CSP which will provide all of the CSP HD functionality but with significantly improved targeting accuracy.  CSP TLA provides the Battlefield Commander a vastly improved TLA allowing timely use of Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMs) and Coordinate Seeking Weapons (CSWs) across the battlespace.  CSP TLA is being procured as an upgraded capability for the Gray Eagle UAS program and can be integrated onto other manned and unmanned aerial platforms.  The funds associated with this funding line are for the technology maturity of the TLA Laser.  Once this laser technology has been matured to the appropriate Technology Readiness Level (TRL), it will be cut into the TLA development effort and eventual production to replace the CSP HD payloads on the Gray Eagle platform.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports efforts to evaluate and integrate technologies and representative prototype systems that facilitate the development of Soldier-borne sensor devices transitioning from the laboratory to operational use. Efforts focus on proving out commonality across as broader spectrum of users as possible to provide enhanced Soldier products, giving them superiority on the battlefield. Near term efforts include the integration of goggles with the weapon sights for Rapid Target Acquisition (RTA) in a realistic operating environment, thereby increasing Soldier lethality. This project also develops a Family of Weapon Sights (FWS) with fused electro-optical performance, including focal plane arrays and high resolution micro-displays.  FWS enabling technologies increase product resolution, range, and imaging performance. New technologies improve Soldier lethality, survivability, reduce weight, and improve affordability, mobility and comfort to combat and training environments. In addtion this project explores insertion of technology that improves the Soldier's ability to detect Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) Detection.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>FWS is a family of weapon sights that utilize advances in thermal and image intensified technologies to produce Individual, Crew-Served, and Sniper weapon sights operable in-line with a day optic or in stand-alone mode.  FWS  includes fused multi-band imagery and rapid target acquisition with ballistic equations, providing the Soldier with improved situational awareness and more rapid target detection and engagement during day and night operations.  This program will integrate smaller pixel (12 micron) uncooled long-wave infrared focal plane arrays in multiple large format sizes to improve sensitivity, clarity, and range, while simultaneously reducing the size, weight and power consumption of the Crew-Served and Sniper variants.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>There is a broad application potential for environmental quality technology (EQT) to be applied to multiple Army weapon systems and installations.  However, technology must be demonstrated and validated (total ownership cost and performance data identified) before potential users will consider exploiting it.  Therefore, this program element includes projects focused on validating the general military utility or cost reduction potential of technology when applied to different types of infrastructure, military equipment or techniques.  It may include validations and proof-of-principle demonstrations in field exercises to evaluate upgrades or provide new operational capabilities.  The validation of technologies will be in as realistic an operating environment as possible to assess performance or cost reduction potential.  EQT demonstration/validation is systemic; i.e., applies to a class of systems (e.g., tanks or aircraft) or to a Department of Army-wide, multiple site/installation problem (e.g., unexploded ordnance detection and discrimination).  This program will address, and eventually resource, programs in each of the environmental quality technology pillars (restoration, conservation, compliance, and pollution prevention).  Work must be endorsed by potential users and supported by a state-of-the-art assessment (i.e., "technology is heading for user to implement").</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The National Defense Center for Environmental Excellence (NDCEE) was established by Congress in 1990 with a directive to "serve as a national leadership organization to address high priority environmental problems for the Department of Defense (DoD), other government organizations, and the industrial community."  The NDCEE Program is a national resource for developing and disseminating advanced environmental technologies.  The NDCEE is used to demonstrate environmentally acceptable technology to industry; validate new technology prior to transferring that technology; and assist in the training of potential users as part of that technology transfer process.  The NDCEE is a DoD resource for environmental quality management and technology validation.  This program is managed by the Army on behalf of the Office of the Assistant Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Environment (ADUSD-E).  In May 2008, the program name was redesignated from the National Defense for Environmental Excellence to the National Defense Center for Energy and Environment to ensure that the Center's mission recognizes and addresses the strategic interdependence of energy and environmental technology requirements within an overall sustainability framework in support of our installations, weapons systems and war fighters.  This name change also directly supports the DoD's proactive implementation of Executive Order 13423, "Strengthening Federal Environmental, Energy and Transportation Management."

Our broadly encompassing and growing mobile, personal and stationary advanced energy technology requirements include infrastructure, alternative and synthetic fuels, surety, renewables, storage, distribution, advanced power, micro-grids, transportation, systems integration and others.  Further, to train as we fight, validated energy and environmental technologies need to be available, and implemented at our power projection bases and training areas.  The NDCEE will continue to research, demonstrate and transfer these technologies supporting our integrated Environment, Safety and Occupational Health (ESOH) and energy objectives with full consideration of the triple bottom line of mission, environment and community.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The NDCEE is a national asset focused on DoD applications that include technology transfer to appropriate DoD organizations.  The NDCEE fosters an outreach program to describe its products and capabilities that include publication of results and participation in professional meetings, symposia, conferences, and appropriate coordination with industry.  The management strategy for the NDCEE centers on a DoD Executive Advisory Board (EAB) chaired by the DoD NDCEE Executive Agent on behalf of the ADUSD (ESOH) and composed of senior DoD leadership to oversee NDCEE operations.  The EAB is supported by an EAB Working Group (EABWG) that includes staff members from each of the offices represented on the EAB.  The EABWG coordinates all NDCEE activities and reports back to the EAB Principals.  The EABWG is, in turn, supported by a Technical Working Group that addresses the details of NDCEE program execution.  The contracting strategy of the NDCEE is based on using an NDCEE Contracting Officer's Representative to validate all the contractual portions of the NDCEE and by technical monitors (TM) to oversee the technical aspects of each contracted task.  A prime contractor operates NDCEE test facility(s) to validate environmentally compatible technologies on a representative "shop floor".  The NDCEE accounts for and conducts work for: (1) direct funded Army tasks; (2) reimbursable tasks from within DoD and from other Government agencies; and (3) Congressionally directed and funded tasks.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The U.S. Army's Environmental Quality Technology (EQT) program provides new or innovative methods, equipment, materials, and/or protocols to reduce the total cost of Army operations and/or allow training operations to continue with minimum adverse impact on the environment that result from base operations and weapons system maintenance/support activities.  The restoration demonstration/validation portion of EQT is designed to support Army-wide stewardship of its lands and facilities by focusing on the transfer of potential technological solutions to restoration problems on Army installations and to industry to support restoration of Army lands to their former or redesignated use.  The restoration EQT demonstration/validation program goal is to support installation needs through exploitation of technology without compromising readiness or training.  It accomplishes this goal in two steps.  First, Technology Teams identify, prioritize, and justify technological solutions to Army high-priority environmental quality technology restoration requirements.  Second, based on Department of the Army and Office of the Secretary of Defense guidance, funding authority is sought through the Army's planning, programming, and budgeting process.  The EQT management oversight process consists of an Environmental Technology Technical Council (ETTC; a program management council), an Environmental Technology Integrated Process Team, (a working group supporting the ETTC) and, in this case, a Restoration Technology Team (composed of experts in restoration technology and in Army user needs).
This program is leveraging resources and knowledge gained from the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP), the Environmental Security Technology Certification Program (ESTCP) and the National Defense Center for Environmental Excellence (NDCEE).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Acquisition Executive (DAE), through the Nunn-McCurdy certification process, certified a restructured WIN-T program on June 5, 2007.  The certification Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) stated that the Army will restructure the WIN-T Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP) to absorb the former Joint Network Node (JNN) Network program.  It further stated that the restructured program will consist of four Increments: Inc 1, Inc 2, Inc 3, and Inc 4.

WIN-T is key to the Army's Network Modernization program. The WIN-T program's focus is to design, develop, produce and field the Future Modular Force transport network, while leveraging mature technologies that can enhance the Current Modular Force to operate in an emerging noncontiguous environment. 

Inc 2 FY 2013 funds continue the Full Rate Production (FRP) contract to include government test support for New Equipment Training, Cold Region Test, Force Development Test and Experimentation (FDT&amp;E), Initial Operational Test (IOT), First Unit Equipped (FUE) as well as the support required for the Full Rate Production Decision Review.

Inc 3 FY 2013 funds continue the Engineering Manufacturing Development phase and Platform Integration to include a Full Critical Design Review. Increment 3 will continue with testing and Modeling and Simulation activities.

The HBSS is a flexible, commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS)-based application which monitors, detects, and counters against known cyber-threats to the DoD Enterprise, using an intrusion prevention system and host firewall.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Warfighter Information Network - Tactical (WIN-T) Increment 3 (Inc 3) is the Army's communications system for reliable, secure, and seamless video, data, imagery, and voice services that enables decisive combat actions.  WIN-T Inc 3 is key to the Army's Network Modernization program.  It will be focused on moving information in a manner that supports commanders, staffs, functional units, and capabilities-based formations - all mobile, agile, lethal, sustainable, and deployable.  It will be optimized for offensive and Joint operations so that the theater combatant commander will have the capability to perform multiple missions simultaneously.  Inc 3 will provide the Commander/user within the tactical area of responsibility a mobile infrastructure that passes relevant information effectively and efficiently for combined arms capabilities in all required terrain and environmental conditions.  WIN-T is implementing the Global Information Grid (GIG) NetCentric Vision including Information Assurance and Network Centric Enterprise Services.  In addition, WIN-T is a key component of the tactical GIG.  WIN-T provides dynamic bandwidth and enabling formations On-The-Move (OTM).  Inc 3 develops the mature technologies which will be inserted into Inc 2.  Inc 3 introduces the aerial tier to complete the 3-tier objective architecture.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Defense Acquisition Executive (DAE), through the Nunn-McCurdy certification process, certified a restructured WIN-T program on June 5, 2007.  The certification Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) stated that the Army will restructure the WIN-T Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP) to absorb the former Joint Network Node (JNN) Network program.  It further stated that the restructured program will consist of four Increments: Incs 1, 2, 3, and 4.

The ADM of May 18, 2009 approved an initial Acquisition Program Baseline (APB) for Inc 3 and noted known changes to the program including elimination of Future Combat Systems (FCS) manned ground vehicles (MGVs), liquid cooled radios, and, subsequently, the termination of Class IV Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV).  A follow-on Increment 3 ADM on July 31, 2009 permitted the obligation of remaining FY2009 Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) funds to resource EMD efforts including development of the Joint Command, Control, Communications, Computer, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance radio to support the air-tier capability. The revised Acquisition Program Baseline (APB) as directed in the ADM aligns with the Department's FY 2010 and FY 2011 President's Budgets as well as the cancellation of the Future Combat Systems (FCS) manned ground vehicle component. This revised ADM was approved on October 22, 2010.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The HBSS is a flexible, commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS)-based application which monitors, detects, and counters against known cyber-threats to the DoD Enterprise, using an intrusion prevention system and host firewall. 

The Joint Task Force Global Network Operations (JTF-GNO) mandates McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator (ePO), an enterprise-class, open architecture client server system, to centrally manage security; the ePO server architecture will be implemented at the Enterprise and Tactical levels.  PEO C3T will test, train, deploy, and set conditions to maintain the HBSS software suite on all Mission Command Networks and Systems (MCNS), where the Army is the executive agent on NIPR, SIPR and CX-I.

PEO C3T will manage the funding for tactical implementation of HBSS for the Army's Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems.  C4ISR systems requiring HBSS implementation are owned by five Army PEOs and two Joint PEOs. Within PEO C3T, Project Manager Warfighter Information Network-Tactical (PM WIN-T) is leading the procurement effort on the ePO servers and virtual client installation</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program implements the provisions of Title 10 U.S. Code, Section 2350a, Cooperative Research and Development (R&amp;D) Projects: Allied Countries.  The objective is to improve, through the application of emerging technologies, the conventional defense capabilities of the United States and our cooperative partners, including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), U.S. major non-NATO allies and Friendly Foreign countries. Through technology sharing and joint equipment development these projects help reduce U.S. acquisition costs and leverage important technologies for the Army Transformation and the development of the Future Combat system. Cooperative efforts also improve multinational force compatibility with potential coalition partners through the development and use of similar equipment and improved interfaces. The program focuses specifically on international cooperative technology demonstration, validation, and interoperability of Army weapon and command, control, communications and information (C3I) systems, including the NATO Defense Against Terrorism initiatives. Projects are implemented through international agreements with foreign partners that define scope, cost and work sharing arrangements, management, contracting, security, data protection and third party transfers.  Funds are used to pay for only the U.S. work share that occurs in the United States at U.S. Government and U.S. contractors facilities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program implements the provisions of Title 10 U.S. Code, Section 2350a, Cooperative Research and Development (R&amp;D) Projects: Allied Countries.  The objective is to improve, through the application of emerging technologies, the conventional defense capabilities of the United States and our cooperative partners, including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), U.S. major non-NATO allies and Friendly Foreign countries. Through technology sharing and joint equipment development these projects help reduce U.S. acquisition costs and leverage important technologies for the Army Transformation and the development of the Future Combat system. Cooperative efforts also improve multinational force compatibility with potential coalition partners through the development and use of similar equipment and improved interfaces. The program focuses specifically on international cooperative technology demonstration, validation, and interoperability of Army weapon and command, control, communications and information (C3I) systems, including the NATO Defense Against Terrorism initiatives. Projects are implemented through international agreements with foreign partners that define scope, cost and work sharing arrangements, management, contracting, security, data protection and third party transfers.  Funds are used to pay for only the U.S. work share that occurs in the United States at U.S. Government and U.S. contractors facilities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The MNNEC is more than interoperability of information systems; it is the complete networking of information systems with sensors and shooters focusing on building Net-Centric interoperability among coalition tactical land components operating in a Joint Environment, focused at the  Brigade and Below level, but not excluding using the services provided at higher echelons. The MNNEC has a future force focus, endeavoring to define migration strategies for Net-Centric capabilities in the 2010-2025 timeframe with part of the work to determine the time-phased implementations of a Multi-National Network Enabled Capability. The end results would be an integration of national C2/C4ISR systems into an NCES environment to include the NATO Network Enabled Capabilities (NNEC).</r2:Text>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element supports advanced component development and prototypes of new and improved technologies for combat support and combat service support equipment essential to sustaining combat operations.  Advancements in watercraft, bridging, electric power generators and batteries, potable water, material-handling, environmental control, shelter systems, cargo aerial delivery, field service systems, mortuary affairs equipment and petroleum equipment are necessary to improve safety and increase the tactical mobility, operational capability, lethality and survivability on the digital battlefield and to provide for greater sustainment while reducing the logistics support burden.

Increase from FY 2012 to FY 2013 reflects Project G11 Advance Electric Energy Con AD.

Joint Light Tactical Vehicles (JLTV):  Funding supports the development and testing of the JLTV Family of Vehicles (FoV), which is being developed as a joint and international system between the Army and Marine Corps, and the Australian Army, participating under a Project Arrangement.  The JLTV goal is a FoV with companion trailers capable of performing multiple mission roles that will be designed to provide protected, sustained, networked mobility for personnel and payloads across the full Range of Military Operations (RoMO).  JLTV objectives include increased protection and performance over the current fleet; minimizing ownership costs by maximizing commonality, fuel efficiency and other means; and maintaining effective competition throughout the lifecycle.  The JLTV FoV includes ten (10) sub-configurations (and companion trailers) in three payload categories.  Commonality of components, maintenance procedures, training, etc., between vehicles and trailers is expected to be inherent in FoV solutions within and across Payload Categories to minimize FoV total ownership cost.  Unique service requirements have been minimized.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Funding supports project advanced component study and development, and prototype of equipment and sub-systems supporting the Army Watercraft mission to provide critical capabilities in support of full-spectrum land combat operations by extending the Commander's available maneuver space into and throughout the littorals, inland waterways and near coastal regions.  Army watercraft equipment supports the conduct of amphibious, riverine, logistics over the shore (LOTS), Joint logistics over the shore (JLOTS), inter and intratheater transport, movement and maneuver, mission command and sustainment as identified in DODD 5100-01, Functions of the Department of Defense and its Major Components. Army Watercraft exploit the inland waterway and littoral regions as waterborne maneuver and supply routes, conduct operations through littoral entry points, developed, undeveloped and austere access points, and in non-permissive and/or denied access scenarios. The Army uses a spectrum of lighterage and floating craft, from heavy sustainment ocean going landing craft capable of intratheater and ship to shore transport and undeveloped beach or harbor access, to ocean-going and harbor utility tug boats and barge derricks for transport and denied port/salvage operations, and modular causeway systems to support LOTS/JLOTS.

FY13 funding will be used to support the maturation of equipment, systems and sub-systems into Army Watercraft for the purposes of improved performance, energy efficiency, environmental and regulatory compliance, and to enhance the seaworthiness, safety, survivability, supportability and reliability of existing systems.  Funded efforts will advance critical gaps in these areas for the current fleet, while at the same time studying, developing, and testing emergent technologies in a manner to support future acquisitions and future fleet planning as those areas are to be imminently informed by the recently chartered and upcoming Army Watercraft Systems Board of Directors (AWS BOD).

Fleet wide funding requirements will complete core requirements for development, prototype operational testing and military unit assessment of externally mounted accommodation units in support of crew and supercargo berthing,  integration of escalation of force (EoF) force protection enhancements, to include both lethal and non-lethal, development of Battle Command on the Move (BCOTM) and Common Operating Picture (COP)/interoperability aspects of existing C4ISR, enhancement of developing environmental and energy efficiency technologies to ensure continued compliance with increasingly stringent regulatory requirements, and study/development of digital technology integration in the areas of near and real time logistics management, area situational awareness, trend analysis, Condition Based Maintenance Plus (CBM+), equipment monitoring and diagnostics/prognostics and related functional areas, as well as study and development of Terminal Operations (ship to shore) and At Sea Transfer.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports component development and Material Handling Equipment (MHE) prototyping and stays abreast of emerging and available technologies to be integrated into military MHE to address identified capability gaps and warfighter objectives.  This project enables the development of selected technologies and transition to system integration and development or production of MHE products.  MHE includes Rough Terrain Forklifts, Rough Terrain Container Handlers and Cranes, as well as ancillary MHE equipment, to support distribution of critical supplies in the theater of operations.  FY13 funding will allow innovative maintenance support technologies to be investigated with the goal to improve diagnostic tasks and to reduce safety and environmental hazards when performing maintenance on tactical MHE in the field.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports development of critical soldier support and sustainment systems including shelter systems (rigid and soft wall), cargo aerial delivery, field service systems, mortuary affairs equipment, heaters, camouflage systems to counter emerging enemy threat technologies, and other combat service support equipment.  These systems will fill identified theater distribution and services capability gaps, improve unit sustainability, and increase combat effectiveness.  This project also supports Advanced Component Development and Prototyping of Critical Distribution Capabilities to include cargo aerial delivery systems; which provide improved safety and accuracy while increasing survivability of aircraft, personnel, and equipment.  The project supports the development of tactical heater systems that support mobile Joint Service command and control, medical, and maintenance platforms.  This project develops critical enablers that support the Quartermaster (QM) Force Transformation Strategy and The Army's Modular Capabilities by maintaining readiness through fielding and integrating new equipment.  This project also ensures Army Expeditionary Forces are capable of rapid deployment through aerial delivery initiatives and reduces sustainment requirements, related Combat Support/Combat Service Support (CS/CSS) demands in lift, combat zone footprint, and costs for logistical support.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>The SHC 90K is a self-powered, thermoelectric heater that operates outside the tent and provides forced hot air circulation without the need for an external power supply (i.e., field generator). The SHC 90K generates its own electrical power, without any moving parts, through the use of thermoelectric modules located inside the combustion chamber that convert waste heat into electricity. The internal generation of electrical power gives the SHC 90K the added capabilities of single switch operation, forced hot air circulation, outside the tent operation, completely automatic safety and temperature controls, built-in troubleshooting diagnostics, operation without the need for a fire guard, and significantly higher combustion efficiencies, all without the need for an external power supply. The heater burns multi-fuels and operates in extreme cold temperatures down to -60oF.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Zero-Footprint Base Camp reduces the operational energy and logistics footprint of the expeditionary base camp system, with the goal being a significant reduction in fuel, water, and power requirements to sustain operations in the field.  Operating a base camp such as Force Provider requires a significant amount of logistics support and also produces an enormous amount of by products, both of which cost money, human effort (that means a risk in the form of soldiers on the road), and represents a potential vulnerability.</r2:Description>

Conduct evaluation of integrated technologies that are transitioning for the RDECOM 6.3 programs in a realistic operating environment at the Ft Devens Base Camp Systems Integration Laboratory (SIL). Efforts are focused on proving out subsystem maturity and the potential of these technologies before transitioning into System Development and Demonstration and putting them into operational use within the Army Force Provider base camps as a Pre-Planned Product Improvements (P3I). Focus will be on evaluating technologies that will improve upon the environmental and energy efficiency performance of the base camp. Specifically: 1) Evaluation of a variety of high performance insulating materials that are light-weight, durable, and cost effective; and 2) Integration and evaluation of micro-grid / smart power / renewable energy solutions that can be incorporated into the standard Army Force Provider modules.</r2:Text>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project develops and demonstrates the potential of prototype equipment and technologies to satisfy petroleum storage, distribution, and quality surveillance system requirements.  The Concept and Technology Development program supports the development and enhancement of rapidly deployable Petroleum and Water equipment. The mission includes developing onboard fuels quality analysis systems; achieving greater capabilities in the removal of Nuclear, Biological, Chemical (NBC) and other contaminates from water sources; reducing the logistics foot print; developing water reutilization systems to reduce the requirement for transport of water into the theater; and material systems to decrease the logistics foot print and employment time for the transfer of liquid logistics in the theater. This vital equipment enables the Army to achieve its mission by providing the Army with the means to be highly mobile and self-sustaining in very hostile theaters of operations.  Future Force operations demand that combat systems be rapidly deployable to the theater, rapidly emplaced upon arrival, and rapidly relocated to support a fast moving non-linear battlefield.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supported Advanced Component Development and Prototypes of new and reformulated paints, paint removers, cleaners and other surface coating materials and processes for weapon systems production and maintenance operations.  The project increased operational sustainment and warfighter training capabilities by reducing soldier health risks, environmental impacts and compliance enforcement actions against installations while increasing coatings performance and standardization across the Army.  Materials and processes demonstrated under this project are inherently compliant with all applicable National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants that regulate surface coating activities, thereby eliminating the need for Army installations to incur hundreds of millions of dollars in expenses to purchase, install and operate air pollution control devices.  This project transitioned advanced technologies developed under 0603728A, Environmental Quality Technology Demonstrations (025).  The project tested and evaluated Sustainable Painting Operations for the Total Army (SPOTA) at facilities that produce and maintain Combat Support/Combat Service Support systems, Ground Combat Vehicles and other Army equipment.  The project expedited technology transition from the laboratory to operational use by demonstrating the capabilities of new materials and processes to fulfill the performance requirements outlined in Material Specifications, Depot Maintenance Work Requirements, Technical Manuals and other technical data.  Test and evaluation activities were executed by Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM) centers and laboratories in cooperation with the affected Life Cycle Management Commands, Program Executive Offices and Program Managers.  Materials were demonstrated at ten different Army facilities in order to minimize the disruption of materiel maintenance operations at any one facility.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Joint Light Tactical Vehicles (JLTV):  Funding supports the development and testing of the JLTV Family of Vehicles (FoV), which is being developed as a joint and international system between the Army and Marine Corps, and the Australian Army, participating under a Project Arrangement.  The JLTV goal is a FoV with companion trailers capable of performing multiple mission roles that will be designed to provide protected, sustained, networked mobility for personnel and payloads across the full Range of Military Operations (RoMO).  JLTV objectives include increased protection and performance over the current fleet; minimizing ownership costs by maximizing commonality, fuel efficiency and other means; and maintaining effective competition throughout the lifecycle.  The JLTV FoV includes ten (10) sub-configurations (and companion trailers) in three payload categories.  Commonality of components, maintenance procedures, training, etc., between vehicles and trailers is expected to be inherent in FoV solutions within and across Payload Categories to minimize FoV total ownership cost.  Unique service requirements have been minimized. 

FY11 major budget activities supported completion of the Technology Development (TD) phase testing, testing report submissions, and closeout of the TD prototype contracts.  As the program progressed towards the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase, major budget activities supported staffing of the Capabilities Development Document, development of Milestone B documentation and the purchase of Government Furnished Equipment (GFE).  Awaiting Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) for approval to purchase GFE prior to Milestone B, therefore the program will carry over funding to FY 2012.

RDT&amp;E funding will be provided under two new Program Elements - 0604804A, Project L50 for FY12 and 0605812A, Project VU9 for out-years.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) Acquisition Strategy for the Technology Demonstration (TD) phase, FY 2008 through FY 2011, is to competitively award multiple contracts.  During this phase, the contractors will be required to design the JLTV Family of Vehicles (FoV) to the Preliminary Design Review level and fabricate and test selected prototypes and trailers for payload Categories A, B, and C.  The TD phase contracts were awarded on October 29, 2008 under the full and open competition process to BAE Systems Land and Armament Systems-Ground Systems Division; General Tactical Vehicles (A Joint Venture of General Dynamics Land Systems, Inc. and AM General, LLC); and Lockheed Martin Systems Integration.  The fabricated protoptypes will undergo developmental testing, as well as limited user assessments, in a relevant environment at Government test facilities.  The addition of Australian protoptypes to the program will further reduce the risk.  The goal is to ensure the family of protypes is mature in terms of supporting technologies and full system integration for Milestone B approval and entry into Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase.

Joint Light Tactical Vehicles (JLTV) is a Joint Services Program with the U.S. Army and Marine Corps as the two main components.  In addition, the Navy anticipates procuring JLTV vehicles upon successful Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) testing.  The program will use an evolutionary approach to deliver capabilities in increments based on program priorities.  All technologies entering the current Engineering, Manufacturing and Development (EMD) phase shall be no less than Technology Readiness Level 6 to achieve Capabilities Development Document (CDD) requirements.

The program revised the acquisition strategy in the first quarter FY 2012 addressing Better Buying Power Initiatives, and reduced the schedule by 15 months to enable a 33-month Non-Developmental Item approach for EMD with Milestone B in third quarter of FY 2012.  This initiative saves $400.0 million in the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP) for the Services.

Increment I will produce two Mission Role Variant (MRV) configurations (Combat Tactical Vehicle (CTV) and Combat Support Vehicle (CSV)) with mission packages (General Purpose, Heavy Guns Carrier, Close Combat Weapons Carrier and Utility/Shelter Carrier).  EMD vendors will fabricate representative mission packages from both MRVs, which the Government will fully test during the EMD phase.  Agreement was reached between the PM and user community to eliminate two mission packages, the Special Purpose (SP) and Command and Control On-The Move (C2OTM) vehicles which integrated WIN-T systems for the Army.  Eliminating these unique vehicles reduces technical risk and cost of the JLTV EMD effort.  It also eliminates duplicate development and relies on the WIN-T program's existing efforts to fund, integrate, and test their capabilities on other vehicles during the JLTV EMD schedule.

Through a full and open competition, the program anticipates awarding up to three firm-fixed price contracts for the EMD phase.  Unless future market research identifies a valid non-EMD vendor capable of delivering the required capabilities, there will be a down-select from the EMD contractors to enter into the Production and Deployment phase.  The down-select will result in a fixed-price type contract with a base LRIP quantity, LRIP options, full-rate production options, and a Technical Data Package option.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports development of critical soldier support and sustainment systems including shelter systems (rigid and soft wall), base camp subsystems, field service systems, mortuary affairs equipment, heaters, camouflage systems to counter emerging enemy threat technologies, and other combat service support equipment.  These systems will fill identified theater distribution and services capability gaps, improve unit sustainability, and increase combat effectiveness.  This project supports Advanced Component Development and Prototyping of Critical tactical support systems that support mobile Joint Service command and control, medical, and maintenance platforms.  This project develops critical enablers that support the Quartermaster (QM) Force Transformation Strategy and The Army's Modular Capabilities by maintaining readiness through fielding and integrating new equipment.  This project also ensures Army Expeditionary Forces are capable of rapid deployment and reduces sustainment requirements, related Combat Support/Combat Service Support (CS/CSS) demands in lift, combat zone footprint, and costs for logistical support.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Efforts are focused on proving out subsystem maturity and the potential of these technologies before transitioning into System Development and Demonstration and putting them into operational use within the Army Force Provider base camps as a Pre-Planned Product Improvements (P3I).   Focus will be on evaluating technologies that will improve upon the environmental and energy efficiency performance of the base camp.  Specifically: 1) Evaluation of a variety of high performance insulating materials that are light-weight, durable, and cost effective; 2) Integration and evaluation of micro-grid / smart power / renewable energy solutions that can be incorporated into the standard Army Force Provider modules; and 3) Integration and evaluation of smart and energy efficient Environmental Control Units / Heaters that will compliment improved shelter efficiencies and significantly reduce the fuel demand on base camp operations.</r2:Text>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Battle Command Sustainment Support System (BCS3) is the logistics Command and Control (C2) solution for U.S. land forces. BCS3 provides commanders the capability to execute end-to-end distribution and deployment management and brings better situational awareness resulting in better decision-making capability to warfighters. It enables warfighters to target, access, scale and tailor critical logistics information in near-real time. BCS3 provides more effective means to gather and integrate asset and in-transit information to manage distribution and deployment missions. BCS3 combines distribution management to include commodity and convoy tracking, and deployment management into a logistics Common Operating Picture (COP) for one mission-focused visual display.   

BCS3 has been adopted and integrated into Joint and strategic logistics command and control processes. BCS3 is the only near-term end-to-end logistics COP solution for the Joint commander. BCS3 will maintain its core capabilities and continue to advance in development while integrating into the Joint command and control architecture. This continued development will enable decision superiority via advanced collaborative information sharing achieved through interoperability. 

BCS3 has immediate, high pay-off benefit to warfighters and additional future growth in its capabilities. BCS3 is a force multiplier, a precision tool for logistics planning and execution that provides warfighters with the necessary tools to succeed.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element (PE) funds development of medical materiel at the start of an official program of record, within the early system integration portion of the System Development and Demonstration phase of the acquisition life cycle using 6.4 funding.  Program efforts support transition of promising Science and Technology candidate medical technologies (drugs, vaccines, medical devices, diagnostics, and mechanisms for detection and control of disease carrying insects) to larger scale testing in humans for safety and effectiveness.  Programs are aligned to meet Future Force (F2) requirements stressed within concept documents and organizational structures.  The PE provides funding for Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulated human clinical trials to gain additional information about safety and effectiveness on the path to licensure for use in humans.  The Projects supported by this PE are: 

(PROJ 836) funds the demonstration and validation of medical products for enhanced combat casualty care and follow-on care, including rehabilitation.  This project also funds the human clinical trials that test the safety and effectiveness of biologics, devices and demonstration.  Clinical trials are conducted in accordance with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations.  Products from this project will transition to 832.

(PROJ 808) funds development of candidate medical countermeasures for infectious diseases of military relevance. Efforts include vaccines, drugs, diagnostic kits/devices, and insect control measures.  These funds support human clinical efficacy trials of the drug/vaccine in a larger group that are designed to assess performance and to continue safety assessments in a larger group of volunteers. Products from this project will transition to 849.

(PROJ 811) funds the development of military relevant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) medical countermeasures.  It provides funding for planning and conducting of human clinical trials in a group of healthy volunteers to assess the drug/vaccine for safety, tolerability, how the drug/vaccine is distributed, metabolized, and excreted from the body, and investigate the appropriate dose for therapeutic use.  Products from this project will transition to Project 812. 

(PROJ VS7) program upgrades, retrofits, trains, and sustains the 256 Medical Evacuation legacy helicopters that continue to play a major role in Iraq and Afghanistan. The force design will increase the number of air frames in the force from 12 to 15 aircraft for 37 MEDEVAC companies to better meet operation needs.  Products from this project will transition to VS8.

This program is managed by U.S. Army Medical Materiel Development Activity (USAMMDA) and U.S. Army Medical Materiel Agency (USAMMA)  of the US Army Medical Research and Materiel Command</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project funds development of candidate medical countermeasures for infectious diseases of military relevance.  These efforts are in: vaccines, drugs, diagnostic kits/devices, and insect control measures.  These funds support human clinical efficacy (capacity to produce a desired size of an effect under ideal or optimal conditions) trials of the drug/vaccine in larger groups that are designed to assess how well the drug/vaccine works, and to continue safety assessments in a larger group of volunteers.  Funding supports both technical evaluations and human clinical testing to assure the safety and effectiveness of medical diagnostic kits and devices.  This work, which is performed in military laboratories or civilian pharmaceutical firms, is directed toward the prevention of disease, early diagnosis, and speeding recovery once diagnosed.  All clinical trials are conducted in accordance with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations, a mandatory obligation for all military products placed into the hands of medical providers or service members.  Product development priorities are determined based upon four major factors: (1) the extent and threat of the disease within the Combatant Commands theater of operations, (2) the clinical severity of the disease, (3) the technical maturity of the proposed solution, and (4) the affordability of the solution (development and production).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project funds development of militarily relevant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) medical countermeasures.  It provides funding for the planning and conducting of human clinical trials in a group of healthy volunteers to assess the drug/vaccine for safety, tolerability, how the drug/vaccine is distributed, metabolized, and excreted from the body, and to investigate the appropriate dose for therapeutic use.  Development efforts are focused on militarily unique needs effecting manning, mobilization, and deployment.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project funds the demonstration and validation of medical products for enhanced combat casualty care and follow-on care, including rehabilitation.  This project funds human clinical trials to test the safety and effectiveness of biologics (products derived from living organisms) and devices necessary to meet medical requirements.  When available, commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) medical products are also tested and evaluated for transition to system development and demonstration.  Consideration is also given to reducing the medical logistics footprint through smaller weight, volume, and equipment independence from supporting materials.  All clinical trials are conducted in accordance with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations.
Major contractors/intra-governmental agencies include:  IGR Enterprises, Inc.; Army Medical Department Board Test Center; SeQual Technologies, Inc.; Ultrasonic Diagnostics, Inc.; HemCon Medical Technologies, Inc.; Hemerus Medical, LLC.; Fast Track Drugs &amp; Biologics, LLC; Clinical Research Management, and Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) and Institute of Surgical Research (ISR) for user evaluation.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Original models of Army Black Hawk MEDEVAC helicopters continue to play a major role in maintaining high US troop survival rates in Iraq and Afghanistan by evacuating wounded troops in less than one-hour.  In 2009 a VCSA-approved force design update increased the number of air frames in the force from 12 to 15 aircraft for 37 MEDEVAC companies to better meet operational needs.  In 2010, the AMEDD accepted life-cycle management of the MEDEVAC MEP from PEO Aviation.  In order to achieve required operational capability and enhance commonality across the MEDEVAC fleet, the MEDEVAC MEP program upgrades, retrofits, trains, and sustains the 256 MEDEVAC legacy helicopters to achieve the medical capability provided by the HH-60M, which is factory built for the MEDEVAC mission.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

One of the requirements for the UH-60A/L MEDEVAC is a sensor system that will assist the pilots in locating patient pick-up points and assist them in maintaining situational awareness in night and adverse weather conditions. The MMS is currently being qualified for use on the HH-60M aircraft. This system will be installed on UH-60 aircraft using the proven Sponson-Mount FLIR system, which is currently being used in OEF for the MEDEVAC mission. The funds will develop and test a Medical Mission Sensor FLIR prototype on the UH-60A/L.</r2:Text>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Nett Warrior (NW) program [named in honor of Medal of Honor recipient COL Robert Nett], previously known as Ground Soldier System (GSS) program, leverages commercial smart devices and secure Army tactical radios to provide an integrated dismounted leader Mission Command (MC) and Situational Awareness (SA) system for use during combat operations. The system provides unparalleled situational awareness and understanding to the dismounted leader allowing for faster and more accurate decisions in the tactical fight. This translates into Soldiers being at the right place, at the right time, with the right information making them more effective, more lethal, and more survivable in the execution of their combat mission. The NW program focuses on the integration and evaluation of commercial smart devices for the MC/SA system, improved navigation, and reduced fratricide through the visualization of friendly forces. The development and integration process employs combat veteran for Soldier integration and feedback enhancing the human factors and fightability. NW also develops supporting power systems aimed at achieving NET ZERO power balance in the expeditionary environment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Nett Warrior (NW) program provides unparalleled situational awareness and battle command to dismounted combat leaders through commercial smart device technologies and secure tatical radios.  The NW program executed a MS A in FY09 and began three competing TD phase contracts leading to developmental and operational testing FY10-11.  The technology development contracts have been completed. The NW MS C is executed in 2QFY12 followed by a low rate Capability Set (CS) 14 production award.  The RDT&amp;E and Production dollars in FY12-13 pay for Developmental Test and Evaluation planned for 4QFY12-1QFY13, followed by 1QFY13 Initial Operational Test &amp; Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) as well as hardware, software, integration and program management.  The Developmental and Operational tests are validation of the system utility, supportability, and austere-environment power production and regeneration strategy-leading to the full 10 BCT set CS14 in the 2QFY13. NW also continues to reduce size, weight and power through a semi-annual integration and evaluation and test of commercial smart device technologies which evolve continuously. The development and integration process employs combat veteran for Soldier integration and feedback enhancing the human factors and fightability. NW also develops supporting power systems aimed at achieving NET ZERO power balance in the expeditionary environment.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports the Advanced Component Development and Prototyping of select Air Soldier System (Air SS) components. The Air SS provides improved safety, survivability, and human performance that amplifies the Warfighter's effectiveness and facilitates full-spectrum dominance of Army aircraft. The Air SS addresses capability gaps identified during combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan including the effects of weight and bulk, limited situational awareness, and lack of functionally integrated aircrew member life support equipment. The Air SS follows an evolutionary acquisition approach with two sub-increments that integrate mature technologies to build to the full capability. Each sub-increment progressively reduces overall weight and bulk of aircrew equipment, increases situational awareness, and enhances aircrew mobility. This funding provides advanced development for the Air SS in technology areas supporting improved environmental cooling, integrated power, flexible display technologies, lightweight protective clothing, and miniaturized communication devices.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Gunshot Detection System (GDS) was identified by the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army for insertion into the Capabilities Development for Rapid Transition (CDRT) process.  A Capabilities Production Document (CPD) was approved on 13 Feb 2009. On 3 May 2010 an Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) was approved for 13,424 systems. The system uses passive acoustic and / or another sensor modality for detection, computer-based signal processing, and both aural and visual indications to help troops locate a hostile shooter, by reporting relative shooter azimuth, range, and elevation from incoming small arms fire. The visual data is displayed on a single ruggedized display and the verbal/voice over a speaker. 

FY 2011 efforts for Explosive Ordinance Disposal (EOD) Robotic and Dismounted Equipment - Design, prototype, integration and demonstration in support of the following efforts:  Robotic Telescoping  Pan, Tilt, Zoom (PTZ) Camera; High Fidelity Video Imaging; Bangstick; Improved Laser Sight for Pan Disrupter; Multishot Disrupter for Robot Applications; Ultra Lightweight MK2 EOD Disrupter; and Precision Disrupter Robotic Aiming System. 

The FY 2013 funds will be used for the development of engineering documentation, generation of an Acquisition Requirements Package (ARP) to support conduct of Source Selection activities leading to a competitive contract award in FY2014.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Small Arms Improvement Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) program provides funds to mature, demonstrate, test and evaluate emerging technology from Joint Service Small Arms Program (JSSAP), Project 627, Program Element 0603607A, (Budget Activity 3) and other domestic and foreign sources for small arms weapons systems and technology. Small arms systems include weapons ranging up to 40 millimeter in caliber. Current and future efforts focus on improvements designed to enhance lethality, target acquisition, fire control, training effectiveness and reliability of weapons to include ammunition when developing and/or evaluating standard and non-standard weapons. Focus areas include the maturing of technology through testing and evaluation of sub-system components or system prototypes which demonstrates light weight materials, wear resistant/protective coatings, observation/situational awareness improvements and equipment enhancements.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Joint Program Office (JPO) for IBS Terminals supports all Services and Special Operations Command (SOCOM). The Integrated Broadcast Service (IBS) is the worldwide Department of Defense (DoD) standard network for transmitting time-sensitive tactical and strategic intelligence and targeting data to all echelons of Joint Service operational users. The JPO's role is to consolidate and replace existing IBS terminal functionality and capability, and to expedite execution of the IBS Technical Transition Plan (TTP). The JTT family of systems currently consists of the JTT-Senior and JTT-IBS. The TTP is a comprehensive refresh effort of the entire IBS network focused on rearchitecting the broadcast from its current multi-broadcast, multi-data format structure, to a single broadcast (Common Interactive Broadcast - CIB) and single data format (Common Message Format - CMF). The JTT family of systems is a critical component of the TTP as these systems are the only IBS receiver/transceiver devices in the DoD being modernized to support both the new consolidated broadcast architecture and the National Security Agency's (NSA) crypto modernization mandate. The JTT upgrades must execute the over-the-air broadcast portion of the TTP in the near term to avoid a complete cessation of IBS data flow via the existing over-the-air IBS broadcast networks. The JTT will be the official IBS producer system, ensuring continued IBS interoperability to a variety of tactical receivers across DoD and the services throughout the TTP implementation period and beyond. This program funds the integration and evaluation of JTT hardware and software modules, as well as implementing performance enhancements to the family of JTT equipment. This is necessary to ensure crypto modernization compliance and to facilitate migration to a rearchitected CIB and CMF-based IBS broadcast structure.  

FY13 Funds of $.096 million support the final testing of the Common Interactive Broadcast (CIB) waveform migration to the IBS Intelligence Data Enterprise.  The JTT technical insertion transitions to sustainment by the end of FY12. During the November 2010 POM brief, a zero-sum request was submitted to shift $1.5 million of FY13 Base Research, Development, Testing, and Evaluation dollars to FY13 Base Procurement dollars to sustain support for DoD customers.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Joint Program Office (JPO) for IBS Terminals supports all Services and Special Operations Command (SOCOM). The Integrated Broadcast Service (IBS) is the worldwide Department of Defense (DoD) standard network for transmitting time-sensitive tactical and strategic intelligence and targeting data to all echelons of Joint Service operational users. The JPO's role is to consolidate and replace existing IBS terminal functionality and capability, and to expedite execution of the IBS Technical Transition Plan (TTP). The JTT family of systems currently consists of the JTT-Senior and JTT-IBS. The TTP is a comprehensive refresh effort of the entire IBS network focused on rearchitecting the broadcast from its current multi-broadcast, multi-data format structure, to a single broadcast (Common Interactive Broadcast - CIB) and single data format (Common Message Format - CMF). The JTT family of systems is a critical component of the TTP as these systems are the only IBS receiver/transceiver devices in the DoD being modernized to support both the new consolidated broadcast architecture and the National Security Agency's (NSA) crypto modernization mandate. The JTT upgrades must execute the over-the-air broadcast portion of the TTP in the near term to avoid a complete cessation of IBS data flow via the existing over-the-air IBS broadcast networks. The JTT will be the official IBS producer system, ensuring continued IBS interoperability to a variety of tactical receivers across DoD and the services throughout the TTP implementation period and beyond. This program funds the integration and evaluation of JTT hardware and software modules, as well as implementing performance enhancements to the family of JTT equipment. This is necessary to ensure crypto modernization compliance and to facilitate migration to a rearchitected CIB and CMF-based IBS broadcast structure.  

FY13 Funds of $.096 million support the final testing of the Common Interactive Broadcast (CIB) waveform for migration to the IBS Intelligence Data Enterprise.  The JTT technical insertion transitions to sustainment by the end of FY12.  During the November 2010 POM brief, a zero-sum request was submitted to shift $1.5 million of FY13 Base Research, Development, Testing, and Evaluation dollars to FY13 Base Procurement dollars to sustain support for DoD customers.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

FY13 funding increase for Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) transfer, a pilot program to centrally fund the analysis of alternatives for new programs that have a material development decision but have not been assigned to a program manager for material development.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) develops and demonstrates selected technology enabled capabilities to support advanced ground and aviation systems, precision weapons, and soldier equipment.  Funding facilitates demonstration of relatively mature technologies and systems in relevant environments and tactical / operational scenarios, taking technologies through and beyond Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6. Efforts include competitive prototyping earlier in development to facilitate transition of new capabilities into acquisition programs of record. Efforts funded will be selected by an Army Senior Executive Steering Committee to ensure that demonstrations have high potential for filling capability gaps and transition. This PE provides the Army an improved mechanism for fulfilling the goals of the Weapon Systems Acquisition Reform Act (WSARA) of 2009 by enabling greater competition in the latter stages of technology maturation and establishes a closer alignment between Science and Technology (S&amp;T) programs and acquisition programs. This PE also provides analytical support for Analysis of Alternatives (AoA), a pilot program to centrally fund the analysis of alternatives for new programs that have a material development decision but have not been assigned to a program manager for material development. Funding for this effort was previously contained in 0605803A, project 733 in FY12.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Combat Identification (CID) is a family of systems to maximize the overall combat effectiveness of forces by minimizing and mitigating incidents of fratricide and maximizing the situational understanding of the trigger puller across the broad spectrum of Joint and Coalition combat operations.  This is accomplished by the identification of friends, enemies/foes and neutrals in the Joint and Coalition battle space.  Based on program prioritization direction from the Deputy Secretary of Defense and the Deputy's Advisory Working Group (DAWG), the Joint Cooperative Target Identification - Ground (JCTI-G) efforts have been refocused to address fratricide incidents involving Fires-on-Dismounts (FoD) and Air to Ground (A-G) fires.  The FoD is a Joint effort with the United States Marine Corps.  In accordance with an Army/Marine Corps MOA, funding for FoD systems development will be equitably shared between the two services.  This program has been designated Special Interest by the Defense Acquisition Executive.

Program has no Base or OCO FY13 request.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Combat Identification (CID) is a family of systems to maximize the overall combat effectiveness of forces by minimizing and mitigating incidents of fratricide and maximizing the situational understanding of the trigger puller across the broad spectrum of Joint and Coalition combat operations.  This is accomplished by the identification of friends, enemies/foes and neutrals in the Joint and Coalition battle space.  Based on program prioritization direction from the Deputy Secretary of Defense and the Deputy's Advisory Working Group (DAWG), the Joint Cooperative Target Identification - Ground (JCTI-G) efforts have been refocused to address fratricide incidents involving Fires-on-Dismounts (FoD) and Air to Ground (A-G) fires.  The FoD is a Joint effort with the United States Marine Corps.  In accordance with an Army/Marine Corps MOA, funding for FoD systems development will be equitably shared between the two services.  This program has been designated Special Interest by the Defense Acquisition Executive.

Program has no Base or OCO FY13 request.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The JCTI-G Materiel Development Decision (MDD) Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) was signed by the Defense Acquisition Executive, Dr. Ashton Carter, on 23 June 2010.  The MDD ADM authorized the programs entry into the Materiel Solution Analysis (MSA) phase and commencement of the Analysis of Alternatives (AoA).  The two phased AoA is expected to be completed by April 2011 resulting in program and materiel solution recommendations.  The program Milestone (MS) A decision and entry into the Technology Development (TD) phase is expected in FY12.  The MS A will be followed by release of the FoD Acquisition Requirements Package (ARP) to solicit and competitively awarded TD contracts in FY12.  Two (or more) TD cost-plus type contracts will be awarded to competing teams to develop system (or key system elements) prototypes for demonstrating in a relevant environment and conduct a Preliminary Design Review (PDR) prior to MS B.  A successful PDR, along with an approved Capability Development Document (CDD), and Acquisition Strategy will be the criteria supporting a MS B and entry into Engineering &amp; Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase.  The result of EMD will be a baseline system configuration for production. This strategy will require the support of other Military Services and Government agencies.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program supports the overall Air and Missile Defense (AMD) architecture and provides a robust intercept capability against rocket, artillery, and mortar (RAM) and residual Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) threats for deployed forces supporting stability and counterinsurgency operations.  Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment 2 (IFPC2) will integrate with current Counter-Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar (C-RAM), and RAM Warn Capability.  When implemented, IFPC2 will provide 360 degree protection against RAM and residual UAS threats simultaneously attacking from multiple azimuths.  Anticipated system will consist of a kinetic (missile or gun) and/or directed energy Interceptor, Fire Control Sensor, Technical Fire Control, Command Vehicle and control interfaces between major components.  The specific system concept will be determined by an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) to be completed in FY 2012.  Tactical Command and Control is an external interface to the IFPC2 program to be provided by supported forces.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Hybrid airship platform endurance is dependent on weather conditions and payload weight, but the LEMV prototype system is expected to increase endurance to 21 days on average assuming 20 knot winds.

The LEMV was funded in PE 0603308A Project 978 in FY10.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Long Endurance Multi-Intelligence Vehicle (LEMV) is a technology demonstration effort to improve persistent surveillance and assured communications using a platform with significantly improved endurance over existing systems. The LEMV platform is a hybrid airship that achieves vertical lift from helium contained within its hull making it lighter-than-air and from traditional engine propulsion that produces thrust to provide lift.  The LEMV prototype requirements are to achieve 21 day endurance in 20 knot continuous winds, carry 2500 pounds of multiple surveillance and communication payloads, operate at a maximum altitude of 20,000 feet Mean Sea Level, and provide 16 kilowatts (kW) of power to the payload. The LEMV system is recoverable and reusable. The LEMV system prototype and associated technologies will be evaluated during a Joint Military Utility Assessment (JMUA) in an operational environment upon completion of developmental testing.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Army received approval to acquire the LEMV under an Other Transaction Authority (OTA).  Extensive market research determined that this hybrid airship has never been manufactured as a full-scale functioning system and critical hybrid airship technology at the system and subsystem level is mainly available from non-traditional Department of Defense contractors.  An OTA agreement was preferred in order to gain access to critical technology within the Non-Traditional industrial community in this area and to promote competition. The OTA Agreement was competitively awarded using a competitive Request for Proposal process.  A Joint Military Utility Assessment (JMUA) will be conducted in theatre following the system development and transport. A Material Development Decision (MDD) is expected 90-180 days after completion of the JMUA Phase 1 (the first 2 months of the overall JMUA time period).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
