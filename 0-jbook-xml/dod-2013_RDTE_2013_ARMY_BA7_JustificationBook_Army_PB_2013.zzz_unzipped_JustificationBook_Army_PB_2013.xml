                <r2:ProgramElementNote>Change Summary Explanation:  FY 2011:  Adjustments made for Congressional marks, recissions, and inflation.  FY 2013:  Funds used to develop improved armored cab for crew protection and blast protection for MLRS (093); program re-alignment, a successful Milestone B, and Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract award in FY12 for GMLRS AW (78G); and other inflation adjustments.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) is a full spectrum, combat proven, all weather, 24/7 lethal and responsive, precision strike weapon system that fully supports more deployable, affordable and lethal, Brigade Combat Teams, Fires Brigades, Modular Forces, and Joint Expeditionary Forces.  The HIMARS launcher is a C-130 transportable, wheeled, indirect fire, rocket/missile launcher capable of firing all rockets and missiles in the current and future Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) Family of Munitions (MFOM) and Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) Family of Munitions (AFOM) engaging targets with precision out to ranges of 300 kilometers. HIMARS satisfies the Army's digitization requirements by interfacing with the Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) fire support command and control system. The HIMARS product improvement program provides funding for research, development, and integration efforts necessary for sustainment, obsolescence mitigation, reliability improvements, incorporation of advanced automotive, armor, armament and system hardware and software technologies, and decreasing the logistics footprint.  This effort includes performing technical assessments, concept studies, and risk reduction efforts for incorporation of future requirements.  The HIMARS product improvement program maintains compliance with Intra-Army Interoperability and Digital Communications.  HIMARS has been deployed to Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and is still supporting Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) with great success by both US Army and Marine Corps units.

MLRS is a full spectrum, combat proven, all weather, 24/7 lethal and responsive, Precision Strike weapon system that is organic/assigned to Fires Brigades supporting Brigade Combat Teams.  The MLRS launcher provides critical missile precision strike, operational shaping fires, counterfire, and close support destructive and suppressive fires.  The launcher is complimented by the MFOM to include the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS), and the AFOM, capable of engaging targets up to a range of 300 kilometers.  The MLRS product improvement program provides funding for research, development, and integration efforts to the MLRS necessary for sustainment, obsolescence mitigation, reliability improvements, incorporation of advanced automotive, armor, armament and system hardware and software technologies, and decreasing the logistics footprint.  This effort includes performing technical assessments, concept studies, and risk reduction efforts for incorporation of future requirements.  The MLRS product improvement program maintains compliance with Intra-Army Interoperability and Digital Communications via Joint Variable Message Format. 

GMLRS munitions are the Army's primary organic Joint Expeditionary, all-weather, all-terrain, 24/7, tactical precision guided rockets employed by modular Fires Brigades supporting Brigade Combat Teams, Divisions, Joint Special Operations Force, Joint Force Combatant Commanders, and is also a key component of the Marine Corps Future Fighting Effort.  GMLRS is the primary munitions for units fielded with the HIMARS and MLRS M270A1 rocket and missile launcher platforms.   GMLRS provides close, medium, and long range precision and area fires to destroy, suppress, and shape threat forces and protect friendly forces against the following:  cannon, mortar, rocket and missile artillery, light materiel and armor, personnel, command and control, and air defense surface targets.  GMLRS integrates guidance and control package and an improved rocket motor achieving greater range and precision accuracy requiring fewer rockets to defeat targets, thereby reducing the logistics burden.  The two fielded variants are GMLRS with Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munitions (DPICM /Increment 1) and GMLRS Unitary (U/Increment 2), a 200-pound class high explosive warhead.  The GMLRS Unitary is a modification to the GMLRS DPICM integrating a multi-mode fuze and high explosive warhead making it an all-weather, low collateral damage, precision strike rocket. This modification expands the MLRS target set into urban and complex environments by adding, point, proximity and delay fuzing modes, and supports Troops in Contact (TIC) scenarios.  A third variant of GMLRS, the Alternative Warhead (AW/Increment 3) has completed Technology Development (TD) with a successful Milestone B and will enter Engineering and Manufacturing Development in FY12, with the Production and Deployment beginning in 2QFY15.  The GMLRS AW is being developed to replace DPICM and meet requirements outlined in a 25 JUN 2008 DoD Cluster Munitions Policy, which requires all cluster munitions by 2019 to produce less than 1% Unexploded Ordinance on the battlefield.  As of FY10, the AW Program has been managed and funded under project code, 78G.  To date, over 2,121 GMLRS rockets have been fired in support of Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) by the Army</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The MLRS product improvement program conducts concept studies to support obsolescence mitigation, automotive updates, and hardware/software enhancements.  Development efforts underway include Enhanced C2 and efforts supporting Interoperability Certifications, Information Assurance compliance, and increased crew protection (Improved Armored Cab).  The Improved Armored Cab effort, beginning in FY 12, fulfills a M270A1 system requirement that incorporates the same level of crew protection capability as the HIMARS Increased Crew Protection cab. A contract will be awarded following a competitive bid process (full and open competition) to ensure best value for the Government. The Fire Control System Update is driven by the need to mitigate obsolete electronic components that are being sustained through life of type purchases. These purchased components will be exhausted, thus requiring an update to the design.  This update to the design will preserve current capability of firing the complete set of MLRS Family of Munitions per the Operational Requirements Document (ORD). Efforts preparing for the Fire Control System Update have been accomplished and the FCS-U contractor work will begin in FY13.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) Unitary (U/Increment 2) is the only variant of the Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) Family of Munitions (MFOM) currently in production.  This rocket integrates a 200-pound class high explosive warhead with multi-mode fuzing options (proximity, point detonate, and delay); expanding the MLRS target set into urban, complex, pre-planned and Troops in Contact (TIC) scenarios by delivering a low collateral damage, precision strike rocket.  GMLRS Unitary is relevant to current operations with over 2,121 rockets fired in support of Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) by the Army, Marine Corps and United Kingdom.  The program office continues to explore opportunities to enhance GMLRS technology.  Improvements will provide the following, per Joint Capability Integration and Development System (JCIDS) requirements: (1) enhanced operational capability and flexibility across the target set, (2) potential cost savings across weapon system life cycle through obsolescence initiatives, (3) test equipment commonality and reduced user effort for sustainment operations with enhancements to the MLRS Common Test Equipment (MCTE), (4) future Insensitive Munitions (IM) technology studies and insertion, and (5) optimized flight performance and increased survivability for friendly forces and non-combatants through scalable effects.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) Alternative Warhead (AW/Increment 3) is being developed to replace the GMLRS Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munitions (DPICM/Increment 1) and fill a Warfighting Capability Gap left by the future removal of current cluster munitions from the battlefield, as outlined in a 25 JUN 2008 Department of Defense (DoD) Cluster Munitions Policy.  This effort includes:  development, test activities to evaluate payload performance against validated models/simulations, and integration.  GMLRS AW TD Phase has been completed with a successful Milestone B.  The Army will enter into Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) in FY12.  Production and Deployment is scheduled for FY15 with Initial Operational Capability and the Full Rate Production Decision Review scheduled for FY17.  Improvements will provide the following, per Joint Capability Integration and Development System (JCIDS) requirements: (1) enhanced operational capability and flexibility across the target set, (2) potential cost savings across weapon system life cycle through obsolescence initiatives, (3) test equipment commonality and reduced user effort for sustainment operations with enhancements to the Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) Common Test Equipment (MCTE), and (4) future Insensitive Munitions (IM) technology studies and insertion.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Biometrics Enabling Capability (BEC) will be the Department of Defense (DoD) authoritative biometric enterprise database repository.  Capabilities shall include multimodal storage and matching, state-of-the-art Service Oriented Architecture, management portal, Biometrically Enabled Watch-List, increased system capacity and processing ability, and system interoperability and data sharing with government agencies and stakeholders including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Homeland Security, National Ground Intelligence Center, Department of State, United States Central Command (CENTCOM), United States Special Operations Command and other DoD and Federal agencies, as required. 
 
The current prototype capability, Next Generation Automated Biometric Identification System (NG-ABIS), was developed as a Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) based on a CENTCOM Joint Urgent Operational Needs Statement (JUONS).  NG-ABIS provides a robust capability for distinguishing friend from foe in hot spots around the globe.  NG-ABIS enables near-instantaneous device-to-database communication and lays the foundation for enhanced device-to-device communication, reducing cycle and response times.  NG-ABIS receives submissions from existing QRC-based collection devices.  NG-ABIS also receives requests by authorized users to perform storage retrieval and searches of biometric data collection and matching results.  NG-ABIS provides a reliable and effective tool for overseas operations by allowing the Warfighter to make near real-time retention, capture, or release decision.
 
The NG-ABIS QRC will be the initial baseline capability for the BEC Program of Record (POR).  NG-ABIS becomes BEC Increment 0 at the Full Deployment Decision (FDD) in FY2012 when the POR will be established.  This was delayed from 3rd quarter FY2011 due to a delay in the enhanced NG-ABIS software deployment.
 
The BEC program has an associated Analysis of Alternatives that has been conducted in support of BEC Increment 1, a follow-on acquisition program that is conducting pre-Milestone B activities.  Milestone B is projected for FY2013.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:Text>$34.595M in Base funding provided Milestone B activities and documentation and furthered the development of Transaction Manager integration (TMi) that will provide the Warfighter with near real-time matching results for retention, capture, or release decisions. TMi is currently scheduled to be deployed into NG-ABIS in FY12.  Allowed for system interoperability collaboration with DHS and DOJ's FBI.  Leveraged biometric capabilities and data sharing with government agencies and stakeholders, including DOS, DHS, FBI, NGIC, CENTCOM and SOCOM.  Supported additional system capacity and throughput based on rapidly increasing submission rates from the Warfighter.  Supported Homeland Security Presidential Directive 24 (HSPD 24)/ National Security Presidential Directive 59 (NSPD 59) and maintain the compliance of the system consistent with current information assurance guidance, DoD policy and biometric standards. Improved the NG-ABIS data algorithms. Supported government civilian labor and operational support including travel, training, supplies, infrastructure and facility costs.  Supported continued testing and evaluation of the Transaction Manager integration (TMi) in preparation for the full deployment to the operational environment.  Supported integration, test and verification efforts supporting Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) based web services required to develop the system interoperability releases.   Funds provided PM contractor support to plan, develop and prepare Army and Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) level documentation consistent with DoD Instruction 5000.02, the Defense Acquisition System and compliant with existing statutory and regulatory policies for a Full Deployment Decision (FDD) in FY12 for BEC Increment 0 and a Milestone B decision in FY13 for BEC Increment 1.   $25.134M in Overseas Contingency Operations funding resourced required labor costs for development, integration, test and verification efforts supported projected capabilities surrounding enhanced web services, interoperability with designated federal agencies biometric capabilities enhanced classification capabilities and quality improvement of data enterprise data sets.  In addition, funds provided for processing and capacity increases in order to meet Homeland Security Presidential Directive 24 (HSPD 24)/National Security Presidential Directive 59 (NSPD 59) objectives.</r2:Text>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology &amp; Logistics (USA AT&amp;L) held a biometrics Materiel Development Decision (MDD) Defense Acquisition Board (DAB) on 10 June 2009. On 06 July 2009, the USA AT&amp;L issue an Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) authorizing directing the Army to conduct an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) for the Biometrics Enabling Capability (BEC) program. The Army published a BEC AoA report on 30 April 2010 that recommended an enhanced status quo acquisition approach for BEC.  This approach begins with establishing the current capability as BEC Increment 0 at a Full Deployment Decision currently scheduled in FY12.  This will be followed by BEC Increment 1, which will enter the Engineering and Manufacturing Development Phase of acquisition with a Milestone B in FY13.  BEC Increment 1 will provide new capabilities beyond the current DoD Automated Biometric Identification System (DoD ABIS).  To achieve these additional capabilities in a cost-effective and timely manner, the BEC Increment 1 evolutionary Acquisition Strategy will include agile acquisition processes approved by the PEO EIS that will allow the PM DoD Biometrics to provide multiple, rapid deliveries of incremental capabilities to the user for operational use and evaluation.  PM DoD Biometrics has prepared a forward-looking Acquisition Strategy for the BEC Increment 1 Program that is compliant with the Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 5000.2 process, yet through tailoring is agile enough to provide rapid release of new capabilities to the user and Warfighter.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

These BTDs promote the identification and transition of new or emergent biometric technologies that enhance biometrics-enabled capabilities in DoD.  BIMA utilizes memberships in research and development organizations as well as the annual Multiple Biometric Grand Challenge event to investigate, test and improve performance of biometric technologies and capabilities.  BIMA is required to use the Joint Interoperability Test Command to test biometric technologies and provide certification that biometric equipment is interoperable and can be utilized by all branches of the armed services and government.  BIMA uses RDTE contract labor and development projects to directly impact the efficiency and operation of the Automated Biometric Identification System.</r2:Text>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The design objective of the Patriot system was to provide a baseline system capable of modification to cope with continuing threat evolution.  This program minimizes technological risks and provides a means of enhancing system capability through planned upgrades of deployed systems.  The Patriot Product Improvement program upgrades the Patriot system to address operational lessons learned, enhancements to joint force interoperability and communications, and other system performance improvements to provide overmatch capability against the emerging threat.  Upgrades are implemented through individual hardware and software materiel changes and fielded incrementally. This program encompasses several changes which will require the use of a variety of acquisition methods to develop, test, procure and field.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>Fiscal Year (FY) 2011:  JLENS was increased $40.350 million to fund the Secretary of Defense directed Combatant Coomand (COCOM) Exercise extended test program.

FY 2012:  JLENS was reduced $16.800 million to fund other higher priorities. 

FY 2013:  JLENS was increased $34.001 million to fund the Secretary of Defense directed COCOM Exercise extended test program.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Joint Land Attack Cruise Missile Defense Elevated Netted Sensor System (JLENS) is a supporting program of the Army and Joint Integrated Air and Missile Defense, providing a persistent surveillance and tracking capability for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle and Cruise Missile defense to the current and projected defense forces. JLENS will provide fire control quality data to Surface to Air missile systems such as Army Patriot and Navy Aegis; increasing the weapons' capabilities by allowing these systems to engage targets normally below, outside or beyond surface based weapons' field of view. Additionally, JLENS provides this fire control quality data to fighter aircraft allowing them to engage hostile threats from extended ranges.
	
As a secondary role JLENS also detects and tracks Surface Moving Targets.  The Program Manager may defer integration of the JLENS secondary roles to provide Launch Point Estimate for Tactical Ballistic Missiles and Large Caliber Rockets, based on Secretary of Defense direction to participate in and conduct an extended test program as part of a Combatant Command Exercise in FY 2012. JLENS supports military operations across the full spectrum of conflict.

A JLENS Orbit consists of two systems: a fire control radar system and a wide-area surveillance radar system. Each radar system employs a separate 74-meter tethered aerostat, mobile mooring station, radar and communications payload, processing station, and associated ground support equipment. JLENS uses advanced sensor and networking technologies to provide 360-degree, wide-area surveillance and precision target tracking. This JLENS information is distributed via joint service networks and contributes to the development of a single integrated air picture.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Joint Land Attack Cruise Missile Defense Elevated Netted Sensor System (JLENS) is a supporting program of the Army and Joint Integrated Air and Missile Defense, providing a persistent surveillance and tracking capability for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle and Cruise Missile defense to the current and projected defense forces. JLENS will provide fire control quality data to Surface to Air missile systems such as Army Patriot and Navy Aegis; increasing the weapons' capabilities by allowing these systems to engage targets normally below, outside or beyond surface based weapons' field of view. Additionally, JLENS provides this fire control quality data to fighter aircraft allowing them to engage hostile threats from extended ranges.
	
As a secondary role JLENS also detects and tracks Surface Moving Targets.  The Program Manager may defer integration of the JLENS secondary roles to provide Launch Point Estimate for Tactical Ballistic Missiles and Large Caliber Rockets, based on Secretary of Defense direction to participate in and conduct an extended test program as part of a Combatant Command (COCOM) Exercise in FY 2012. JLENS supports military operations across the full spectrum of conflict.

A JLENS Orbit consists of two systems: a fire control radar system and a wide-area surveillance radar system. Each radar system employs a separate 74-meter tethered aerostat, mobile mooring station, radar and communications payload, processing station, and associated ground support equipment. JLENS uses advanced sensor and networking technologies to provide 360-degree, wide-area surveillance and precision target tracking. This JLENS information is distributed via joint service networks and contributes to the development of a single integrated air picture.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The JLENS Operational Requirements Document (ORD) calls for initial fielding to Block I requirements (tethered aerostat platforms for Fire Control and Surveillance radars), followed by fielding of Block II (untethered platforms for Fire Control and Surveillance radars), and Block III (both radars on a single untethered platform). There is currently no funding beyond Block I.  

On 28 Jun 05, the Defense Acquisition Board (DAB) approved the JLENS program for entry into Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) as recommended by the Army Acquisition Executive. The DAB elected to maintain oversight of JLENS as an Acquisition Category (ACAT) 1D program as stated in the Acquisition Decision Memorandum signed on August 5, 2005.

In June 2011, the Secretary of Defense directed JLENS to participate in and conduct an extended test program in support of the Combatant Command (COCOM). Initial funding of $40.350 million was reprogrammed into FY 2011. The President's Budget FY 2013 includes funding to support extending the EMD phase and to continue the COCOM Exercise extended test program.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Mission Description: INSCOM conducts Research, Development, Testing, and Evaluation (RDTE) of rapid prototype cyber ttack weapons systems in support of full-spectrum military operations. INSCOM's cyber weapons are low-density
or non-standard items whose requirements have been Army G3/5/7 or Joint validated and are not in development by acquisition technology developers or system program managers.  Justification: INSCOM executes its assigned RDTE mission in compliance with AR 10-87, 70-1, 71-9 and 700-142; CJCSI 3170.01E and O-3600.1; Army Cyberspace OPLAN 8039, and HQDA Cyberspace EXORD 155-10. INSCOM's rapid Cyber weapons systems developments are based on national, strategic,
operational, and tactical requirements outlined in NSPD-38/54, HSPD-23, National Strategic Plan for United States Offensive Cyber Operations, National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace, National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations, Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative, USSTRATCOM CONPLAN 8039,and COCOM Joint Urgent/Operational Needs Statements.  Priority of effort is given to requirements that are immediately traceable to land component command operations.  Risk/Funding:  Not funding INSCOM's RDTE program severely degrades the Army's ability to provide Combatant Commanders with critical warfighting capabilities, resulting in additional risks of failure to Army operational missions or increased costs in Soldier lives and fighting capability due to loss of combat advantages provided through this program.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>The decreases in FY 2011 of $0.810 million and FY 2012 of $0.046 million was a result of changes in budget position. 

The increase in FY 2013 funding of $5.000 million is to fund requirements for GPS-based Precision Guided Munitions (PGMs) require pre-launch loading of sufficient GPS Satellite related data down at the Weapon Platform level to enable Precision Capable?Fires. The increase of $3.108 million is to fund requirements for Joint Automated Deep Operation Coordination System (JADOCS) Capability Production Document (CPD) which is currently being staffed at Joint 
Requirements Oversight Council (JROC).</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) automates fire support planning and coordination for the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps. AFATDS automates the planning, coordinating and controlling of all fire support assets in the Joint battlespace (field artillery, mortars, close air support, naval gunfire, attack helicopters, and offensive electronic warfare) from Echelons Above Corps to Battery or Platoon in support of all levels of conflict. As a result of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF)/Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF), AFATDS has implemented precision fires capabilities in new/improved munitions such as Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) Unitary Vertical Attack, Excalibur, Smart and 155 Bonus. Additional implemented capabilities include automatic conduct of Unit Fratricide Avoidance Checks and Collateral Damage Avoidance. AFATDS will interoperate with the other Army Battle Command Systems, current and future Army, Navy and USAF Command and Control weapon systems, and the German, French, Turkish, and Italian fire support systems. The system is composed of common hardware/software employed in varying configurations at different operational facilities (or nodes) and unique system software interconnected by tactical communications in the form of a software-driven, automated network. The system is currently fielding non-developmental, rugged common hardware, running the Windows Operating System. The total force will be fielded a Windows based platform by fiscal year 2013.

Joint Automated Deep Operations Coordination System (JADOCS) is a Joint, Interagency, and Multinational (JIM) Targeting, Mission Management, and Common Operational Picture (COP) Windows based software suite which functions as a complementary system to the AFATDS. JADOCS provides integration and synergy between multiple Command &amp; Control (C2) systems of the uniformed services, and Joint and combined elements involved in the targeting process and performs coordination and calculates collateral damage. JADOCS Mission Managers support this coordination amongst Warfighter functional areas to rapidly execute critical missions. JADOCS is a component of the Integrated Fires Family of Systems (FOS) and complementary to the Army Battle Command Systems (ABCS) System of Systems (SoS).

GPS-based Precision Guided Munitions (PGMs) require pre-launch loading of sufficient GPS Satellite related data down at the Weapon Platform level to enable Precision Capable?Fires.  This hot?start capability allows for rapid post-launch time-to-first-fix of GPS signal and maximum utilization of PGM maneuver authority to insure required target engagement performance.  This is especially critical for short times of flight and steer-early solutions such as Mortar and Cannon based PGMs.  Local GPS Satellite visibility challenges due vertical terrain/complex environment issues during normal combat operations can prohibit ?Precision Capable? Fires when using GPS Satellite data generated exclusively at the Firing Weapon Platform.   A system-of-systems Network Assisted GPS capability will be developed, integrated, and validated to overcome local GPS Satellite masking problems through the sharing of sufficient timely required GPS Satellite data via Wide-Area Network (WAN) and Local-Area Network (LAN) based materiel solutions that effectively and efficiently leverage mature Technologies and sunk taxpayer investments of existing Programs of Record.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) automates fire support planning and coordination for the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps. AFATDS automates the planning, coordinating and controlling of all fire support assets in the Joint battlespace (field artillery, mortars, close air support, naval gunfire, attack helicopters, and offensive electronic warfare) from Echelons Above Corps to Battery or Platoon in support of all levels of conflict. As a result of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF)/Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF), AFATDS has implemented precision fires capabilities in new/improved munitions such as Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) Unitary Vertical Attack, Excalibur, Smart and 155 Bonus. Additional implemented capabilities include automatic conduct of Unit Fratricide Avoidance Checks and Collateral Damage Avoidance. AFATDS will interoperate with the other Army Battle Command Systems, current and future Army, Navy and USAF Command and Control weapon systems, and the German, French, Turkish, and Italian fire support systems. The system is composed of common hardware/software employed in varying configurations at different operational facilities (or nodes) and unique system software interconnected by tactical communications in the form of a software-driven, automated network. The system is currently fielding non-developmental, rugged common hardware, running the Windows Operating System. The total force will be fielded a Windows based platform by fiscal year 2013. 

GPS-based Precision Guided Munitions (PGMs) require pre-launch loading of sufficient GPS Satellite related data down at the Weapon Platform level to enable ?Precision Capable? Fires.  This ?hot? start capability allows for rapid post-launch time-to-first-fix of GPS signal and maximum utilization of PGM maneuver authority to insure required target engagement performance.  This is especially critical for short times of flight and steer-early solutions such as Mortar and Cannon based PGMs.  Local GPS Satellite visibility challenges due vertical terrain/complex environment issues during normal combat operations can prohibit ?Precision Capable? Fires when using GPS Satellite data generated exclusively at the Firing Weapon Platform.   A system-of-systems Network Assisted GPS capability will be developed, integrated, and validated to overcome local GPS Satellite masking problems through the sharing of sufficient timely required GPS Satellite data via Wide-Area Network (WAN) and Local-Area Network (LAN) based materiel solutions that effectively and efficiently leverage mature Technologies and sunk taxpayer investments of existing Programs of Record.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>AFATDS began fielding in 1996, with the original AFATDS Version 96 Materiel Release. It has been updated with subsequent releases reflecting the Spiral development strategy of the program. Full Materiel Release of AFATDS V6.6 (First Windows version) was achieved in June 2010. Full Materiel Release of AFATDS V6.7 was achieved in January 2011. AFATDS V6.8 is being developed and expects to achieve Full Materiel Release in 1Q FY2013. 

Development efforts will continue to enhance Command and Control for precision weapons, Excalibur Height above Ellipsoid (HAE), Active Weapon Target pairing and Unexploded Ordnance (UXO) area computations. It will also provide backward interoperability to Pass and Subscribe Services (PASS) and AFATDS XML Engine (AXE) for Software Block 2 (SWB2) to enable connection to SWB1/1+ versions. 

In April 2011, the program office presented a Capability Development Document (CDD) for the AFATDS Increment II development effort to the Joint Capabilities Board panel.  In June 2011, the program received the final approval memorandum of the CDD from the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC).  Currently, the program office is working to achieve a Milestone B (MS B) decision.  Upon completion of the MS B decision, the execution of the Increment II requirements as specified in the CDD will begin.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Joint Automated Deep Operations Coordination System (JADOCS) is a Joint, Interagency, and Multinational (JIM) Targeting, Mission Management, and Common Operational Picture (COP) Windows-based software suite which functions as a complementary system to the Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS). JADOCS provides integration and synergy between multiple Command &amp; Control (C2) systems of the uniformed services, and joint and combined elements involved in the targeting process and performs coordination and calculates collateral damage. JADOCS Mission Managers support this coordination amongst Warfighter functional areas to rapidly execute critical missions. JADOCS enables coordination and de-confliction of conventional and asymmetric war-fighting missions. JADOCS uses a map-oriented Graphical User Interface (GUI) and overlays as a framework for information display. JADOCS is fielded to Air Force, Navy, Marine, and Army units involved in the targeting process at Echelons Above Corps, Corps, and Division. JADOCS provides the Combatant Commands with the capability to plan and direct theater counter-fire and precision strike operations through the real time synchronization of US and Coalition assets. The application provides the Warfighter with a combination of tools, services and Mission Managers for rapid "system of systems" integration, visualization, coordination and deconfliction of critical mission information. It not only enhances Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems in the areas of strike planning but also in situational awareness, joint and combined interoperability and force transition in war. JADOCS is a component of the Integrated Fires Family of Systems (FOS) and complementary to the Army Battle Command Systems (ABCS) System of Systems (SoS).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>In FY 03, the Automated Deep Operations Coordination System (ADOCS) was renamed the Joint Automated Deep Operations Coordination System (JADOCS) and was transitioned to Product Manager, Fire Support Command and Control (FSC2). 

JADOCS has operated as a graduated Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD) program since 2005. In 2008, the Vice Chief of Staff Army approved JADOCS for Acquisition program status under the Capabilities Development for Rapid Transition (CDRT) program. Commencing in FY 10 and continuing through FY 15, the Army will provide funding for its requirements under JADOCS.  The Army started development of a Capabilities Production Document in 2008 and was submitted to Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) for approval in 4th Quarter of FY 11. 

JADOCS is presently fielded to U.S. Central Command (USCENTCOM), U.S. Pacific Command (USPACOM), U.S. Forces Korea (USFK) and U.S. European Command (USEUCOM), including their subordinate commands. JADOCS is distributed to over 320 servers and 3,614 clients worldwide. Additionally, JADOCS is fielded to coalition partners. The Republic of Korea, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) have Foreign Military Sales (FMS) cases.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Army has completed a comprehensive Combat Vehicle (CV) modernization strategy, which includes the Abrams, Bradley and Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV) Platforms.  

This Program Element (PE) corrects vehicle deficiencies identified in Army operations; continues technical system upgrades to include the integration of applicable technologies on ground systems; addresses needed evolutionary enhancements to tracked combat vehicles; and develops technology improvements which have application to or insertion opportunities across multiple Ground Combat Systems vehicles.  This PE provides combat effectiveness and Operating and Support (O&amp;S) cost reduction enhancements for the Abrams tanks and Bradley Fighting Vehicles through a series of product improvements.

This project funds improvements to the Abrams Family of Vehicles (FOV).  The Abrams mission is to provide necessary firepower, mobility and survivability to overmatch all current and emerging enemy threats in achieving decisive dominant maneuver.  The M1A2 SEP (current production model) refers to a System Enhancement Package incorporated on the tank in 1998, which upgraded the M1A2's computer systems and its night vision capabilities.  Since that time, the M1A2 SEP has virtually reached its upper limits for space, weight, and power (SWaP).  The Abrams tank is expected to be in service through 2045 and will be modernized in accordance with a revised capabilities document to:  (1) posture the tank infrastructure to enable incremental growth as a hedge against other risks and contingencies, (2) maintain threat overmatch to deter aggression, project power and protect US interests and allies around the globe - especially with regards to the lessons of counterinsurgency learned during the tank's successful campaigns during Operation Iraqi Freedom, and (3) leverage the mature and relevant technology enhancements from the Army Research &amp; Development Technology base.  The Abrams tank must embark on a modernization effort in order to remain relevant and maintain threat overmatch capability.  The objective is to maintain Survivability, Combat Overmatch and reduce O&amp;S costs through an evolutionary approach with incremental development.   

The M2/M3A3 Bradley Fighting Vehicle is at or exceeds Space, Weight, and Power-Cooling (SWaP-C) limitations. To host and restore lost platform capability, the Bradley Fighting Vehicle program shall execute a series of Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) to support the current embedded systems and to facilitate integration of technologies currently in development under other existing Programs of Record. The ECPs are not intended to exceed the operational capability outlined in current system requirements documents, but rather to ensure that the existing system performance is not further degraded and that Army mission equipment packages can be integrated on the Bradley platform.

The AMPV will provide the Heavy Brigade Combat Team (HBCT) with a replacement for the M113 Family of Vehicles (FOVs) that is more survivable and mobile to accomplish operational support missions across the full spectrum of conflict. The AMPV will be selected upon completion of the Analysis of Alternatives in FY 2013.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Army is developing a comprehensive Combat Vehicle modernization strategy for the Abrams main battle tank.  This strategy will focus on incrementally delivering capability to the warfighter to meet both near-term limitations as well as mitigating gaps and maintaining combat overmatch in the future.  This effort was approved by the Army Acquisition Executive in 3Q FY 2011.  The M1A2 SEPv2 improvements implemented through the Abrams ECP 1 Program will restore lost power generation, solve impending obsolescence issues and incorporate inbound technologies currently under development under other existing Programs. The Abrams ECP 1 technologies specified in the Acquisition Decision Memorandum will complete engineering development with a production contract award in FY 2016.  Production Qualification testing, Live Fire Test &amp; Evaluation (LFT&amp;E), and a Limited User Test (LUT) will be completed by mid FY 2020.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

To host and restore lost platform capability, the Bradley Fighting Vehicle program shall execute a series of Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) to support the current embedded systems and to facilitate integration of technologies currently in development under other existing Programs of Record. The ECPs are not intended to exceed the operational capability outlined in current system requirements documents, but rather to ensure that the existing system performance is not further degraded and that Army mission equipment packages can be integrated on the Bradley platform.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Product Manager Bradley will execute an Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) reestablishing Space, Weight, Power and Cooling (SWAP-C) to facilitate integration of technologies being developed under existing Programs of Record (POR). The proposed ECP will restore lost capability, not to exceed operational envelopes outlined in current approved requirement documents.  The ECP is scheduled to field in FY 2018 to address powerpack and electrical power upgrades, which will enable the vehicle to host Army directed inbound technologies with no further performance degradation to the vehicle. This ECP will be executed on a sole source cost plus incentive fee contract to the current platform Original Equipment Manufacturer.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Tactical Mission Command (TMC) is a suite of products and services that provide commanders and staffs executive decision making capability in a collaborative environment, planning tools, and Common Operational Picture (COP) management and other maneuver functional tools.  TMC satisfies requirements and capabilities identified in the Maneuver Control System (MCS) Good Enough Operational Requirements Document (ORD) and MCS 6.4 Capability Production Document (CPD) which includes Army migration to Department of Defense (DoD) net-centric environment.  The overarching capability includes a user-defined COP with integrated Command and Control (C2) and Situational Awareness (SA), map-centric collaboration, Army Battle Command System (ABCS) and other enabling system interoperability, data management, and enterprise services.  The suite of products include Command Post of the Future (CPOF), Battle Command Common Services (BCCS) that provides the consolidate server and services infrastructure for systems supporting Army Battle Command from Battalion to Army Component Command, Battalion and Above Joint Convergence with the Marine Corps, and Tactical Web Portal for Knowledge management. TMC products and services are compliant with the joint technical architecture.  In addition, this project funds the development of a collaborative Mission Command (MC) environment for ABCS to operate more efficiently and effectively.  The MC environment will serve as a common foundation for functionality development and support by collapsing onto a common architecture and infrastructure.  MC Convergence/ Common Operating Environment (COE) development and integration will significantly enhance the ability of commanders and staff to effectively conduct collaborative mission planning and execution across a range of operations and spectrum of conflict.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>In accordance with the Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) requirements document approved in 2008, entitled Mission Command Essential Capability, software capability will be developed in 2-year increments as capability sets designed to Collaborate, Collapse and Converge Mission Command products.  The product development funded under this R-Form is an integral part of the ABCS, a system of systems, under a strategy designed to optimize opportunity for improved interoperability among the systems, to capture the benefits of competition where possible and to ensure the rapid integration of new capability into warfighter systems.  This strategy is designed to increase operational efficiency, reduce the physical footprint, and logistics support requirements.
Mission Command Collapse/ Common Operating Environment (COE) development and integration provides for a single, common solution with open architecture that produces a collaborative Mission Command environment for Maneuver, Fires and Air supported by Intel and Logistics.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The CH-47 Chinook is a twin-turbine, tandem-rotor, heavy-lift transport helicopter with a useful load of up to 25,000 pounds.  As the Army's only heavy lift helicopter, the CH-47 is an essential component of the Army Future Force.  The CH-47F program fills the Army's Aviation Transformation Chinook requirement.  This program funds improvements to the engines and airframe components.  The T55-GA-714A engine improvements include a redesigned N1 drive line, a new torque system, and provides improvement to the engine control unit thru continuous software upgrades.  The Airframe Component Improvement Program includes development of new rotor blades, drive train, aircraft power generation systems, and avionics solutions that will allow the Chinook to improve its performance by providing improved aircraft controls, increased payload capability, and advanced avionics capabilities.  Early studies will be performed to identify largest areas of payback in fleet modernization.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The UH-60 Black Hawk is the workhorse of Army Aviation, flying more than 49% of the Army's annual flying hours.  The system has been in production for over 30 years and provides a common platform with the versatility to perform multiple missions, ranging from air assault to command and control to medical evacuation/search and rescue. While the Black Hawk is the Army's newest helicopter, it was designed with a twenty-year service life. Today, two-fifths of the Army's Black Hawk fleet (721 aircraft) is comprised of H-60L aircraft with an average age of 13 years.  The older H-60A models (918 aircraft) have an average age exceeding 23 years.  To counter the older UH-60A's declining readiness rates, increased operations and support costs and to meet Future Force interoperability requirements, the Utility Helicopters Project Office established a program to replace existing UH-60 helicopters and provide capabilities needed on the future battlefield.  The resulting configuration of the new UH-60M enhances the commander's ability to conduct non-linear, simultaneous, fully integrated operations in order to decisively mass the effects of the Army's warfighting assets.  The UH-60M configuration provides digital connectivity for enhanced situational awareness and improved lift, range, deployability, and survivability to further increase the commander's ability to conduct operations across the entire spectrum of the battle space. An Operational Requirements Document (ORD) for recapitalization of the Black Hawk fleet was approved by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) in March, 2001.  The ORD described an evolutionary, block approach to transform the utility helicopter force to one that is more deployable, responsive, and less expensive to operate. A revised ORD was signed by the JROC on July 24, 2006, which updated key performance parameters for survivability and force protection. RDTE funds were required to develop, integrate, test and qualify the UH-60M Upgrade configuration.  FY2005 funded the initial efforts to move the UH-60M program to an Upgrade configuration which included Fly-By-Wire (FBW) technology, Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) and the Common Avionics Architecture System (CAAS), which is the common cockpit to be used by UH-60M, CH-47 and Special Operations aircraft. Incorporation of CAAS will minimize future sustainment costs for these aircraft platforms.  A successful UH-60M Upgrade IPR decision was obtained in January 2006.  On May 18, 2007, the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Overarching Integrated Product Team (OIPT) approved the Army request for advanced procurement for seven UH-60M Upgrade aircraft and recommended a paper Defense Acquisition Board (DAB).  On October 15, 2009, based on increasing demands for helicopters to support Army Force Generation Model (AFORGEN) requirements, the Configuration Steering Board (CSB) recommended a restructure of the UH-60 Modernization Program to the Defense Acquisition Executive (DAE). The recommendation included three parts: 1) produce UH-60M baseline aircraft only; 2) complete Development Test (DT) on FBW aircraft; and 3) migrate selected technologies from the upgrade development efforts to the baseline configuration. The recommendation was approved by the DAE on February 18, 2010, in a signed Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM).  The ADM also directed the program to rebaseline.

The Improved Turbine Engine Program (ITEP) develops, tests and qualifies a nominal three thousand (3000) shaft horsepower (shp) class turboshaft engine with 25% better specific fuel consumption (SFC) as compared to other equivalent horsepower category engines.  The engine will be designed to fit in the same engine envelope as a T700 engine for the Black Hawk and Apache aircraft.  Other goals of the program are 65% greater horsepower to weight ratio, 35% less production and maintenance cost and 20% greater design life.  The program consists of system engineering and program management, detailed design engineering, design assurance hardware manufacturing and testing, component and module level development and testing, system level testing and qualification, as well as, initial integration testing into the airframe.   

The UH-60L Cockpit Digitization provides an integrated digital map, integrated performance planning, and commonality of hardware, software and training with UH-60M.  Effectively, the UH-60L will have the same situational awareness as the UH-60M.

FY2013 funds ITEP Systems Engineering/Program Management Milestone Decision requirements, while FY2014 funds ITEP contract award and initial component design and fabrication.  FY2013 also funds UH-60L Cockpit Digitization.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Utility Helicopters Project Manager Office (UH PMO) is planning and executing programs to acquire the capabilities described in the Operational Requirements Document (ORD) For Recapitalization Of The UH-60 Black Hawk Utility Helicopter Fleet.  The ORD specifies a two block approach and cites firm requirements for both blocks of capability as well as a robust pre-planned product improvement (P3I) plan that includes the insertion of technology. To address the requirements in the ORD the Utility Helicopters Project Office developed a strategy that developed the UH-60M Baseline to meet the Block 1 requirements and initiated the development of the UH-60M Upgrade for technology insertion of Fly-By-Wire (FBW), Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC), and Common Avionics Architecture System (CAAS).  In February 2010, the Defense Acquisition Executive (DAE) supported an Army Configuration Steering Board (CSB) and Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD) Overarching Integrated Product Team (OIPT) recommendation to cease production of the UH-60M Upgrade integrated solution due to Army Force Generation (AFORGEN) requirements. Concurrence with this recommendation is captured in the 18 February 2010 Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) directing the Army to rebaseline the UH-60 Modernization Program.  The ADM directed the completion of the development and development test of the UH-60M Upgrade program, continued procurement of UH-60M aircraft, and migration of select technologies from the UH-60M Upgrade development to the UH-60M configuration. This migration does not include FBW or CAAS. As part of completing the development and development testing of the UH-60M Upgrade, the integration, qualification and testing will be documented and shelved awaiting a future decision directing production of UH-60M Upgrade.  At the point the decision is made to restart the UH-60M Upgrade effort, the appropriate UH-60M acquisition and test documents will be updated.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project D17, Apache Block III (AB3) funding is for the non-recurring engineering (NRE), development, and testing work associated with the planned remanufacture and new build of 690 Apache aircraft in the Block III configuration (deliveries began in Oct 2011).  The AB3 program consists of two Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAP), AB3A Remanufacture and AB3B New Build.  D17 program addresses obsolescence and reliability challenges as well as adds significant combat capability to the aircraft.  Upgrades include: Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Level III-IV Control, Improved Situational Awareness, Upgraded Communications Suite, Improved Drive and Propulsion Systems, Improved Targeting Capability, Increased Computer Processing Capability and Speed, Improved Navigation Systems, and Improved Diagnostics and Maintainability.  Upgrades are integrated as incremental block modifications.  The program addresses operational shortfalls identified during real-world combat missions and meets Longbow Apache Capability Production Document (CPD) requirements for modernization.     

Funding also provides for the Modernized Rocket Launcher (MRL) to support the MIL-STD1760 digital AH-64D Apache and OH-58F Kiowa Warrior aircraft.  MRL replaces the analog interface M260 and M261 Hydra-70 rocket launchers on Army Aviation aircraft that employ digital interfaces to address reliability shortcomings identified during combat missions.  MRL is a fully-digitized launcher, which provides reduced weight, increased safety, reliability, flexibility, and improved accuracy and effectiveness while employing the Hydra-70 rocket system.  MRL will eliminate weapon-unique aircraft equipment by providing a non-proprietary, open architecture standard MIL-STD-1760 interface and will improve reliability and maintainability through launcher and rocket Built-in-Test (BIT) and supports future growth.

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The NRE will encompass subsystem integration and will utilize existing test aircraft, incorporate the technical insertions, and initiate appropriate qualification and operational flight-testing. The Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) effort includes a total quantity of 51 aircraft, with deliveries completing in December 2013.  These 51 LRIP aircraft will be used for operational testing, First Unit Equipped (FUE), and training base fielding. 

In Oct 10, a contract for Apache Block III Lot 1 (8 aircraft) was awarded to initiate LRIP.  Additional options for Lot 2a (16 aircraft), Lot 2b (19 aircraft) and Lot 2c (8 aircraft) are part of the LRIP Contract plan.

In early 2012, the existing Engineering Manufacturing Development (EMD) effort will be modified to incorporate development and testing to support the AB3 Lot 4 and Lot 6 production configurations.

In FY13, a contract for Apache Block III Lot 3, initiating Full Rate Production, will be awarded with options for Lot 4, Lot 5 and will continue to a total of 690 remanufactured and new build aircraft.

Training device concurrency will be maintained with each technical insertion. The EMD effort is managed as Cost Reimbursable.  Production efforts will be awarded as Firm Fixed Price (FFP) and include the Advance Procurement requirements.

MRL Contract will be a full-and-open competition for launcher development.  Government developed and controlled Performance Specification and Interface Control Documents will be used to ensure the MRL meets user requirements, utilizes open system architectures, addresses multi-service interoperability, provides a low-risk program, and supports future growth and integration for additional Hydra-70 digital platforms.  Market research will be used to refine Government requirements and interfaces to ensure a robust, competitive environment.  The request for proposal and ensuing proposal evaluations will emphasize Government data rights, technical data package delivery, and total life-cycle cost of the launcher as factors affecting contractor selection.  This is emphasized to provide a best value solution to support the Soldier.

Multi-year authority may be requested for the out years.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The budget line provides for Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) and integration of all Army fixed wing aircraft such as C-31A, UV-18, UV-20, CE-182, CE-208, O-2, T-34, U-21, B-300, King Air 350, C-12, RC-12, UC-35, C-23, C-26, C-37, C-20, and EO-5 for aircraft communications, navigation, surveillance (CNS) and Department of Defense (DoD) mandated safety equipment to meet current and evolving international standards.  FY13 Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) dollars in the amount of $0.979 million provides funding for NRE of CNS equipment that meets current and future air traffic management requirements. The increased performance will permit the Army fixed wing aircraft to operate in compliance with other existing and emerging regulations.  As requirements for new avionics equipment continue, aircraft delays and airspace exclusion are likely for aircraft not properly equipped.  Upgrade of communication and navigation systems will improve aircraft performance and enhance reliability and maintainability, thereby improving aircraft availability for mission requirements. The associated aircraft modifications will assure worldwide deployability for those required to deploy.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Aircraft Engine Component Improvement Program (CIP) develops, tests, and qualifies improvements to aircraft engine components to correct service-revealed deficiencies, improve flight safety, enhance readiness and reduce operating and support (O&amp;S) costs.  In addition, CIP provides the test vehicles for the testing and qualification efforts required as a part of the Army's Critical Safety Item (CSI) program.  CIP is included in the RDTE budget vice procurement appropriations in accordance with congressional direction.   The majority of CIP funding has been reallocated to PE 273744 beginning in FY07.  Non-program specific Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) as well as  Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) safety and readiness issues will continue to be addressed under this PE.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Horizontal Battlefield Digitization is a strategy that allows warfighters, from the individual soldier and platform to echelons above corps, to share critical situation awareness (SA) and command and control (C2) information. It conducts analysis and evaluation of new information technologies, concepts, and applications of integrated management activities to meet the dynamic Army acquisition technology requirements. The strategy applies digital information technologies to acquire, exchange, and employ data throughout the operational environment, and provides a clear and accurate common operational picture for leaders at all levels. This timely sharing of information significantly improves the ability of commanders and leaders to quickly make decisions, synchronize forces and fires, and increase the operational tempo.  Digitization is a means of realizing a fully integrated C2/SA capability to the platoon level, including interoperability links with joint and multi-national ground forces. The major efforts included in the program element are: 1) Integration and synchronization of the Army's interoperability efforts, coordination of interoperability efforts between joint and multi-national forces, and the synchronization of combat material and training efforts to develop Army information technologies; 2) Systems engineering and integration of hardware and software interfaces between and across the warfighting functions and across multiple Program Executive Offices, providing System of Systems (SOS) capabilities that satisfy warfighter requirements and enable the execution of mission operations by providing one Common Operational Picture (COP)/Common Tactical Picture (CTP). 3) Oversee and support synchronization of LandWarNet Battle Command capabilities and ensure interoperability across the current and future force. 4) Support fielding of integrated systems to Active and Reserve Components (USARNG and USAR) in accordance with Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN). 5) Support of the the Army Equipping Enterprise System (AE2S) integration of the Force Development Investment Information System (FDIIS), Army Flow Model (AFM), and the Continuing Early Validation (CEaVa) programs into a single integrated system. This supports the Army's Equipping Strategy Army Force Generation, ARFORGEN, and consolidates capabilities to gain efficiencies. IAW the National Defense Authorization Act 804 and OSD's report to congress,Army is poised to implement the "Agile Business Process" that will result in an iterative and incremental approach to software development and hardware/software capability integration.  This process will improve effectiveness in the identification, assessment and acquisition of capability solutions for the Army Network. The $25M FY13 Network Itegrated Evaluation (NIE) budgeted in this PE will resource procurements of the material solutions that results from the FY12 NIE Cycle.  The Army will request prior approval reprogramming of this funding into appropriate procurement accounts prior to execution.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Horizontal Battlefield Digitization is a strategy that allows warfighters, from the individual soldier and platform to echelons above corps, to share critical situation awareness (SA) and command and control (C2) information. It conducts analysis and evaluation of new information technologies, concepts, and applications of integrated management activities to meet the dynamic Army acquisition technology requirements. The strategy applies digital information technologies to acquire exchange and employ data throughout the operational environment, and provides a clear and accurate common operational picture for leaders at all levels. This timely sharing of information significantly improves the ability of commanders and leaders to quickly make decisions, synchronize forces and fires, and increase the operational tempo.  Digitization is a means of realizing a fully integrated C2/SA capability to the platoon level, including interoperability links with joint and multi-national ground forces. The major efforts included in the program element are: 1) Integration and synchronization of the Army's interoperability efforts, coordination of interoperability efforts between joint and multi-national forces, and the synchronization of combat material and training efforts to develop Army information technologies; 2) Systems engineering and integration of hardware and software interfaces between and across the warfighting functions and across multiple Program Executive Offices, providing System of Systems (SOS) integration capabilities that satisfy warfighter requirements and enable the execution of mission operations by providing one Common Operational Picture (COP)/Common Tactical Picture (CTP). 3) Oversee and support synchronization of LandWarNet Battle Command capabilities and ensure interoperability across the current and future force. 4) Support fielding of integrated systems to Active and Reserve Components (USARNG and USAR) in accordance with Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN). 5) Support the Army Equipping Enterprise System (AE2S) integration of the Force Development Investment Information System (FDIIS), Army Flow Model (AFM) and the Continuous Early Validation (CEaVa) programs into a single integrated system. This supports the Army's Equipping Strategy, ARFORGEN, and consolidates capabilities to gain efficiencies. IAW the National Defense Authorization Act 804 and OSD's report to Congress, Army is poised to implement the "Agile Business Process" that will result in an iterative and incremental approach to software development and hardware/software capability integration.  This process will improve effectiveness in the identification, assessment and acquisition of capability solutions for the Army Network. The $25M Network Integrated Evaluation (NIE) funds budgeted in FY13 in this PE will resource procurements of the material solutions that results from the FY12 NIE Cycle.  The Army will request prior approval reprogramming of this funding into appropriate procurement accounts prior to execution.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>Change Summary Explanation:  FY11 RDTE funding of $3.748 million is for Command and Control (C2)/Situational Awareness (SA) Convergence.  It uses Project Code 122.  FBCB2 RDTE Funding in FY09 and Prior used Project Code 120.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Force XXI Battle Command Brigade and Below (FBCB2) consists of FBCB2 and Joint Battle Command - Platforms (JBC-P) hardware and software.

Joint Battle Command - Platforms (JBC-P), which includes Blue Force Tracking and Army Aviation, provides true Joint force Command and Control (C2) Situational Awareness (SA) and communications (e.g., terrestrial, celestial) capability at the platform level through command center locations (e.g., Network Operations Centers, Theater Operation Commands (TOCs), Brigade Command Posts) and enables mission accomplishment across the entire spectrum of Joint military operations.  JBC-P serves as the cornerstone for Joint Blue Force Situational Awareness (JBFSA).  It provides continuous near-real-time identification of friendly locations to populate the Joint Common Operating Picture (JCOP).  Joint Battle Command - Platforms (JBC-P) enhances Joint Combat Identification to increase combat effectiveness and reduces fratricide in a secure environment.  It enables Joint, net-centric C2/Battle Command by seamlessly passing/sharing relevant information vertically and horizontally, within all levels of command, regardless of Service unit hierarchy.  In addition to utilizing the existing FBCB2/BFT system, JBC-P system hardware consists of a family of computers (e.g., handhelds, tablets, ruggedized computers, beacons and in-dash computers), communications equipment (e.g., satellite transceivers/antennas), encryption devices (e.g., KGV-72), and ancillary equipment (e.g., Mission Data Loader, Disk Duplicator, cables, installation kits, etc.).

$3.748 million was programmed for FY11 RDTE to pay for JBC-P C2/SA Convergence.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Joint Battle Command - Platforms (JBC-P), which includes Blue Force Tracking and Army Aviation, provides true Joint force Command and Control (C2) Situational Awareness (SA) and communications (e.g., terrestrial, celestial) capability at the platform level through command center locations (e.g., Network Operations Centers, Theater Operation Commands (TOCs), Brigade Command Posts) and enables mission accomplishment across the entire spectrum of Joint military operations.  JBC-P serves as the cornerstone for Joint Blue Force Situational Awareness (JBFSA).  It provides continuous near-real-time identification of friendly locations to populate the Joint Common Operating Picture (JCOP).  Joint Battle Command - Platforms (JBC-P) enhances Joint Combat Identification to increase combat effectiveness and reduces fratricide in a secure environment.  It enables Joint, net-centric C2/Battle Command by seamlessly passing/sharing relevant information vertically and horizontally, within all levels of command, regardless of Service unit hierarchy.  In addition to utilizing the existing FBCB2/BFT system, JBC-P system hardware consists of a family of computers (e.g., handhelds, tablets, ruggedized computers, beacons and in-dash computers), communications equipment (e.g., satellite transceivers/antennas), encryption devices (e.g., KGV-72), and ancillary equipment (e.g., Mission Data Loader, Disk Duplicator, cables, installation kits, etc.).

$3.748 million was programmed for FY11 RDTE to pay for JBC-P C2/SA Convergence.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>FY13 is a key year, with the Radar Digital Processor (RDP) development to support near term fielding.  RDP provides additional performance, to include Mode 5 IFF (Identification, Friend or Foe) to reduce fratricide potential.  The RDP and related software will begin fielding in FY15.  The FY14 Requirement for RDP testing and support is $17M less than the FY13 Requirement as the task completes.

Development and testing of the Upper Tier Debris Mitigation  and THAAD - Patriot interoperability efforts also peak in FY13, with the FY14 requirement $9M less than the FY13 requirement.  The anticipated fielding of THAAD underscores the growing complexity of the battle space and the greater need for integration between weapon systems.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Project 036:  Patriot is an advanced Surface-to-Air guided missile system with a high probability of kill capable of operation in the presence of Electronic Countermeasures (ECM) and able to conduct multiple simultaneous engagements against high performance air breathing targets and ballistic missiles likely to be encountered by US Forces.  The Patriot Product Improvement Program provides for the upgrade of the Patriot System through individual materiel changes.  The Patriot Product Improvement Program upgrades the Patriot system to address operational lessons learned, enhancements to joint force interoperability, and other system performance improvements to provide overmatch capability with the emerging threat.  Efforts will be made to expedite Patriot materiel solutions (e.g. Radar Digital Processor, Communications Upgrades, Radars on the Net) to both enhance capability and facilitate integration into the IAMD architecture.

Project 038 Avenger Product Improvement Program (PIP):  Avenger is a highly mobile and transportable surface-to-air missile/gun weapon system mated with a High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV).  Mounted on a turret are a .50 caliber M3P machine gun and two Standard Vehicle Missile Launchers (SVMLs).  Each SVML contains four STINGER missiles.  It is operated by a two-man crew for defense against Rotary Wing (RW) and fixed-Winged (FW) aircraft at low altitude, day or night, and in clear or adverse weather.    

The Avenger Product Improvement Program (PIP) provides for the design, development, integration and testing of new LRUs on the Avenger Weapon System.

STINGER Product Improvement: The STINGER Block I missile is an advanced, fire-and-forget, short-range, man-portable, air defense weapon system.  It provides low-altitude defense for ground forces against attack or aerial observation by low-flying Unmanned Aerial System (UAS), Cruise Missile (CM), RW, and FW threats.  STINGER employs an infrared (heat seeking)/ultraviolet seeker to guide to the target.  STINGER Block I missiles have extensive infrared counter-countermeasure capabilities and can engage targets from any aspect to include head-on.  The missile utilizes a high-explosive, hit-to-kill warhead.  STINGER can be fired from the shoulder or from a variety of platforms to include ground vehicles and helicopters.  The missile is delivered as a certified wooden round and requires no field testing or maintenance.  

The STINGER Product Improvement provides for design, development, test and integration of a proximity fuze assembly into existing Stinger Block I missiles. The proximity fuze assembly provides the capability to meet the Unmanned Aerial System Defense (UAS-D) requirements stated in the Operational Requirements Document for the STINGER Guided Missile System.  When integration is completed the Stinger Block I missile with the new developed proximity fuze assembly will have increased capability with a 10 year service life.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project 036:  Patriot is an advanced Surface-to-Air guided missile system with a high probability of kill capable of operation in the presence of Electronic Countermeasures (ECM) and able to conduct multiple simultaneous engagements against high performance air breathing targets and ballistic missiles likely to be encountered by US Forces.  The Patriot Product Improvement Program provides for the upgrade of the Patriot System through individual materiel changes. These improvements focus on the evolving threat and will provide a more robust capability and the foundation upon which future improvements can more readily be incorporated with minimal hardware changes. Efforts will be made to expedite Patriot materiel solutions (e.g. Radar Digital Processor, Communications Upgrades, Radars on the Net) to both enhance capability and facilitate integration into the IAMD architecture.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The design objective of the Patriot system was to provide a baseline system capable of modification to cope with continuing threat evolution.  This program minimizes technological risks and provides a means of enhancing system capability through planned upgrades of deployed systems.  The Patriot Product Improvement program upgrades the Patriot system to address operational lessons learned, enhancements to joint force interoperability and communications, and other system performance improvements to provide overmatch capability against the emerging threat.  Upgrades are implemented through individual hardware and software materiel changes and fielded incrementally. This program encompasses several changes which will require the use of a variety of acquisition methods to develop, test, procure and field.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The STINGER Block I missile is an advanced, fire-and-forget, short-range, man-portable, air defense weapon system.  It provides low-altitude defense for ground forces against attack or aerial observation by low-flying Unmanned Aerial System (UAS), Cruise Missile (CM), Rotary Wing (RW), and Fixed-Wing (FW) threats.  STINGER employs an infrared (heat seeking)/ultraviolet seeker to guide to the target.  STINGER Block I has extensive infrared counter-countermeasure capabilities and can engage targets from any aspect to include head-on.  The missile utilizes a high-explosive, hit-to-kill warhead.  STINGER can be fired from the shoulder or from a variety of platforms to include ground vehicles and helicopters.  The missile is delivered as a certified wooden round and requires no field testing or maintenance.

The STINGER Product Improvement provides for design, development, test and integration of a proximity fuze assembly into existing Stinger Block I missiles. The proximity fuze assembly provides the capability to meet the Unmanned Aerial System Defense (UAS-D) requirements stated in the Operational Requirements Document for the STINGER Guided Missile System.  When integration is completed the Stinger Block I missile with the new developed proximity fuze assembly will have increased capability with a 10 year service life.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>In FY 2012 the Stinger Based Systems (SBS) Product Office will award a proximity fuze development contract for the design, development, test and integration of a proximity fuze assembly into existing Stinger Block I missiles. The proximity fuze assembly provides the capability to meet the Unmanned Aerial System Defense (UAS-D) requirements stated in the Operational Requirements Document for the STINGER Guided Missile System.  When integration is completed the Stinger Block I missile with the new developed proximity fuze assembly will have increased capability with a 10 year service life.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

This program element supports development of critical improvements and insertion of technology upgrades to the Joint Tactical Ground Station (JTAGS) and the research and development of the JTAGS Pre-Planned Product Improvement (P3I). JTAGS is presently a transportable information processing system that receives and processes in-theater, direct down-linked data from Defense Support Program (DSP) satellites. JTAGS disseminates warning, alerting, and cueing information on Ballistic Missiles and other tactical events of interest throughout the theater using existing communication networks.  This program is designated as a DoD Space program.  JTAGS provides critical support by providing Combatant Commanders near real-time warning of theater ballistic missiles and other battle space characterization information in their Areas of Responsibility (AOR).  The four OCONUS deployed JTAGS units constitute the DoD's only in-theater system providing space-based warning.  JTAGS is designated as the in-theater element of the United States Strategic Command's Theater Event System. JTAGS supports all Theater Missile Defense pillars and by being located in-theater, provides the shortest sensor to shooter connectivity.  The objectives of the improvements are to upgrade JTAGS to a new configuration for operation with the next generation of Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) satellites, and to improve warning accuracy and timeliness.  These improvements will be accomplished in a two-Block P3I Program development effort.  Block 1 activities include Information Assurance (IA) upgrades:  Highly Elliptical Orbit (HEO) Automation Track Transfer (ATT) Integration bridging Initial Geosynchronous Capability (IGC); new commercial antennas; Source on Source (SoS) Upgrade; and SIPRNET capability. Utilizing FY12 and out years funding, Block 2 upgrades will be executed in two phases.  Phase 1 upgrade includes desheltering five systems and the reintegration of the various hardware/software/communication systems into operation centers and Geosynchronous (GEO) scanner capability (FY 13-14).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Under this program element, critical improvements will be developed making maximum use of Non-Developmental Items (NDI)/Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) components.  After design and integration, the system will be subject to a thorough developmental and limited user test (LUT) to verify performance, operational effectiveness and suitability.  All Block 1 activities (formerly known as Defense Support Program (DSP)-Only Multi-Mission Mobile Processor (M3P) (DM3P)) were rebaselined and resources refocused to maintain viability of JTAGS. Block 1 activites include Information Assurance (IA) upgrades; Highly Elliptical Orbit (HEO) Automation Track Transfer (ATT) Integration upgrades; and a bridging Initial Geosynchronous Capability (IGC); new commercial antennas; and SIPRNET capability. Utilizing FY12 and outyears funds, Block 2 upgrades will be executed in two phases.  Phase 1 upgrade includes desheltering five systems and the reintegration of the various hardware/software/communication systems into operation centers and Geosynchronous (GEO) scanner capability (FY 13-14).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Joint High Speed Vessel (JHSV) program is a merger of the Army's Theater Support Vessel (TSV) program and the Marine Corps/Navy High Speed intra-theater surface Connector (HSC) program into a joint (multi-service) High Speed Vessel program.
The JHSV program takes advantage of inherent commonality hull forms to create a more flexible asset for the Department of Defense and leverage the Navy's core competency in ship acquisition.  The JHSV program will provide high speed intra-theater surface connector capability to rapidly deploy troops and equipment together and then immediately transition to execute, even in the absence of developed infrastructure, and conduct deployment and sustainment activities in support of multiple simultaneous, distributed, decentralized battles and campaigns.  The primary missions include: support to Theater Security Cooperation Program (TSCP) and Global War on Terrorism (GWOT), littoral maneuver, and seabasing support.  Department of Army (DA) and Department of Navy (DoN) will maintain separate and distinct funding streams to support this joint program.  DA will resource to the critical Army requirement set validated for the joint Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) for High Speed Intra-theater Surface Connector (HSC)and the Capability Development Document (CDD) for JHSV .  DA and DoN will focus on the development of common capabilities, each Department will source their unique developmental costs for unique service capabilities that cannot be incorporated into a combined solution set. FY10/11 funding will procure for the Army Integrated Logistics Support (ILS)/Integrated Electronic Technical Manuals.(IETMs).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The JHSV program will combine the two separate programs (Theater Support Vessel (TSV) - Army and High Speed Connector (HSC) - Navy) and take advantage of inherent commonality of hull forms to create a more flexible asset for the Department of Defense.  Based on the efforts accomplished and data collected to date by the two services, it appears that a hardware solution will incorporate the evolutionary development of commercial based high speed vessel technology employing integrated military unique capabilities/adaptations.  The JHSV would be acquired competitively and production would be based in the United States.  The Joint High Speed Vessel (JHSV) program's updated Acquisition Strategy is currently under development.  The JHSV program Milestone A Defense Acquisition Board (DAB) was in April 2006. Milestone B occurred November 2008.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

This effort supports the development of a system that will help increase the user's recall (ability to extract relevant information) from disparaging sources and then process it to improve their understanding of the collected data.
FY10-11: Global Horizontal Integration (GHI) is a multi-phased Department of Defense Joint experiment, led by the Army, to build a capability for real-time fusion of multi-discipline and coalition intelligence available from tactical, operational, combined, and national levels.  GHI and the Information Dominance Center are complementary programs, with GHI applying IDC capabilities to Joint and Coalition environments.</r2:Remarks>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Cryptographic Modernization (CM) program supports the implementation of the National Security Agency (NSA) developed Communications Security (COMSEC) technologies into the Army by providing COMSEC system capabilities through encryption, trusted software or standard operating procedures, and integrating these mechanisms into specific systems in support of securing the National Network Enterprise.  This entails architecture studies, modeling and simulation, system integration, testing, certification, and accreditation of COMSEC systems and equipment.  COMSEC technology ensures total signal and data security for all Army information systems to include any operational enhancement and specialized Army configurations.  The program also assesses, develops, and integrates COMSEC tools (hardware and software) which provide protection for fixed infrastructure posts, camp or station networks as well as tactical networks.  The cited work is consistent with Strategic Planning Guidance and the Army Modernization Strategy.  The Army Key Management System (AKMS) automates key generation and distribution while supporting joint interoperability, providing communications and network planning with key management.

The program provides Commanders with an automated capability to plan, engineer, distribute, and manage all systems that employ Electronic Key, Electronic Protection (EP), and Signal Operating Instructions (SOI).

Army Key Management System (AKMS) consists of two Workstations, one hosting Local COMSEC Management Software (LCMS) for COMSEC Management, one hosting Automated Communication Engineering System (ACES) for Cryptonet Planning and the Simple Key Loader (SKL). LCMS is the COMSEC accounting and generation software that provides Information Systems with Cryptographic Key capability.  Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) will be replacing LCMS. KMI will provide an integrated operational environment that will bring essential key management personnel and functions in-band; achieving an integrated, over the network key management solution to support emerging cryptographically modernized systems. The KMI client nodes will be the Army?s subset of NSA?s Key Management Infrastructure System supporting DoD GIG Net Centric and Crypto Modernization Initiatives. The Mission Planning Mission Support System (MPMSS) Interface for KMI will create a secure and highly automated interface to enable transparent provisioning of KMI products.  This interface shall facilitate transparent communications between MPMSS and KMI to achieve integration between provisioning services and the communications net plan of the Warfighter. ACES provides Information Systems with Cryptonet Planning &amp; SOI/EP Fill for Combat Net. SKLs move the ACES/LCMS data to End Crypto Units (ECUs). The Next Generation Load Device (NGLD) Large is the fill device slated for use with the Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) Wideband Network Waveform(WNW) and Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW) radios, providing critical key fill and mission data set loading operations as well as preventing the need for additional redundant Software Loader Verifier (SLV) laptops in the field. The NGLD Large will support loading of Military GPS User Equipment (MGUE) which will replace all current Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module(SASSM) based GPS devices.  It meets the critical requirement for time to first fix.  The NGLD Large may also be used to configure WIN-T nodes. MIDS JTRS also intends to use this device for their fill requirements.  Its internal HAIPE process will allow users to pass black keys across SIPR without having to use the Electronic Key Distribution (EKD) process. The NGLD Large also has potential in meeting Over-The-Network-Keying (OTNK) requirements.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Provides Commander with an automated capability to plan, engineer, distribute, and manage all systems that employ Electronic Key, Electronic Protection (EP), and Signal Operating Instructions (SOI).
    - Army Key Management System (AKMS) AKMS consists of two Workstations, one hosting Local COMSEC Management Software (LCMS) for COMSEC Management, one hosting Automated Communication Engineering System (ACES) for Cryptonet Planning and the Simple Key Loader (SKL).
    - LCMS is the Communications Security (COMSEC) accounting and generation software that provides Information Systems with Cryptographic Key capability.
   -Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) will be replacing LCMS. KMI will provide an integrated operational environment that will bring essential key management personnel and functions in-band; achieving an integrated, over the network key management solution to support emerging cryptographically modernized systems. The KMI client nodes will be the Army?s subset of NSA?s Key Management Infrastructure System supporting DoD Global Information Grid (GIG) Net Centric and Crypto Modernization Initiatives. The Mission Planning Mission Support System (MPMSS) Interface for KMI will create a secure and highly automated interface to enable transparent provisioning of KMI products.  This interface shall facilitate transparent communications between MPMSS and KMI to achieve integration between provisioning services and the communications net plan of the Warfighter.
    - The Next Generation Load Device (NGLD) Large is the fill device slated to provide critical key fill and mission data set loading operations as well as preventing the need for additional redundant Software Loader Verifier (SLV) laptops in the field. The NGLD Large will support loading of Military GPS User Equipment (MGUE) which will replace all current Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM) based Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) devices.  It meets the critical requirement for time to first fix.  The NGLD Large may also be used to configure Warfighter Information Network- Tactical (WIN-T) nodes. Its internal High Assurance Internet Protocol Encryptor (HAIPE) process will allow users to pass black keys across Secure Internet Protocol, Router (SIPR) without having to use the Electronic Key Distribution (EKD) process. The NGLD Large also has potential in meeting Over-The-Network-Keying (OTNK) requirements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Biometrics (measurable physical and behavioral characteristics that enable the establishment and verification of an individual's identity), is a component within the Information System Security Program (ISSP).  Prior to FY11 there were two biometrics organizations executing funds described in this R Form:  the Biometrics Identity Management Agency (BIMA), formerly the Biometrics Task Force (BTF), and Program Manager (PM) Department of Defense (DoD) Biometrics.  Currently, only BIMA uses project 50B.

BIMA acts as the DoD proponent for biometrics; leads in the development and implementation of biometric technologies for Combatant Commands, Services, and Agencies; delivers capabilities in order to contribute to the enhancement of biometric community; increases Joint Service interoperability and; empowers the warfighter by improving operational effectiveness on the battlefield.

This program has no FY13 Base or OCO RDTE requirement.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:Text>BIMA solicits proposals for Biometric Technology Demonstrations (BTDs) with specified focus areas tailored to address current operational needs and capability gaps.  These BTDs promote the identification and transition of new or emergent biometric technologies that enhance biometrics-enabled capabilities in DoD.
BIMA utilizes memberships in research and development organizations as well as the annual Multiple Biometric Grand Challenge event to investigate, test and improve performance of biometric technologies and capabilities.  The current focus is on face and iris recognition technology on both still and video imagery through a series of challenge problems and evaluation using large sequestered data sets.
BIMA is required to use the Joint Interoperability Test Command to test biometric technologies and provide certification that biometric equipment is interoperable and can be utilized by all branches of the armed services and government.
BIMA uses RDTE contract labor and development projects to directly impact the efficiency and operation of the Automated Biometric Identification System.  Projects include Gallery Manager and Development of an Iris Quality Measurement Algorithm Tool.</r2:Text>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Global Combat Support System-Army (GCSS-Army) program has two components: a functional component titled GCSS-Army and a technology enabler component titled Army Enterprise Systems Integration Program (AESIP) (formerly Product Lifecycle Management Plus (PLM+)).  GCSS-Army coupled with AESIP are information and communications technology investments that will provide key enabling support to the transformation of the Army into a network-centric, knowledge-based future force.  The GCSS-Army approved Joint Capability Description Document (CDD) requires an enterprise approach to replace current logistics and maintenance Standard Army Management Information Systems (STAMIS). GCSS-Army will provide the Army's Sustainment Support (CS/CSS) warfighter with a seamless flow of timely, accurate, accessible and secure information management that gives combat forces a decisive edge. AESIP will provide the system's enterprise hub services, centralized master data management and cross-functional business intelligence/analytics.  GCSS-Army will implement best business practices to streamline supply, accountability, maintenance, distribution, and reporting procedures in support of the future force transition path of the Army Campaign Plan.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Global Combat Support System-Army will provide the Army's Tactical warfighter with a seamless flow of timely, accurate, accessible, actionable, and secure information not readily available today that gives combat forces a decisive edge.  GCSS-Army will modernize automated logistics by implementing best business practices to streamline supply operations, maintenance operations, property accountability, and tactical logistics and financial management and integration procedures in support of the Future Force transition path of the Army Campaign Plan.  This effort will implement a comprehensive logistics automation solution for the field (deployable) and installation level Army and provide the Commander on the battlefield with an integrated, interoperable view of the battle-space in time to support decisions that will affect the outcome of combat operations.  Further, it will allow the Army to meet statutory requirements for auditability.  This solution implements Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) products from SAP AG.  This will also allow the Army to retire multiple custom designed stand-alone business software baselines optimized to existing Army business processes and replace them with a single integrated business software baseline that has been optimized to industry defined best business practices.  GCSS-Army is a key component of the Federated ERP Integration solution that will optimize tactical logistics and finance domain business processes into a single federated approach.  It will eliminate the need for extensive maintenance and modification of aging, diverse software systems resulting in improved and efficient change control and configuration management through implementation of an enterprise system.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>GCSS-Army has an evolutionary acquisition strategy as defined in DoD Directive 5000.01 and DoD Instruction 5000.02 and will define, develop and produce/deploy an initial, militarily useful (and supportable) operational capability based upon proven technology, time-phased requirements, projected threat assessments, and demonstrated manufacturing capabilities in as short a time as possible.  The system will be developed in multiple releases as functional capabilities are defined and as integration and synchronization opportunities with related systems present opportunities for subsequent releases.  Release 1.2 will be a viable stand alone capability that will not require subsequent releases to be operational.  

GCSS-Army is being implemented in three releases to ensure program success. 

Release 1.0 replaces: Standard Army Retail Supply System (SARSS) at one Direct Support Unit (DSU) in the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment (ACR), Fort Irwin, California. An Operational Assessment (OA) was conducted on Release 1.0 and information is gathered through Continuous Evaluation. 

Release 1.1 includes: Supply (Tactical and Installation Warehouse and Materiel Management); Field-level Maintenance; Property Accountability (Property Book, Unit Level Supply, and Unit Basic Load Ammunition); Force Element and Defense Forces Public Security (Allows Task Organization of Personnel, Equipment and Associated Property Accountability, Maintenance and Finance Actions); Store and Forward capability; Interoperability with STAMIS systems; Tactical and Installation Finance (Cost Management, Funds Distribution and Execution, Fund Status Reporting, and General Fund Enterprise Business System (GFEBS) Data Synchronization); Hub services; and Enterprise Master Data Management. Release 1.1 provides over 80% of the required GCSS-Army capability; it subsumes Release 1.0 and replaces the SARSS, Property Book Unit Supply Enhanced (PBUSE), Standard Army Maintenance System - Enhanced (SAMS-E) and Standard Army Maintenance System Installation Enhanced (SAMS-IE) legacy systems. 

Release 1.2 provides enhanced capabilities such as disconnected operations,increased financial capabilities, expanded enterprise master data management, installation based maintenance and is prepared to receive a bolt-on aviation maintenance system. Rel 1.2 does not by itself replace any additional Systems. Rel 1.2 represents the complete
baseline with all required capabilities provided.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Army Enterprise Systems Integration Program (AESIP), mission is to integrate Army business processes by providing a single source for enterprise hub services, centralized master data management, and business intelligence and analytics.  AESIP will support the Army's federated approach and enable the integration of end-to-end logistical and financial processes. The Army has successfully addressed concerns about the lack of integration of ERPs by leveraging AESIP core capabilities and expanding those benefits across the Army enterprise. AESIP will be an Army specific commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) web portal implementation via the NetWeaver Platform from developer Systems Applications and Products (SAP) American Group to support Army process scenarios and requirements that will provide core competencies:

Enterprise Service Bus (Hub Services) - For a Service oriented, Single Point of Entry to connect, mediate, and control the exchange of data.
Enterprise Business Intelligence/Business Warehouse - Aggregates data from ERP and non-ERP systems to provide flexible Enterprise level reporting.
Enterprise Master Data Management - For a single source of authoritative data and improved workflow and business processes. 

Hence, the AESIP solution establishes a framework for a fully integrated ERP centric environment that will ultimately provide Commanders Total Visibility from Factory to Foxhole thereby ensuring delivery of the right equipment to the right unit at the right time, while reducing backlogs of material on the battlefield.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>Change Summary Explanation:  Funding - FY 2013 : Funding increased to support Transportable Tactical Command Communications (T2C2).</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Military Satellite Communication (MILSATCOM) systems are joint program/project efforts to satisfy ground mobile requirements for each Service, the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), the National Command Authority, the combatant commanders, the Office of the Secretary of Defense, and other governmental, non-DoD users.  The worldwide MILSATCOM systems are: the Super High Frequency (SHF) Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS); the Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS); the MILSTAR Extremely High Frequency (EHF) Low Data Rate (LDR) and Medium Data Rate (MDR); the Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF); and future MILSATCOM capabilities. All of these systems are required to support legacy, interim and emerging communication space architectures and Future Force requirements. The Army is responsible for materiel development, acquisition, product improvement, testing, fielding and integrated logistics support of ground satellite terminals and SATCOM control subsystems and all associated equipment used to provide range extension of Mission Command Networks and Systems. The Army also participates in the development of MILSATCOM programs, including architectures, payloads, waveforms, antennas and terminal developments to ensure US Army equities are appropriately addressed with our sister services.  This includes technology assessment efforts associated with the integration of MILSATCOM components to US Army Landwarnet. This responsibility also includes maintaining the life cycle logistics support required to achieve end-to-end connectivity and interoperability, satisfying JCS network operations in support of the President, JCS, combatant commanders, Military Departments, Department of State, and other government Departments and Agencies.

This program is designated as a DoD Space Program.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>FY12 funding finances PM DCATS netcentric systems engineering, modem risk mitigation, Joint SATCOM Engineering Center (JSEC) Lab efforts and DoD Information Assurance Certification Accreditation Process (DIACAP) support.  Funding provides for SATCOM terminal upgrades, enhancement of baseband throughput capabilities, technology insertion and upgrades which enhance decision support capabilities, allowing for full utilization of Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) capabilities.  Both the Wideband SATCOM Operational Management System (WSOMS) and the Enterprise Wideband SATCOM Terminal System (EWSTS) Capability Production Documents (CPDs) contain Netcentric-Ready Key Performance Parameters (NR-KPPs) as required by CJCSI 6212.01C.  Netcentric efforts are required to facilitate the migration from the current trunk-based communications systems to Internet Protocol (IP) based systems and to engineer, test and integrate IP based capabilities into EWSTS and WSOMS systems.  Studies, risk mitigation, system integration and advanced demonstrations for netcentric baseband and policy based control will accommodate technology insertion, data sharing, remote operations, architecture efforts and use of commercial technology, thus ensuring the life of the Defense Enterprise Wideband System (DEWSS) terminal family beyond 2025 and reducing lifecycle costs and enterprise requirements on the WGS and Defense Satellite Communication System (DSCS) satellites in the future.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>This project funds advanced systems engineering, research, development, test and evaluation of new and emerging technologies to optimize terminal performance and communications control.  Once the technologies are mature and deemed feasible, funding and management responsibility for implementation of the technology will transition to Army PORs.

The funds provided for T2C2 will be used to achieve Material Development Decision (MDD) and conduct an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA). The AoA will evaluate at least two competitive non-development commercial capabilities that can be rapidly integrated into existing communications architecture.  If the AoA shows a low cost commercial system can meet Army requirements, T2C2 would proceed directly to Milestone C.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Global Command and Control System-Army (GCCS-A):  This project is the Army component system that directly supports the implementation of the Global Command and Control System Family of Systems.  GCCS-A provides automated command and control tools for Army Strategic and Operational Theater Commanders to enhance warfighter capabilities throughout the spectrum of conflict during joint and combined operations in support of the National Security.  The GCCS-A developed software systems dramatically improves the Army's ability to analyze courses of action; develop and manage Army Forces; and ensure feasibility of war plans. GCCS-A provides a client-server layered architecture and functional best-of-breed software applications to develop a totally integrated component of the Global Command and Control System Family of Systems that integrates the GCCS-Joint picture with the Army Battle Command Systems.  The GCCS-A strategic tools have been modernized and replaced by Defense Readiness Reporting System - Army (DRRS-A), a suite of web based applications for Army Readiness, Force Registration and Force Projection.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Global Command and Control System-Army (GCCS-A):  This project is the Army component of the Global Command and Control System Family of Systems (FoS).  GCCS-A provides automated command and control tools, including Force readiness, planning and movement, and situational awareness, for Army Strategic and Operationa Theater commanders to enhance warfighter capabilities throughout the spectrum of conflict during Joint and combined operations in support of National Security. GCCS-A dramatically improves the Army's ability to analyze courses of action, develop and manage Army forces and execute war plans. GCCS-A links the GCCS-J Common Operating Picture with the Army Mission Command systems. GCCS-A will be modernized to meet evolving requirements to enterprise and web based architectures. GCCS-A strategic tools for readiness reporting have been modernized and replaced with the Defense Readiness Reporting System - Army (DRRS-A), a suite of web based applications for Army Readiness, Force Registration and Force Projection.  Defense Readiness Report System - Army (DRRS-A) will implement the Global Force Management Data Initiative (GFM DI) for consumption of authoritative force structure data.

In response to the Congressional direction (Section 247 of Fiscal Year 2010 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA)), GCCS-A will be included in the modernization of command and control systems within the Department of Defense (DoD) under the Joint Command and Control (JC2) framework. While sustaining and synchronizing current fielded operations, the Army will modernize and enhance current capabilities to support both the Service and Joint warfighter as part of a synchronized, orchestrated DoD wide effort that will transition the GCCS FoS into a more agile, net-centric, service oriented environment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>GCCS-A was slated for replacement by the future DoD Command and Control (C2) system, the Net Enabled Command Capability (NECC) program.  The NECC program was cancelled by the Defense Acquisition Executive (DAE) on 2 November 2009.  Under current plans, GCCS-A will be modernized to meet the requirements defined in the JC2 Capability Development Document (CDD), as well as align with the Joint and Army Enterprise architectures and Common Operating Environment (COE) standards.

GCCS-A must be maintained as a system until replaced by a new joint command and control capability. Based on the JC2 AoA determination, services are directed to transform the GCCS Family of Systems to a more agile, net-centric, service oriented environment. Post-AoA activities are on-going to determine the specific modernization efforts required to address the JC2 capabilities and the management and governance processes to implement them.  Product Manager, Strategic Mission Command, remains actively engaged in the "Path Forward" planning activities.  This provides an avenue to raise issues and make recommendations to assure that the Army's interests are protected and the GCCS-A program modernization is adequately defined and supported

In accordance with the Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) requirements document approved in 2008, entitled GCCS-A Mission Command Essential Capability, software capability will be developed in 2-year increments as capability sets designed to Collaborate, Collapse and Converge Mission Command products.  The product development funded under this R-Form is an integral part of the Mission Command System of Systems, under a strategy designed to optimize opportunity for improved interoperability among the systems, to capture the benefits of competition where possible and to ensure the rapid integration of new capability into warfighter systems.  This strategy is designed to reduce the physical footprint, logistics support requirements and increase operational efficiency.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Project 114: Tactical Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (TUAV) Shadow 200 provides the Army Brigade Commander with dedicated Reconnaissance, Surveillance and Target Acquisition (RSTA), Intelligence, Battle Damage Assessment (BDA) and Force Protection. The Shadow provides the Brigade Commander with critical battlefield intelligence and targeting information in the rapid cycle time required for success at the tactical level. The TUAV Shadow system air vehicle meets the required operating range of 50 kilometers and remains on station for up to nine hours with the re-wing configuration. The TUAV Shadow system consists of four air vehicles (each configured with an Electro Optical/Infrared (EO/IR) sensor payload), launcher, ground control and support equipment including: power generation, communications equipment, automated recovery equipment, one system remote video terminals, vehicle mounted shelters, and High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles with trailer(s). Each system is equipped with one Maintenance Section Multifunctional (MSM) and is supported at the division level by a Mobile Maintenance Facility (MMF). 

Project 11A, The STARLite Synthetic Aperture Radar/Ground Moving Target Indicator (SAR/GMTI) payload is a lightweight, high performance, all weather, multi-functional radar system for the Gray Eagle Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS). The STARLite system provides wide area, near real time Reconnaissance, Surveillance and Target Acquisition (RSTA) capabilities. It operates throughout the UAS flight mission profile in adverse weather and through battlefield obscurants.  The Common Sensor Payload (CSP), an Electro Optical Infra Red w/Laser Designator (EO/IR/LD) system, also for the Gray Eagle, provides a day/night capability to collect and display continuous imagery with the ability to designate targets of interest for attack by laser guided precision weapons.  Additional initiatives will continue to focus on the transition of technologies directly supporting emerging requirements and the Army's Current and Future Force.  This effort has been expanded to include High Definition (HD) and Target Location Accuracy (TLA) capability.
 
Project 11B, The Tactical Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) Payload (TSP) is a SIGINT sensor, currently under development for the Gray Eagle that detects radio frequency (RF) emitters. The TSP system will provide a SIGINT capability to the tactical commander.  The TSP system will be a modular, scalable payload using an architecture that is software reconfigurable to allow for growth and flexibility as technology, and as the adversaries use of technology, changes.  The TSP system improves situational awareness and shortens the targeting cycle by detecting and identifying emitters associated with high value targets (HVTs). The TSP system is capable of processing conventional signals, standard military signals, and modern signals of interest.

Project 123:  The Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Joint Technology Center/Systems Integration Laboratory (JTC/SIL) is a Joint facility that develops, integrates, and supports the enhancement of its Multiple Unified Simulation Environment (MUSE) capability for Army systems and operational concepts.  The JTC/SIL conducts prototype hardware and software development, builds the UAS Institutional Mission Simulator (IMS) trainers for the Shadow, Hunter, and ERMP programs, and provides modeling and simulation support. The MUSE is a real-time, operator in-the-loop simulation that may be integrated with larger simulations in support of Army and Joint training and exercises.  The MUSE is also employed as a Mission Rehearsal Tool for ongoing combat operations.  This project funds the management of the JTC/SIL and MUSE enhancements. 
 
Project D10:  The Small Unmanned Aircraft System (SUAS) provides the battalion and below ground maneuver elements critical situational awareness and enhances force protection.  The system provides the small unit commander an organic and responsive tactical Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and Target Acquisition (RSTA) capability through the ability to view real-time Full Motion Video (FMV) and sensor data via the system ground control station.  Other compatible receivers, such as the One Station Remote Video Terminal (OSRVT) and appropriately equipped manned platforms may also receive the SUAS products.

A SUAS includes three aircraft that must be launched by hand or by some other means that does not require an improved launch/recovery location.  In addition to the aircraft, the system contains ground support equipment, which includes an interoperable hand controller.  This equipment is fully transportable in or on rucksack type packs that are organic to the unit.   

The SUAS RDT&amp;E budget line includes funding for studies and incremental development/upgrade of current SUAS capabilities that will capitalize on new technology insertions based on identified user requirements.  Past improvements include a Digital Data Link capability, introdu</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Tactical Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (TUAV) Shadow 200 provides the Army Brigade Commander with dedicated Reconnaissance, Surveillance and Target Acquisition (RSTA), Intelligence, Battle Damage Assessment (BDA) and Force Protection. The Shadow provides the Brigade Commander with critical battlefield intelligence and targeting information in the rapid cycle time required for success at the tactical level.

Each system is equipped with one Maintenance Section Multifunctional (MSM) and is supported at the division level by a Mobile Maintenance Facility (MMF). 

All 102 Shadow UAS systems have been procured and 93 have been fielded. Shadow has amassed over 709,000 total flight hours, most of which were flown in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF). The Shadow UAS began being deployed to OIF in 2003 and to OIF in 2006. Incremental upgrades are required for continued improvement and interoperability. Common Systems Integration is required to ensure interoperability with other manned and unmanned weapon systems, to include One System Remote Video Transceiver (OSRVT). Continued developmental improvements are required to provide greater interoperability, increase operational capability and flexibility to the Brigade Combat Team. Modifications to the airframe, avionics, payloads, ground control equipment, and support equipment are based on documented requirements and lessons learned units operating in OEF and OIF. 

Justification:  

FY2013 RQ-7 UAV Base funding of $31.158 million will be used for Capability Improvements, specifically: Engine improvements (engine development), Air Vehicle modifications (small mission computer development, weatherization, improved fuel system (vented), GPS Denied Operations and redundant avionics development), and Ground Equipment (interoperability) improvements. Additionally, funds will be for System Engineering, Program Management, Software Architecture and Reliability Solutions and System Test and Evaluation support. Funds will also be used to conduct the Increment II OSRVT Limited User Test (LUT), and other applicable OSRVT test events.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>A System Capability Demonstration (SCD) was conducted with four contractors.  The results from the SCD in conjunction with proposal evaluations resulted in the competitive down select of a Best Value TUAS.  A successful Milestone II ASARC was conducted 21 Dec 99 and a Milestone III Decision 25 Sep 02.  The full rate production contract was awarded 27 Dec 02, and all 102 systems were procured by FY2009.  Continued development of the selected TUAV system will be accomplished through a series of modifications and retrofits such as Tactical Common Data Link (TCDL), Communications Relay, Laser Designator, Larger engine, Larger fuselage, and reliability upgrades. Development/integration of these improved capabilities will be through individual efforts on sole source cost-plus fixed fee engineering services contract with the Shadow prime contractor and competitive contracts.  Development of the larger engine will be accomplished through a competitive process.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Tactical Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (TUAV) budget line is a shared funding line between multiple Payload programs.  These Payload programs support the Army's transformation by developing Reconnaissance, Surveillance and Target Acquisition (RSTA) and Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) payload systems for brigade combat teams, divisions, and corps Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS).  This is in accordance with Headquarters Department of the Army (HQDA) and Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) UAS priorities.  

Small Tactical Radar - Lightweight (STARLite) Synthetic Aperture Radar/Ground Moving Target Indicator (SAR/GMTI) is a lightweight, high performance, all weather, multi-functional radar system for the Gray Eagle Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS). The STARLite system provides wide area, near real time Reconnaissance, Surveillance and Target Acquisition (RSTA) capabilities. It operates throughout the UAS flight mission profile in adverse weather and through battlefield obscurants. The SAR mode generates quality images for the battlefield commander for detection, classification and location of stationary commercial wheeled vehicle-size targets. The GMTI mode detects moving ground targets, provides location information and performs cross-cue with the Electro-Optic/Infrared (EO/IR) sensors. 

Common Sensor Payload (CSP) - Electro Optical / Infra Red / Laser Designator (EO/IR/LD) provides day/night capability to collect and display continuous imagery with the ability to designate targets of interest for attack by laser guided precision weapons.  It is the EO/IR/LD sensor for Gray Eagle UAS which supports force applications, battlespace awareness, force protection, and net-centric operations across the battlefield to provide wide area, near real time RSTA capabilities.   Additional initiatives will continue to focus on the transition of technologies directly supporting emerging requirements and the Army's Current and Future Force.  CSP is being procured for the Gray Eagle UAS program and has potential application to other platforms.  

CSP High Definition (HD) is the first capability enhancement for the CSP which will provide the commander with HD Full Motion Video (FMV) in both the Electro-optical and Mid-wave IR spectrums for improved battlefield situation awareness and identification of high value targets.  All Gray Eagle platforms will be equipped with CSP HD.

CSP Target Location Accuracy (TLA) is the final upgrade to the current capability and provides all of the CSP HD functionality but with significantly improved targeting accuracy.  CSP TLA provides the Battlefield Commander a vastly improved TLA allowing timely use of Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMs) and Coordinate Seeking Weapons (CSWs) across the battlespace.  CSP TLA is being procured as an upgraded capability for the Gray Eagle UAS program and can be integrated onto other manned and unmanned aerial platforms.  All Gray Eagle platforms will be equipped with the CSP TLA capability.

The Tactical Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) Payload (TSP) is a SIGINT sensor, currently under development for the Gray Eagle that detects radio frequency (RF) emitters. The TSP system will provide a SIGINT capability to the tactical commander.  The TSP system will be a modular, scalable payload using an architecture that is software reconfigurable to allow for growth and flexibility as technology, and as the adversaries use of technology, changes. The TSP system improves situational awareness and shortens the targeting cycle by detecting and identifying emitter associated with high value targets (HVTs). The TSP system is capable of processing conventional signals, standard military signals, and modern signals of interest.

FY 2013 base development dollars in the amount of $6.247 million is for the continued integration and test of the CSP HD upgrade as well as the initial pre-contract award efforts for TLA.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>STARLite SAR/GMTI is a threshold requirement for the Gray Eagle UAS.  The acquisition strategy for STARLite program was based on a full and open competition for the Army.  A five year competitive production contract was awarded in April 2008 to Northrop Grumman for the build, integration, test and delivery of STARLite systems with preplanned improvements for Extended Range and Increased Reliability.  STARLite will support the Gray Eagle UAS Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) event planned for 4th Quarter FY 2012.  No additional development dollars are planned for STARLite in FY 2013 as the program will be in Full Rate Production (FRP).

Common Sensor Payload (CSP) EO/IR/LD is a KPP (Key Performance Parameter) requirement for the Gray Eagle UAS.  The acquisition strategy for the CSP program was based on a full and open competition for the Army.  It was briefed and approved at the Army Systems Acquisition Review Council (ASARC) in Dec 2006.  A competitive contract was awarded in Nov 2007 to Raytheon for the build, integration, test and delivery of the CSP.  CSP will support the Gray Eagle UAS IOT&amp;E event planned for 4th Quarter FY 2012.  No additional development dollars are planned for CSP baseline in FY 2013 as the program will be in FRP.  

CSP High Definition (HD) is an upgrade to the baseline CSP program which is planned for final development, testing and integration in FY 2012. The development will conclude with a Developmental Test (DT) in early FY 2013 and a production cut-in decision will be briefed to the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) prior to the FY 2013 CSP HD production buy.  A retrofit is also planned for award in FY 2013 to bring all of the previously procured CSP baseline systems up to the HD configuration.

CSP TLA is a directed requirement for the Gray Eagle platform with enhanced capabilities addressed in the Joint Requirement Oversight Council Memorandum (JROCM 051-09).  The approved acquisition strategy for the development of this new capability is a sole source task order through the competitively awarded Navy Basic Order Agreement (BOA) with Raytheon that will provide seven integration and test assets.  These assets will be used to fully test and integrate this new capability onto the Gray Eagle platform.  Once the TLA upgrade has been fully integrated and tested, the program can enter Milestone C and begin production and replacement of the baseline CSP system.  The entire Gray Eagle fleet will be retrofitted to the CSP TLA variant.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Tactical Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) Payload (TSP) is a SIGINT sensor, currently under development for the Gray Eagle that detects radio frequency (RF) emitters. The TSP system will provide a SIGINT capability to the tactical commander.  The TSP system will be a modular, scalable payload using an architecture that is software reconfigurable to allow for growth and flexibility as technology, and as the adversaries use of technology, changes.  This flexible architecture allows for third party software applications to be integrated into the TSP system.  The TSP system is a complementary system to the aerial and terrestrial Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) layers through direct interface with the Distributed Common Ground System-Army (DCGS-A) Information and Intelligence Enterprise (DI2E).  It supports Manned/Unmanned (MUM) teaming with Brigade Combat Team ground SIGINT Terminal Guidance (STG) teams and manned airborne assets.  The TSP system improves situational awareness and shortens the targeting cycle by detecting and identifying emitters associated with high value targets (HVTs).

The TSP system is capable of processing conventional signals, standard military signals, and modern signals of interest.  This includes detection, recognition, identification, direction finding, and high confidence geo-location.  The TSP system operates in two modes, passive and active to provide an enhanced Aerial Precision Geolocation (APG) capability.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>TSP is a threshold requirement for the MQ-1C Gray Eagle UAS. The TSP program entered the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase with a Milestone B decision in September 2011. The TSP Program EMD contract award was based on full-and-open competition and was focused on integration and test onto the Gray Eagle platform and integration and test of TSP software into the Distributed Common Ground System-Army (DCGS-A). The TSP EMD program is a derivative of systems that are currently fielded on the Hunter UAS and a variety of other manned platforms. The demonstrated scalability of these fielded materiel solutions allows the TSP EMD program to leverage efforts that directly support the TSP EMD program.


The TSP programs acquisition strategy has been modified to accommodate the FY 2012 Appropriation that reduces the 11B Funding Line by $14.100 Million. The TSP program is following an incremental acquisition strategy with a TSP Block 0, Block 1 and Block 2.   

The TSP Block 0 will provide an early TSP operational capability for the Gray Eagle program. 

The TSP Block 1 is the current Program of Record that entered EMD in FY 2011.  

Beginning in FY 2016, the TSP Block 2 effort will address System enhancements and upgrades as the threat and technology evolves.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Joint Technology Center/Systems Integration Laboratory (JTC/SIL) is a Joint facility that develops, integrates, and supports the enhancement of its Multiple Unified Simulation Environment (MUSE) capability for Army systems and operational concepts.  The JTC/SIL conducts prototype hardware and software development, builds the UAS Institutional Mission Simulator (IMS) trainers for the Shadow, Hunter, and ERMP programs, and provides modeling and simulation support. The MUSE is a real-time, operator in-the-loop simulation that may be integrated with larger simulations in support of Army and Joint training and exercises.  The MUSE is also employed as a Mission Rehearsal Tool for ongoing combat operations.  This project funds the management of the JTC/SIL and MUSE enhancements.  

This system supports the Legacy to Objective transition path of the Transformation Campaign Plan (TCP).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Small Unmanned Aircraft System (SUAS) provides the battalion and below ground maneuver elements critical situational awareness and enhances force protection.  The system provides the small unit commander an organic and responsive tactical Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and Target Acquisition (RSTA) capability through the ability to view real-time Full Motion Video (FMV) and sensor data via the system ground control station.  Other compatible receivers, such as the One Station Remote Video Terminal (OSRVT) and appropriately equipped manned platforms may also receive the SUAS products.

A SUAS includes three aircraft that must be launched by hand or by some other means that does not require an improved launch/recovery location.  In addition to the aircraft, the system contains ground support equipment, which includes an interoperable hand controller.  This equipment is fully transportable in or on rucksack type packs that are organic to the unit.   

The SUAS RDT&amp;E budget line includes funding for studies and incremental development/upgrade of current SUAS capabilities that will capitalize on new technology insertions based on identified user requirements.  Past improvements include a Digital Data Link capability, introduced in 2010, which provided data link security, increased the number of communications channels allowing more aircraft to operate in close proximity, extended range through data link relay capability, and integrated advanced digital payloads.  Future enhancements will follow the natural progression of technology and exploitation of improved payloads to meet warfighter needs.  FY 2013 and future improvements will be in the areas of:  continued communications link encryption; gimbaled payloads; software blocking integration; common hand controller development and integration; ADS-B integration; and noise reduction.

Justification: 

FY 2013 engineering services efforts will continue to focus on communication link encryption, GPS Denied / Comms Denied Navigation, Autonomous Air Vehicle behaviors, Simulator upgrades, ADS-B integration, and noise reduction.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Distributed Common Ground System - Army (DCGS-A) is the Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) System of Systems (SoS) for Joint, Interagency, Allied, Coalition, and National data analysis, sharing and collaboration.  The core functions of DCGS-A are:  the vertical and horizontal synchronization of ISR Processing, Exploitation and Dissemination (PED) efforts; operations in a networked environment at multiple security levels; the control of select Army and joint sensor systems; the fusion of all acquired data and information, and distribution of relevant red (threat), gray (non-aligned), and environmental (weather and terrain) information; and providing the Warfighters' early warning and targeting capability.  DCGS-A provides a single integrated ISR ground processing system composed of common components that are interoperable with sensors, other information sources, all Warfighting Functions, and the Defense Information &amp; Intelligence Enterprise (DI2E).  DCGS-A is fielded in Fixed and Mobile configurations emphasizing the use of reach and split based operations by improving accessibility of data in order to reduce forward deployed footprint.  As enhanced capabilities are developed and tested, annual software releases are integrated into Army Common/commodity hardware and fielded to units IAW the Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) process.

FY13 Base funding in the amount of $40.876 million will be used for development of the Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE) as the Lead for PEO IEW&amp;S.  As such, DCGS-A is currently aligning its architecture to fit within the Common Operating Environment (COE) as described by the ASA(ALT) COE Implementation Plan.  This alignment is in accordance with the G-3/5/7 priority to align all Army networks, procurements, and enhancements under one COE and one vision.

DCGS-A software will be tailored by echelon and scalable to each unit's mission.  DCGS-A provides commanders and staffs the ability to maintain an accurate and up to date understanding of the operational environment.  DCGS-A's contributions to commanders' visualization and situational awareness, rapid planning, and the synchronization of all warfighting functions, enable Army units to operate within the enemy's decision cycle.  This capability enhances tactical and operational maneuver and the conduct of full spectrum operations across the range of military operations from humanitarian to major combat operations.

The DCGS-A configurations range from laptops to systems integrated in tactical shelters and mounted on tactical vehicles to large commodity servers operating in a Cloud Processing Architecture.  Main Cloud nodes will be placed in data centers strategically located across the globe, while tactical edge Cloud nodes will be integrated within select existing equipment currently on units Modified Tables of Organization &amp; Equipment (MTOE).  The fundamental intent and tenet of this approach is to reduce forward deployed equipment/footprint by co-locating the advanced analytics capabilities within the DCGS-A baseline with the regional data centers, where the data is stored.  This infrastructure consolidation simultaneously reduces processor and communications requirements in tactical units by limiting the number of large data files transported across tactical communications systems.  The first DCGS-A Cloud node reached its initial operating capability in Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) in FY11. The design, development, and initial deployment of prototype tactical edge nodes will be in 4QFY11.  Following a successful operational assessment and Milestone C in 2QFY12/Full Deployment Decision in 4QFY12, DCGS-A Software Baseline (DSB) 1.0 capability will be deployed throughout the Army.

DCGS-A consolidates, enhances, and modernizes the tasking, processing, exploitation, and dissemination (TPED) capabilities formerly found in nine Army intelligence programs of record and two Quick Reaction Capabilities.  DCGS-A provides these technologically advanced PED capabilities in tailored and scalable mobile and fixed configurations in all maneuver and maneuver support units from Company Intelligence Support Team to Army Service Component Command, and in select maneuver sustainment units battalion and above.  The program also will develop software packages to be embedded in mission command and other select systems to provide required ISR/analytic capabilities.  DCGS-A is a key component of the DoD ISR Task Force modernization efforts and a critical Army priority.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Distributed Common Ground System-Army (DCGS-A) program was created in response to the Department of Defense (DoD) Distributed Common Ground/Surface System (DCGS) Mission Area Initial Capabilities Document (MA ICD) dated 13 Aug 2004, which captured the overarching requirements for an Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) Family of Systems (FoS) that will contribute to Joint and combined Warfighter needs. That ICD was updated as the Distributed Common Ground/Surface System (DCG/SS) Enterprise ICD, and approved by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) 27 Feb 2009. The Army requirements were refined in the DCGS-A Capabilities Development Document (CDD), and approved by the JROC 31 Oct 2005. The DCGS-A program is currently in the Engineering, Manufacturing and Development (EMD) phase and was designated as a Major Automated Information System (MAIS) in OSD (AT&amp;L) Memorandum, 29 Mar 2010. 

DCGS-A is following an evolutionary acquisition approach to develop and field system capabilities over time to satisfy the requirements of the DCGS-A Capability Development Document (CDD). Following this approach, the first increment was defined and a Capability Production Document (CPD) was created with full consideration of all of the preceding supporting documents and analysis. As part of its initial staffing, a Cost Benefit Analysis was completed in support of the DCGS-A CPD. This analysis projected a significant cost avoidance/savings over the life cycle by not limiting the hardware configuration to a one size fits all unit types design but rather integrating the DCGS-A SW capabilities into common servers and other IT components fielded at that echelon. This approach was included in the CPD and updated DCGS-A Acquisition Strategy. The CPD was approved by the JROC on 20 Dec 2011.

The DCGS-A System Engineering Plan (SEP) updated the current development plan and was approved by OASD (R&amp;E) on 5 Dec 2011. The DCGS-A Revised Acquisition Strategy (AS) is awaiting approval by the Defense Acquisition Executive (DAE). It is anticipated the DCGS-A Acquisition Program Baseline will be approved in 2Q12. The DCGS-A program is currently preparing for a milestone C in 2Q12 and an operational test in 2Q-3Q12 and subsequent FDD decision in 4Q12.  

PM DCGS-A has been designated as the Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE) Lead for PEO IEW&amp;S. As such, DCGS-A is currently aligning it's architecture to fit within the Common Operating Environment (COE) as described by the ASA(ALT) COE Implementation Plan. This alignment is in accordance with the G-3/5/7 priority to align all Army networks, procurements, and enhancements under one COE and one vision. Our acquisition strategy supports this initiative as we continue to collapse PORs and reduce footprint following our capability migration path and iterative development approach in support of an "IT Box" requirements prioritization process. As we continue the path to DSB 1.0 and beyond, each release will focus on the COE and continually align the Command Post activities with DCGS-A Cloud, Edge Node, and POR migration activities.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The production MQ-1C Gray Eagle Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) has changed based on new Army Guidance from a company sized unit equipped with twelve (12) Unmanned Aircraft (UA) and associated support equipment to balanced Platoons, each capable of operating independently with four (4) Aircraft.  Each will be equipped with a Standard Equipment Package (SEP), Ground Equipment and the following Payloads: Electro-Optical/Infrared, Laser Range Finder/Laser Designator (EO/IR/LRF/LD), communications relay, and up to four (4) HELLFIRE Missiles.  The SEP includes: two (2) Universal Ground Control Stations (UGCS), two (2) Ground Data Terminal?s (GDT?s), one (1) Satellite Communication (SATCOM) Ground Data Terminal (SGDT), one (1) Portable Ground Control Station (PGCS), one (1) Portable Ground Data Terminal (PGDT),  one (1) Automatic Take-off and Landing System (ATLS) set which includes (2) Tactical Automatic Landing Systems (TALS), and ground support equipment. 

Ground Based Sense and Avoid (GBSAA) provides a solution to the ?See and Avoid? issues associated with gaining access to the National Airspace System (NAS) for UAS.  GBSAA is a ground-based means of detecting airborne traffic and providing the necessary intelligence to the UAS, allowing it to Sense and Avoid (SAA) as an alternate means of compliance with CFR Part 91.

Justification: FY 2013 funding of $74,618 million will provide for software/hardware fixes identified from the Initial Test and Evaluation (IOTE) in FY2012. It will provide funding to conduct the Follow-On Test and Evaluation (FOTE) for the Universal Ground Control Station (UGCS) and the Universal Ground Data Terminal, GBSAA development, testing and integration of the Phase I Plus systems.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Extended Range Multi-Purpose (ERMP) Operational Requirement Document (ORD) was approved by the Joint Requirement Oversight Council (JROC) 6 Apr 2005, Milestone B occurred 20 Apr 2005, and the System Development and Demonstration contract was awarded 8 Aug 2005, as a result of a competitive solicitation which included a vendor system capabilities demonstration.  Capabilities Production Document was approved 14 Mar 09.  To meet the required capability, evolutionary acquisition has been employed to implement the incremental approach outlined in the CPD.  The Gray Eagle UAS is being matured during the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) phase, which includes the development and integration of key components such as the Tactical Common Data Link (TCDL), Link-16, and integration of Government Furnished Equipment (GFE), payloads, appropriate Common Aviation Ground Support Equipment and the One System GCS.  PM JAMS is developing the P+ model of the HELLFIRE missile and participating in the integration and test activities for the entire Gray Eagle system.  PM JAMS is budgeting for the procurement of missiles for the fielded systems.  PM Night Vision/Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and Target Acquisition (RSTA) under PEO Intelligence and Electronic Warfare Systems (IEWS) develops, manages, and competes in the POM and is responsible for meeting all ERMP costs associated for payloads, payload integration, and payload sustainment.  Field Tests at the Electronic Proving Grounds in Ft Huachuca, AZ, and integration tests at the Central Technical Support Facility in Ft Hood, TX, are examples of the tests planned to reduce risk in the SDD phase.

FY2013 and beyond funding allows for the development and integration of Pre-Planned Product Improvements, such as interoperability compliance initiatives and a Universal Armament Interface, and Block upgrades.  These improvements will be implemented through a CPFF engineering services contract and/or engineering change proposals with the Gray Eagle prime contractor.

The LRIP will:  
 
a.  Establish an effective and efficient production base for the system required to provide a solid foundation on which to build FRP systems. 
b.  Permit an orderly increase in production rate to mitigate risk. 
c.  Procure production representative equipment to support test &amp; evaluation. 
d.  Support Doctrine, Training, Leadership Development, Organization, Materiel, Personnel and Facilities (DTLOMPF) and Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTP) development. 
e.  Provide an opportunity to incorporate lessons learned from the comprehensive test and evaluation program into the production baseline.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Small Unmanned Aircraft System (SUAS) provides the battalion and below ground maneuver elements critical situational awareness and enhances force protection.  The system provides the small unit commander an organic and responsive tactical Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and Target Acquisition (RSTA) capability through the ability to view real-time Full Motion Video (FMV) and sensor data via the system ground control station.  Other compatible receivers, such as the One Station Remote Video Terminal (OSRVT) and appropriately equipped manned platforms may also receive the SUAS products.

A SUAS includes three aircraft that must be launched by hand or by some other means that does not require an improved launch/recovery location.  In addition to the aircraft, the system contains ground support equipment, which includes an interoperable hand controller.  This equipment is fully transportable in or on rucksack type packs that are organic to the unit.   

The SUAS RDT&amp;E budget line includes funding for studies and incremental development/upgrade of current SUAS capabilities that will capitalize on new technology insertions based on identified user requirements.  Past improvements include a Digital Data Link capability, introduced in 2010, which provided data link security, increased the number of communications channels allowing more aircraft to operate in close proximity, extended range through data link relay capability, and integrated advanced digital payloads.  Future enhancements will follow the natural progression of technology and exploitation of improved payloads to meet warfighter needs.  FY 2013 and future improvements will be in the areas of:  continued communications link encryption; gimbaled payloads; software blocking integration; common hand controller development and integration; ADS-B integration; and noise reduction.

Justification: 

FY 2013 engineering services efforts will continue to focus on communication link encryption, GPS Denied / Comms Denied Navigation, Autonomous Air Vehicle behaviors, Simulator upgrades, ADS-B integration, and noise reduction.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>SUAS acquisition strategy was based upon a full and open and was awarded in Aug 2005.  The Full Rate Production Decision Review was approved in Oct 2006 with Full Rate Production beginning in April 2007. A significant system upgrade was completed in early FY2010 incorporated a Digital Data Link (DDL) which improved operational capability by:  incorporating an encryption capability enabling secure data links increasing the number of channels allowing for more air vehicles to be flown in a smaller areas; extending the operational range through communication relay capability; and integration of advanced digital payloads.  The first DDL systems were fielded in December 2009.  Future efforts will focus on common hand controller, interoperability, and integration of additional / improved payloads utilizing a sole source Cost Plus Fixed Fee Engineering Services contract.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Tactical Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (TUAV) Shadow 200 provides the Army Brigade Commander with dedicated Reconnaissance, Surveillance and Target Acquisition (RSTA), Intelligence, Battle Damage Assessment (BDA) and Force Protection. The Shadow provides the Brigade Commander with critical battlefield intelligence and targeting information in the rapid cycle time required for success at the tactical level. The TUAV Shadow system air vehicle meets the required operating range of 50 kilometers and remains on station for up to nine hours.  The TUAV Shadow system consists of four air vehicles (each configured with an Electro Optical/Infrared (EO/IR) sensor payload), launcher, ground control and support equipment including: power generation, communications equipment, automated recovery equipment, one system remote video terminals, vehicle mounted shelters, and High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles with trailer(s). Each system is equipped with one Maintenance Section Multifunctional (MSM) and is supported at the division level by a Mobile Maintenance Facility (MMF). 

All 102 Shadow UAS systems have been procured and 93 have been fielded. Shadow has amassed over 709,000 total flight hours, most of which were flown in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF). The Shadow UAS began being deployed to OIF in 2003 and to OIF in 2006. Incremental upgrades are required for continued improvement and interoperability. Common Systems Integration is required to ensure interoperability with other manned and unmanned weapon systems, to include One System Remote Video Transceiver (OSRVT). Continued developmental improvements are required to provide greater interoperability, increase operational capability and flexibility to the Brigade Combat Team. Modifications to the airframe, avionics, payloads, ground control equipment, and support equipment are based on documented requirements and lessons learned units operating in OEF and OIF. 

Justification:  

FY2013 RQ-7 UAV Base funding of $31.158 million will be used for Capability Improvements, specifically: Engine improvements (engine development), Air Vehicle modifications (small mission computer development, weatherization, improved fuel system (vented), GPS Denied Operations and redundant avionics development), and Ground Equipment (interoperability) improvements. Additionally, funds will be for System Engineering, Program Management, Software Architecture and Reliability Solutions and System Test and Evaluation support. Funds will also be used to conduct the Increment II OSRVT Limited User Test (LUT), and other applicable OSRVT test events.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>A System Capability Demonstration (SCD) was conducted with four contractors.  The results from the SCD in conjunction with proposal evaluations resulted in the competitive down select of a Best Value TUAS.  A successful Milestone II ASARC was conducted 21 Dec 99 and a Milestone III Decision 25 Sep 02.  The full rate production contract was awarded 27 Dec 02 and all 102 systems were procured by FY2009.  Continued development of the selected TUAV system will be accomplished through a series of modifications and retrofits such as Tactical Common Data Link (TCDL), Communications Relay, Laser Designator, High reliability engine, Larger fuselage, and reliability upgrades.  Development/integration of these improved capabilities will be through individual efforts on a (mostly) sole source cost-plus fixed fee engineering services contract with the Shadow prime contractor.  Development of the larger engine will be accomplished through a competitive process.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Army has a requirement to provide Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) platforms capable of operating in and near unfriendly territories/areas of conflict.  The system shall be a rotary wing unmanned vertical takeoff and landing(VTOL) aircraft system not conducive to standard airfields but forward deployable to support extended operations in austere environment.  The aircraft system will be made up of multiple aircraft (minimum of 4) that incorporates high value technologies in the airframe, propulsion, datalink systems, communications systems, and avionics systems.  The system will be common with the Army selection of the Line of Sight and Beyond Line of Sight Tactical Common Data Link and the Universal Ground Control Station.  The aircraft will simultaneously carry multi-functional payloads such as SIGINT, EO/IR/LD, and Wide Area Surveillance without degrading time on station. This system will provide dramatic improvements in operational flexibility and mission performance.

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Medium Range Multi-Purpose Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) program is planned to enter the acquisition cycle at Milestone A in FY2013, and as such the contents of this acquisition strategy are still pre-decisional. Overall, the Army plans to conduct this program as full and open competition, incorporating the tenets of the Defense Acquisition Executive's Better Buying Power initiatives.
   
The Army intends to use the Universal Ground Control Station (UGCS) and the Universal Ground Data Terminal (UGDT) already being integrated into the Gray Eagle program as the ground control element of this system.  This is being done to ensure commonality, interoperability, and reduced life cycle cost.  Assuming more than one competitive vendor, the Army plans to award two competitive, cost-type Technology Development (TD) contracts in FY 2014.  The purpose of these contracts will be to reduce technical risk, to determine and mature the appropriate set of technologies to be integrated into the full system, and to demonstrate critical technologies on prototype.

Following a successful Milestone B decision planned in FY2015, the Army intends to down select to one of the two TD vendors for the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase.  The EMD contract is planned to be awarded as a cost-type contract.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Joint Personnel Identification Version 2 (JPIv2) will provide an Army tactical biometric collection capability to capture an adversary or neutral person's biometric data and enroll them into the Department of Defense (DoD) enterprise authoritative biometric database to positively identify and verify the identity of actual or potential adversaries.  JPIv2 development will be informed by prototype collection capabilities.  U.S. forces are currently operating unilaterally or in combination with joint, multinational, and interagency partners, to identify unknown individuals and verify the identity of person(s) across the full spectrum of military operations.  Capabilities proposed for JPIv2 will be configurable for multiple operational mission environments.  JPIv2 planned development employs integrated software and sensors to capture multimodal information in an interoperable system facilitating the use of biometrics.  JPIv2 captures an individual's identity utilizing the person's unique physiological, and/or behavioral features and linking this identity to the individual's past activities, earlier encounters, and previously used identities.  The operating environment includes anywhere military forces may operate.  The JPIv2 will interoperate with a variety of other biometric collection, database, and information systems and adhere to applicable technical standards.

FY2013 Core funding supports the planning, development and preparation for a Milestone B decision in FY2013. Funds will also support development activities under an Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract for JPIv2 program of record.  EMD efforts include: defining system of systems functionality and interface requirements; complete preliminary design to include both hardware and software; define and develop system maturity, reliability and technical performance measures; develop operational deployment sustainability, suitability and survivability plans; and conduct technical reviews consistent with required system capability.  Additionally, funding will support government civilian labor and operations to include travel, training, supplies, infrastructure, and facility costs.  Funds will also support Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) activities under an EMD contract for JPIv2 program of record.  EMD T&amp;E efforts include: development of test plans against system requirements; conducting preliminary testing of system of systems functionality; production of test reports to inform developmental activities; and providing T&amp;E support to scheduled technical reviews.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Joint Personnel Identification Version 2 (JPIv2) will provide an Army tactical biometric collection capability to capture an adversary or neutral person's biometric data and enroll them into the Department of Defense (DoD) enterprise authoritative biometric database to positively identify and verify the identity of actual or potential adversaries.  JPIv2 development will be informed by prototype collection capabilities.  U.S. forces are currently operating unilaterally or in combination with joint, multinational, and interagency partners, to identify unknown individuals and verify the identity of person(s) across the full spectrum of military operations.  Capabilities proposed for JPIv2 will be configurable for multiple operational mission environments.  JPIv2 planned development employs integrated software and sensors to capture multimodal information in an interoperable system facilitating the use of biometrics.  JPIv2 captures an individual's identity utilizing the person's unique physiological, and/or behavioral features and linking this identity to the individual's past activities, earlier encounters, and previously used identities.  The operating environment includes anywhere military forces may operate.  The JPIv2 will interoperate with a variety of other biometric collection, database, and information systems and adhere to applicable technical standards.

FY2013 Core funding supports the planning, development and preparation for a Milestone B decision in FY2013. Funds will also support development activities under an Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract for JPIv2 program of record.  EMD efforts include: defining system of systems functionality and interface requirements; complete preliminary design to include both hardware and software; define and develop system maturity, reliability and technical performance measures; develop operational deployment sustainability, suitability and survivability plans; and conduct technical reviews consistent with required system capability.  Additionally, funding will support government civilian labor and operations to include travel, training, supplies, infrastructure, and facility costs.  Funds will also support Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) activities under an EMD contract for JPIv2 program of record.  EMD T&amp;E efforts include: development of test plans against system requirements; conducting preliminary testing of system of systems functionality; production of test reports to inform developmental activities; and providing T&amp;E support to scheduled technical reviews.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The USD (AT&amp;L) on 10 June 2009 held a biometrics Materiel Development Decision at which he directed the Army to conduct an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) for the Joint Personnel Identification version 2 (JPIv2) program.  The Army completed the AoA on 30 April 2010 and recommended an enhanced status quo acquisition approach.  This approach will entail selecting and integrating commercial off the shelf (COTS) products to meet the warfighter's needs based on a Capabilities Development Document (CDD).  In line with this recommended approach, the Acquisition Strategy for DoD Biometrics JPIv2 program is scheduled to begin development with a Milestone B decision in FY 2013.  The current Biometric Automated Toolset-Army Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) will be supported and maintained to include continued sustainment and enhancement while the JPIv2 capabilities are developed.  In FY2013, BAT-A will be sustained with Overseas Contingency Operations funding.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
