                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Air Ocean Tactical Applications (AOTA) Program Element is aligned with the Navy's maritime strategy to enhance the future mission capabilities of the Navy-Marine Corps Meteorological and Oceanographic (METOC) Team supporting naval warfighters worldwide. New state-of-the art government and commercial technologies are identified, transitioned, demonstrated and then integrated into Combat Systems and programs of record to provide capabilities that provide real-time and near-real-time operational effects of the physical environment on the performance of combat forces and their new and emerging platforms, sensors, systems and munitions. The AOTA program element focuses on sensing and characterizing and predicting the littoral and deep-strike battlespace in the context of regional conflicts and crisis response scenarios.  Projects in this program element transition state-of-the art sensing, assimilation, modeling and decision aid technologies from government and commercial sources. Unique project development efforts include atmospheric and oceanographic data assimilation techniques, forecast models, data base management systems and associated software for use in mainframe, desktop and laptop computers. Model data, products and services can be used by forward-deployed personnel or in a reach-back mode to optimize sensor placement and force allocation decisions. Global Geospatial Information and Services efforts within this program address the bathymetric needs of the Navy. Also developed are algorithms to process new satellite sensor data for integration into Navy and Marine Corps decision support systems and for display as part of the common operational and tactical pictures. In addition, the projects provide for demonstration and validation of specialized atmospheric and oceanographic instrumentation and measurement techniques, new sensors, communications and interfaces. Included are new capabilities to assess, predict and enhance the performance of current and emerging undersea warfare and mine warfare weapons systems. AOTA capabilities are designed to support the latest versions of the Global Command and Control System and specific unit-level combat systems. This program element develops technological upgrades for the U.S. Naval Observatory's Master Clock system to meet requirements of Department of Defense communications, cryptographic, intelligence, geolocation, and targeting systems; develops near-real-time earth orientation predictions; develops very precise determination of positions of both faint and bright stars; and supports satellite tracking and space debris studies.  

Major emphasis areas include the Naval Integrated Tactical Environmental System Next Generation (NITES-Next) and the METOC Future Mission Capabilities, the METOC Space-Based Sensing Capabilities, the Precise Timing and Astrometry, the Fleet Synthetic Training, the Tactical Oceanographic Capabilities for Under Sea Warfare, the Earth System Prediction Capability projects, and the Remote Sensing Capability Development.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The major thrust of the Meteorology and Oceanography (METOC) Data Acquisition Project is to provide future mission capabilities to warfighters that will allow them to detect and monitor the conditions of the physical environment throughout the entire battlespace.  New sensor technologies (including unmanned vehicles, tactical sensor exploitation, in-situ sensors) identified as the most promising candidates are transitioned from the government's and commercial industry's technology base.  These new sensor technologies are demonstrated, validated and integrated into operational programs for  warfighters.  These new sensor capabilities provide timely and accurate METOC data and products to operational and tactical commanders. METOC data requirements have likewise evolved as the emphasis on naval warfare has evolved from blue water operations to the littoral and deep strike battlespace.  The littoral and deep strike regions typically have dynamic and complex oceanographic and atmospheric conditions. The need to accurately characterize these conditions is more crucial than ever in planning and executing warfare operations and effectively allocating force weapon and sensor systems. Routinely available data sources, such as climatology, oceanographic and meteorological numerical models, and satellite remote sensing are necessary but not sufficient to support these warfare areas in the littoral and deep strike regions.  Operational sensors are deployed great distances from the target area of interest.  The challenge is to collect and disseminate METOC data in variable and dynamic littoral environmental conditions or in denied, remote or inaccessible areas over extended periods of time.  This project: 1) provides the means to rapidly and automatically acquire a broad array of METOC data using both off-board and on-board sensors; 2) provides an on-scene assessment capability for the tactical commander; 3) provides the tactical commander with real-time METOC data and products for operational use; 4) demonstrates and validates the use of tactical workstations and desktop computers for processing and display of METOC data and products;  5) demonstrates and validates techniques which employ data compression, connectivity and interface technologies to obtain, store, process, distribute and display these METOC data and products; 6) develops new charting and bathymetric survey techniques necessary to reduce the existing shortfall in coastal hydrographic survey requirements; 7) develops an expanded database for predictive METOC models in areas of interest; and 8) supports the development of radar weather using through-the-sensor techniques. 

Major emphasis areas include the METOC Future Mission Capabilities (FMC) and the Tactical Oceanographic Capabilities project.

FY 2015 request provides for continued advanced development of software and hardware component and prototype efforts associated with acquiring environmental data, and METOC data dissemination, storage, delivery, design, development efforts, and develop METOC network integration capability.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Meteorological and Oceanographic (METOC) Data Assimilation Project is a multi-faceted project that provides future mission capabilities for warfighters to characterize the physical environment within their battlespace.  This project includes: 1) development, demonstration and validation of software associated with atmospheric and oceanographic data assimilation forecast models and database management systems for use in both mainframe and tactical scale computers.  Included are numerical oceanographic and atmospheric models for the Large Scale Computers at the Navy Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center (FNMOC), Monterey, CA and the Naval Oceanographic Office (NAVO), Stennis Space Center, MS.  These models, combined with a global communications network for data acquisition and distribution, form a prediction system which provides METOC data and products necessary to support naval operations worldwide in virtually every mission area; 2) other software models, which focus on ocean thermal structure and circulation, and surf and tide prediction; 3) software to process and manage satellite remotely-sensed environmental data at Oceanography Centers ashore and on ships equipped with the AN/SMQ-11 satellite receiver/recorder; 4) future METOC and environmental satellite data readiness and risk reduction preparations to develop hardware and software that will allow ground stations to receive, ingest and exploit satellite data including payload sensor data from the National Polar Orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) Preparatory Project (NPP), the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) Polar Systems' Meteorological Operational satellites A &amp; B (METOP-A &amp; B), Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS), and Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP). This software allows for the integration and tactical application of significant oceanographic and atmospheric data derived from satellite-borne sensors.  Satellite and unmanned sensor data, combined with manned platform data are foundational to a robust numerical weather and oceanographic modeling capability that predicts battlespace conditions impacting fleet and adversary weapon and sensor performance.  Included are software and algorithms for the processing of sensor measurements, conversion of raw signal data to geophysical information, analysis schemes encompassing Artificial Intelligence and Expert Systems, and other satellite data applications and field validation of end products; and, 5) a family of acoustic system performance models beginning with active system models and databases in the low-, mid-, and high-frequency regimes and culminating with high fidelity simulation products.  As weapons and sensors become more sophisticated and complex, the marine environment has an increasingly significant impact on system performance.  Operational limitations induced by the ocean and atmosphere must be understood, and the resulting constraints on mission effectiveness and system employment minimized.  Hence, the operating forces require more accurate worldwide forecasts of METOC conditions with increased temporal and spatial resolution. An additional challenge is posed by the emergence of new satellite sensor data.  In order to fully exploit this dynamic and massive volume of data, modern Data Base Management Systems are required, and must be tailored for individual computer configurations at both FNMOC and NAVO.  Improved representation of smaller-scale phenomena, particularly in the littoral, is also an important consideration.  Intelligence Preparation of the Environment Sensor R&amp;D to meet Chief of Naval Operations and Commander, Fleet Forces Command requirements for remote autonomous, clandestine, littoral battlespace sensing in near shore areas in support of Sea Shield &amp; Sea Basing.
 
Major emphasis areas include the METOC Future Mission Capabilities (FMC), the METOC Space-Based Sensing Capabilities, and the Tactical Oceanographic Capabilities / Under Sea Warfare projects (TOC/USW).

FY 2015 request provides for continued advanced software component development and prototype efforts associated with advanced data assimilation into environmental prediction systems (to include development of tactical decision aids and asset allocation tools software), the continued development of advanced oceanographic and atmospheric prediction systems software and architectures to provide improved forecasts and estimates of product accuracies, continued development of improved data fusion techniques, data quality control technologies and accelerate the automation prediction processes, and the development of data assimilation and fusion software technologies for tactical radars, remote sensing and undersea sensor systems.  Begin research and development of data processing and data assimilation algorithms for the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES-R) launch.  Develop Meteorological and Oceanographic (METOC) Decision Support &amp; Predation Tools to improve Electromagnetic and Electro-optical (EM/EO) system performance.
The Earth System Prediction Capability (ESPC) program provides a more accurate global ocean and atmospheric forecast system with longer skillful forecast times through integrating and coupling atmosphere, ocean, ice, land and near-space forecast models into a seamless prediction system that reduces errors in the current modeling suite. Additionally it will develop a national common modeling architecture to improve cross-agency collaboration, and a greatly more efficient computational architecture to allow for real-time operational prediction.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Acquisition, management and contracting strategies to support the Earth System Prediction Capability Project, a multi-faceted program which includes: 1) development, demonstration and validation of atmospheric, sea ice and oceanographic data assimilation techniques, forecast models, database management systems, and associated software for use in teraflop to petaflop scale computers; 2) other models, which focus on decision products and quantifying thresholds, forecast uncertainty, and risk for Navy and DoD resource and mission planning using non-Navy models as input; 3) techniques to improve computational and data dissemination efficiency for environmental information dominance.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Goal:  Develop techniques and tools to assimilate Meteorological and Oceanographic (METOC) data in order to improve the accuracy of global and regional scale meteorological and oceanographic forecast models.  Data assimilation is expanded to include new in-situ and remotely-sensed data types, based on operational need.  Tasks are directed toward advanced software enabling assimilation of disparate sources on non-synoptic time scales.  Acoustic, atmospheric, and oceanographic model development, prototyping and transition is focused on improved model physics, increased resolution, and computational efficiency.  

Metric:  Tasks will address no less than 75% of applicable capability gaps and requirements.
------
Goal (ESPC): Develop a more accurate global ocean, atmosphere, wave and sea ice forecast system with longer skillful forecast times from weeks to seasons through integrating and coupling atmosphere, ocean, ice, land and near-space forecast models into a seamless prediction system that reduces errors in the current modeling suite. Additionally develop a common modeling architecture to improve cross-Agency collaboration, and a greatly more efficient computational architecture to allow for real-time operational prediction. 

Metrics: Long term trends show a globally averaged gain of skill of 1 day per decade of RDT&amp;E investment, i.e. today's 5-day forecast is as accurate as the 3-day forecast available in the early 1990's. This program will implement new technological approaches to improve 7-14 day predictions to the level of current 5-7 day forecasts and will seek to provide quantifiable skill above long term seasonal averages for 14-90 day lead times for mission planning.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Tactical Meteorology and Oceanography (METOC) Applications Project provides future operational effects decision aid capabilities for Navy and Marine Corps warfighters in the context of Joint Operations in a net-centric environment. This project identifies and transitions state-of-the-art decision support software technologies from the government's and commercial Industry's technology base and then demonstrates and validates these capabilities before fielding. These software decision support tools provide platform, sensor, communications, and weapon systems performance assessments for warfighters in terms of their littoral and deep-strike battlespace environments. These assessments allow mission planners and warfighters, from Unit to Theater level, to optimize their sensor employment on airborne, surface, and subsurface platforms in support of Naval Composite Warfare mission areas including Undersea Warfare (USW), Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), Mine Warfare, Amphibious Warfare (AMW), Anti-Surface Warfare (ASUW), Anti-Air Warfare (AAW), Strike Warfare (STW), and Naval Special Warfare (NSW). Performance assessments leading to improvements in operational and tactical control are conducted through a two-tiered approach: 1) METOC Decision Aids (MDAs) and, 2) Operational Effects Decision Aids (OEDAs). MDAs consist of a series of analysis tools which characterize the physical environment conditions of the battlespace based on the best set of physical environment data available at the time (i.e., some combination of historical and/or real-time (or near real-time) in-situ, and numerically modeled forecast data). OEDAs then use the MDA information by fusing it with relevant, often-classified sensor and target data to predict how weapons and sensor systems will perform. Performance results are displayed in tabular and graphic formats integrated into net-centric visualization tools for use by mission planners and combat/weapon system operators to develop localization plans, USW/AAW/ASUW screens, STW profiles, AMW ingress and egress points, and for other warfare considerations. MDAs and OEDAs typically use data derived from sensors developed in Project 2341 (METOC Data Acquisition) and assimilated by software produced by Project 2342 (METOC Data Assimilation and Modeling). MDAs and OEDAs also use data obtained through direct interfaces to Navy combat systems. A current emphasis area of the project is capabilities required to characterize and/or predict sensor and weapons system performance in the highly complex littoral environments in support of regional conflict scenarios. It addresses multi-warfare areas, particularly shallow water ASW, NSW, and missile and air defense/strike capabilities. 

The major emphasis of this project is the software development within the Naval Integrated Tactical Environmental System Next Generation (NITES-Next) program of record. 

FY 2015 request provides for the achievement of NITES-Next Initial Operational Capability (IOC), the continuation of Fleet Capability Release (FCR)-2 software development efforts including extensive system architecture, and testing efforts and initiation of FCR-3.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Precise Timing and Astrometry (PTA) project funds research and development of improvements for the U.S. Master Clock (MC) System, the DoD Time Transfer capability, the Earth Orientation System, and the Astrometric Observation System. The MC System and Time Transfer provides precise time for use in modern military and National Technical Means (NTM) navigation, guidance, positioning, and tracking systems. The Earth Orientation System provides precise Earth Orientation Parameters for use by the DoD and the national civilian infrastructure to establish the specific orientation of the Earth and to provide input to the terrestrial reference frame. The Astrometric Observation System provides the basic data needed to generate the celestial reference frame which is the standard for calibrating all inertial navigation systems, satellite orbits, and earth rotation determinations. Improvement to the MC System, Time Transfer, Earth Orientation, and Astrometric Observation Systems are needed to ensure that new and upgraded DoD and NTM capabilities meet their performance requirements. By DoD Directive (CJCSI 6130.01D, encl J, of 13 Apr 2007), the U.S. Naval Observatory (USNO), Washington, D.C., is responsible for coordinating Precise Time and Time Interval (PTTI) requirements and for maintaining a PTTI reference standard (astronomical and atomic) for use by all DoD, Federal agencies, and related scientific laboratories. The Navy is also responsible for providing astronomical data for military and NTM navigation, positioning, and guidance capabilities that are space-based. 

The PTA research and development efforts are focused on several areas relating to timing and time transfer: (1)  Development of Rubidium Fountain Atomic Clocks and development of improved GPS Timing Receivers in order to meet the precise timing requirements for the GPS III system; (2) Research &amp; development of the capability of distributing timing signals via Optical fiber lines, as an alternative and backup to GPS time distribution; and (3) Research &amp; development into Optical Clock technology, which is expected to be required for future DoD systems. The PTA research and development effort is also focused on the following areas related to Earth Orientation Parameter (EOP) determination: (1) Upgrade of the Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VBLI) data acquisition system / radio telescope at Kokee Park HI; (2) Development of a Software (SW) Correlator for processing of VLBI data, necessary for the generation of Earth Orientation Parameter (EOP) data; (3) Development of the capability for electronic transmission of the VLBI data from remote VLBI sites to the USNO correlator. The new SW Correlator and the eVLBI infrastructure upgrades are necessary in order to support daily updates of EOP data required by GPS III; (4) Development of an automated end-to-end EOP processing system, which combines input from multiple data sets (e.g. VLBI data, GPS orbit data, and laser ranging data, etc.). This process is currently very labor intensive and costly. Automation is necessary to meet future DoD and GPS requirements; and (5) Modifications to the EOP system for compatibility with the new international standard -'VLBI2010'. Starting in FY15, the PTA research and development for astrometry will focus on improvements to the USNO Navy Precision Optical Interferometer (NPOI) at Flagstaff, AZ. It is necessary for maintenance of the Celestial Reference Frame (CRF). Four 1.8m telescopes will be added to the array in order to extend and expand the number of stars in the catalog to fainter stars of 9th magnitude.

The Critical Time Dissemination (CTD) aspect of the PTA program develops enhanced methods of distributing and verifying precise time back to the Master Clock, UTC (USNO). The development aspect of this project has four parts: (1) Development of a mobile time link; (2) Refinement of and modernization of the Hydrogem Maser and Auxilary Offset Generator (AOG); (3) Customize a timing system to develop a Site Verification System; and (4) Produce a fiber link system to transfer the Master Clock down long-haul fiber.
In response to these DoD requirements, this project transitions Research and Exploratory Development efforts, as well as developments in the civilian sector, into the operational capabilities of the USNO.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:Text>Master Clock (MC) and Time Distribution:  Four Navy Rb Fountains (NRF2-5) are now located in the National Master Clock Facility and have demonstrated excellent prediction -of and agreement- with USNO Universal Time Clock (UTC).  Time from NRF2-5 are now included in the USNO MC time scale and being reported to the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) for inclusion in the international coordinated UTC.  One Navy Rb Fountain has been completed and shipped to the Alternate Master Clock facility (December 2012).  One more Rb Fountain will be completed and sent to the AMC facility by July 2013.  Approximately 12 months are needed to verify the performance of the two Rb Fountains once they are in place at the AMC.  
										
Earth Orientation:  Very Long Baseline Interferomtry System (VLBI) Software (SW) correlator design and development completed.  The new 15-station SW Correlator was procured (OPN-funded), delivered and installed in September 2012.  It will replace the Hardware (HW)  correlator.  The Initial Operation Capability (IOC) for the SW Correlator was completed on 7 February 2013.  The preliminary version of the Graphical User Interface (GUI) has been delivered.  The SW correlator is used for processing the daily National Radio Astronomy Observatory Earth Orientation Parameter (NRAO EOP) intensive series, from the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) Mauna Kea, HI, and Pie Town, NM, antennas.  In addition, one of the International VLBI Service (IVS) EOP intensive experiments (using the Kokee Park, HI, and Wettzell, Germany, antennas) is correlated on both the SW and HW correlators for intercomparison.  Plans for replacement and upgrade of the VLBI radio telescope at Kokee Park HI are progressing.  The Kokee Park telescope replacement contract and the Kokee Park Telescope project manager contract is in preparation at Fleet Logistics Center (FLC), Philadelphia, and are expected to be awarded in July 2013.</r2:Text>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Fleet Synthetic Training (FST) provides naval forces with an enhanced in-port training capability. Integrating embedded shipboard training devices, aircraft and submarine simulators into an interoperable network with joint, coalition and interagency partners will provide more effective training for our deploying naval forces. 

A key factor in achieving this new way of training our naval forces is to ensure that the required training is based on realistic characterizations of the physical environment. This project develops and delivers software that characterizes the ocean and atmospheric environments; adjusts to meet fleet-required training scenarios; allows synthetic training to be conducted in areas of planned and contingency operations; and, provides sufficient detail to simulate the real-world conditions of the physical environment in those areas of interest.

Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) Fleet Synthetic Training (FST) at Sea effort will provide the capability to conduct integrated Live, Virtual and Constructive (LVC) single or multi-ship exercises with ships at sea using the Navy Continuous Training Environment (NCTE). This capability will support BMD mission area Fleet training and mission rehearsal in theater, allow ships to participate in Combatant Command (COCOM) mandated BMD exercises while pierside or underway, as well as enhance BMD training objective accomplishment in current Fleet Requirements Training Plan (FRTP) underway training events such as Composite Training Unit Exercises (COMPTUEX) and Joint Task Force Exercises (JTFEX). The NCTE and FST directly support Fleet training readiness and strike group and BMD platform deployment certifications.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Deployable Joint Command and Control (DJC2) provides a self contained, standardized, rapidly deployable, modular, scaleable, and reconfigurable joint command and control (C2) capability to designated Geographic Combatant Commands (GCCs).  DJC2 is the material solution to Defense Planning Guidance that called for the development of Standing Joint Task Forces (JTFs) with a deployable C2 capability.  DJC2 will ensure that Joint Force Commanders (JFC) are equipped, as well as trained and organized, to carry out their C2 responsibilities.  DJC2 provides GCCs and JFCs a mission critical, integrated family of systems with which to plan, control, coordinate, execute, and assess operations.  It is designed to deploy rapidly, set up within hours, and quickly provide necessary C2 mission and collaboration functionality across the full spectrum of JTF operations.  The DJC2 has also been deployed in support of Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HA/DR) efforts.  The capability is intended for all levels of conflict and will be reconfigurable to meet specific GCC and JTF mission requirements.  This capability is interoperable with higher and adjacent echelons of command (to include coalition allies) as well as with supporting elements to include joint forces.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>This RDT&amp;E line supports an evolutionary acquisition strategy.  The intent of this strategy is to:  develop a system based upon a current understanding of joint requirements; rapidly field systems based upon those requirements; analyze operational utilization of the systems; and roll the results of the analysis into periodic upgrades of the systems to maintain currency and maximize operational effectiveness.  The baseline configuration is based upon existing Command, Control, Communications, Computers, &amp; Intelligence (C4I) systems, scaled to the Combatant Command level.  The follow-on configurations will include newly developed capabilities based on emergent, joint requirements and operational feedback based upon utilization of earlier delivered systems.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program element supports the requirements study, technology maturation, system design and demonstration of a general-purpose, future-proof avionics network that replaces copper with glass.  As both analog and digital onboard information transport and processing requirements continue to grow, life cycle costs associated with maintaining and upgrading current stove-piped networks aboard naval aircraft systems becomes unsustainable.  The size, weight, power, high data rate and scalability advantages of a single-mode fiber optic network have significant total ownership cost savings implications that will allow the Department of the Navy to more affordably and effectively meet mission requirements well into the future.  The activities funded will provide a networking baseline or standard that can be incorporated into airborne platforms that maximize networking system capability while minimizing associated life cycle costs.  While the development under this program does specifically address airborne platforms where size and weight of the cable plant is particularly important, ultimately the network technology developed will have broad applicability to shipboard and submarine platform network requirements as well.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>The overarching objective of this activity is to develop and demonstrate a highly integrated Local Area Network for airborne platforms incorporating an optical fiber network that uses wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) to address demanding military network re-configurability, scalability, and technology refresh challenges.   The telecommunication network application of WDM technology is fully mature for commercial environments with little constraint on size, weight, and power (SWAP).  The program will leverage and enhance the telecommunication standards for optical fiber networks while addressing the SWAP restrictions and severe environmental requirements of military airborne platforms.  The functionality of the technology developed cannot be obtained through Commercial-Off-The-Shelf components due to SWAP constraints and the military environment.  Effort will involve understanding the properties of engineered optical fiber components and electronic semiconductors as they apply to highly integrated optical fiber networks.  Ultimately these higher performance components and networks will address the needs for all classes of military platforms.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Congressional Add supports the requirements study, technology maturation, system design and demonstration of a general-purpose, future-proof avionics network that replaces copper with glass.  As both analog and digital onboard information transport and processing requirements continue to grow, life cycle costs associated with maintaining and upgrading current stove-piped networks aboard naval aircraft systems becomes unsustainable.  The size, weight, power, high data rate and scalability advantages of a single-mode fiber optic network have significant total ownership cost savings implications that will allow the Department of the Navy to more affordably and effectively meet mission requirements well into the future.  The activities funded will provide a networking baseline or standard that can be incorporated into airborne platforms that maximize networking system capability while minimizing associated life cycle costs.  While the development under this program does specifically address airborne platforms where size and weight of the cable plant is particularly important, ultimately the network technology developed will have broad applicability to shipboard and submarine platform network requirements as well.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program provides Air Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) platform effectiveness through development and maturization of advanced hardware and software associated with airborne acoustic and non-acoustic systems. This includes sensors and components, processing, post-processing, data recording and display capabilities to address regional threat scenarios against surfaced or submerged conventionally and nuclear powered submarines. Key objectives are platform accommodations of advanced active and passive sensors and components, improved detection, classification, localization, tracking, and increased capacity and flexibility to handle multi-sensor data loads. Programs being funded during the FYDP will investigate technologies such as: Over the Horizon (OTH) Communications, Distributed Netted Sensors, transient signals, and source and receiver improvement technologies that will enhance passive and Multi-static Active Sensor Systems capabilities. Other programs being funded during the FYDP will provide for the development and maturization of persistent tactical search technologies that will allow transition to the localization and attack phase in all operationally relevant environments. In addition, the program will provide for the development and subsequent experimentation, including data collection and engineering measurement, of Multi-static Active Coherent sources and receivers, laser technologies, electro-optical and Multi-Spectral camera technologies, Radar, and Magnetic Anomaly Detection sensors.  Those technologies that are deemed mature and provide increased operational capability will be approved for a production Rapid Capability Insertion (RCI) build.  The test articles, which consist of passive/active sensors/components and associated processors, will support at-sea trials and experiments.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Naval Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Strategy employs a family of UAS to perform tactical, persistent and penetrating Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance in support of Naval and Joint missions from forward bases/platforms and naval ships. 

In support of the Navy's overall UAS strategy, this program develops Concept of Operations (CONOPS) that integrate UAS into the Chief of Naval Operations Navy Vision of Sea Power 21 (Sea Shield, Sea Strike, Sea Basing and FORCEnet).  By providing fleet input based on current operations with UAS in a simulated combat environment, this CONOPS development investment is the foundation of how the Carrier Strike Group and the Expeditionary Strike Group will operate a combined Manned and Unmanned Naval Air Force. This program establishes the common architecture, including Command &amp; Control, for all unmanned systems to support and inform CONOPS development. This effort provides for a cross-program view of Naval Unmanned Systems and is the entry point for OSD and other services for commonality and interoperability.  Specifically:
- Provides studies and demonstrations in support of the Naval UAS Family of Systems (FoS) CONOPS development.
- Horizontally integrates across the Naval UAS FoS for the Naval Aviation Enterprise through interoperability and common system solutions.
- Develops the Naval UAS FoS Architecture to support integration into the Naval Unmanned Systems Cross Functional Team.
- Provides Naval support for development of Standards across Department of Defense (DoD) UAS and North Atlantic Treaty Organization, emphasizing standardization and interoperability.
- Conducts CONOPS studies, demonstrations, and exercises for Vehicle Control, Targeting, and Weapons, Sensor and Payload Employment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Advanced Combat System Technology line is to evolve the technical and business practices for programs to change to an open architecture construct. The program was constructed to mature both technical and business model integration for C5I systems programs of record in an open architecture environment. The priority was incorporating the principles of modular design and design disclosure, reusable application software, interoperability and secure information exchange, lifecycle affordability and encouraging competition and collaboration.

Project Unit 0324: Funding is to maintain and update an information exchange environment to improve transparency of design disclosure and information exchange on past and current investments to support the principle of cross-program reuse, and to provide the tools and leadership for assisting programs through the transition to Naval Open Architecture (OA).  The other elements of the OA transformation effort are being realized as management efficiencies within programs.  Those elements include ensuring that all naval systems, families of systems, and programs move to modular OA in accordance with Department of Defense (DoD) Instruction 5000.1 dated 12 May 2003 which mandates that all DoD programs utilize open systems architectures to rapidly field affordable and interoperable systems.  By direction of the Navy Service Acquisition Executive (SAE), PEO IWS was assigned overall responsibility and authority to direct the Navy's OA effort until that duty transferred to DASN (RDTE) in 2011. The Core OA funding line has remained with PEO IWS.  That policy established a need to coordinate acquisition strategies, develop guidance and tools, and develop analysis of alternatives to determine OA software reuse practices within and across the Navy Communities of Interest (COI - Surface, Subsurface, Air, Space, C4I, USMC, and ONR).  This project facilitates a strategic shift in the acquisition business process to facilitate cooperative competition in cross-domain/COI business relationships.  This improves innovation and economies of scale throughout the Navy and Marine Corps.  This leadership effort has identified the business case and potential return on investment for moving the Navy towards an open systems approach, supported the development of open systems technologies, and integrated best business and technical practices for open systems development within Naval acquisition.  Naval OA ensures Navy-wide system architectures become extensible and scalable in function, capacity, and workload to meet Joint warfighting requirements.  This also includes the identification and development of common software components, functions, reuse methodologies, and extensible product lines.  In summary, this funding supports the management of a reuse repository and reuse information exchange portal, and the evolving business, systems engineering, and cultural changes required across all Naval programs as they migrate to function in a Joint, net-centric warfare environment.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element provides resources for development of mine countermeasure systems to provide minehunting, minesweeping, and neutralization to counter known and projected mine threats.  The mine countermeasures systems provide mobile, quick reaction forces capable of land or sea-based minehunting and minesweeping operations worldwide.  Resources are for developing and deploying advanced mine-hunting and minesweeping systems and the intelligence and oceanographic capabilities that will enable mine warfare superiority.  Tactics and techniques used vary across a diversity of environments and a diversity of threats, including both asymmetric and emerging.  Resources provide for systems and support of mine warfare systems, maritime systems, and expeditionary systems to allow for continuous operations of the Navy's warships and support vessels, other military vessels, and commercial vessels.  Core capabilities include forward presence, deterrence, sea control, power projection, maritime security, humanitarian assistance and disaster response to maintain freedom of the seas.  Increased capability includes conducting minefield reconnaissance (mine density and location) at high area search rates, improving detection capability, decreasing sensor false alarm rates, reducing or eliminating post-mission analysis detect, classify, identify, decide time, improving neutralization time, improving network communications, automatic target recognition, and achieving in-stride detect-to-engage capability.  Concept of operations includes development of cooperative, unmanned, modular systems; the establishment of a capable networked command and control systems; and standing up an accurate and interactive environmental system with the ability to form and disseminate a Common Environmental Picture.  Efforts benefit the MCM force by transforming the Navy from the platform-centered legacy set of systems to a capability-centered force that is distributed, networked, and able to provide unique maritime influence and access across the entire maritime domain.

The Surface Mine Countermeasures (SMCM) programs are platform independent and will provide detection, classification, localization, identification, neutralization, and influence clearance capabilities.  Programs develop: (1) remote minehunting capability for surface platforms; (2) the integration and improvement of new and existing systems (3) support for systems which detect, localize, classify, identify, and neutralize all mine types across Mine Countermeasure (MCM) Avenger Class and other platforms; (4) systems for neutralizing mines and light obstacles through the entire water column to include shallow water, very shallow water, surf zones, and beach landing craft zones in support of operations; (5) the integration of Unmanned Undersea Vehicles (UUVs) to meet Undersea Surveillance capabilities as well as other prioritized and enduring capabilities, requirements and gaps and (6) integrate hardware for experimental testing related to surface ship, aircraft, and other cross platform applications.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The AN/WLD-1(V)2 Remote Minehunting System (RMS) is a mine reconnaissance system designed for the detection, classification, identification, and localization of bottom and moored mines in shallow and deep water. The RMS will provide the Navy the capability to keep ships and sailors out of the minefield. The RMS is deployed from the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) as part of the ships' Mine Countermeasure (MCM) Mission Package (MP). The RMS is a fully integrated system consisting of a semi-submersible Remote Multi-Misson Vehicle (RMMV) towing a variable depth sensor, the AN/AQS-20A. The RMMV is a high-endurance, semi-autonomous, low-observable, unmanned, diesel-powered vehicle, operated and maintained from the LCS. Line-of-sight (LOS) and over-the-horizon (OTH) data links provide real time vehicle command and control and mine reconnaissance sensor data transmission to/from LCS.

The first Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) units (LRIP 1) were used during the RMMV Reliability Growth Program (RGP) v4.2 configuration and will be upgraded to the version 6.0 (v6.0) configuration to support LCS integration. 

The Program demonstrated substantially improved RMMV system performance during RMMV v4.2 validation testing in FY13. In the first quarter of FY14, the improved performance was validated during RGP Developmental Testing (DT).  The Milestone C (MS C) Gate Review Defense Acquisition Board (DAB) is scheduled for the third quarter of FY14. 

Not a new start.  ACAT 1D Transparency requirement realigned program funding to Project Element 0604122N beginning in FY15.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides resources for development, improvement and integration of MCM systems.  A description of the major planned programs include the following:

1) AN/SQQ-32(V)4 High-Frequency, Wide Band (HFWB) is a technology upgrade to the AN/SQQ-32 Towed Body which will incorporate HFWB technology into the detection sonar to address performance deficiencies against new mine threats in the littorals.  This upgrade will be installed on MCM-1 Class ships with the AN/SQQ-32(V)3 and will develop new transducer modules, fiber optic cable and modify topside processing and display software.  2) Mine Warfare and Environmental Decision Aids Library (MEDAL) is a software segment on the Global Command and Control System - Maritime (GCCS-M). MEDAL provides mine and mine warfare planning and evaluation tools and databases to the MCM Commander.  3) Develop and implement Mine Countermeasures Commander's Estimate of the Situation (MCM CES).  4) Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) Flight 1 includes the Unmanned Surface Sweep System (US3,)a magnetic/acoustic sweep system developed to sweep acoustic/magnetic influence mines, that when integrated with an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) becomes the Unmanned Influence Sweep System (UISS) deployed from the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS); 5) Multi-Function USV Flight 2 integrates a minehunting sensor with the UISS vehicle. The added capability allows a common USV to conduct minehunting and minesweeping missions. 6) AN?SLQ-60 Mine Neutralization System (MNS) Seafox on the MCM Class ships. MNS is the replacement to the existing AN/SLQ-48 Mine Neutralization System. 7) SSQ-94 MCM Trainer upgrade will incorporate the AN/SQQ-32 (V)8 sonar, SSN2(V)5 PINS and Mine Neutralization System Team Trainer.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>HFWB - Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City (NSWC, PC) and ARL UT designed and developed the HFWB upgrade to the AN/SQQ-32. 

Mine Warfare and Environmental Decision Aids Library (MEDAL) - requirements for MEDAL Builds are generated through a formal requirements process. Requirements conferences gather a list of candidate functions based on a logical sequence to fully implement the overall software architecture. The fleet is presented with a recommended list of candidate capabilities based on this program plan, doctrine, fleet comments, and technology. These capability items are then prioritized by the fleet representatives (coordinated by Naval Mine Warfare and Anti-Submarine Command (NMAWC).The fleet inputs are then consolidated by COMINEWARCOM into an overall list which is then presented to Navy leadership for pricing and final selection. The selection is based on price, risk, available funding, and possibly by other program factors (e.g., ensure that MEDAL supports other program delivery schedules). Selection balances immediate needs, long term objectives, technical maturity and other programmatic factors. A verification and validation process is applied to any algorithms, tactics, or models to be incorporated in the software. MEDAL development to include integration of data fusion techniques and incorporation of Data Access Layer (DAL) architecture to meet FORCEnet requirements. Acquisition strategy for Mine Countermeasures Commander's Estimate of the situation (MCM CES) is to deliver the software module within MEDAL builds by implementing the CES framework into the MEDAL software. SSQ-94 MCM Trainer upgrade will incorporate the AN/SQQ-32 (V)8 sonar, SSN2(V)5 PINS and Mine Neutralization System Team Trainer.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides resources for development, improvement and integration of Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) Mine Countermeasure systems.  A description of the major planned programs include the following:

1)Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) Flight 1 includes the Unmanned Surface Sweep System (US3) , a magnetic/acoustic sweep system developed to sweep acoustic/magnetic influence mines, that when integrated with an Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) becomes the Unmanned Influence Sweep System (UISS) deployed from the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) 2)Multi-Function USV Flight 2 integrates minehunting sensor(s) with the UISS vehicle. The added capability allows a common USV to conduct mine hunting and mine sweeping missions. 3) USV Mine Hunting Units (MHUs) include USVs towing AN/AQS-24A mine hunting sonars and associated support equipment, including a command and control center that will be deployed from vessels of opportunity. MHUs are in response to an Urgent Operational Need (UON) from Naval Forces Central Command.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Persistent Littoral Undersea Surveillance (PLUS) Innovative Naval Prototype (INP) Program provides Undersea Surveillance capability by employing mobile Unmanned Undersea Vehicle (UUV) technology.  PLUS is being developed in response to an Urgent Operational Need (UON) identified by the Fleet. PLUS uses both conventionally powered UUVs with propellers and UUVs propelled by buoyancy engines (commonly called seagliders).  PLUS INP S&amp;T development program is planned to transition into a prototype User Operational Evaluation System (UOES). The Large Displacement Unmanned Undersea Vehicle (LDUUV) provides long endurance UUVs operating autonomously in denied littorals with multiple mission payloads to increase the Navy's capacity and capability.
Persistent Littoral Undersea Surveillance (PLUS): The Persistent Littoral Undersea Surveillance (PLUS) program provides effective, adaptive and persistent undersea surveillance targets over large littoral areas.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>PLUS will develop a prototype User Operational Evaluation System (UOES) in response to an Urgent Operational Need (UON) request from the Fleet. The PLUS UOES will be utilized in a fleet experimentation event to develop Concept of Employment (CONEMP) for a potential follow-on program of record.

LDUUV will award Engineering Development Model (EDM) contract(s) to design, build and test LDUUV EDM(s).  ONR's LDUUV Innovative Naval Prototype (INP) program will transition 4 prototype vehicles to PMS 406 LDUUV Program of Record (POR) as User Operational Evaluation Systems (UOES).  The LDUUV UOES will be utilized in exercises to support requirement and CONOP development that feeds into LDUUV POR.  First ONR LDUUV INP vehicles are expected to transition at the end of FY 15.
This effort will transition to PEO-LCS / PMS406 as a User Operational Evaluation System (UOES) in FY 2013.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program provides a combination of U.S. Navy systems to counter the threat to amphibious forces from obstacles and anti-landing/sea mines in the Beach Zone and Surf Zone (0-10 ft water). The Assault Breaching Systems (ABS) consist of a system of systems approach that includes the following programs:  JABS - Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) Assault Breaching System; CMS - Countermine System; COBRA - Coastal Battlefield Reconnaissance and Analysis; PNMS - Precision Navigation and Marking System; and C4I - Command, Control, Computers, Communications, and Intelligence.  The Assault Breaching Systems enable the Navy-Marine Corps team to conduct Joint Forcible Entry Operations (JFEO), Ship-To-Objective Maneuver (STOM), and other combat operations to project power ashore.

The JDAM Assault Breaching System (JABS) is a currently fielded system that neutralizes surface mines and obstacles in the Beach Zone and Surf Zone.  The ABS Tactical Decision Aid optimizes the Desired Points of Impact (DPI) for JDAM munitions to effectively neutralize mines and obstacles while minimizing the required number of munitions and friendly aircraft sorties.  Continued testing is required to optimize the ABS Tactical Decision Aid database for the most common enemy mines and obstacles.

The Countermine System (CMS) is the far-term solution for neutralizing buried mines in the Beach Zone and Surf Zone.  CMS transitioned from a 6.3 S&amp;T Concept Demonstration effort to a 6.4 development program after a concept decision/AoA in FY06.  CMS is the only USN system capable of neutralizing buried mines. 

Coastal Battlefield Reconnaissance and Analysis (COBRA) is the ABS program to conduct ISR/T.  This system provides Airborne Mine Countermeasures (AMCM) capability, and one system consists of two Airborne Payloads and one Post Mission Analysis Station.  Under the umbrella of evolutionary acquisition, three increments of development are planned. Block I is a multispectral sensor capable of daytime detection of surface-laid minefields and obstacles in the Beach Zone.  Block II adds a 3D LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) sensor that enables nighttime detection of mines and obstacles in the Beach Zone and the Surf Zone (0-10 ft of water).  Block II also adds on-board near real-time processing of multispectral imagery data.  Block III adds an interferometric sensor that is capable of detecting buried mines.  Blocks II and III will incorporate technology being developed by 6.3 S&amp;T.  COBRA consists of a modular payload architecture that can be integrated onto the MQ-8B Fire Scout Vertical Takeoff and Landing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (VTUAV)  or USN manned helicopters like the SH-60.  COBRA will serve as the "detect" mission module in the Surf Zone and Beach Zone for the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) Mine Warfare mission package.
 
Precision Navigation &amp; Marking System (PNMS) provides navigational upgrades for the Landing Craft, Air Cushion (LCAC); Landing Craft, Utility (LCU); and Amphibious Assault Vehicle (AAV).  A system of virtual lane marking improves the navigation ability of these three assault craft which enables them to navigate safely through the neutralized assault lanes provided by JABS and CMS.  OPN funds the CRAFTALTS to upgrade the navigation systems.  LCU Navigation Upgrade: Modernized the navigation system to enable safe transit through the breached lane.  LCAC Autopilot Upgrade: An integrated improvement to the LCAC Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) navigation system for craft control that allows precise navigation and hovering within the breached lane.  These software upgrades and backfits occur during scheduled LCAC SLEPs. AAV Navigation Upgrade : Modernize the navigation system to enable precise transit through the breached lane.  

Command, Control, Computers, Communications and Intelligence (C4I) system will tie all of the above systems together under an integrated ABS architecture that is compatible with the existing Mine Warfare architecture.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Countermine/Counter Obstacle (CM/CO) is a two phased approach, near term and far term solutions. The near term approach for CM/CO is JDAM Assault Breaching System (JABS) and ABS Tactical Decision Aid and this effort has been completed. The far term solution is CMS, which transitioned from ONR in 2nd QTR FY07 followed by SD&amp;D contract in 4th QTR 08.

Intelligence/Surveillance/Reconnaissance/Targeting (ISR/T) - COBRA Block I achieved MS C in 3rd QTR FY09. COBRA Block II technology transferred from ONR and will achieve MS B in 2nd QTR FY16. COBRA Block III technology will transition in FY18.

Precision Navigation &amp; Marking System (PNMS) - The navigation upgrades for the Landing Craft, Air Cushion (LCAC) and Landing Craft, Utility (LCU) are in progress. AAV enhancements will be achieved through an ECP (PMA AAV (Marine Corps)) in 2nd QTR FY14.

All of the above systems continue to meet or exceed their Key Performance Parameters and benefit from effective program management that efficiently allocates the funding it receives.  Any delays in program timelines and increases in costs are due directly to previous year's budget cuts.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Surface Ship Torpedo Defense (SSTD) program provides a detect-to-engage layered torpedo defense capability.  It is comprised of four major efforts, the AN/SLQ-25 (NIXIE) system, Torpedo Warning System (TWS), the Countermeasure Anti-Torpedo (CAT) and Acoustic Device Countermeasure (ADC MK2 Mod4).  There are two development programs, the CAT program develops a canisterized Anti-Torpedo Torpedo (ATT) as an ACAT II program.  The TWS develops the required torpedo detection, classification and localization (TDCL) ship systems as an ACAT III program.  The AN/SLQ-25X solicitation was cancelled due to a more cost effective technical solution of interfacing the TWS to NIXIE system.

The program will develop and field six Surface Ship Torpedo Defense prototype (TWS/CAT) Engineering Design Model (EDM) systems on CVNs. Each prototype consists of one TWS and eight CATs. The six systems were accelerated due to the lack of hard-kill torpedo defense on HVUs which has been exacerbated by recent real-world events and evolving threats. The systems provide a hard-kill torpedo defense capability in advance of the IOC as part of the program of record. The program delivered one hybrid prototype system in FY13 on USS GHW BUSH.   The next prototype is expected to deliver in FY14; This system will be delivered in a roll-on/roll-off (RO-RO) configuration and installed on USS Roosevelt.  The program will build and deliver one additional RO-RO and one EDM in FY15 and 2 EDMs in FY16.

The program will focus on first providing torpedo defense capability to High Value Units (HVU). The Initial Operational Capability (IOC) system will be installed on one CVN and one Combat Logistics Force (CLF) ship (both HVUs) with IOC in FY19.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

FY 2015 includes increases for the SSTD Rapid Fielding Plan, speed-to-fleet technologies.  FY 2015 also includes decrease due to the Department's decision to reduce contracted services and other rate/miscellaneous adjustments.
 
Technical and Schedule:  FY13 reductions and adjustments eliminated 1 of the 2 RO-ROs and delayed the remaining unit to the end of FY14. IOC is FY19.  PB14 changed the requirement to deliver 2 EDMs in FY15 to 1 RO-RO and 1 EDM.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>CAT Program:  In FY09 and FY10, the CAT project completed a Systems Requirements Review (SRR) and Preliminary Design Review (PDR) on the second Engineering Development Model (EDM-2) design.  Applied Research Lab (ARL) will complete the EDM-2 design and hold a Critical Design Review (CDR) in FY15. ARL will fabricate test articles and 40 total EDM-2 CATS in support of the prototype fielding.  Integration testing began in FY13 and will continue through delivery of the prototype CATs.  A complete Technical Data Package (TDP) will be prepared.   Program will enter Milestone C decision in late FY16 and a competitive fixed price contract will be awarded to build low rate initial production (LRIP) units.  These units will support operational testing beginning in FY18 with an FY19 IOC.

TWS Program:  In FY09 and FY10, a towed sensor system specification was developed and 2 sea tests were conducted on Navy destroyers that demonstrated the ability of three different passive sonar ranging techniques and demonstrated the benefit of new torpedo detection sonar waveforms.  Data from these tests is being applied to the HVU application, and the sensor specification is being modified to meet the increased capability required for HVU ships.  Development and production of the new sensors is being conducted by 3Phoenix.  A complete sensor set was delivered in 2nd QTR FY12 to support an at sea test in the 3rd QTR FY12.  At the same time, a ready-stowage rack, and fire control systems are being developed by Pacific Engineering Incorporated (PEI) and In-Depth Engineering, respectively.  All of these components were brought together for integration in FY13.  This integration will support fabrication and fielding of the prototype systems.  This testing will inform a Milestone C decision in late FY16.  A contract will be awarded for TWS LRIP systems to support Operational Testing beginning in FY18, with an FY19 IOC.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Navy unique program addresses all technology areas associated with Navy/Marine Corps aircraft operations aboard ships. The program includes:

- (2208) - Development of ship hull, mechanical, propulsion, electrical, aviation, and combat support systems, subsystems and components to significantly improve aircraft carrier affordability, manpower requirements, survivability, and operational capabilities, and to meet the requirements of existing and pending regulations and statutes critical to the operation of existing and future aircraft carriers. Funding for this project continues in PE 0604112N in FY 15 and later. 

- (3216) - The AN/SQQ-34 Aircraft Carrier Tactical Support Center (CV-TSC) contributes to Aircraft Carrier (CVN) self defense capabilities. The system provides shipboard support of multi-mission aircraft operating organic to the CVN or under control of the Carrier Strike Group (CSG), providing primary mission support for Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) and Surface Warfare (SUW). The AN/SQQ-34 also provides auxiliary support for secondary missions such as search and rescue.  The system provides the capability to collect, process, analyze, display, and distribute sensor and tactical data in support of detection, classification, and localization of targets. The AN/SQQ-34 is incrementally upgraded to support new air platforms and their sensors, centrally integrate ASW capabilities on the CVN, transition maturing technologies, and maintain interoperability with interfacing systems. The system provides support for both rotary wing aircraft (SH-60F, MH-60R) and future support for fixed wing aircraft operating within the CSG (P-8, BAMS).

- (4004) - Development of an advanced technology aircraft launch system in support of the CVN 78 Class design and construction schedule. The Electro Magnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) will replace the current steam catapult on CVN 78 Class ships. EMALS provides better control of applied forces, both peak and transient dynamic, improved
reliability and maintainability, increased operational availability and reduced operator and maintainer workload. Funding for this project continues in PE 0604112N in FY 15 and later. 



- (4005) - The In-Service Carrier Systems Development Demonstration and Validation program exploits available technologies to deliver an affordable, robust, operator-friendly automation control environment for Navy Aircraft Carrier shipboard equipment. The program provides the system architecture, requirements/specification development, technology selection, software development (including software baseline), as well as land-based and shipboard testing of new technologies to improve shipboard operations and to reduce workload, manpower requirements, and Total Ownership Costs (TOC).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides for the development of aircraft carrier specific technologies, the infusion of the ship technology base into existing and future aircraft carriers, and the potential realization of subsystem design capabilities not currently feasible. This project transitions the most promising technologies from the Navy technology base, other government laboratories, and the private sector into specific advanced development efforts. All systems developed in this project have the potential to support emerging requirements and other promising systems technologies for insertion into new aircraft carrier designs. The emphasis is directed toward developing ship hull, mechanical, propulsion, electrical, aviation, warfare systems, and combat support systems, sub-systems and components to significantly improve aircraft carrier affordability, manpower requirements, survivability, and operational capabilities and to meet the requirements of existing and pending regulations and statutes critical to the operation of future aircraft carriers. This project also encompasses those tasks required to support CVN 78 procurement, including, but not limited to engineering support, programmatic and program support, logistics support, modeling and simulation, test and evaluation, manpower and program related studies, and design support systems, such as the Integrated Digital Environment (IDE). Funding for this project continues in PE 0604112N in FY 15 and later.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The AN/SQQ-34 Aircraft Carrier Tactical Support Center (CV-TSC) contributes to Aircraft Carrier (CVN) self defense capabilities. The system provides shipboard support of multi-mission aircraft operating organic to the CVN or under control of the Carrier Strike Group (CSG), providing primary mission support for Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) and Surface Warfare (SUW). The AN/SQQ-34 also provides auxiliary support for secondary missions such as search and rescue.  The system provides the capability to collect, process, analyze, display, and distribute sensor and tactical data in support of detection, classification, and localization of targets. The AN/SQQ-34 is incrementally upgraded to support new air platforms and their sensors, centrally integrate ASW capabilities on the CVN, transition maturing technologies, and maintain interoperability with interfacing systems. The system provides support for both rotary wing aircraft (SH-60F, MH-60R) and future support for fixed wing aircraft operating within the CSG (P-8, BAMS).
 
Additionally, this project will mature the development of low-cost multi-beam Ku-Band planar phased arrays and associated integrated radio systems, and addresses the major cost drivers of planar arrays and their associated radios. This effort will be the first spiral of a major cost reduction effort for multi-beam arrays, with the goal of showing a path to a production cost of less than one third the cost of existing array technologies. This development will produce key integrated components needed to reduce the cost of arrays and will provide prototype multi-beam Ku-Band receiving and transmitting arrays/radios using these components. The effort will also emphasize advances in technologies associated with multi-path interference, scan angle losses and networking waveforms.
(Speed to Fleet) The CV-TSC program provides increased situational awareness to the Carrier Strike Group (CSG) in support of force protection, primarily in the area of Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW).  A portion of this program will focus on maturing low-cost multi-beam Ku-Band planar phased arrays and associated integrated radio systems that will be used to support data links to multiple MH-60Rs.  This specific effort will address the need for low cost communications security (COMSEC) devices that are compatible with phased array systems, and that are needed to secure these data links.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Software version 8.0 is the baseline being developed to support CVN-78, which includes a new combat system architecture. Efforts included requirements specification revisions, architecture requirements revisions, and early developmental software builds modifying infrastructure to support the CVN-78 combat system. Software version 8.0 will include acoustic signal processing and analysis improvements, sensor performance predictions and mission planning support for the MH-60R acoustic sensor suite, embedded training for shipboard operators, and interoperability changes to support the Ship-Self Defense System (SSDS) and Common Data Link (CDL).

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Mission Description:  The Radiation Detection, Indication and Computation (RADIAC) Program is responsible for providing radiation monitoring instruments that detect and measure ionizing radiation.  These instruments are used on all Navy, Coast Guard and Military Sealift Command vessels, and at every Navy shore installation, in order to ensure the safety of personnel, continuity of operations in radiological contingencies, and protection of the environment.

Justification:  Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 20 (10CFR20) requires RADIAC instruments be used to ensure the safety of personnel who work with or are exposed to radioactive materials in their work.  Additionally, the Navy's mission requires personnel and ships to have the ability to operate in radiological environments and the ability to identify and interdict radiological Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD).  Navy programs that require RADIAC instruments for Occupational Safety &amp; Health (OSH) reasons under the provisions of 10CFR20 include Naval Nuclear Propulsion, Nuclear Weapons, Medical, and Radiological Affairs Support.  Non-OSH programs include Radiological Defense, Consequence Management, Training, Technical (RADIAC calibration, shielding evaluation, research, etc.) and Radiological Search (maritime interdiction and radiological search missions to locate or intercept WMD).

This budget item develops new, highly reliable, more easily calibrated, easy to care and maintain, light weight and modern RADIAC instruments in order to improve the effectiveness of radiation safety, to make instruments simpler to use, and to reduce life cycle costs.  The ultimate goal is to replace old, bulky, costly to maintain and repair, unreliable and obsolete instrumentation with multifunction equipment that can be automatically calibrated at greatly reduced cost.

This budget item also provides for improvement to nuclear weapons intrinsic radiation (gamma and neutron) shielding calculations, mixed field (neutron and gamma) dosimetry, and in neutron measurement.  The objective is to develop less costly and more effective integral shielding for better personnel protection and safety.  Improvement in personnel dosimetry and neutron measurement is also a major emphasis.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Mission: The Radiation Detection, Indication and Computation (RADIAC) Program is responsible for providing radiation monitoring instruments that detect and measure radiation in accordance with the provisions of Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10CFR).  These instruments are used on all vessels afloat and at every shore installation in order to ensure the safety of personnel and the environment.  RADIACs are also required after an act of terrorism or war that involves nuclear material in order to enable continuing warfighting ability.

Justification: Many RADIAC instruments and dosimetry systems are decades old and approaching the end of their useful lives.  In some cases the equipment and replacement parts are no longer manufactured, making the equipment logistically unsupportable.  In other cases increasing failure rates due to age make replacements an economic efficiency
improvement.  In all cases a technology refresh will make both economic sense and provide increased operational capabilities.  
Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program (NNPP):  Instruments are developed to support the safe operation and maintenance of nuclear powered vessels and at nuclear maintenance facilities.
Non-NNPP: Instruments are developed to support other than NNPP end users, such as Explosive Ordnance Disposal, Weapons, Medical, Industrial Radiography and Training. 
Visit, Board, Search &amp; Seizure (VBSS): The Navy has been tasked to intercept and board vessels at sea to search for nuclear or radiological materials that could be used for terrorist attacks. These instruments would have different characteristics than those used for NNPP and non-NNPP purposes and prototypes must be developed and/or tested and evaluated.  
The AN/PDR-65 Ship Board Monitoring System is obsolete and will be replaced.  The IM-239/WDQ Air Particle Detector (APD) and the HD-732, HD-1150 and HD-1151 Air Particle Samplers (APS) are obsolete and will be replaced.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>The need for dosimetry is a very significant consequence of working with or around ionizing radiation.  The expensive infrastructure and investments by the Navy in its dosimetry program is evidence of the importance attributed by the Navy to the health and safety of the Navy's military and civilian personnel, and that of the general public.  As new and improved technologies appear, it is important to evaluate them for their potential to improve performance while reducing total operating costs.  Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) is a relatively new technology where the benefits appear to be significant but have yet to be fully evaluated.  This project's objective is to make modest investments with the labor of a Navy Health Physicist to explore, in collaboration with a U.S. Army colleague interested in the same technology for Army use, the potential of the joint military application for OSL dosimetry.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>All surface combatants require an instrument to detect and measure radiological activity in the event of a nuclear detonation in order for the ship to avoid the radiological danger and continue its mission.   The AN/PDR-65, at over 40 years of age, was the instrument used for this purpose, but it is obsolete and has been de-fielded.  An interim replacement has been fielded while OPNAV finalizes updating the Cold War requirements under which the AN/PDR-65 was designed in order to include radiological (terrorist dirty bomb) threats.  The interim replacement is the IM-265 Survey Meter, which is already in the Navy inventory, but it was not designed for this requirement and cannot measure radiation external to the ship and is therefore not suitable as the permanent replacement.  In light of Operation Tomodachi this requirement has taken on more significance.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Title>Visit, Board, Search &amp; Seizure</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The Visit, Board, Search &amp; Seizure (VBSS) mission of the Navy includes the requirement to be able to board ships and be able to detect and identify potential radiological or nuclear Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD).  Such a sensitive mission requires leading edge technology and capabilities to ensure success.  The AN/PDX-1 RADIAC Set was fielded in response to a Joint Urgent Operational Needs Statement to meet this requirement.  It contains several instruments that serve different purposes, including the search detector, isotope identifier, and personal dosimeter.  Current technology dictates that the sensitivity of the detector is directly proportional to the size of the detector element; i.e., the larger the detector, the more sensitive and capable it is.  However, in VBSS there must be a tradeoff between size/weight and capability, since it is difficult and hazardous for boarding parties to carry a backpack-sized detector, along with their weapons and other gear, up a rope ladder to board a vessel on the high seas.  This will be a continuing and growing effort to find smaller, lighter instruments with enhanced sensitivity, reach-back capability, and other enhancements to provide the Navy the best and most cost effective equipment possible for this critical mission.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Title>Calibrators</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>Calibrators are the basic tool used to calibrate all Navy radiological detection equipment.  Essentially they consist of a high energy radiological source (Cs-137) in a shielded container that is located in a specially constructed room, or "range."  A technician places the instrument to be calibrated at a specific calibration point in the range and remotely operates the calibrator by raising the source out of its container so that it irradiates the object instrument.  The instrument's response to the radiation is measured so that it can be calibrated to specific tolerances.  The current suite of AN/UDM-1B calibrators is over 20 years old and the natural decay of the strength of the radioactive source over time restricts calibration effectiveness by limiting the scale of calibration points below American National Standards Institute (ANSI) requirements that are followed in accordance with Navy policy.  Also due to the age of the calibrators, there are several parts no longer supported by the manufacturer, and a malfunctioning calibrator poses a very high safety risk.  COTS equipment will be surveyed to find the best solution with which to equip the Navy's seven RADIAC Calibration Laboratories with modern calibrators.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Several facilities throughout the Navy, particularly accelerator facilities, produce significant neutron radiation fields.  Having a monitor to provide instant readings on the neutron level provides data on high dose procedures and experiments.  The current system requires environmental dosimeters to be used and sent out for processing, taking weeks to obtain results.  Waiting on dosimeter results may cause excessive exposures to individuals because safe radiological boundaries may not be maintained where the radiation level is not known.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Telescoping rate meters play a vital role in the practice of radiation safety in the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program.  The detector is attached to the end of an extendable, telescoping pole, thus allowing the operator to maintain a safe distance for high exposure areas.  This allows the Navy to comply with federal regulations that radioactive doses received by operators are As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA).</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Several commands use non-destructive interrogation techniques when searching cargo containers.  These techniques expose the container to a 14 MeV neutron generator and analyze the reflected data.  These end users require a portable neutron detector capable of accurately measuring the neutrons produced by the interrogation in order to monitor the work area to ensure dose limits are not exceeded.  

This work may also prove to be a suitable technology that would also enable replacement of the aging AN/PDR-70 Neutron Survey Meter.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Title>Primary Dosimetry</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The need for primary dosimetry is inherent due to the Navy's operation of nuclear reactors and their emission of ionizing radiation.  Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 20.1502, states "Each licensee shall monitor exposures to radiation and radioactive material at levels sufficient to demonstrate compliance with the occupational dose limits."  A primary dosimeter must pass accreditation proficiency testing, allowing the reading obtained to become a part of an individual's permanent health record.  This permanent record is used to protect the individual radiation worker's health, and the Navy from future liability.  The Navy's current primary device is the DT-702, a Thermo Luminescence Dosimeter (TLD).  Existing TLD and newer technologies (e.g., Optically Stimulated Luminescence, or OSL) must be continually researched to determine on-going performance parameters, cost to field and cost to maintain.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>A secondary dosimeter provides an accurate, real-time readout of the radiation exposure being obtained in operational environments, and is utilized in conjunction with a primary dosimeter.  The primary dosimeter does not provide real-time exposure information, so the secondary dosimeter is worn for that purpose.  The Navy's secondary dosimeter is the Mk2 Electronic Personal Dosimeter (EPD).  Evaluation of the current detector must be accomplished to establish a militarized environmental capability.  Also, research is required to find a secondary dosimeter that can measure the type of radiation encountered with pulsed X-ray machines, and to see if this new capability can be incorporated into one device such as the existing Mk2.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The CNO's ASW initiative is a focused effort to identify the most promising ASW technologies through a process of discovery, assessment, experimentation, and analysis.  The CNO's ASW initiative will coordinate the development of technologies which move beyond incremental or marginal improvements in ASW effectiveness.  The CNO's vision of "fundamentally changing the way ASW is currently conducted to render the enemy submarine irrelevant against US and coalition forces" necessitates a change in the calculus of how the US Navy conducts ASW.  Central to the CNO's ASW initiatives achieving the CNO's vision are several innovative approaches which include using the art-of-the-technologically-possible; minimizing force-on-force; reducing the ASW end-to-end time line; supporting rapid maneuver; developing off-board and distributed ASW detection systems; and finding innovative weapons solutions.  To achieve these key approaches, it is essential to develop new ASW technologies and conduct at-sea experiments to prove/disprove technology concepts and collect corroborating data.  An OPNAV letter of direction limits the scope of this project, beginning in FY10, to the development/test of CAS/VDS and the continuation of studies in support of the ASW Initiative thereafter.  Starting in FY13, the CAS/VDS effort has been transferred to the Littoral Combat Ship PE 0603581N, Project 3129 budget, as part of the ASW Mission Module.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The CNO's ASW initiative is a focused effort to identify the most promising ASW technologies through a process of discovery, assessment, experimentation, and analysis.  The CNO's ASW initiative will coordinate the development of technologies which move beyond incremental or marginal improvements in ASW effectiveness.  The CNO's vision of "fundamentally changing the way ASW is currently conducted to render the enemy submarine irrelevant against US and coalition forces" necessitates a change in the calculus of how the US Navy conducts ASW.  Central to the CNO's ASW initiatives achieving the CNO's vision are several innovative approaches which include using the art-of-the-technologically-possible; minimizing force-on-force; reducing the ASW end-to-end time line; supporting rapid maneuver; developing off-board and distributed ASW detection systems; and finding innovative weapons solutions.  To achieve these key approaches, it is essential to develop new ASW technologies and conduct at-sea experiments to prove/disprove technology concepts and collect corroborating data.  An OPNAV letter of direction limits the scope of this project, beginning in FY10, to the development/test of CAS/VDS and the continuation of studies in support of the ASW Initiative thereafter.  Starting in FY13, the CAS/VDS effort has been transferred to the Littoral Combat Ship PE 0603581N, Project 3129 budget, as part of the ASW Mission Module.
The detection and identification of underwater mines based on structural acoustic features has been successfully demonstrated.  This structural acoustics (SA) approach offers significant increases in coverage rates together with higher probabilities of detection and lower false alarm rates against most of the threat mines the Navy is expected to encounter in the foreseeable future. Highly successful blind tests have been carried out demonstrating high performance detection and classification with low false alarm rates. This technology is now in transition to the fleet.  The work proposed here, is to develop and demonstrate a long range/high coverage rate ASW systems concept based on the Low-Frequency Broadband (LFBB) technology using a fleet sonar AN/SQQ-89 on surface combatants.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>The detection and identification of underwater mines based on structural acoustic features has been successfully demonstrated. This structural acoustics (SA) approach offers significant increases in coverage rates together with higher probabilities of detection and lower false alarm rates against most of the threat mines the Navy is expected to encounter in the foreseeable future. Highly successful blind tests have been carried out demonstrating high performance detection and classification with low false alarm rates. This technology is now in transition to the fleet. The Navy will develop and demonstrate a long range/high coverage rate ASW systems concept based on the LFBB technology using a fleet sonar AN/SQQ-89 on surface combatants.  Specifically, using a standard AN/SQQ-53C as a source and the Multi-Function Towed Array (MFTA) as a receiver.  In the Speed to Fleet effort, the Navy will build a special processor that will "roll on" the surface combatant and be able to be integrated into the existing AN/SQQ-89 system.  The processor will run codes already developed in the ONR programs, but now adapted to the ASW problem.  Ultimately, the demonstration will involve testing and documenting the ability of the approach to distinguish and correctly identify low Doppler bottom, near bottom, submarines and false targets as a function of speed and range from target fields.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element supports innovative research and development in submarine Hull, Mechanical and Electrical (HM&amp;E) and combat systems technologies and the subsequent evaluation, demonstration, and validation for submarine platforms. It will increase the submarine technology base and provide subsystem design options not currently feasible. The program element also supports programs transitioning from Science and Technology (S&amp;T), Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), Independent Research and Development, and Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) projects. 
Project Unit 0223:
The Advanced Submarine Combat Systems Development non-acquisition (NON-ACAT) Project supports Navy Submarine Acoustic Superiority and Technology Insertion Initiatives through the application of advanced development and testing of sonar and tactical control systems improvements. This Project transitions technologies developed by Navy technology bases, the private sector, Office of Naval Research (ONR), Future Naval Capabilities (FNC), and DARPA. The Project addresses technology challenges to improve tactical control in littoral and open ocean environments for a variety of operational missions including peacetime engagement, surveillance, battle space preparation, deterrence, regional sea denial, precision strike, task group support, and ground warfare support. Prototype hardware/software systems are developed to demonstrate technologically promising system concepts in laboratory and at-sea submarine environments. Specifically, the focus of the technology efforts will be Advanced Processing Build (APB) for acoustics, imaging, tactical control, electronic warfare, and Advanced Sonar Arrays. APBs develop and demonstrate improvements to current and future sonar/combat control systems. The Advanced Sonar Arrays program develops and tests new sensors and demonstrates large array configurations. This Project is funded under demonstration and validation, as it develops and integrates hardware for experimental tests related to specific platform applications. Technologies and/or capabilities developed under this program will be shared, as applicable, with surface and surveillance sonar/combat system development programs. In particular, development programs for surface ship sonar, Advanced Capability Build (ACB) and surveillance platforms, Advanced Surveillance Build (ASB), will work closely with the APB program to optimize software reuse. ACB, ASB and APB may co-develop capabilities and modular architecture technologies to maximize commonality and cost effectiveness.

Project Unit 2033:
The Advanced Submarine Systems Development (ASSD) Program is a non-acquisition program that develops and matures technologies for successful integration into future and modernized submarine classes, thus lowering acquisition and life cycle program costs while improving mission capability.  ASSD transitions Hull, Mechanical, and Electrical (HM&amp;E) technologies and future naval concepts from Science &amp; Technology (S&amp;T) and Research and Development (R&amp;D) to operational platforms; performs tests and demonstrates submarine design and naval architecture products destined for integration into future submarine classes or backfit into existing fleet assets; develops, initially integrates, and does test validation of leading payload concepts for submarine integration in support of the Design for Undersea Warfare; and operates unique R&amp;D experimentation, modeling, testing and simulation facilities to enhance submarine stealth, maneuverability, capability, and affordability. The program also supports Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR), Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR), Office of Naval Research (ONR), Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Programs and near and mid-term technology insertion to achieve future submarine class total ownership cost reductions, and influence future submarine concept designs and core technologies. Experimentation and demonstration is conducted in a joint warfighting context with other services, (i.e. the U.S. Marines, U.S. Army, and the U.S. Air Force), to enable early assessment of warfighting capabilities, and to contribute to smarter technology selection decisions for potential incremental development. This program also supports Information Exchange Programs and joint Project Arrangements (PA) with the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and other international partners.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Advanced Submarine Systems Development (ASSD) Program is a non-acquisition program that develops and matures technologies for successful integration into future and modernized submarine classes, thus lowering acquisition and life cycle program costs while improving mission capability.  ASSD transitions Hull, Mechanical, and Electrical (HM&amp;E) technologies and future naval concepts from Science &amp; Technology (S&amp;T) and Research and Development (R&amp;D) to operational platforms; performs tests and demonstrates submarine design and naval architecture products destined for integration into future submarine classes or backfit into existing fleet assets; develops, initially integrates, and does test validation of leading payload concepts for submarine integration in support of the Design for Undersea Warfare; and operates unique R&amp;D experimentation, modeling, testing and simulation facilities to enhance submarine stealth, maneuverability, capability, and affordability. The program also supports Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR), Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR), Office of Naval Research (ONR), Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Programs and near and mid-term technology insertion to achieve future submarine class total ownership cost reductions, and influence future submarine concept designs and core technologies. Experimentation and demonstration is conducted in a joint warfighting context with other services, (i.e. the U.S. Marines, U.S. Army, and the U.S. Air Force), to enable early assessment of warfighting capabilities, and to contribute to smarter technology selection decisions for potential incremental development. This program also supports Information Exchange Programs and joint Project Arrangements (PA) with the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and other international partners.

Project 2033 is comprised of  three budget categories: Stealth, Payloads &amp; Sensors, and Innovative Technology Transition/Concept Development. 
NOTE: Project 2033 has combined Advanced Propulsion/Ship Concept and Total Ownership Cost (TOC) into Innovative Technology Transition/Concept Development. Budget categories were combined to consolidate projects into one.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Note:  Beginning in 2015, there is an administrative change that will shift efforts funded from PE 0603561N (Advanced Submarine System Development) / Project 3220 to PE 0603595N (Ohio Replacement) / Project 3220.  This shift is consistent with Congressional intent identified in HR 933 (FY13).

The Sea Based Strategic Deterrent (SBSD) Advanced Submarine System Development project supports the OHIO Replacement (OR) program.  The funding applies to the design, systems engineering, prototyping, and vendor qualification activities needed to execute the schedule for Common Missile Compartment (CMC) design, whole ship design, and component technologies development for the next generation U.S. ballistic missile submarine. This RDT&amp;E program supports cooperation with the United Kingdom (UK) to maintain strategic deterrence, based on a single effort to develop a CMC as agreed by the UK Secretary of State for Defence and the U.S. Secretary of Defense in 2009.

The OHIO Replacement program strategy is to maximize the re-use of existing OHIO systems and new designs from the SEAWOLF and VIRGINIA Classes (as applicable), focus on Life Cycle Total Ownership Cost (TOC) affordability, and meet the military requirements established for this SSBN to achieve mission success in a challenging environment. The requested funding levels support the Technology Development, Design, and Engineering Integration efforts to support the OHIO Replacement SSBN lead ship construction start in FY 2021.

The following key activities support a ship acquisition program to replace the OHIO Class SSBNs: 											
1. Design and development of a missile compartment, launch system, and strategic support systems to meet U.S. strategic requirements while cooperating with the UK on modernizing its strategic deterrent in accordance with Presidential direction (December 2006).

2. Concept and System Definition for remaining portions of the ship will be accomplished by the Design/Build/Sustain approach modeled after the VIRGINIA Class program.											
3. Development of advanced submarine platform technologies to provide capabilities needed to enhance platform operational effectiveness and minimize life cycle cost.

											
OR Concept and System Definition Prototyping, and Technology Development Efforts:											
The OR program supports design, systems engineering, prototyping and vendor qualification activities needed to develop CMC design, the OHIO Replacement whole ship design, and component development. The OR design timelines are based on the approach proven on VIRGINIA Class Program, adjusted for the additional complexity of a missile compartment and Strategic Weapons Systems (SWS). Planned technical studies and prototyping are necessary to reduce risks associated with updating SSBN system designs for current technical standards and demonstrating design feasibility of developmental technology to inform the establishment of detailed requirements. 											
The Navy continues investing in Design for Affordability (DFA) initiatives similar to those employed successfully for VIRGINIA Class, but tailored to the unique SSBN mission and operational tempo of OHIO Replacement to drive down overall program costs. Efforts will focus on reducing ship construction costs through implementing more effective design features to produce a more affordable/producible class. As part of this effort, alternative contracting strategies will be examined to include multi-class multiyear procurement (MYP) and economic order quantity (EOQ).											
Activities planned for FY 2015 are required to maintain the first article prototype of the CMC to support the UK SUCCESSOR programme.  The CMC program will mature required technologies and re-host the TRIDENT II D5 SWS (Launcher, Fire Control and Navigation) while ensuring no degradation to D5 security, safety and performance. In addition, whole ship design efforts are focused on technologies requiring significant development times and those technologies that are required to support ship design and construction schedules such as the propulsor, maneuvering/ship control and signatures.  These technologies are critical for stealth capability for a ship class that will be in service until the 2080s. Ship concept design efforts include important pre-construction activities such as finalizing ship requirements, risk characterization of developmental technology, improvement and validation of performance prediction tools and improvement of design tools. Technology development will address maturation of technologies.

Note:  Beginning in 2015, there is an administrative change that will shift efforts funded from PE 0603561N (SBSD Advanced Submarine System Development) / Project 3220 to PE 0603595N (Ohio Replacement) / Project 3220.

Specific initiatives include robotic welding, Integrated Product Development Environment (IPDE) process development, and material reuse.  Continue to fund design yard incentives.  Continue program affordability efforts targeted to achieving potential savings associated with multi-year and/or Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) procurements across submarine classes, investigating the government vs. contractor furnished equipment mix for potential efficiencies, and potential savings associated with continuous missile tube and/or launch tube production runs.</r2:Text>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Submarine Tactical Warfare Systems program element is comprised of the Advanced Submarine Support Equipment Program (ASSEP) and the Submarine Special Operations Support Program.  The objective is to improve submarine operational effectiveness through the development and implementation of advanced Research and Development (R&amp;D).  In order to provide improved operational effectiveness, R&amp;D efforts are focused on Advanced Imaging Developments and Advanced Electronic Warfare Support (ES) Developments.  A continuing need exists to improve these capabilities in view of the advancements in potential imaging counter detection, the need to support specialized missions, and the increasingly dense and sophisticated electronic environment caused by the proliferation of complex radar, communications, and navigation equipment of potential adversaries.  Ongoing developments in 360 degree imaging systems and electro-optic infra-red vulnerability signature reduction technologies are supporting these needs.  

The Submarine Arctic Warfare Development program responds to the increased threat of naval activity in the Arctic regions while continuously supporting the Navy's strategic objective of Assured Access and Combat Credibility.  The U.S. Navy Submarine Force (SUBFOR) demonstrates existing Arctic Warfare capabilities, operational and tactical proficiency while developing advanced submarine research and development technology in unique cold water environments, under-ice conditions, and ice-covered shallow water regions during Ice Exercises (ICEX).  ICEX provides the framework for various submarine research and development programs to conduct test and evaluation in Arctic regions or at periodic Ice Camps.  Particular emphasis is placed on the areas of sonar operability, tactical surveillance, weapon utility, and other submarine support missions.  Efforts include assessment of combat system effectiveness, development of Arctic specific improvements for existing sonar and weapons, development of class specific Arctic operational guidelines, and the testing of ice-capable submarine support structures.  This program also provides SUBFOR a cadre of trained Arctic Operation Specialists (AOS) and an inventory of unique Arctic sensors to optimize submarine safety during under-ice operations.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>A continuing need exists to improve Imaging and Electronic Warfare support (EW) capabilities in view of the advancements in potential imaging counter detection and the increasingly dense electromagnetic environment caused by the proliferation of complex radar, communications, and navigation equipment of potential adversaries.  Improvements are necessary for submarine EW and Imaging to be operationally effective in the following mission areas: Joint Littoral Warfare, Joint Surveillance, Space and Electronic Warfare, Intelligence Collection, Maritime Protection, and Joint Strike.  The program is divided into two project categories: Advanced Imaging Project Development and Advanced Electronic Warfare Support Project Development.  Both of these categories will allow for the mitigation of submarine masts, periscopes, and sensors to visual, radar, and infrared detection.  Evaluation of state of the art technology to implement periscope/mast improvements via EW electromagnetic and electro-optic sensors resulting in improved capability.  Engineering Demonstration Models (EDMs) are developed, evaluated, and validated in the lab and through at-sea testing.

The Advanced Imaging Project Development projects include the development of the Affordable Modular Panoramic Photonics Mast (AMPPM) which introduces several groundbreaking technologies such as individually replaceable capability modules (allowing a vast array of capability combinations without supporting redesign) as well as presenting live 360 degree High Definition video (greatly increasing situational awareness and reducing scope exposure time.)  Also in support of AMPPM advanced materiel Electro-Optic/Infrared (EO/IR) Vulnerability Signature Reduction;  Mast Test Vehicle (MTV) testing and Imaging Engineering Measurement Program.  The Advanced EW Development projects include the development of: Distant ES Support and Remote Log-In; Rapid Reprogramming Threat Libraries; Specific Emitter Identification (SEI) Improvements; Radar Vulnerability Tool; Enhanced DeInterleavers; ES Correlator; Low Probability of Intercept (LPI) Direction Finding (DF); Embedded Built-in Test (BIT); EW on-Board Trainer (OBT); Multi-function Modular Mast (MMM) Payloads and Next Generation EW Systems Algorithms and Applications.  OPNAV direction provided for Next Generation EW in reference dated 17 June 12, SER N97/12U144401.

All programs funded in this project are non-Acquisition Category (ACAT) programs.  The test articles identified consist of critical components that will be fully developed during Engineering Manufacturing and Development phase into EDMs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Explore alternative surface ship force structures, advanced surface ship and unmanned surface vehicles concepts, and the potential technologies for these force structures and advanced concepts in support of pre-acquisition mission needs analysis, mission area analysis, and planning. The objective is a more affordable, mission capable surface ship force including increased ship production capability; ships with reduce manning, reduced operating and support costs, and greater utilization of the latest technology. The program directly supports the Navy Shipbuilding Plan with state-of-the-art design tools and methods for surface ship force structure alternative studies, ship &amp; unmanned vehicle concept studies, and the actual conduct of surface ship force structure alternative studies and advanced design concept studies for the ships that may become part of the shipbuilding plan.

Project 2196 - This project funds concept development engineering, mission effectiveness analysis, and other analyses for formulation of future surface ship force structure along with development of the tools to accomplish these efforts. Efforts include advanced ship concept studies, ship and ship systems technology assessments, and the development and upgrade of ship concept design and engineering tools, methods, and criteria.

Project 3161 - This project funds a prioritized portfolio of time-sensitive initiatives through integrated efforts in Cross Platform Systems Development (CPSD), furthering Sea Enterprise through the development of support elements meeting relevant needs of the warfare community.  The areas of exploration for CPSD include surface ship concept advanced development, next generation unmanned surface vehicle, high speed ships, tool integration and technical data exchange, embedded interoperability engineering, and mission capability systems engineering.  The research products developed by this project directly support and influence both immediate fleet requirements and future acquisition programs by providing a range of technically acceptable alternatives and evaluation of emerging technologies. 

In particular, tasks within this project continue to directly support interoperability testing and certification for Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) and other platforms in deploying battle groups, development and certification of Safe Operating Envelope (SOE) tools for surface combatants (CG 47, DDG 51, DDG 1000), Total Ownership Cost (TOC) pilot programs, future flexible and modular warship analyses, and development of specifications and processes to reduce production costs of platforms.  

Tasks within this project continue to directly support the Test and Evaluation Master Plan (TEMP) execution for multiple ship classes including, LCS, JHSV, and DDG 1000 reducing Live Fire Test and Evaluation (LFT&amp;E) costs, furthered validation of hydrodynamic simulation tool supporting DDG 1000 Hull Form Plan (HFP), have increased technology readiness level for aluminum combatants, developed tools to execute the CG 47 Cracking Task Force recommendations, increased situational awareness for deploying strike groups.  This project supports NAVSEA's core mission and allows for improved performance and reduced cost of current and future naval platforms.

Project 3376 - Strategic Sealift Research and Development - Develops new concepts and technologies which can be applied to or will enable future strategic sealift, and Seabasing systems. The technologies include ship configuration concepts, equipment to increase cargo handling and cargo loading/unloading rates (including commercial and merchant ship systems), improved man/machine interfaces, improved structural configurations and materials, and Logistics-Over-the-Shore (LOTS) equipment and system improvements. This project is a continuation of efforts accomplished under NDSF BA 04 Project 3116 Strategic Sealift Research and Development and is not a new start. 

Note:  NDSF BA 04 Project 3116 Strategic Sealift Research and Development amounts:  FY 2013: $6.169M; FY 2014: $6.288M</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides the foundation for an affordable and mission capable surface ship force. It also supports the next step in the development of a transformed naval force by accomplishing the pre-milestone A (especially pre-concept decision) efforts for all potential surface ships and craft. These efforts are the required first step in the integration of total ship systems, including combat systems, weapons systems and Hull, Mechanical and Electrical (HM&amp;E) systems. Inadequate early planning and ship concept formulation can result in down-stream design, construction and operational problems. A more subtle and severely negative impact of neglecting this early effort is that the "best" concepts and technologies may never even be considered and our greatest potential ship design advances never realized. Designs and technologies must meet the threat. This project supports this requirement.

This project funds concept development engineering, mission effectiveness analysis, and other analyses for formulation of future surface ship force structure along with development of the tools to accomplish these efforts. Advanced ship concept studies, ship and ship systems technology assessments, and the development and upgrade of ship concept design and engineering tools, methods, and criteria are also funded in this project.

This project accomplishes the following: (1) Develops alternative surface ship force structure concepts including the ships and unmanned vehicles; (2) Evaluates the mission capability effectiveness and costs for these alternative surface fleet architectures; (3) Performs fleet war fighting/mission effectiveness assessment studies; (4) Identifies future surface ship requirements and characteristics necessary to meet future threats and support mission needs; (5) Investigates new affordable ship concepts and evaluates technologies necessary to support these concepts; (6) Provides design methods and automated design tools to develop and evaluate ship concepts; and (7) Supports development of Initial Capabilities Documents (ICD) and analogous early requirements documents for future ships. These efforts are done to support mission analysis; mission needs development and technology assessment in support of future fleet concepts and potential ship acquisition programs. These efforts are fundamental to the Navy's formulation of the future fleet.

Supports concept exploration and mission needs assessment for potential future ship acquisition programs, however, these are not direct efforts for specific, authorized shipbuilding programs. This project supports and maintains this country's naval ship design and engineering capabilities in the area of very early stage (Concept Design) design tools, criteria, and methods.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project has been established to support NAVSEA Technical Authority through coordinated, collaborative, cross-platform systems development resulting in advanced capabilities across business lines through development adaptation and extension of processes, procedures, and tools necessary to develop and explore alternative surface ship force structures; advanced surface ship and unmanned surface vehicle concepts; interoperability; and development of systems level engineering criteria and options to support these force structures and advanced concepts as part of pre-acquisition mission needs analysis, mission area analysis, SCN, and R&amp;D planning. The objective is the coordination of ongoing early-stage concept design and development efforts for cross-platform applicability to result in a more affordable, mission-capable, and interoperable surface ship forces including ships with reduced manning, increased ability to produce, reduced operating and support costs, and greater utilization of the latest technology.

NAVSEA Tech Authority efforts under Project 3161, known as the Cross Platform Systems Development (CPSD) Program enhance ongoing efforts within Project 2196 and transition directly to early-stage ship design for Ship Preliminary Design and Feasibility Studies and other Program Executive Office (PEO) ship design programs. While these efforts support concept exploration and mission needs assessment for potential future ship acquisition programs, they are not direct efforts for specific, authorized shipbuilding programs. This project is the only R&amp;D effort (Government or commercial) that provides a coordinated, collaborative approach to the development of: cross-platform naval ship and weapon system design, as well as engineering capabilities in the areas of design tools, criteria, and methods. This project also provides innovative solutions for current Fleet issues involving Technical Authority, such as current interoperability issues with new systems or platforms.  

Naval Ship System Engineering Tech Authority recapitalization and product development consolidates platform advanced concept development and design tool development in CPSD 1.0 (Platform Concept Advanced Development) and CPSD 2.0 (Platform Design and Certification Tools/Engineering and Tech Data Exchange Development); and aligned standards and requirements development for modularity and system / component commonality within CPSD 3.0 (Ship Systems Engineering/Modular Ship Systems Development). Program product areas support: platform-centric force architecture and concept development and tools (CPSD 1.0, CPSD 2.0), engineering products and system development (CPSD 3.0, CPSD 5.0), and system interoperability and mission capability for delivering ships (CPSDs 6.0, 8.0, 9.0). CPSD develops and transitions products to Technical Warrant Holder (TWH) community and develop prioritized plans and activities for future products from emerging cross platform technical requirements and associated capabilities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>0409 - DDG 51 FLT III Concept Development - Develop Preliminary Analysis, Testing, and Design for introduction of DDG 51 FLT III in FY16. 

2474 - LX(R) (formerly LSD(X)) is expected to functionally replace LSD-41 Class ships and LSD-49 Class ships for embark, transport, control, insert, sustainment, and extract of Marine Air-Ground Task Force elements and supporting forces by helicopters, landing craft, and amphibious vehicles.  Efforts are required to identify viable alternatives, including examining a reduced cost variant of LPD-17 Class.  Efforts include all Gate and Milestone (MS) documentation, Capabilities Development Documentation (CDD), and Indicative Design (ID).  Program is on track to support FY26 retirement of LSDs.  LX(R) will move to RDTEN PE 0604454N Project 2474 starting in FY15 and out.

3377 - Naval Operational Logistics Integration (OPLOG) - Develops enabling technologies for future and in-service afloat operational logistics and integrated supply systems; defines integrated combat logistics force and combatant logistics requirements; and provides a forum for cooperative initiatives of acquisition programs, program sponsors, engineering managers, the Navy science and technology community, and fleet customers. This project was previously funded in the National Defense Sealift Fund (NDSF) Appropriation (BA 04, PE 0408042N, Project 3117 Naval Operational Logistics Integration). This project in FY 2015 and later is a continuation of efforts and is not a new start. 

NDSF BA 04 Project 3117 prior year amounts: FY 2013: $18.170M; FY 2014: $20.024M

C253 - Develop concept studies, ship design, and trade off studies in support of recapitalization of the existing T-AO 187 Fleet Oiler Class.  The Navy's Combat Logistics Force (CLF) oilers supply fuel and dry cargo to Navy ships at sea.  The T-AO(X) will operate as a shuttle ship from resupply ports to customer ships.  Additionally, in conjunction with a T-AKE Dry Cargo/Ammunition Ship, they will accompany and stay on-station with a Carrier Strike Group (CSG) to provide fuel as required to customer ships.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project unit supports three efforts.

SURFTECH - The evaluation of advanced and alternative technologies through the Surface Ship Technology (SURFTECH) process for examining suitability for meeting total ship concepts capability needs. The objective of this project is to provide decision makers with feasible, affordable alternatives to be selected for further development. In support of surface ship advanced technology development and transformation, the surface ship community has instituted a technology evaluation process to coordinate, identify, prioritize, and integrate technology insertion and development efforts and assist RDT&amp;E community efforts to initiate appropriate technology development. The current acquisition guidelines require the development of critical technologies after Milestone A. If significant gap analysis, planning, and early development efforts are not conducted in parallel with Concept Development the Navy will not be able to provide broad, cross-platform direction to surface navy development efforts in an effective manner and will not effectively leverage limited resources to quicken the pace of both development and transition of critical mission technologies for timely acquisition.

AGOR OCEAN - Funding supports the acquisition of general purpose research vessels which will conduct science, educational and engineering operations in all oceans, and will be operated by the University Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS).

LCC Class ESA of the LCC 19 &amp; 20 will be conducted to determine life extensions.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>2474 - LX(R) (formerly LSD(X)) is expected to functionally replace LSD-41 Class ships and LSD-49 Class ships for embark, transport, control, insert, sustainment, and extract of Marine Air-Ground Task Force elements and supporting forces by helicopters, landing craft, and amphibious vehicles.  Efforts are required to identify viable alternatives, including examining a reduced cost variant of LPD-17 Class.  Efforts include all Gate and Milestone (MS) documentation, Capabilities Development Documentation (CDD), and Indicative Design (ID).  Program is on track to support FY26 retirement of LSDs.  LX(R) will move to RDTEN PE 0604454N Project 2474 starting in FY15 and out.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>Prior to FY 2015 Project 3377 was funded in the NDSF Appropriation, BA 04 PE 0408042N under Project 3117 Naval Operational Logistics Integration. This project in FY 2015 and later is a continuation of efforts and is not a new start.  NDSF BA 04 Project 3117 prior year amounts: FY 2013: $18.170M; FY 2014: $20.024M</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project 3377 - Naval Operational Logistics Integration (OPLOG)- Develops enabling technologies for future and in-service afloat operational logistics and integrated supply systems; defines integrated combat logistics force and combatant logistics requirements; and conducts cooperative initiatives with acquisition programs, program sponsors, engineering managers, the Navy science and technology community and Fleet customers. OPLOG develops integrated, cross-platform (i.e. applicable to more than one ship class/type) operational logistics and energy conservation technologies and capabilities as well as draft acquisition and operations policy ensuring future Naval systems leverage emerging logistic capabilities and technologies to provide operationally effective and energy efficient logistics delivery.
	
Though the operational logistics family of systems touches all aspects of Naval presence and power projection, operational logistics capability and system interfaces typically have been left to individual acquisition programs to develop and resolve. Technology development is necessary to mitigate technological and operational risk before ship acquisition programs accept new technologies. This project provides a foundation for the transition and systems development of science &amp; technology initiatives evolving from the Office of Naval Research (ONR) Power &amp; Energy Future Naval Capabilities (FNC), Enterprise and Platform Enablers FNC, Seabasing FNC and from other enabling Government, industry and academia concepts to the acquisition community.  Thus, this project resources continued research and development of appropriate technologies with applicability to multiple acquisition programs and defines and matures performance and interface requirements for those technologies.  This project continues to identify, develop, integrate, demonstrate and transition logistics technologies to improve the cost effectiveness of Fleet at sea logistics delivery through outreach, coordination and collaboration with industry, academia, Fleet and Enterprise representatives.                                   								
                                                                								
This project will continue to develop improved shipboard replenishment, transfer, and handling systems and components as well as asset visibility and standardized packaging technologies. This project will include development of approaches to support Service goals for reduced energy consumption by the logistics Fleet. This integrated suite of 	
developed capabilities will enable multiple ship types to leverage common technologies common across DoD (Joint) and commercial transportation networks providing a more affordable, energy efficient, mission capable force.  This capabilities and system-of-systems approach will be applied to concept development of future auxiliary force 		
architectures.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This PE includes the development of advanced surface ship hull, mechanical, and electrical (HM&amp;E) components and systems for all future ships and back-fit ships where appropriate. This PE is managed by PMS-320, the Electric Ships Office, located organizationally within PEO SHIPS, with responsibility for developing Naval Power Systems that focus on energy efficiency, providing power to mission systems, and platform integration of those components and systems.  The mission of PMS 320 is to develop and provide smaller, simpler, more affordable and more capable electric power systems for all Navy platforms and focus Navy and industry investments.

This PE is the bridge between Science and Technology (S&amp;T) and ship platform and mission systems acquisition programs by identifying prospective applications for S&amp;T research, advanced development, and performing additional product development and qualification when necessary to meet platform or mission system requirements.

In October 2009, SECNAV outlined a set of specific objectives supporting U.S. Navy energy reform including several aimed at significantly reducing Fleet fuel consumption and improving our energy security posture. PMS-320 supports the DON Energy Goals by employing an integrated approach to develop and transition more affordable technologies that satisfy increasing shipboard power demands and high operational tempo while improving energy efficiency, reducing fuel consumption, and reducing Total Ownership Cost.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports the development and transition strategy of Navy Power and Propulsion Systems including power generation, power conversion, power distribution, energy storage, power utilization and automation and control functions for fully integrated electric propulsion (such as T-AKE -1 class or DDG 1000 class), hybrid electric propulsion (such as LHD 8 and LHA(R) class),  as well as legacy mechanical propulsion ships (such as DDG 51 class).  This project supports optimized integration of mission systems, appropriate component and system controls, integration of components and systems into future and current ships, and providing power system solution alternatives to new and existing platforms. 

Project developments are aligned with the Navy's 30 year shipbuilding plan via the Naval Power Systems Technology Development Roadmap, which outlines the way ahead for future developments and provides a basis for coordinated planning and investment by the Navy and private industry.  

This project develops and transitions products that increase energy efficiency (and thereby create fewer greenhouse gas emissions and reduce dependence upon foreign petroleum sources), provide additional power to mission systems, and integrates those components and systems into ship platforms.

DON Energy Initiatives - Energy Storage Module (ESM) Increment 1, Advanced Power Generation Module (APGM), and Gas Turbine (GT) Efficiency Upgrades:  This project supports the DON Energy Initiative designed to reduce ship energy consumption and increase mission effectiveness through longer time on station.  The ESM will achieve fuel savings by de-risking single generator operations.   APGM will provide increased power to meet DDG51 Flight III  requirements for advanced sensors and future weapons with reduction in life cycle costs through increased fuel efficiency over legacy gas turbine generator sets.  GT Efficiency Upgrades will provide fuel efficiency improvements to existing gas turbine engines for both backfit and new construction ships.

Mission Power:  Designs, develops, tests and integrates shipboard power systems to incorporate advanced sensors, Directed Energy and other advanced weapons. Design and testing includes Modeling and Simulation, as well as land based testing, to reduce risk and demonstrate readiness for shipboard use.  AMDR PCM provides power conversion from ship's 4160 VAC distribution systems to 1000 VDC at 1.4MW to support ship installation of AMDR Radar.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) provides funds for detailed design, development, construction, issue resolution, certification, integration, and testing of the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS). LCS is a fast, agile, and networked surface combatant with capabilities optimized to defeat asymmetric threats, and assure naval and joint force access into contested littoral regions. It uses open-systems architecture design, modular weapons, sensor systems, and a variety of manned and unmanned vehicles to expand the battle space and project offensive power into the littoral.

LCS operates with focused-mission packages that deploy manned and unmanned vehicles to execute a variety of missions, including littoral anti-submarine warfare (ASW), surface warfare (SUW), and mine countermeasures (MCM). LCS also possesses inherent capabilities, regardless of the mission package installed, including Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (ISR), Homeland Defense, Maritime Interdiction/Interception Operations (MIO), Anti-Terrorism/Force Protection (AT/FP), air self-defense, joint littoral mobility, Special Operating Forces (SOF), and logistic support for movement of personnel and supplies. This relatively small, high-speed surface combatant complements the U.S. Navy's Surface Fleet by operating in environments where it is less desirable to employ larger, multi-mission ships. LCS can deploy independently to overseas littoral regions, remain on station for extended periods of time either with a battle group or through a forward-basing arrangement, and is capable of underway replenishment. LCS will operate with Carrier Strike Groups, Surface Action Groups, in groups of other similar ships, or independently for diplomatic and presence missions. Additionally, LCS can operate cooperatively with the U.S. Coast Guard and Allies.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The RDT&amp;E portion of the LCS Program is comprised of design and development efforts required to field the LCS Class Ships, including integration with the Mission Packages (MCM, ASW and SUW) activities both pre and post delivery. It includes the design and development effort required to support the introduction and deployment of a Flight 0+ baseline (LCS 3/4 And Follow) with incorporation of lessons learned from the design and construction of USS Freedom (LCS 1) and USS Independence (LCS 2). Additionally, it includes design, development, issue resolution, certification and testing efforts required to support the design baseline for the six year block buy in FY10-15. This baseline will include lessons learned from the LCS 1 through LCS 4.

The LCS design and development phases include platform design and development, experimentation, ship system design and integration, hull platform testing, development of Technical Data Packages (TDPs), total ship system engineering and integration, combat systems and warfare systems certification, and planning and conduct of system testing. These efforts include procurement of combat and warfare system elements and /or simulators to support production representative testing in support of design, development, and certification efforts and ordnance in support of testing.

The RDT&amp;E portion of LCS funding is also comprised of formal Developmental and Operational Assessment testing of the LCS Ships and Mission Packages. Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) will concentrate on verifying integration and interoperability of employed technologies and systems in the LCS seaframe designs and modular mission packages to achieve the mission capabilities and performance requirements as defined in the LCS program's Flight 0 and Flight 0+ Capabilities Development Documents (CDD). T&amp;E functions will include the evaluation of Critical Technical Parameters (CTP), Measures of Effectiveness (MOE), Measures of Suitability (MOS), and Key Performance Parameters (KPP) for the core seaframe and the focused missions.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>LCS is a minimally manned ship. The small crew size, combined with LCS's complex mission, does not allow adequate time for shipboard "on-the-job" training to achieve LCS operational availability. Consequently, LCS uses a Train-to-Qualify (T2Q)/Train-to-Certify(T2C) training process in an off-ship/shore-based virtual ship trainer environment, focused on tactical operations and equipment operations and maintenance training. When completed, the LCS shore-based training capability will satisfy individual, unit, team, and force training and will meet Capability Development Document (CDD) T2Q Key Performance Parameter (KPP) requirements.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The LCS program takes an evolutionary approach to acquisition that emphasizes competition as a key to achieving affordability.  Initially, two industry teams competed against each other with two distinctly different LCS designs.  The decision produced two flights with a vessel from each design: Flight 0 (LCS 1 and LCS 2); and Flight 0+ (LCS 3 and out). The Flight 0+ baseline incorporates lessons learned from the design, construction, and testing of the Flight 0 ships. The Navy conducted a limited competition amongst the existing LCS industry teams or team participants for the award of a contract for the construction of a block buy of up to ten (10) LCS Flight 0+ Class ships, with an objective of competitively awarding a single contract to a single industry team.

By Acquisition Decision Memorandum of December 23, 2010, the USD (AT&amp;L) authorized execution of an alternative acquisition strategy for the FY 2010 through FY 2015 procurement of 20 seaframes through two ten-ship block buy contracts. On December 29, 2010, the Navy awarded two contracts for block buys of up to ten ships, beginning with the award to each contractor of one FY 2010 ship and associated non-recurring engineering, the development of the Technical Data Package (TDP), core class services, and associated data. This was followed by the contractual funding of one ship to each contractor in FY 2011 and two ships each funded in FY 2012 through FY 2015.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>The LCS Program achieved Milestone A and Program Initiation in May 2004 and Milestone B in February 2011. The LCS program conducts annual Defense Acquisition Board In-Process Reviews (DAB IPRs). The first Seaframe and Mission Module integrated program DAB IPR was conducted in January 2013 and will be held in September hereafter.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Program provides focused war fighting capabilities in littoral mine countermeasures, countering small boat threats and littoral anti-submarine warfare to provide assured access to enable the US Joint Force operations in the littorals. A mission package is a combination of warfare mission modules with specialized crew, support equipment, and vehicles including manned helicopters and unmanned maritime systems. They are packaged in a modular fashion so that they can be quickly swapped out pier side. Mission module development includes architectures, interfaces and integration of mission systems. Mission systems integration also includes the procurement of the first mission packages to be used on the Flight 0 Littoral Combat Ships (LCS). The program has an inventory objective of 24 MCM mission packages, 24 SUW mission packages, and 16 ASW mission packages. Mission package procurement and delivery are aligned with the ship delivery schedule, mission area demand signal from the combatant commanders, and the retirement of legacy platforms. This means that 64 interchangeable mission packages will be available for use among the seaframe variants of the LCS class to support global warfighting and peacetime presence requirements.

An incremental development approach to delivering capability allows the continued insertion of mature capabilities throughout the life of the program without the need for modifications to the sea frames. Future mission package increments will be considered when joint warfighting objectives or changing threats create new operational capability requirements that cannot be met by current mission package designs, or when new technological opportunities allow significant progress toward delivering cost effective, enhanced capabilities. Future mission module increments can be tested, constructed, and incorporated into existing mission packages, one of the most important benefits of LCS modular design.

The LCS MCM mission package will counter deep, shallow, and tethered mines in the littoral without putting Sailors in the minefield. When the MCM mission package is embarked, LCS is capable of conducting detect-to-engage operations (hunting, sweeping, and neutralization) against very shallow and deep-water sea mine threats. The MCM mission package provides these capabilities through the use of sensors and weapons deployed from an MH-60S multi-mission helicopter and unmanned off-board vehicles.  The MCM package consists of the following systems: Coastal Battlefield Reconnaissance &amp; Analysis (COBRA), Airborne Laser Mine Detection System (ALMDS), System, Remote Multi-Mission Vehicle (RMMV), AQS-20A Mine hunting Sonar, Airborne Mine Neutralization System (AMNS), Unmanned Integrated Sweep System (UISS)(which is comprised of the Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) and the Unmanned Surface Sweep System (US3)), Surface Mine Countermeasures (SMCM) Unmanned Undersea Vehicle (UUV) with Low Frequency Broad Band (LFBB), support equipment and support containers. The individual systems are combined into five modules: Organic Airborne Mine Countermeasures (OAMCM) Module, Remote Mine Hunting Module, Unmanned Influence Sweep Module, Coastal Mine Reconnaissance Module and the Buried Mine Module. The Organic Airborne Mine Countermeasures Module provides rapid mine hunting and clearing using the embarked MH-60 helicopter and Mine Countermeasure systems. The Remote Mine Hunting Module uses a Remote Multi-Mission Vehicle (RMMV) and AQS-20A to provide sustained mine hunting and clearing from the surface. The Influence Sweep Module provides endurance bottom sweep capability, the Coastal Mine Reconnaissance Module (CMRM) will allow detection of minefield patterns and obstacles from an embarked Fire Scout VTUAV, and the Buried Mine Module will allow detection of buried mines. When complete, the MCM mission package will provide full capability against floating, tethered, bottom, and buried mines. 

The ASW mission package enables LCS to conduct detect-to-engage operations against modern submarines that pose a threat. Specific ASW capabilities include protecting forces in transit, protecting joint operating areas, and establishing ASW barriers.  

ASW modules developed to provide the warfighter capabilities that can be employed for ASW area search as well as high value unit escort missions. Module components include a torpedo countermeasures system, a Variable Depth Sonar, and a Multi-Function Towed Array. The Aviation Module offers airborne threat localization and engagement capability through a Fire Scout VTUAV and an MH-60R with MK54 torpedoes. The individual systems are combined into three modules: Torpedo Defense Countermeasure; ASW Escort/Large area Clearance; and Aviation Module.  

The SUW mission package increases firepower and offensive/defensive capabilities against large numbers of highly maneuverable, fast, small craft threats, giving LCS the ability to protect the sea lanes and move a force quickly through a choke point or other strategic waterway. With the SUW mission package embarked, LCS has enhanced detection and engagement capability against enemy small craft and similar littoral surface threats.  

The SUW mission package is comprised of several modules including the Gun Mission Module (GMM). The GMM is comprised of two high velocity 30mm cannons and is augmented with the ship's 57mm gun to counter close in to mid-range threats.   The Aviation Module uses the embarked the MH-60R helicopter with Hellfire missile and the MQ-8B Fire Scout Vertical Take-off and Landing Tactical Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (VTUAV) - for the detection, identification, and classification of surface contacts and to engage long range threats. The Maritime Security Module supports the embarkation of a Visit, Board, Search, and Seizure (VBSS) team. The Surface to Surface Missile Module (SSMM) will provide missile coverage for mid-range threats and small boats.

The LCS Mission Modules Common Equipment consists of enabling products required by all mission packages to provide common hardware interfaces, computer operating environment, communications systems, aviation interface systems and portable development &amp; integration test-sets. Common hardware interfaces include definition, installation and control of mechanical, electrical and cooling requirements common to all mission packages. The Mission Package Computing Environment (MPCE) provides common services and Operating Environment to support all Mission Package Application Software and Open Architecture Products. The Multi-Vehicle Communications System (MVCS) enables the control and data exchange of simultaneous unmanned mission vehicles and the Seaframes. Aviation interface systems include integration and management of data communications, data processing and physical hardware interfaces such as common equipment and containers used by all mission packages. Development and integration test-sets provide a mobile operating environment installed in the Mission Package Portable Control Stations (MP-PCS) to serve as a surrogate Seaframe during mission package development and integration test events at test ranges.

Per the FY14 Appriopriations Act, the LCS Mission Modules Program has been assigned its own PE of 0603596N. Prior year funding is located in PE 0603581N. FY14 funding was transferred to the greatest extent practicable.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) is a fast, agile, and networked surface combatant with capabilities optimized to defeat asymmetric threats, and assure naval and joint force access into contested littoral regions. It uses open-systems-architecture design, modular weapons, sensor systems, and a variety of manned and unmanned vehicles to expand the battle space and project offensive power into the littoral. LCS operates with focused-mission packages that deploy manned and unmanned vehicles to execute a variety of missions, including littoral anti-submarine warfare (ASW), surface warfare (SUW), and mine countermeasures (MCM). LCS also possesses inherent capabilities, regardless of mission package installed, including Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance (ISR), homeland defense, Maritime Interdiction/Interception Operations (MIO), anti-terrorism/force protection (AT/FP), air self-defense, joint littoral mobility, and Special Operating Forces (SOF) and logistic support for movement of personnel and supplies. This relatively small, high-speed surface combatant will complement the U.S. Navy's AEGIS fleet by operating in environments where it is less desirable to employ larger, multi-mission ships. It can deploy independently to overseas littoral regions, remain on station for extended periods of time either with a battle group or through a forward-basing arrangement, and is capable of underway replenishment. It will operate with Carrier Strike Groups, Surface Action Groups, in groups of other similar ships, or independently for diplomatic and presence missions.  Additionally, it can operate cooperatively with the U.S. Coast Guard and Allies. The LCS construction phase includes the construction of two LCS Flight 0 Class Ships, one each of two designs, and includes Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) for ships systems, Final System Design (FSD), Detail Design, introduction of final interface requirements for integration with mission packages from the Mission Systems and Ship Integration Team (MSSIT), and Outfitting and Post Delivery (OF/PD).

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The LCS program takes an evolutionary approach to acquisition that emphasizes competition as a key to achieving affordability. Initially, two industry teams competed against each other with two distinctly different LCS designs. The decision produced two flights with a vessel from each design: Flight 0 (LCS 1 and LCS 2); and Flight 0+ (LCS 3 and out). The Flight 0+ baseline incorporates lessons learned from the design, construction, and testing of the Flight 0 ships. The Navy conducted a limited competition amongst the existing LCS industry teams or team participants for the award of a contract for the construction of a block buy of up to ten (10) LCS Flight 0+ Class ships, with an objective of competitively awarding a single contract to a single industry team. By Acquisition Decision Memorandum of December 23, 2010, the USD (AT&amp;L) authorized execution of an alternative acquisition strategy for the FY 2010 through FY 2015 procurement of 20 seaframes through two ten-ship block buy contracts. On December 29, 2010, the Navy awarded two contracts for block buys of up to ten ships, beginning with the award to each contractor of one FY 2010 ship and associated non-recurring engineering, the development of the Technical Data Package (TDP), core class services, and associated data. This was followed by the contractual funding of one ship to each contractor in FY 2011 and two ships each funded in FY 2012 through FY 2015.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>The LCS Program achieved Milestone A and Program Initiation in May 2004 and Milestone B in February 2011. The LCS program conducts annual Defense Acquisition Board In-Process Reviews (DAB IPRs). The first Seaframe and Mission Module integrated program DAB IPR was conducted in January 2013 and will be held in September hereafter.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) created the Navy's Strike Force Interoperability (SFI) Program in 1998 in response to critical shortfalls in the introduction of integrated and interoperable system of systems to deploying Strike Forces.   Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) acts as management lead for Joint System Command (SYSCOM) system certification policy and guidance and certifies platforms for interoperability within the platform and throughout the enterprise, in accordance with Commander, US Fleet Forces Command/Commander, Pacific Fleet (COMUSFLTFORCOM/COMPACFLT) Inst. 4720.3B (OCT 2008), C5ISR Modernization Policy.  COMUSFLTFORCOM/COMPACFLT Inst. 4720.3B also requires that NAVSEA act as administrative agent for COMNAVNETWARCOM Command and Control, Communications, Computers, and Combat Systems Integration Modernization Process (C5IMP) and execution agent for Navy Command and Control, Communications, Computers, and Combat Systems Integration (C5I) Modernization Conferences (NCMC).  This program conducts Interoperability Assessments that are required to certify Aircraft Carriers, Amphibious Assault Ships, and Surface Combatants in accordance with the Naval Warfare System Certification Policy (NWSCP), NAVSEAINST 9410.2A, NAVAIR 5230.20, SPAWAR 5234.1.

The SFI Program ensures overall strike force interoperability is characterized and assessed. NAVSEA is assigned central United States Navy (USN) responsibility for interoperability, directing the development of policy and architecture for Strike Force warfare systems engineering and implementation of a common warfare systems engineering process. There are three priorities within the Strike Force Interoperability Program:  1) Support Fleet As-Is state which includes Navigation System Certification (NAVCERT), Interoperability Capabilities &amp; Limitations, and Interoperability Tactical Information Coordinator Technical Aids (TIC TECHAIDs); 2) Ship system modernization (non-HME) including warfighting capability &amp; other C5I upgrades. This includes C5IMP Baseline Management and Non-Aegis Combat System Integration Testing; and 3) Ship Warfare System Certification &amp; Force Level Assessments. This includes Warfare Systems Certification, Interoperability Certification, Force Level Interoperability Analysis, Assessments, and reports recommending force level interoperability improvements to the program offices for implementation at the systems level. 

In addition to these core efforts, this program also aims to improve the efficiency of testing processes through the Automated Test and Re-test (ATRT) program and engages in efforts designed to ensure the U.S. Navy is interoperable with Joint and Coalition forces through the Maritime Theater Missile Defense (MTMD).

Project 0164 Combat System Integration:

This project consist of five key pillars executed within the SFI program, beginning in FY13: 1) Command &amp; Control, Communications, Computer, Combat Systems, and Intelligence Modernization Process (C5IMP) and Fleet Readiness. The C5IMP validates the introduction of new systems into the Fleet and ensures system maturity prior to installation, thereby reducing risk and enhancing readiness and effectiveness of deploying ships and strike groups; 2) Warfare Systems Certification, which is essential to validating the maturity and operational performance of warfare systems prior to fleet delivery and deployment; 3) Navigation Certification (NAVCERT) and Electronic Charting and Display System - Navy (ECDIS-N) certification, which certifies ship electronic charting capability and certifies the accurate transmission of navigation data to combat and weapons systems; 4) Combat Systems Integration Testing (CSIT), formerly known as Warfare Systems Integration and Interoperability Testing (WSI2T), which is essential in the identification of critical integration and interoperability issues.  CSIT also provides Objective Quality Evidence (OQE) for warfare system certification decisions for installation and deployment; and 5) Interoperability Certification and Assessment, the independent assessment of Strike Group Warfare Systems operational performance.  Interoperability Assessments examine force level engagement threads, aircraft control, air battle-space management, and operational displays.  Assessments of deploying ships in Strike Force configurations are accomplished through the utilization of the Navy's Distributed Engineering Plant (DEP), which is the cornerstone for the Distributed Integration &amp; Interoperability Assessment Capability (DIIAC) Concept.  It is a U.S. Fleet Forces Command and Commander In Chief, U.S Pacific Fleet (COMPACFLT) requirement that all Strike Forces undergo Interoperability Assessment testing in the DEP prior to deployment.  Interoperability Certification results are used to develop fleet tactical tools (Capabilities &amp; Limitations (C&amp;L) and Tactical Information Coordinator Technical Aids (TIC TECHAIDs)), which ensure that operators understand the interoperability capabilities and limitations of their combat systems.      

Project 3312 Maritime Theater Missile Defense Forum (MTMD):

This project funds participation in the Maritime Missile Defense Projects Framework Memorandum of Understanding of 2004 (as amended in 2009).  Known as the Maritime Theater Missile Defense (MTMD) forum, it promotes interoperability with the Navies of nine participating nations (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, United Kingdom and the United States).  This project funds participation in several Project Arrangements and includes maritime contribution to the NATO Active Layered Theater Ballistic Missile Defense (ALTBMD) project, now known as NATO Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD). Engineering analysis and recommendations from MTMD activities are provided to European, Pacific and Central Combatant Commands to influence present day operations.  Specifically, the MTMD Forum is addressing challenges with "Maritime Allied Air Defense in Support of Ballistic Missile Defense Operations" that face the Combatant Commanders during present day operations.

The MTMD forum provides protection against the proliferation of short, medium and long-range Ballistic Missile (BM) and Advanced Anti-Ship Cruise Missile (ASCM) threats through the creation of an interoperable sea-based Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD)capability among coalition nations.  This includes protection across the full spectrum of these threats through the enhanced utilization of existing sea-based systems to protect against current threats while progressively improving and developing systems and system-of- systems to effectively counter evolving threats. 

MTMD supports USN participation in several MTMD related Project Arrangements and Working Groups including:
(1)  Battle Management Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (BMC4I) to define and develop architectures as well as to perform engineering to address coalition capability gaps.
(2)  Modeling &amp; Simulation (M&amp;S) to establish and maintain a maritime coalition M&amp;S testbed and to perform legacy and future systems simulation testing.
(3)  Coalition Distributed Engineering Plant (CDEP) to establish and maintain a maritime coalition Hardware-in-the-Loop Testbed and to conduct CDEP testing.
(4)  Open Architecture (OA) to develop Interface Standards and Data Models.
(5)  Test Planning and Execution (TPEX) to develop Test Plans, oversee exercise participation and conduct post event data analysis and reporting.
(6)  Operational Requirements (OR) to develop a Coalition Maritime Missile Defense Operational Concept Document and to identify operational constraints and tactical constructs surrounding coalition maritime missile defense activities.

Project 9B88 Automated Test and Retest (ATRT):

The Navy, through Automated Test and Re-Test (ATRT) is developing an automated test/analysis capability, which is applicable at phases within system development and integration which provides reproducible and quantitative evaluation of system performance with reduced levels of effort and schedule in order to support one of the Navy's priority initiatives of reduction of Total Ownership Cost (TOC). Funding will provide additional work towards ongoing testing and analysis efforts within the  Combat Systems Integration Testing (CSIT), formerly known as Warfare Systems Integration and Interoperability Testing (WSI2T), AEGIS Combat System Advanced Capability Build (ACB) 12, Antisubmarine Warfare Integrated Common Processor/Acoustic Rapid Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) Insertion, the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) Mission Module development and other major acquisition programs.  In addition, funding will support the development of standards, specifications, and guidance to facilitate NAVSEA-affiliated programs' adoption of this TOC-reducing discipline and technology.

Per Congressional direction, starting in FY14, the ATRT project moves to Program Element 0603597N under Project Unit 9B88C: "Automated Test and Re-Test - Congressional".</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>This project funds assessments in support of NAVCERT associated with modernizations and/or new capability upgrades.  A NAVCERT communicates to NAVSEA, Ship Program Managers (SPMs), Type Commanders (TYCOMs), and the Fleet that shipboard navigation systems are properly installed and in good physical condition and operating to specified accuracy and requirements. A NAVCERT certifies: (1) Ship electronic charting display capability ensuring safety at sea.  (2) Accurate transmission of navigation data to combat and weapons systems ensuring ordnance is delivered on target. (3) Aircraft inertial alignment system which is critical for returning aircraft. A successful NAVCERT is required for Warfare Systems Certification Decisions (WSCD), TOMAHAWK Weapons System (TTWCS) Certifications, Precision Approach Landing Systems (PALS) Certifications, and Electronic Charting and Display System-Navy (ECDIS-N) Certification.  

OPNAVINST 9420.2 and NAVSEAINST 9420.4 requires that a Navigation System Certification (NAVCERT) be performed for all initial installation/new construction, major overhaul/modification/repair when it is determined to impact the accuracy of navigation data, changes to the navigation baseline configuration, greater than six months ship availability, or elapsed time of more than five (5) years since previous NAVCERT to ensure safe navigation.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>This project funds engineering assessments of proposed C5I capability modernizations to determine maturity for installation and risk associated with installs of equipment outside of normal modernization windows. This project is required to support the fleet C5I Modernization Policy (per COMUSFLTFORCOM/COMPACFLT Inst. 4720.3B), to manage operational risks associated with C5ISR modernization in both afloat and ashore units ensuring deploying units receive improved, interoperable, and certified warfighting capabilities in order to meet theater operational requirements. This is done by determining the maturity, through engineering analysis, of the critical linchpins needed to achieve interoperability for each proposed C5IMP capability improvement item to be installed in a ships baseline (Baseline Change), developing installation recommendations of C5I system upgrades for the Fleet Commanders, and researching and analyzing installation or operating problems. Failure to achieve required maturity can break the warfare system package installed on a ship and impact strike group capabilities. There is close coordination with the FLTCDRs and TYCOMs as well as other members of the C5IMP community to address, coordinate, and resolve C5IMP modernization issues thereby reducing risk and enhancing readiness and effectiveness of deploying ships and strike groups. Strike Group Engineers (SGEs) analyze planned C5I configurations of ships and Strike Groups; identify and analyze capability, interoperability, and modernization issues in a Strike Group context; assess impacts against requirements; and provide recommendations for resolution.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>This project funds Interoperability assessments via the Distributed Engineering Plant, the technical assessment of interoperable systems to meet mission requirements, the updating of Strike Group Capabilities and Limitations (C&amp;L) and the updating of the Tactical Information Coordinator Technical Aids (TIC TECHAIDs).  Efforts of the project ensure NAVSEA/PEOs are delivering mature and interoperable warfare systems at the platform and strike group level, NAVSEA provides strike force interoperability certification and assessments. This program focuses on new systems and platforms under development. Interoperability Assessments of deploying ships in Strike Force configurations is accomplished through the utilization of the Navy's Distributed Engineering Plant (DEP), which provides operational configurations for all naval combat systems located at multiple Navy land-based sites located across the country and connected via networking technology. It is a U.S. Fleet Forces Command requirement that all Strike Forces undergo Interoperability Assessment testing in the DEP prior to deployment. The DEP provides the only opportunity for comprehensive interoperability testing of combat system and C5I configuration items prior to shipboard delivery for operational use in surface combatant platforms and strike group units. Further, the DEP provides the mechanism to support the surface Navy's participation in the Joint testing environments as well as the MTMD Coalition forces interoperability testing. The Distributed Integration &amp; Interoperability Assessment Capability (DIIAC) will leverage the existing DEP (facilities, skilled resources, live assets, and network connectivity) and ATRT applications to test and assess battle force interoperability. The result of DEP testing is fed into the development of fleet tactical tools: C&amp;L and TIC TECHAIDs, which ensure that operators understand the interoperability capabilities and limitations of their combat systems. C&amp;Ls are delivered for Strike Groups and their Coalition and Joint partners. TIC TECHAIDS are delivered to deploying ships prior to workups and then a final copy prior to deployment.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Title>Warfare Systems Certification</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>This project funds the conduct of Warfare Systems Certification against set criteria.  This includes providing operational risk assessments, using Objective Quality Evidence (OQE), to ensure installation readiness and deployment readiness of warfare systems and Navy surface platforms.  As directed by COMUSFLTFORCOM/COMPACFLT Inst. 4720.3B, C5ISR Modernization Policy, and in accordance with NAVSEAINST 9410.2, Naval Warfare System Certification Policy (NWSCP), NAVSEA will perform these assessments based on OQE obtained through testimony of subordinate activities and/or independent testing. NAVSEA engineering analyses are developed and staffed for criteria not met. NAVSEA accomplishes these efforts through Warfare Systems Certification Readiness Reviews (WSCRR), Warfare Systems Installation Assessment (WSIA), and Warfare Systems Certification Decisions (WSCD) to support the installation and deployment of warfare systems in Navy surface platforms. The purpose of the WSCRR is to review and approve the Warfare System Certification Plan (WSCP), monitor warfare systems against the WSCP and monitor satisfaction of established criteria to facilitate a WSIA and WSCD. The purpose of the WSIA is to provide the Fleet with an early assessment of risk and characterization of the warfare systems maturity and readiness to support sail-away and any shipboard test and training events for New Construction (NC) phase, Refueling Complex Overhaul (RCOH) or lead ships that are test platforms for major modernization effort and/or an assessment to support an authorization for installation of the warfare system(s) for in-service platforms. This allows the Fleet to make informed installation, testing/exercise, and training decisions. The purpose of the WSCD is to provide warfare systems certification including an assessment of risk and characterization of the warfare systems maturity and readiness to support deployment. A NAVSEA certification decision message is released following the WSCD. An operational risk assessment characterizing warfare systems maturity and readiness to support the subject ship's deployment is developed from OQE gathered from 20 different criteria for each decision point meeting/panel.  This pillar also ensures that aggregate deficiencies and workarounds do not render the operator ineffective by conducting an analysis of all work-arounds documented in Techniques &amp; Procedures (TTPs), Capabilities &amp; Limitations (C&amp;L), and Trouble Reports (TR).</r2:Description>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project funds participation in the Maritime Missile Defense Projects Framework Memorandum of Understanding of 2004 (as amended in 2009).  Known as the Maritime Theater Missile Defense (MTMD) forum, it promotes interoperability with the Navies of nine participating nations (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, United Kingdom and the United States).  This project funds participation in several Project Arrangements and includes maritime contribution to the NATO Active Layered Theater Ballistic Missile Defense (ALTBMD) project, now known as NATO Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD). Engineering analysis and recommendations from MTMD activities are provided to European, Pacific and Central Combatant Commands to influence present day operations.  Specifically, the MTMD Forum is addressing challenges with "Maritime Allied Air Defense in Support of Ballistic Missile Defense Operations" that face the Combatant Commanders during present day operations.

The MTMD forum provides protection against the proliferation of short, medium and long-range Ballistic Missile (BM) and Advanced Anti-Ship Cruise Missile (ASCM) threats through the creation of an interoperable sea-based Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD)capability among coalition nations.  This includes protection across the full spectrum of these threats through the enhanced utilization of existing sea-based systems to protect against current threats while progressively improving and developing systems and system-of- systems to effectively counter evolving threats. 

MTMD supports USN participation in several MTMD related Project Arrangements and Working Groups including:
(1)  Battle Management Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (BMC4I) to define and develop architectures as well as to perform engineering to address coalition capability gaps.
(2)  Modeling &amp; Simulation (M&amp;S) to establish and maintain a maritime coalition M&amp;S testbed and to perform legacy and future systems simulation testing.
(3)  Coalition Distributed Engineering Plant (CDEP) to establish and maintain a maritime coalition Hardware-in-the-Loop Testbed and to conduct CDEP testing.
(4)  Open Architecture (OA) to develop Interface Standards and Data Models.
(5)  Test Planning and Execution (TPEX) to develop Test Plans, oversee exercise participation and conduct post event data analysis and reporting.
(6)  Operational Requirements (OR) to develop a Coalition Maritime Missile Defense Operational Concept Document and to identify operational constraints and tactical constructs surrounding coalition maritime missile defense activities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>Beginning in 2015, there is an administrative change that will shift efforts funded from PE 0603561N (Advanced Submarine System Development) / Project 3220 to PE 0603595N (Ohio Replacement) / Project 3220.  This shift is consistent with Congressional intent identified in HR 933 (FY13).</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Sea Based Strategic Deterrent (SBSD) Advanced Submarine System Development project supports the OHIO Replacement (OR) program.  The funding applies to the design, systems engineering, prototyping, and vendor qualification activities needed to execute the schedule for Common Missile Compartment (CMC) design, whole ship design, and component technologies development for the next generation U.S. ballistic missile submarine. This RDT&amp;E program supports cooperation with the United Kingdom (UK) to maintain strategic deterrence, based on a single effort to develop a CMC as agreed by the UK Secretary of State for Defence and the U.S. Secretary of Defense in 2009.											
The OHIO Replacement program strategy is to maximize the re-use of existing OHIO systems and new designs from the SEAWOLF and VIRGINIA Classes (as applicable), focus on Life Cycle Total Ownership Cost (TOC) affordability, and meet the military requirements established for this SSBN to achieve mission success in a challenging environment. The requested funding levels support the Technology Development, Design, and Engineering Integration efforts to support the OHIO Replacement SSBN lead ship construction start in FY 2021.											
The following key activities support a ship acquisition program to replace the OHIO Class SSBNs: 											
1. Design and development of a missile compartment, launch system, and strategic support systems to meet U.S. strategic requirements while cooperating with the UK on modernizing its strategic deterrent in accordance with Presidential direction (December 2006).											
2. Concept and System Definition for remaining portions of the ship will be accomplished by the Design/Build/Sustain approach modeled after the VIRGINIA Class program.											
3. Development of advanced submarine platform technologies to provide capabilities needed to enhance platform operational effectiveness and minimize life cycle cost.											
OR Concept and System Definition Prototyping, and Technology Development Efforts											
The OR program supports design, systems engineering, prototyping and vendor qualification activities needed to develop CMC design, the OHIO Replacement whole ship design, and component development. The OR design timelines are based on the approach proven on VIRGINIA Class Program, adjusted for the additional complexity of a missile compartment and Strategic Weapons Systems (SWS). Planned technical studies and prototyping are necessary to reduce risks associated with updating SSBN system designs for current technical standards and demonstrating design feasibility of developmental technology to inform the establishment of detailed requirements. 											
The Navy continues investing in program funded affordability initiatives similar to those employed successfully for VIRGINIA Class, but tailored to the unique SSBN mission and operational tempo of OHIO Replacement to drive down overall program costs. Efforts will focus on reducing ship construction costs through implementing more effective design features to produce a more affordable/producible class. As part of this effort, alternative contracting strategies will be examined to include multi-class multiyear procurement (MYP) and economic order quantity (EOQ).											
Activities planned for FY 2015 are required to maintain the first article prototype of the CMC to support the UK SUCCESSOR programme.  The CMC program will mature required technologies and re-host the TRIDENT II D5 SWS (Launcher, Fire Control and Navigation) while ensuring no degradation to D5 security, safety and performance. In addition, whole ship design efforts are focused on technologies requiring significant development times and those technologies that are required to support ship design and construction schedules such as the propulsor, maneuvering/ship control and signatures.  These technologies are critical for stealth capability for a ship class that will be in service until the 2080s. Ship concept design efforts include important pre-construction activities such as finalizing ship requirements, risk characterization of developmental technology, improvement and validation of performance prediction tools and improvement of design tools. Technology development will address maturation of technologies.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project Unit 3237:  Project constructs a new Launch Test Facility to support surface launch testing and evaluation of full-scale launch technologies. The project construction is authorized by 10 U.S.C. Section 2353, funded from Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) appropriations, and will have no general utility and utilized solely to meet RDT&amp;E contractual requirements.  This project enables full-scale testing of a Trident II D5LE SWS missile launcher subsystem to collect launch event information for verification and validation of modeling and simulation software, to evaluate and demonstrate launcher subsystem performance, and to qualify the launcher subsystem hardware. This project provides a test facility to conduct qualification testing of full-scale launcher hardware.  The project will provide performance and safety data to mitigate the risk of a tactical failure in the fleet.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>FFP Contract executed through NAVFAC Multiple Award Construction Contract.

NAVFAC has the contractual warrant to buy design services. NAVFAC/Southwest executes the technical administration, planning, and scheduling for the overall design of the Launch Test Facility (LTF) based on the Facility Design Criteria executed by NAVFAC/SW.  NAVFAC/SW Construction effort is led by NAVFAC/SW and executed by NAVFAC/SW Facilities Engineering and Acquisition Division (FEAD) for construction, certification and validation of the facility.

The facility will provide the necessary foundations, buildings, cranes, infrastructure, ordnance storage, test vehicle arrestment and other services &amp; amenities needed to conduct full-scale surface launch test, integration testing, arrestment, and recovery/reuse of D5LE SWS test vehicles.  Operation of the LTF requires interactions with NAWS &amp; NAWCWD at China Lake, CA and its existing infrastructure, the environment, and operators &amp; maintenance personnel.  The facility is being developed to support the Surface Launch Test system capabilities which will provide a full scale, reusable launch test capability to support Launcher Subsystem development, evaluation and qualification, and Trident II D5LE SWS Missile Subsystem risk reduction.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) provides funds for detailed design, development, issue resolution, certification, integration and testing of the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) Mission Modules (MM). LCS is a fast, agile, and networked surface combatant with capabilities optimized to defeat asymmetric threats, and assure naval and joint force access into contested littoral regions.  It uses open-systems architecture design, modular weapons, sensor systems, and a variety of manned and unmanned vehicles to expand the battle space and project offensive power into the littoral.

The LCS MMs provide tailored warfighting capability for one at a time of the three focused mission areas:

	MCM - provides capability to conduct minehunting (detection, localization, classification, identification, and neutralization) and mine sweeping operations for mine threats. 
	SUW - provides capability to conduct enhanced-range coordinated detection, tracking, classification, identification and neutralization of groups of attacking, multiple, small boat threats, and to conduct maritime security missions.
	ASW - provides capability to detect, classify, localize, and prosecute enemy submarines; counter diesel submarine threats in the littoral shallow waters and their associated deep water approaches; and to provide an escort capability for forces transiting through submarine threat areas.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Program provides focused war fighting capabilities in littoral mine countermeasures, countering small boat threats and littoral anti-submarine warfare to provide assured access to enable the US Joint Force operations in the littorals. A mission package is a combination of warfare mission modules with specialized crew, support equipment, and vehicles including manned helicopters and unmanned maritime systems. They are packaged in a modular fashion so that they can be quickly swapped out pier side. Mission module development includes architectures, interfaces, and integration of mission systems. Mission systems integration also includes the procurement of the first mission packages to be used on the Flight 0 Littoral Combat Ships (LCS). The program has an inventory objective of 24 MCM mission packages, 24 SUW mission packages, and 16 ASW mission packages. Mission package procurement and delivery are aligned with the ship delivery schedule, mission area demand signal from the combatant commanders, and the retirement of legacy platforms. This means that 64 interchangeable mission packages will be available for use among the seaframe variants of the LCS class to support global warfighting and peacetime presence requirements.

An incremental development approach to delivering capability allows the continued insertion of mature capabilities throughout the life of the program without the need for modifications to the sea frames. Future mission package increments will be considered when joint warfighting objectives or changing threats create new operational capability requirements that cannot be met by current mission package designs, or when new technological opportunities allow significant progress toward delivering cost effective, enhanced capabilities. Future mission module increments can be tested, constructed, and incorporated into existing mission packages, one of the most important benefits of LCS modular design.

The LCS MCM mission package will counter deep, shallow, and tethered mines in the littoral without putting Sailors in the minefield. When the MCM mission package is embarked, LCS is capable of conducting detect-to-engage operations (hunting, sweeping, and neutralization) against very shallow and deep-water sea mine threats. The MCM mission package provides these capabilities through the use of sensors and weapons deployed from an MH-60S multi-mission helicopter and unmanned off-board vehicles. The MCM package consists of the following systems: Coastal Battlefield Reconnaissance &amp; Analysis (COBRA), Airborne Laser Mine Detection System (ALMDS), System, Remote Multi-Mission Vehicle (RMMV), AQS-20A Mine hunting Sonar, Airborne Mine Neutralization System (AMNS), Unmanned Integrated Sweep System (UISS)(which is comprised of the Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) and the Unmanned Surface Sweep System (US3)), Surface Mine Countermeasures (SMCM) Unmanned Undersea Vehicle (UUV) with Low Frequency Broad Band (LFBB), support equipment and support containers. The individual systems are combined into five modules: Organic Airborne Mine Countermeasures (OAMCM) Module, Remote Mine Hunting Module, Unmanned Influence Sweep Module, Coastal Mine Reconnaissance Module and the Buried Mine Module. The Organic Airborne Mine Countermeasures Module provides rapid mine hunting and clearing using the embarked MH-60 helicopter and Mine Countermeasure systems. The Remote Mine Hunting Module uses a Remote Multi-Mission Vehicle (RMMV) and AQS-20A to provide sustained mine hunting and clearing from the surface. The Influence Sweep Module provides endurance bottom sweep capability, the Coastal Mine Reconnaissance Module (CMRM) will allow detection of minefield patterns and obstacles from an embarked Fire Scout VTUAV, and the Buried Mine Module will allow detection of buried mines. When complete, the MCM mission package will provide full capability against floating, tethered, bottom, and buried mines. 

The ASW mission package enables LCS to conduct detect-to-engage operations against modern submarines that pose a threat. Specific ASW capabilities include protecting forces in transit, protecting joint operating areas, and establishing ASW barriers.  

ASW modules developed to provide the warfighter capabilities that can be employed for ASW area search as well as high value unit escort missions. Module components include a torpedo countermeasures system, a Variable Depth Sonar, and a Multi-Function Towed Array. The Aviation Module offers airborne threat localization and engagement capability through a Fire Scout VTUAV and an MH-60R with MK54 torpedoes. The individual systems are combined into three modules: Torpedo Defense Countermeasure; ASW Escort/Large area Clearance; and Aviation Module.  

The SUW mission package increases firepower and offensive/defensive capabilities against large numbers of highly maneuverable, fast, small craft threats, giving LCS the ability to protect the sea lanes and move a force quickly through a choke point or other strategic waterway. With the SUW mission package embarked, LCS has enhanced detection and engagement capability against enemy small craft and similar littoral surface threats.  

The SUW mission package is comprised of several modules including the Gun Mission Module (GMM). The GMM is comprised of two high velocity 30mm cannons and is augmented with the ship's 57mm gun to counter close in to mid-range threats. The Aviation Module uses the embarked MH-60R helicopter with Hellfire missile and the MQ-8B Fire Scout Vertical Take-off and Landing Tactical Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (VTUAV) for the detection, identification, and classification of surface contacts and to engage long range threats. The Maritime Security Module supports the embarkation of a Visit, Board, Search, and Seizure (VBSS) team. The Surface to Surface Missile Module (SSMM) will provide missile coverage for mid-range threats and small boats.

The LCS Mission Modules Common Equipment consists of enabling products required by all mission packages to provide common hardware interfaces, computer operating environment, communications systems, aviation interface systems, and portable development &amp; integration test-sets. Common hardware interfaces include definition, installation, and control of mechanical, electrical, and cooling requirements common to all mission packages. The Mission Package Computing Environment (MPCE) provides common services and Operating Environment to support all Mission Package Application Software and Open Architecture Products. The Multi-Vehicle Communications System (MVCS) enables the control and data exchange of simultaneous unmanned mission vehicles and the Seaframes. Aviation interface systems include integration and management of data communications, data processing, and physical hardware interfaces such as common equipment and containers used by all mission packages. Development and integration test-sets provide a mobile operating environment installed in the Mission Package Portable Control Stations (MP-PCS) to serve as a surrogate Seaframe during mission package development and integration test events at test ranges.

Per the FY14 Appriopriations Act, the LCS Mission Modules Program has been assigned its own PE of 0603596N. Prior year funding is located in PE 0603581N. FY14 funding was transferred to the greatest extent practicable.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Navy, through Automated Test and Re-Test (ATRT) is developing an automated test/analysis capability, which is applicable at phases within system development and integration which provides reproducible and quantitative evaluation of system performance with reduced levels of effort and schedule in order to support one of the Navy's priority initiatives of reduction of Total Ownership Cost (TOC). Funding will provide additional work towards ongoing testing and analysis efforts within the Combat Systems Integration Testing (CSIT), formerly known as Warfare Systems Integration and Interoperability Testing (WSI2T), AEGIS Combat System Advanced Capability Build (ACB) 12, Antisubmarine Warfare Integrated Common Processor/Acoustic Rapid Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) Insertion, the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) Mission Module development and other major acquisition programs.  In addition, funding will support the development of standards, specifications, and guidance to facilitate NAVSEA-affiliated programs' adoption of this TOC-reducing discipline and technology.

The ATRT project was previously funded on Program Element 0603582N under Project Unit 9B88: "Automated Test and Retest (ATRT)". Per Congressional direction, starting in FY14 and through the outyears, the ATRT project moves to Program Element 0603597N under Project Unit 9B88C: "Automated Test and Re-Test - Congressional".</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The use of these funds by Navy, through Automated Test and Re-Test (ATRT), will further develop an automated test/analysis capability, which is applicable at phases within system development, integration, and certification which provides reproducible and quantitative evaluation of system performance with reduced levels of effort and schedule in order to support one of the Navy's priority initiatives of reduction of Total Ownership Cost (TOC). Funding will provide additional work towards ongoing testing and analysis efforts within the Integrated Combat System Test Facility (ICSTF), AEGIS Combat System Advanced Capability Build (ACB) 16, Submarine Federated Tactical System and Virginia Class Submarines, the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) Mission Module/ Combat Management System development and other major acquisition programs. In addition, funding will support the development of standards, specifications, and guidance to facilitate NAVSEA-affiliated programs' adoption of this TOC-reducing discipline and technology. 

Per Congressional direction, starting in FY14 and through the outyears, the ATRT project moves to Program Element 0603597N under Project Unit 9B88C: "Automated Test and Re-Test - Congressional".</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Most Navy munitions react violently when exposed to unplanned stimuli such as fire, shock and bullet or fragment impact, thus presenting a great hazard to ships, aircraft and personnel. The Insensitive Munitions Advanced Development (IMAD) program will provide, validate, and transition technology to all new weapon developments and priority weapon systems and enable production of munitions insensitive to these stimuli with no reduction in combat performance. Insensitive Munitions (IM) is the Navy's focused effort on propellants, propulsion units, explosives, warheads, fuses and pyrotechnics to reduce the severity of cook-off and bullet/fragment impact reactions, minimizing the probability for sympathetic detonation, both in normal storage and in use, increasing ship and platform survivability and satisfying performance and readiness requirements.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Each technology area is divided into subtasks addressing specific munition/munition class IM deficiencies. Energetic materials producibility is demonstrated to assure national capability to produce and load munitions systems. The program leverages are being closely coordinated with other military departments, North Atlantic Treaty organization (NATO) and allied countries to eliminate redundant efforts and maximize efficiency. A joint service IM requirement has been developed and through the IM strategic planning process, all Program Executive Offices (PEO) are implementing IM in their priority munitions. IM are identified as a Department of Defense (DoD) critical technology requirement and considered as part of a weapon design. The IMAD program matures the technology developed by a variety of Science and Technology (S&amp;T) sources for program management integration into weapons systems to meet the IM technical deficiencies documented in the PEO IM Strategic Plans. IMAD provides the link between S&amp;T programs and the program managers (PM) by optimizing IM technologies to meet Navy requirements. IMAD offers risk mitigation for the PMs in terms of IM technical knowledge, expertise and manpower with the state of the art expertise across IM products. Each technology area is divided into subtasks addressing specific munition and munition class IM deficiencies.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The M41A4 Saber system is the primary heavy, anti-armor launch system for the TOW Missile within the Ground Combat Element of the Marine Corps.  The Anti-Armor Weapons System-Heavy (AAWS-H) program, working in concert with the U.S. Army, will develop and integrate technology improvements into the Improved Target Acquisition System (ITAS) to meet Increment II system requirements as jointly agreed. Improvements centered on integration of sight image enhancements were concluded in FY13.  Other efforts have focused on providing engineering and technical support which include the study of densified propellant, Saber battery replacement, Saber battery storage container and the test launch stand for the Saber system (far-target location accuracy improvements).  The traversing unit upgrades/improvements, battlefield networking communications capability and a laser designation capability have been postponed due to prioritization of Saber battery upgrade/replacement efforts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>During FY10-12, the development of the Shoulder-Launched-Multipurpose Assault Weapon (SMAW) II system, which is the original solution to the Follow-On-To SMAW (FOTS) requirement, experienced numerous technical and programmatic challenges.  The program rebaselined multiple times, each one adding considerable cost and schedule growth to the original baseline.  The Program Office, with concurrence from the MDA, elected to allow the SMAW II effort to expire and explore alternate methods for satisfying the FOTS requirement.  A new effort has begun and is described below.

The solution to the FOTS requirement is the SMAW Mod 2 system.  The mission of the SMAW Mod 2 is to provide short-range assault fires in support of infantry forces attacking fortified position and urban structures under all field and environmental conditions.  This includes employment under Mission Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP) IV Level Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) conditions.  The SMAW Mod 2 consists of a new SMAW launcher that will be physically and functionally compatible with all current SMAW ammunition variants.  Additionally, work is being performed to develop new propellant technologies for an enhanced rocket motor.

During FY13, the development and integration of the SMAW Mod 2 system was completed and ready for Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&amp;E).  During FY14, IOT&amp;E is planned to be performed on the launcher prior to the development and release of the Full Rate Production Request For Proposal.  Additionally, development of the Densified Propellant will begin.  In FY15, Full Rate Production of the SMAW Mod 2 launcher will begin and work will continue on the Densified Propellant.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This is a Joint Service Program. This program provides for the development of Explosive Ordnance Disposal tools and equipment for use by all military services. The responsibility is assigned to the Navy as single service manager, by Department of Defense Directive 5160.62 of 26 April 1989, for management of the Joint Service Explosive Ordnance Disposal Research and Development Program. Proliferation of sophisticated types of foreign and domestic ordnance and Improvised Explosive Devices necessitate a continuing development program to provide Explosive Ordnance Disposal personnel of all military services with the special equipment and tools required to support this mission. This program also provides life support related equipment necessary to support the performance of Navy Explosive Ordnance Disposal tasks underwater. This equipment must have inherently low acoustic and magnetic signatures in order to allow the Explosive Ordnance Disposal technician to safely approach, render-safe and dispose of sea mines and other underwater ordnance. This program also provides force protection of all military services against Radio Controlled Improvised Explosive Devices (RCIED) to prevent initiation. The Navy has been designated as DOD Executive Agent and Single Manager for Military Ground-Based Counter Radio-Controlled Improvised Explosive Electronic Warfare (CREW) Technology by DOD Directive 5101.14 of 11 June 2007, requiring RDT&amp;E to develop capabilities that meet joint requirements.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Analysis of Alternatives (AOA) studies are always conducted prior to the initiation of new sub-projects. The AOA addresses and emphasizes acquisitions strategies of the most cost-effective solution over the sub-projects' life -cycle. The acquisition strategies observe the following hierarchy of alternatives: commercial item (including
modifications), non-developmental item (including modifications), and lastly, developmental programs. Contracting for RDT&amp;E, if required is always competitive and when feasible, production options are included.


This ongoing program capitalizes on a User Operational Evaluation System (UOES) effort involving Fleet operators engaged in tactical experimentation with prototype UUVs prior to fielding baseline systems and capability improvement package increments. These UUV operators also participate in detailed requirements analyses and definition. Operational capabilities with UUV have been realized at designated operational units, with a competitive acquisition strategy. The addition of enhanced capabilities through an evolutionary acquisition approach to the UUV toolbox is programmed for delivery in accordance with approved CNO requirements and ONR TTAs. Further improvements to the toolbox to add basic mine and underwater explosive threats neutralization capabilities will be pursued.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) significantly improves Battle Force Anti-Air Warfare (AAW) capability by coordinating all Battle Force AAW sensors into a single, real-time, composite track picture to support integrated fire control. CEC distributes sensor data from each USMC Command Control Unit, USA Aerostat, US Navy Ship, and US Navy Aircraft, or cooperating unit (CU), to all other CUs in the battle force through a real-time, line of sight, high data rate sensor and engagement data distribution network. CEC is highly resistant to jamming and provides accurate gridlocking between CUs. Each CU independently employs high capacity, parallel processing and advanced algorithms to combine all distributed sensor data into a fire control quality track picture which is the same for all CUs. CEC data is presented as a superset of the best AAW sensor capabilities from each CU, all of which are integrated into a single input to each CU's combat weapons system. CEC significantly improves our Battle Force defense in depth, including both local area and ship defense capabilities against current and future AAW threats. Moreover, CEC provides critical connectivity and integration of over-land air defense systems capable of countering emerging air threats, including land attack cruise missiles, in a complex littoral environment.

Each military Service funds CEC development for their combat systems.  The CEC Program Office oversees CEC development for all services.

CEC consists of the Data Distribution System (DDS), the Cooperative Engagement Processor (CEP), and interface with Combat Systems and sensors. The DDS encodes and distributes own-ship sensor and engagement data and is a high capacity, jam resistant, directive system providing a precision gridlocking and high throughput of data. The CEP is a high capacity distributed processor that processes force levels of data in near real-time. The data is passed to the ship's combat system as high quality data for which the ship can cue its onboard sensors or use the data to engage targets without actually tracking them. 

The Navy implemented a Signal Data Processor (SDP) approach to modify the current equipment to meet reduced size, weight, cost, power and cooling objectives. This SDP approach also supports continuity for interoperability improvements and program protection, as well as supporting open architecture initiatives, and comms independence. The SDP hardware complies with Category 3 Open Architecture Computing Environment (OACE) standards.  The SDP-S is being fielded fleet-wide to all US Navy, USMC, US Army, and FMS CEC units.

A family of antennas approach will be used to satisfy CEC requirements with lower life cycle costs (procurement, installation, and maintenance) and reduced weight (on mast and below deck).  These antennas enable future capability as well as providing a solution extensible to additional platforms.  This effort for development and production of Common Array Block (CAB) antennas was competitively awarded in late FY2013.

In support of Interoperability, CEC will continue to work collaboratively with other Combat Systems programs (AWS, E-2C, E-2D, SSDS, CDLMS, C2P, and SGS/AC) to develop the software and implement design corrections and system changes. CEC will analyze the interactions of interoperability issues and impacts and provide collaboration for development of CEC and other system changes, develop the long term solutions, including the engineering process to validate small parts of developmental software ideas, and utilize M&amp;S to validate design approaches in the systems engineering realm.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Remarks>Explanations for the use of "WR, MP, and Reqn" in the Contract method &amp; type" column are as follows:
- When using "MIPR", these documents are issued to DOD activities that are outside of the Department of the Navy.
- When using "Reqn" for Wallops Island, this document is used because this is the only document we can provide to the activity to accomplish taskings for the CEC program.
- When using "WR", these documents are sent to Navy activities who obligate funding on their vehicles to accomplish tasking for CEC.  These activities are the only ones who can accomplish these tasks for the program.
- E-2D Integration/NIFC-CA "Various/TBDs" are for classified programs and several document types.</r2:Remarks>

When using "WR", these documents are sent to Navy activities who obligate funding on their vehicles to accomplish tasking for CEC. These 
activities are the only ones who can accomplish these tasks for the program.

Test support also includes the following funding for ACB integration support:
FY12 - $1.0M
FY13 - $3.0M
FY14 - $3.0M</r2:Remarks>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Submarine Rescue manned under PMS 391.  Efforts through FY15 focus on the Submarine Rescue Diving and Recompression System (SRDRS) to provide a new rapidly deployed emergency submarine rescue capability.  SRDRS provides a new capability of pressurized transportation of rescuees from a stricken submarine directly to the decompression system replacing the Deep Submergence Rescue Vehicles and Mother Submarines. SRDRS includes an air transportable rapid Assessment/Underwater Work System (AUWS), a Pressurized Rescue Module (PRM) or Rescue Capable System (RCS), and a Submarine Decompression System (SDS).  The AUWS is a manned system that provides intervention system capability.  To reduce operational risk, an initiative is in process to transition from AUWS to an unmanned Remote Operated Vehicle (ROV).  Intervention assets support clearing disabled submarine seating surfaces, delivery of emergency life support stores, and disabled submarine assessment.  The Submarine Rescue System-Rescue Capable System (SRS-RCS) completed OPEVAL in FY08 and is rescue ready.  The Submarine Rescue System-Submarine Decompression System (SRS-SDS) is scheduled for Initial Operational Capability (IOC) in FY15.  SRDRS Full Operational Capability (FOC) is scheduled for FY15.  The SRDRS will provide a global rapid response capability to support submarine rescue missions with an increase in capability at a fraction of the cost of the currently available systems.								
								
Shallow Depth Diving Equipment managed under SEA00C - This project develops systems to support submarine escape and rescue missions, and conventional diver operations.  Diver operations include ship husbandry, salvage/recovery, and submarine rescue operations to support national, as well as Navy, needs around the world.  Modern certifiable diving systems that ensure diver safety and allow maximum work efficiency will replace currently antiquated systems.  R&amp;D will be performed in the areas of contaminated water diving, diver thermal protection, and diver sound protection.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Submarine Rescue system (SRS) segment of the SRDRS is largely based on the use of Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) technology and maximum use of Non-Developmental Items (NDI).  The SRS segment is being procured using performance based specifications.  Many of the SRS contracts were awarded competitively and were based on technical capability and cost considerations (best value).  Program management of SRDRS is accomplished through the use of Program Executive Officer, Submarines (PEO SUB) leadership.  This change was enacted in February 2003 realigning the responsibility from SEA00C to PEOSUB. The Prototype system provides full operational capability and no additional procurement is planned.  The system is designed to be Government Owned/Commercially Operated/Commercially Maintained (GO/CO/CM).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Many environmental laws, regulations, and policies impose restrictions on Navy vessels, aircraft, and facilities that interfere with operations and/or increase the cost of operations. The Navy must be able to conduct its national security mission in compliance with applicable environmental requirements in the U.S. and abroad without compromising
performance, safety, or health, while simultaneously minimizing the cost of compliance. This program develops and evaluates processes, hardware, systems, and operational procedures that will allow the Navy to operate in U.S., foreign, and international waters, air, space, and land areas while complying with environmental laws, regulations,
Executive Orders, policies and international agreements. The projects for this program element support the Navy's compliance with the (a) Clean Water Act, (b) Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships, (c) International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL 73/78), (d) DoD 4715.6 R1, Regulations on Vessels Owned or Operated by the
Department of Defense, (e) OPNAVINST 5090.1C, Environmental and Natural Resources Program Manual, (f) 40 CFR Part 9 and Chapter VII (Uniform National Discharge Standards [UNDS] Phase I Standard), (g) Executive Order (EO) 13148, Greening the Government Through Leadership in Environmental Management, (h) Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act of 1990, (i) National Invasive Species Act of 1996, (j) 33 CFR 151 Subpart D-Ballast Water Management for Control of Nonindigenous Species in Waters of the United States, (k) Clean Air Act, (l) Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, (m) Executive Order (EO) 13423 Strengthening Federal Environmental, Energy, and Transportation Management of 24 January, 2007. References (a) through (m) establish Level I environmental protection requirements for Navy shipboard systems, operations, and discharges in the areas of liquid wastes, hazardous materials, solid wastes, and other significant afloat environmental concerns. Project 0401 supports RDT&amp;E efforts that enable Navy ships and submarines to comply with laws, regulations, and policies in six major areas: (1) Liquid Wastes, (2) UNDS Rulemaking, (3) Hazardous Materials and Pollution Prevention, (4) Hull Antifouling Paints, (5) Technical Authority, and (6) Ballast Water Exchange Improvements. Project 0817 supports RDT&amp;E to develop and validate technologies to enable Navy facilities to comply with environmental laws, regulations, and policies in a cost-effective manner. Project 9204 supports RDT&amp;E to develop planning and monitoring tools for minimizing Fleet contacts with and potential harassment (physiological and behavior) of marine animals including threatened and endangered species in response to Federal laws and regulations and public scrutiny.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Navy ships and submarines must routinely operate in U.S., international, and foreign waters, and visit numerous U.S. and foreign ports. No body of water is without environmental restrictions that impact the movements and operations of Navy vessels. Environmental requirements tend to be most restrictive in port and in coastal waters, where the Navy's increasing littoral presence places ships and submarines in discharge-restricted waters for longer periods of time. Growing international cooperation in addressing global environmental concerns is resulting in expanding areas of ocean considered environmentally susceptible, where special prohibitions on ship discharges and operations are imposed. Navy vessels must comply with applicable environmental legal requirements while maintaining continued access to all waters for operations, exercises, training, and port access. The large crews and limited on-board space of Navy ships and submarines severely constrain their ability to hold wastes for return to port for shore side disposal. 

The Shipboard Waste Management RDT&amp;E project evaluates and develops shipboard environmental equipment, systems, technologies, processes, and practices to comply with environmental laws, regulations, Executive Orders, international agreements, foreign-country requirements, and DoD and Navy policies. The project focuses on providing engineering criteria, design guidance, and performance specifications for selecting, procuring, installing, integrating, and operating environmental equipment and systems on Navy ships and submarines, and on defining and developing processes, procedures and logistics support requirements. Environmental equipment, systems, processes and practices must meet legal and environmental requirements and be reliable, maintainable and achievable at sea, and impose no or low manning burden. Environmental equipment and systems must meet Navy-unique shipboard requirements (performance, space, weight, shock, vibration, electromagnetic compatibility, manning, automation, etc.), incorporate integrated logistics support, minimize life-cycle cost, and include validated acquisition, design, installation, and operating documentation. Shipboard processes and practices must be feasible and must be compatible with ship and submarine operational, maintenance, manning, habitability, health, and safety requirements. It also addresses afloat environmental issues other than shipboard wastes, e.g., access to environmental data for planning Fleet operations and exercises.  

The Shipboard Environmental Protection Branch (SEA 05P5) is the designated Technical Warrant Holder for Environmental Systems &amp; Materials Engineering, with responsibility and accountability for ensuring that ships and submarines are designed and upgraded, and can be operated, in compliance with existing and anticipated environmental requirements while minimizing total ownership cost and manning. This responsibility encompasses legacy platforms and new vessel designs, as well as Fleet operations exercises, and training.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Inherent to the realization of the vision outlined in Sea Power 21 are certain environmental consequences that will, to a lesser or greater degree, be an impact on the Navy's ability to fully achieve the strategy outlined in the Navy Capability Pillars (NCP) SEA SHIELD, SEA STRIKE, SEA BASING and FORCEnet and the supporting initiatives of SEA WARRIOR, SEA TRIAL and SEA ENTERPRISE. Readiness and training are primary considerations for determining whether any fighting force is at its peak proficiency. The ability to train our forces in a realistic environment is paramount. Today's reality requires training and operating within environmental constraints (national and international laws and agreements), and searching for alternatives to comply with and alleviate those constraints. Moreover, as we develop new systems and technologies in support of Sea Power 21, the Navy must anticipate potential environmental regulations which, while not currently an issue, could in the future adversely impact our ability to protect and sustain our forces at home and abroad.

This program identifies pervasive Navy shore side environmental requirements and develops and validates information, new processes, and technologies that address requirements that pose significant impact on Naval shore activities in complying with environmental laws, regulations, orders, and policies. The goal of the program is to maximize opportunities for significant cost savings while minimizing personnel liabilities, operational costs, and regulatory oversight and preserving or enhancing the ability of Naval shore activities to accomplish their required missions and functions in support of the Navy's transformational strategy.

EEC-2 MAXIMIZE TRAINING AND TESTING RANGE REQUIREMENTS WITHIN ENVIRONMENTAL CONSTRAINTS: This capability addresses environmental impacts and restrictions at Navy land and sea ranges, including munitions testing and manufacturing, to ensure Navy ranges are available to conduct required training and testing operations for the Fleet. Investments in EEC-2 provide validated knowledge, models, and processes to mitigate environmental impacts, restrictions, and costs at Navy training and test ranges to maximize the availability and utilization of the ranges. The results support operational readiness by providing the tools and technologies necessary for sustaining and managing Navy land and sea ranges related to unexploded ordnance (UXO) and munitions, encroachment, air quality, airborne noise, water quality, and wetlands. Capabilities gained include the ability to assess and determine the risks from underwater UXO, the evaluation and prioritization of ordnance contaminated sites for evaluation in environmental programs, and the implementation of range specific best management practices by evaluating and modeling available process, procedures, and technologies.

EEC-3 PLATFORM MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR WITH MINIMAL ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT: This capability focuses on minimizing or eliminating environmental impact related to Navy and Marine Corps weapon system repair and maintenance operations. Investments in EEC-3 provide valid knowledge, models, processes, and technologies to minimize regulated emissions, discharges and hazardous material usage during the repair and maintenance of ships, submarines, and surface/sub-surface vehicles and aircraft and air vehicles. The program supports Fleet operational readiness and Navy acquisition communities by investing in information to understand emerging environmental requirements and to develop innovative processes and technologies that result in savings while reducing the fleet environmental constraints related to platform maintenance. Capabilities and benefits gained include, but are not limited to, the reduction in the usage of heavy metals used in metal finishing (chromium and cadmium), reduced hazardous air pollutant (HAP) emissions, and the development of best management practices and tools to minimize the use of hazardous materials and the generation of hazardous wastes associated with maintaining and repairing ships, submarines and aircraft and unmanned vehicles. Results of program investments will be leveraged across weapon system and platform acquisition to ensure continued reduction in lifecycle costs and long-term environmental compliance burdens to the Fleet.

EEC-4. SUPPORT SHORE READINESS WITHIN ENVIRONMENTAL CONSTRAINTS: Naval shore establishment requires the capability to operate and maintain facilities and provide waterfront and airfield services to the fleet while complying with applicable environmental regulations and minimizing environmental impacts and costs. The program invests in knowledge and innovative processes and technologies that minimize infrastructure and operational costs, regulated emissions, while minimizing discharges and hazardous material usage from ship (waterfront) and aviation operations. Capabilities and benefits gained under EEC-4 include reduced costs associated with wastewater treatment, elimination/reduction in the use of HAPs, ozone depleting substances (ODSs), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and the associated reporting requirements, reduced hazardous waste and disposal costs, and improved storm water management.

EEC-5. COST-EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS: The environmental compliance regulations require base managers to permit, monitor and report on many processes associated with weapon system and platform operations. Naval shore environmental managers require the capability to efficiently and cost effectively manage these compliance requirements. Under EEC-5, the program invests in improved data collection, methods, and models to assess environmental impacts and ecological risk assessments of Naval Operations on harbors, U.S. waterways, and surrounding communities.  Benefits include gaining standardized technical environmental management improvements/techniques related to source control, assessment, and monitoring. EEC-5 also provides validated knowledge, models, processes and technologies to improve environmental monitoring and reporting, and to reduce the cost of compliance with regulations applicable to coastal contamination and contaminated sediments.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>This project is categorized as Non-ACAT (Non Acquisition). The project delivers a broad spectrum of products that require a variety of acquisition processes to implement. Equipment products for naval stations and other mission funded activities are often procured directly through the base operating budget. Equipment products for Shipyards and other Navy Working Capital Fund (NWCF) activities costing over $250K are procured through their Capital Investment Program (CIP). For both types of activities, equipment products costing less than $250K, and process changes not requiring the purchase of new equipment such as consumable material or product substitutions, are funded through the activity's operating budgets. Occasionally there is a technology that must be implemented as a specialized facility. These are acquired through the Military Construction (MCON) Program. All these acquisition processes are pursued using a common strategy that satisfies the needs of all the critical stakeholders: 1) Fleet end user; 2) Funding sponsor for the Navy end user; 3) Other stakeholders with cognizance over the Navy process or operation being changed, 4) Cognizant environmental federal, state, and local regulators; and 5) The private or government organization that will produce the product.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Navy has been and will continue to be subject to litigation with regard to the potential injuring, killing or biologically significant disturbance of marine animals by the use of intense underwater sound. Since Fleet operation and training areas coincide with known or probable habitats, migration routes, or breeding areas of marine mammals and other protected marine species, the possibility exists that such incidents are likely to continue in the future. The increasing public interest and pressure has resulted in escalating Fleet costs. For example, Fleet and SYSCOM development activities have been interrupted; modified, or altogether cancelled and environmental regulations have, among other things, required new ship construction shock trials to obtain Federal permits and conduct extensive environmental planning that can take several years to complete. The incorporation of mitigation measures in Fleet training operations to minimize the potential adverse effects on protected marine animals can significantly reduce the realism of these operations. In addition, the testing, evaluation, and deployment of new sonar detection and monitoring systems that use active acoustics are under intense public scrutiny for their potential adverse effects on whales and other marine mammals. Navy needs scientific evidence to substantiate its claims of limited or inconsequential adverse effects to marine life from operations.

This project primarily focuses on the development of planning, monitoring, and mitigating tools to aid the Fleet in minimizing contact with and the potential harassment of protected marine animals during operations, exercises, training, and undersea surveillance and weapons testing. These new capabilities will encompass historical and newly acquired data and analytical models that together can predict marine animal habitats (where they are likely to be), and their natural and expected behavior (diving patterns, prey localization, calling activity, etc.). This project consists of three major areas that will help ensure Navy compliance with the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) and Endangered Species Act (ESA).
These areas are (1) Marine Ecology and Population Dynamics - Determine the likelihood of the presence of marine mammals or other protected species by developing habitat and ecological models. Refine marine animal survey techniques to optimize the accuracy of abundance estimates in small ocean regions of Navy interest.
(2) Criteria, Thresholds, and Mitigation - Establish criteria and thresholds from which to measure potential impact on marine mammals and other marine species from Navy training operations. Determine the effectiveness and usefulness of various mitigation measures in relation to the potential impact of Navy operations on marine mammals; and (3) Mitigation Methodologies - Determine the observation, detection and classification measures required to develop effective monitoring and mitigation procedures for Fleet and SYSCOM use. Focus on improving marine animal monitoring capabilities over current methods by developing new technologies or improving existing technologies that improve monitoring and mitigation effectiveness, reduce cost, and minimize impacts on readiness activities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides data through laboratory, component, engine, fuel system, and weapon system tests, which relate the effects of changes in the Navy fuel procurement specification properties and chemistries to the performance and reliability of Naval ship, aircraft, and fuel distribution systems. The information is required to: (a) develop, validate, and execute the test protocols necessary to approve fuels from non-petroleum feedstocks, (b) determine the extent to which unnecessarily restrictive specification features can be relaxed to reduce cost and increase availability worldwide, (c) provide guidance to fleet operators for the safe use of off-specification or commercial grade fuels when military specifications are unavailable or in short supply, (d) technically justify changes to fuel specifications to ensure fuel quality and avoid fleet operating problems while accommodating evolutionary changes in fuel supply, and (e) improve capability to provide fuel quality surveillance in the field. Continued volatility and rapid escalation of the cost of fuel have placed additional pressures on Navy budgets responsible for maintaining and sustaining the Navy tactical fleet both now and in the future. These pressures have placed an added emphasis on the potential use of lower cost commercial fuels and/or fuels derived from non-petroleum sources as a potential means of stabilizing the current and anticipated price volatility. Recent problems with petroleum-based fuel quality have demonstrated the adverse effects that fuel-related problems can have on ship and aircraft system performance, reliability, and readiness. The program addresses readiness, additional maintenance costs, and the cost of lost equipment. The potential risk of fuel-related problems over the next decade, given the unknown supply, feedstocks, and the introduction of new theaters of operation, will continue to increase. 

This project represents the Navy's only investment designed to maintain its capability to operate as a "smart" customer for fuels that cost over $4.0B per year for procurement, transport, storage, and consumption, and are essential to fleet operations. Additionally, it is the Navy's only investment in the approval of alternative fuels for tactical applications and directly supports the Navy's energy goals of increased energy security and environmental stewardship.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Legislation, Executive Orders (EO), and SECNAV Guidance direct DoN to reduce fossil fuel use and increase renewable energy use. This guidance includes the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which directs agencies to reduce energy intensity 30% by 2015, the National Defense Authorization Act of 2010, which directs DOD to source 25% of its energy from renewable sources by 2025, EO13514, which directs DOD to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2020, and SECNAV energy goals, which direct that 50% of DoN's energy come from alternative sources by 2020. Further, studies by the Defense Science Board and others have stressed the dangerous reliance of DOD on vulnerable grid power and unreliable imported oil. Currently, the Navy has limited options for producing energy from renewable sources. Private industry and other federal agencies are developing and testing new technologies. Renewable energy from the ocean such as wave, sea water air conditioning, tidal energy, outer continental shelf wind development, ammonia production and utilization, vortex induced vibration marine hydrokinetic, and compressed air storage for ocean energy, among other technologies have potential to alleviate current Navy island installation dependence on fossil fuel, at comparable costs to projected fossil energy sources. Also, advanced energy management systems have potential to increase installation energy security and enable broader use of renewable energy sources.

This Energy RDT&amp;E Project will test, evaluate, and validate components as well as demonstrate cost-effective and technical viability of energy efficiency and renewable energy, energy storage and Alternative Fuel Vehicle prototypes. All efforts will be coordinated across DOD and with other agencies as appropriate. Specifically, this project aims to pursue three areas of development, testing and evaluation: (A) Renewable Energy to support feasibility evaluation, modeling and possible prototype testing of new energy sources for use at Naval installations with potential for widespread applicability to energy security and renewable energy requirements. Other renewable sources for evaluation, modeling and possible prototype testing may include energy storage (dead-ended fuel cell, zinc air battery, etc.), facility level concentrating solar power, next generation solar heat reflective film, plasma lighting for high wattage applications, micro-inverters for photo-voltaic storage, building level micro-grid, new generation waste heat capture, and other technologies; (B) It will support demonstration and validation of advanced electric grid management systems, known as "Smart Grid" and "Micro Grid" technology, for use at Naval installations to enable improved energy security; (C) Demonstration and Validation of Alternative Energy, Energy Efficiency, Sustainable Building Features, Alternative Fuel Vehicles, and Smart Energy Management Technology: This project will support the testing, demonstration, validation, and application of innovative facility energy efficiency and alternative energy technology.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Mission Description and Budget Item Justification: 
This program provides for capabilities to: a) overcome performance limitations and reduce the life cycle cost of shore facilities and, b) provide protection against terrorist attacks for shore installations and their operations. The program focuses on technical and operational issues of specific Navy interest, where there are no unbiased test validated Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) solutions available, and where timely capabilities may not materialize without specific demonstration or validation by the Navy. Additionally, the program completes the development of technologies originating from Navy, DOD and other sources of Science and Technology programs, including the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and Department of Energy (DOE). Validated technologies are implemented in the Navy's Military Construction (MILCON) and Facilities, Sustainment Restoration and Modernization (FSRM) program, and Antiterrorism and Force Protection (ATFP) Other Procurement, Navy (OP,N) program. 

Project 0995 addresses the following Navy facilities requirements during FY 2012 through FY 2018: Advance Technology for Waterfront Facilities Repair and Enhancements, Facilities Technologies to Reduce the Cost of Facilities Sustainment, Restoration and Modernization for reducing the total ownership cost (TOC) of future and existing Facilities and addressing natural and catastrophic risk of critical Naval Waterfront Facilities. This project is consistent with recommendations of two National Academy of Sciences Reports: "The Role of Federal Agencies in Fostering New Technology and Innovation in Building" and "Federal Policies to Foster Innovation and Improvement in Constructed Facilities." 

Started in FY2006 the Force Protection Ashore Project 3155 addresses selective topics in modeling, and material technologies to reduce the vulnerability of installations; and reduce the acquisition and operating costs of protective technologies. The demonstrations and validations provide the independent, technical and operational test data for the development of competitive performance specifications to acquire the required capabilities. The ATFP project is coordinated with other DOD programs.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program provides the Navy with new engineering capabilities that are required to overcome specific performance limitations of Naval shore facilities while reducing the cost of sustaining the Naval shore infrastructure. The program focuses available RDT&amp;E resources on satisfying facility requirements where the Navy is a major stakeholder or where there are no tested validated Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) solutions available, and a timely solution will not emerge without a Navy sponsored demonstration and validation. The program completes the development and validation of facility technologies originating in Navy science and technology programs, plus a variety of other sources which includes the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Validated technologies are implemented in the Navy's Military Construction (MILCON) and Facilities Sustainment Restoration and Modernization Programs (FSRM). The Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act of 2009 laid down very specific guidelines for the correction of corrosion deficiencies in DoD shore facilities which is estimated to be $1.9B (DOD Annual Cost of Corrosion for the Department of Defense Facilities and Infrastructure July 2010). 

Project 0995 addresses two Navy facilities requirements: 1) waterfront facilities repair, upgrade and service life extension; and, 2) validation testing/performance monitoring of critical facilities (such as dry docks, piers, runways, magazines, etc.), testing and evaluation of the performance of alternative materials, and surfacing concepts, and, methods and corrosion technologies to reduce the cost of Sustainment, Restoration and Modernization (SRM). 

Waterfront facilities, repair, upgrade and service life extension: 
An urgent requirement exists for early identification of strategies and solution recommendations for seismic risk at Naval Facilities, and especially nuclear capable waterfront facilities. Recent Pacific Rim earthquakes have heightened anxiety levels on perceived huge risks to Navy waterfront facilities in the region. The sub-project will provide analysis and solution recommendations for facilities impacted by seismic risk. Waterfront facilities repair and upgrade: About 75% of the Navy's waterfront facilities are over 45 years old. They were designed for a service life of 25 years which was to satisfy the mission requirements existing at that time. The over aged reinforced concrete requires costly and repetitive repairs. Besides providing more pier side ship maintenance and thus reduce dry dock costs, these piers must be strengthened to support concentrated crane loads up to 140 tons when piers were originally not designed for concentrated loads. Piers were previously designed to service one or possibly two particular ship classes. Berthing flexibility is now limited by mooring and utility arrangements. This sub-project addresses new material design methods, and retrofit methods which extends the service life of existing waterfront facilities by an additional 15 or more years. The project also addresses updating the mission based service, environmental, and protection loading requirements imposed by changes in platforms, operations and threats. Other initiatives include: leveraging Building Information Modeling (BIM) technology to provide for enhanced facilities management processes and waterfront utilities service enhancements using models to achieve flexible berthing arrangements consistent with current and future platform mooring configurations and hotel service requirements including Facilities and Infrastructure Integrated Product Support for Acquisition Category (ACAT) Programs. 

Technologies to reduce the cost of Sustainment, Restoration and Modernization (SRM): 
Technologies to reduce the cost of SRM issues of high operational significance are addressed on a priority basis. The Navy portion of corrosion deficiencies at DoD shore facilities is estimated to be $433M (DOD Annual Cost of Corrosion for the Department of Defense Facilities and Infrastructure July 2010). This effort will demonstrate and validate the cost and reliability of advanced corrosion technologies in order to assure their acceptance and implementation in traditionally conservative public works and construction industries. These facility corrosion technologies will accelerate the validation, commercialization, and wide-spread implementation required to reduce the cost of correcting, the deficiencies in the Navy SRM backlog. The sub-projects include the continuing effort to validate, test and conduct performance monitoring of enhanced facility designs and coatings for facilities and equipment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Protection of Navy Installations against terrorist activities requires deployment of advanced technology for force protection capabilities. This antiterrorism and force protection (AT/FP) ashore project will develop, demonstrate and validate technologies for the following: access control and integrated perimeter security surveillance sensors and intelligent electronic security systems for automated intruder detection (Installation Protection); perimeter security; waterside protection against craft and swimmer intrusion; secure and efficient operations centers and emergency management centers including human and information support systems (Command and Control). Programs currently being evaluated are  standard-based enterprise physical security system integration and automation; Command, Control, and Communications (C3) capabilities for emergency operations; integrated and networked mass notification systems (MNS); Waterside intelligent video security systems; integrated over-the-water sensors and analytics for automated course of action planning; identifying and interdicting malevolent threats - watercraft, swimmers, divers, and unmanned underwater vessels (UUVs) to reduce injury and death to the war fighter and damage to high value units (HVUs). Through demonstration and validation of risk modeling and simulation models, the potential of emerging technologies will be evaluated and installation security strategies that reduce manpower and other costs will be formulated. These demonstrations and validations derive advanced technology from science and technology programs of government academia and industry. The technology evaluation and validation produces data for performance specifications used for competitive procurement. All work will be coordinated with other programs and through industry forums as appropriate.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>In FY85 Congress directed the Services and Defense Logistics Agency to permanently capture, manage and control engineering data in digital format so it would be available to support competitive spares re-procurement.  The Joint Engineering Data Management Information &amp; Control System (JEDMICS) program manages and controls 106,000,000 engineering images and has 25,000 authorized users responsible for over 70,000 user sessions per month.  Over 1.5 million digital images are retrieved each month.  New data and new users are added each month as DoD re-engineers its business processes to take advantage of digital data that is managed and controlled for corporate reuse.  The JEDMICS system is deployed at 6 interoperable sites that service 600 locations worldwide.   Data stored in JEDMICS is used for Logistics Support,  Spares re-procurement, Weapons Systems procurement, Engineering, Maintenance, Distribution, Manufacturing, Air National Guard and  Deployed Engineering Technical Services organizations.  JEDMICS facilitates work process re-design since it brings the electronic drawings to the desktop, shop floor or flight line in real time eliminating walk, wait and slack time to retrieve drawings.  Additionally, Administrative Lead Time, Repair Turn Around Time, Engineering Change Proposal processing time, demilitarization time, and all cycle times dependent on engineering data have decreased with the real time availability of digital engineering data.  JEDMICS also facilitates Electronic Commerce since it produces digital technical data packages that can be forwarded along with an electronic order.  Funds are for Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) test, evaluation and integration.  JEDMICS development efforts are required to integrate and test COTS upgrades.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>Conduct development efforts associated with JEDMICS software releases.  Conduct COTS requirements definition, evaluation, integration and testing of annual baseline releases.  Conduct technology insertion of the JEDMICS system that is required to protect the $21B digital data asset managed in JEDMICS.

These annual releases are necessary to incorporate changes that are essential to keeping the system running within the Navy's Enterprise.  They include Service mandated Information Technology changes, storage capability increases for emerging engineering data formats, changes to accommodate commercial hardware and software end-of-life product obsolescence, and defenses for newly recognized Information Assurance vulnerabilities affecting the systems various software applications.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Stable annual funding is required to facilitate implementation and execution of a robust, flexible Logistics R&amp;D program that will provide the means for Naval Supply Systems Command (NAVSUP) to effectively pursue solutions to mission-related capability/technology gaps.  The NAVSUP Logistics R&amp;D program has an established infrastructure and business process for ensuring that R&amp;D funds are applied to projects that address high priority enterprise needs established in accordance with OPNAV goals and the NAVSUP Commander's Guidance.

From a process perspective, Log R&amp;D investments are governed by a NAVSUP enterprise-wide Executive Steering Group (ESG) chaired by the NAVSUP Vice Commander, and comprised of SES and Command leadership representatives.  The ESG ratifies capability/technology gaps identified by all activities within the enterprise, and then assesses and prioritizes all proposed Log R&amp;D initiatives in accordance with their potential for filling the established gap and generating return on investment.

The established Log R&amp;D business management process has currently identified capability/technology gaps in the following general areas:  1) the need to develop technology enhancements promoting the movement of shipboard supply operations ashore, especially as it relates to optimally manned ships, 2) developing and/or modernizing shipboard equipment, material or processes for which NAVSUP exercises Technical Authority, 3) developing and modernizing Information Technology (IT) and Automatic Identification Technology (AIT) applications to enhance performance of supply chain management and logistics functions (e.g., remote diagnostics/prognostics, in-transit visibility, unique item identification) that are not supported by Navy ERP, and 4) collaborating with acquisition program managers to reduce total ownership costs.  This modest R&amp;D investment will establish a NAVSUP Logistics R&amp;D Program to explore additional technologies and significantly increase potential cost savings.

Examples of specific issues/projects that are under consideration for investment of Log R&amp;D funding as a result of the FY10 NAVSUP capability gap and initiative review include:  Automated inventory management system; Shipboard ozone laundering; Improved general purpose protective equipment (helmet protection and anti-vibration gloves); Non-plastic waste bags; Counterfeit parts detection methodology; Afloat automatic identification technology architecture.

This list of potential projects for addressing capability gaps will be updated and prioritized over time, under the oversight of the NAVSUP Log R&amp;D ESG, to ensure that funds allocated provide the highest return on investment consistent with Navy/NAVSUP goals and objectives.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>In accordance with Title 10 United States Code, Section 2350a, this Program Element (PE) provides funding for research and development (R&amp;D) programs with approved allies under international agreements.  These funds can only be applied to work efforts in the U.S., and the Under Secretary of Defense, Acquisition and Technology and Logistics (USD, AT&amp;L) must approve each international agreement.  The program provides funds for multiple projects under separately approved international agreements as well as funds that support the establishment of such agreements.  Each international agreement is summarized in a separate Summary Statement of Intent (SSOI) that also states why the project serves to increase the defense capabilities of the U.S.  The SSOI is used to obtain Project approval by the Department of the Navy and the Office of the Secretary of Defense.

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) R&amp;D cooperative programs differ from other Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) programs because issuance of funding from this PE coincides with the signature of international agreements.  These signatures occur throughout the fiscal year and often encounter unexpected delays during the staffing and negotiation phases of agreement processing prior to signature.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

These funds can only be applied to work efforts in the U.S., and the Office of Secretary of Defense must approve each international agreement.  The program provides funds for multiple projects under separately approved international agreements as well as funds that support the establishment of such agreements.  Each international agreement is summarized in a separate SSOI which also states why the project serves to increase the conventional defense capabilities of the U.S.  The SSOI is used to obtain project approval by the Department of the Navy and the Office of the Secretary of Defense.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The DoD's Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Program (JNLWP) was established by the Secretary of Defense, who assigned centralized responsibility for DoD joint research and development of non-lethal weapons and technology to the Commandant of the Marine Corps as the Executive Agent. The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (USD AT&amp;L) provides principle oversight of the JNLWP. 

The efforts in this Program Element (PE) reflect Joint Service research and development (R&amp;D) investment decisions provided by the Joint Non Lethal Weapons Integrated Product Team, a multi-service flag level corporate board that executes the JNLWP for the Executive Agent. Research conducted is based on the needs and capabilities of the Services, the Special Operations Command and the Coast Guard, as identified in the DoD's Non-Lethal Weapons Joint Capabilities Document. This coordinated joint R&amp;D development approach addresses mutual capability gaps and assures the best non-lethal technologies and equipment are provided to the operating forces while eliminating duplicative Service investment. 

This PE funds Joint Service research, development, test, and evaluation of non-lethal weapon (NLW) systems and technologies that provide a non-lethal capability to minimize fatal or permanent injuries as well as undesired damage to property and the environment. NLW are designed to incapacitate or hinder movement of individuals, crowds, or equipment. The availability of NLW allows commanders less than lethal options, across the spectrum of military operational warfare, i.e., peacekeeping, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, as well as special operations. 

The Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Directorate was established by the Executive Agent to manage the day to day research and development activities of the DoD Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Program. The JNLWP funding is distributed amongst the USA, USAF, USN, USMC, SOCOM, and USCG in support of NLW research and development efforts. Each Service is responsible for their procurement and operating support costs.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The JNLW Program strategy is to continue to pursue the fielding of NLW systems through modifying Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) products for near term capabilities and the development of new technology NLW systems in various stages of acquisition. These are balanced with efforts in modeling and simulation, experimentation, and state-of-the-art technology investment. The acquisition strategy for each weapon system is largely Lead Service dependent. The JNLWP provides RDT&amp;E funding while the Services are responsible for procurement and operations and maintenance funding. For complex development programs, such as directed energy research, JNLWP RDT&amp;E funds will support each Service's RDT&amp;E joint application efforts.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>The JPALS Increments (Inc) 1A and 1B programs are being combined into project 2329 beginning in FY15.  Increment 1B (Project 3228) will now only contain FY10 - FY14 funds with FY14 being a year of transition to the JPALS re-plan brought about by the Precision Approach Landing Capability (PALC) Roadmap Study,  DoN Resources and Requirements Review Board (R3B) decision dated 03Jul13.  JPALS Increment 1B funds in FY15 and out have been realigned IAW approved service priorities and, in part, will fund the PALC Roadmap investments in recapitalization and refurbishment of legacy landing systems.  Improvements will be made to JPALS software and avionics to provide manned and unmanned aircraft with autoland capabilities.  As a result of these PALC changes, JPALS Inc 2 (Project 3354) has been cancelled.

FY 2014 funding in both Project 3228 and 3354 will be used to finance the single increment of JPALS, with FY 2014 funding carrying over to finance FY 2015 requirements on the single increment of JPALS.  The FY15-FY19 budget JPALS budget request has been reduced to properly support the FY15-FY19 JPALS requirements.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification
The Joint Precision Approach and Landing System (JPALS) is an Acquisition Category 1D program with joint partners for requirements and acquisition including the USAF, USN/ USMC, USA, USCG, and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).  JPALS is the next generation global positioning system (GPS)-based precision approach and landing system for the DoD and is intended to provide a rapidly deployable, adverse weather, adverse terrain, day/night precision approach and landing capability for fixed and rotary wing manned and unmanned aircraft.

On 16 March 2007, the JROCM approved the JPALS Capability Development Document and designated the Navy as the Lead Service.  The Analysis of Alternatives was finalized in 3Q FY07. Milestone B was met 14Jul08.  At Milestone B, the Milestone Decision Authority separated Increment (Inc) 1 into Inc 1A and Inc 1B. On 19Jan10, the JROC approved Inc 2 for the Land-Based System and designated the Air Force as the lead component for the Land-Based System.

The DoN PALC Roadmap Study documents direction to re-scope JPALS to a single increment.  As a result, JPALS Inc 1B was reduced in scope to support the F-35 Lightning II and Unmanned Carrier Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike (UCLASS) programs as their primary landing system on aircraft carriers and amphibious assault ships.  Accordingly, improvements will be made to JPALS to provide autoland capability for manned and unmanned aircraft, therefore, investments in aircraft software and avionics will continue, although retrofit of existing aircraft was removed from program requirements.  In addition, JPALS Inc 2 was cancelled.  The remaining re-scoped JPALS program efforts provide a strong technology basis for evolution should a requirement for JPALS on existing aircraft, fixed air bases, or expeditionary air fields re-emerge in the future.


JUSTIFICATION FOR BUDGET ACTIVITY:  This program is funded under ADVANCED COMPONENT DEVELOPMENT AND PROTOTYPES because it includes all efforts necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative models or prototype systems in high fidelity and realistic operating environment.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Schedule (project 2329):
Schedule has been revised to update program milestones.  MS-C moved from first quarter FY2014 to second quarter FY2017 as a result of the Precision Approach and Landing Capability (PALC) Roadmap restructure of JPALS into a single increment and the inclusion of manned and unmanned autoland capabilities.  Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase extended to third quarter FY2016.  Additional System Development and test events were added to support the revised program phasing and additional development for manned and unmanned autoland capabilities.  LRIP contract award moved from third quarter FY2014 to third quarter FY2017.  Added schedule elements to this project to depict the de-scope of JPALS to a single project for Increment 1.

Schedule (projects 3228, 3354):
Per above PALC changes, JPALS is now combined into a single project. 

Cost (project 2329):
Per 2329 schedule discussion, all of JPALS will be consolidated into Project 2329.  FY15 budget profile has been reduced to account for the re-structured JPALS program, brought on by the PALC Roadmap Study.  Existing FY14 funding in projects 3228 and 3354 will carry over into FY15; FY 15 funding request (and $141.8M reduction from PB 14) reflects this assumed carryover. During FY 14 execution, funding will be realigned from projects 3228 and 3354 to project 2329.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Technology Development phase was conducted jointly by NAVAIRSYSCOM (PMA213), USAF Electronic Systems Command (Global Air) and multiple industry partners.  This effort provided the concept of operations, performance specifications and technology readiness levels necessary to provide the foundation from which to launch the Increment 1 System Development and Demonstration (SDD) phase development.  JPALS reached MS-B on 14 July 2008 and the SDD phase development contract was awarded on 17 July 2008.  Tasking consists of sea-based JPALS, related ship and airborne reference systems, end-to-end software algorithms, necessary ship installation hardware, test equipment, system simulation software, and other RDT&amp;E deliverable products to the joint team.  The SDD contract was decided after full and open competition.  JPALS is being developed by the Navy with an open system architecture in order to facilitate the compatible integration of many different aircraft and avionics architectures.  The Navy is lead service for the Joint Program and lead component for Increment 1.  JPALS Increment 1 provides for development, integration, installation, and test of Sea-Based JPALS to meet Initial Operation Capability (IOC) of CVN/LHA/LHD-class ships in accordance with the JPALS Capability Development Document.  Additionally, this requirement provides critical enabling technology for Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) F-35B/C and ship-based Unmanned Carrier Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike (UCLASS).

As a result of the DoN Resource and Requirements Review Board (R3B) approved PALC Roadmap, the JPALS development program has been extended to include design improvements to provide manned and unmanned aircraft with autoland capabilities.  As a result, the current Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract has been extended to conduct detailed requirements and design trade studies to identify specific system design improvements.  This will be followed by a second EMD contract to implement the required autoland system improvements and support F-35B/C and UCLASS shipboard testing prior to conducting a MS-C Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) review and awarding an LRIP contract.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>MS B conducted 17 July 2008 and approval granted for program progression to EMD phase.  System design improvements for manned and unmanned autoland capabilities will lead to a Preliminary Design Review (PDR) scheduled for second quarter FY2015 and Critical Design Review (CDR) scheduled for fourth quarter FY2015.  Milestone C scheduled for second quarter FY2017.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Joint Precision Approach and Landing System Increment 1B, beginning in FY10, provides for integration and testing into the avionics of the Carrier (CVN) &amp; LH Air Wings, including but not limited to:  C-2A, F/A-18E/F, EA-18G, MH-60R/S, and E-2D.  This is the first phase of the air integration of JPALS onto all sea based USN aircraft. Additionally, trade studies and risk reduction activities will be pursued on additional sea based USN/USMC aircraft, to include MV-22, CH-53K, UH-1Y and MQ-8. Beginning in FY 2014, all funding will be used to finance efforts under project 2329.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

DE&amp;EWS consist of multiple breakthrough technologies, including: laser weapons that provide for speed-of-light engagements at tactically significant ranges (with savings realized by minimizing the use of defensive missiles and projectiles); electromagnetic launch of projectiles that will significantly increase firing ranges, impose greater cost to adversaries of ballistic and air defense missile engagements, and enhance the land attack mission; and fielding of high power radio frequency systems for non-kinetic electronic attack and active denial technology, allowing for non-lethal determination of threat intent beyond small arms fire ranges. 

PMS 405 will manage development of DE&amp;EWS that incorporate: Weapons Grade High Energy Lasers, Free Electron Lasers (Megawatt class), Electromagnetic Railgun (EMRG) Weapon Systems, High Power Radio Frequency Weapon/Sensor Systems, and other systems/capabilities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Electromagnetic Railgun (Railgun):  Provide ship-based program/technical commonality with the Office of the Secretary of Defense Strategic Capabilities Office (OSD SCO) Land Based Rail Gun (LBRG), PE 0604250D8Z, Project P250 Advanced Innovative Technologies. PE 0603925N will use the LBRG as funding leverage to produce a common Railgun and mount that will be capable for use onboard Navy warships.

Railgun provides increased capability for the following mission sets: Naval Surface Fire Support (NSFS), Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD), Fast Attack Craft and Fast Inshore Attack Craft (FAC/FIAC), and future potential for Anti-Surface Warfare (ASuW).  Railgun will launch the Hypervelocity Projectile (HVP), currently in development as a Future Naval Capability (FNC).   

Railgun uses electromagnetic energy, vice traditional propellant (powder), to launch projectiles, providing the following advantages: increased range (i.e. 110nm vice 13nm for NSFS); increased ammunition storage capacity; improved ship safety due to decreased explosives safety hazards; decreased costs when compared to current land attack missiles.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The SSL provides a capability to support these gaps with the ability to deter, damage and/or destroy asymmetric threats including rockets, missiles, fast attack craft, and Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs).  A SSL Weapon System, at varying power levels, can deter or blind Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (ISR) systems at low powers, as well as, destroy the platforms (UAS, small boat) that carry them.  SSL leverages the Office of Naval Research (ONR) efforts on the SSL Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) and SSL Technology Maturation (TM) efforts.  SSL will transition this capability from Science and Technology (S&amp;T) development to a Program of Record (PoR).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Navy program addresses unique technologies on Ford class carriers. The program includes:
 
- (2208) - Development of ship hull, mechanical, propulsion, electrical, aviation, and combat support systems, subsystems and components to significantly improve aircraft carrier affordability, manpower requirements, survivability, and operational capabilities, and to meet the requirements of existing and pending regulations and statutes critical to the operation of existing and future aircraft carriers.

- (4004) - Development of an advanced technology aircraft launch system in support of the CVN 78 Class design and construction schedule. The Electro Magnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) will replace the current steam catapult on CVN 78 Class ships. EMALS provides better control of applied forces, both peak and transient dynamic, improved
reliability and maintainability, increased operational availability and reduced operator and maintainer workload.

This Program Element (PE) and associated projects is a continuation of efforts previously funded under PE 0603512N projects 2208 and 4004 and is not a new start.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The AN/WLD-1(V)2 Remote Minehunting System (RMS) is a mine reconnaissance system designed for the detection, classification, identification, and localization of bottom and moored mines in shallow and deep water. The RMS will provide the Navy the capability to keep ships and sailors out of the minefield. The RMS is deployed from the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) as part of the ships' Mine Countermeasure (MCM) Mission Package (MP). The RMS is a fully integrated system consisting of a semi-submersible Remote Multi-Mission Vehicle (RMMV) towing a variable depth sensor, the AN/AQS-20A. The RMMV is a high-endurance, semi-autonomous, low-observable, unmanned, diesel-powered vehicle, operated
and maintained from the LCS. Line-of-sight (LOS) and over-the-horizon (OTH) data links provide real time vehicle command and control and mine reconnaissance sensor data transmission to/from LCS.

Not a new start.  ACAT 1D Transparency requirement realigned program funding from Project Element 0603502N beginning in FY15.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The AN/WLD-1(V)2 Remote Minehunting System (RMS) is a mine reconnaissance system designed for the detection, classification, identification, and localization of bottom and moored mines in shallow and deep water. The RMS will provide the Navy the capability to keep ships and sailors out of the minefield. The RMS is deployed from the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) as part of the ships' Mine Countermeasure (MCM) Mission Package (MP). The RMS is a fully integrated system consisting of a semi-submersible Remote Multi-Mission Vehicle (RMMV) towing a variable depth sensor, the AN/AQS-20A. The RMMV is a high-endurance, semi-autonomous, low-observable, unmanned, diesel-powered vehicle, operated
and maintained from the LCS. Line-of-sight (LOS) and over-the-horizon (OTH) data links provide real time vehicle command and control and mine reconnaissance sensor data transmission to/from LCS.

The first Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) units (LRIP 1) were used during the RMMV Reliability Growth Program (RGP) version 4.2 (v4.2) configuration and will be upgraded to the v6.0 configuration to support LCS integration. In FY15 a new start RMMV Competitive (LRIP 2) contract will be awarded to procure the next LRIPs and a RMMV integration/maintenance contract.  Additionally, the development of RMMV v6.0 will support integration of the RMMV into LCS MCM MP and testing in FY15.

The Initial Operational Capability (IOC) has shifted to 2nd quarter FY16 to align with the LCS MCM MP IOC and will use LRIP 1 units.  Primary activities in FY15 include completion of v6.0 upgrades and support for the LCS MCM MP Technical Evaluation (TECHEVAL) and conduct of LCS MCM MP Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&amp;E). 

Additionally, the Program will implement hardware and software Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) for LCS Freedom Class integration and upgrade training assets in support of Ready For Training (RFT) in FY16.

Not a new start.  ACAT 1D Transparency requirement realigned program funding from Project Element 0603502N beginning in FY15.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This element includes development of electronic warfare systems for the United States Navy and United States Marine Corps assault and strike aircraft. This includes the development and testing of advanced Infrared Countermeasures systems for emerging threats and emergency contingencies for Aircraft Self-Protection Equipement (ASE) Suite Integration. Realignment of project units from Tactical Aircraft Directed Infrared Countermeasures to Joint and Allied Threat Awareness System began in FY 2011. Common Infrared Countermeasures is a new start for the Navy with efforts that began in FY 2013.

JUSTIFICATION FOR BUDGET ACTIVITY: This program is funded under ADVANCED COMPONENT DEVELOPMENT AND PROTOTYPES because it includes all efforts necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative models or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Joint and Allied Threat Awareness System (JATAS AN/AAR-59) is required to provide assault aircraft with a reliable and improved surface-to-air Infrared (IR) missile/Hostile Fire Indication (HFI) threat detection system. This capability must provide accurate and timely warning in all flight regimes, ambient light conditions, clutter backgrounds and weather conditions. It must be capable of providing countermeasure cueing to flares and/or a Directional Infrared Countermeasures (DIRCM). JATAS will enable assault Aircraft Survivability Equipment to detect and provide countermeasure cueing for current and emerging threats. Lead Department of the Navy platform for this capability is the MV-22. Project was previously funded by the Tactical Aircraft Directed Infrared Countermeasure (TADIRCM) project unit. JATAS has been designated an ACAT IC program.

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>A JATAS Capabilities Development Document (CDD) was approved in a Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memorandum dated 18 February 2011.  Per the CDD, the JATAS will be an advanced Missile Warning System (MWS) designed to replace the legacy AN/AAR-47(V) MWS and increase the survivability of Marine Corps and Navy tilt-rotor and rotary wing aircraft against infrared threats. Additionally, the system will provide aircrew with warnings of laser-enabled weapon systems such as range finders, illuminators, and beam riders. The JATAS will interface with existing AN/ALE-47 Countermeasures Dispensing System, existing AN/APR-39 Radar Warning Receiver, existing Department of the Navy Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasure system, and other compatible Directed Infrared Countermeasures systems as part of an integrated electronic countermeasures response to attacking infrared missiles. Additionally, the JATAS will provide Hostile Fire Indication (HFI) of small arms, rockets and other unguided threats and provide situational awareness in Visually Degraded Environments. Per the CDD, JATAS was developed into two increments. Increment I (Phase I) includes the missile and laser warning capabilities and cueing of countermeasure systems. Increment I (Phase II) adds HFI capability against Type I and III threats during the Engineering and Manufacturing Development phase of this program. Increment II will develop HFI capability against Type II threats. The Joint and Allied Threat Awareness System (JATAS) Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase is being executed via a Fixed Price Incentive Firm (FPIF) contract over an approximate 48-month period of performance, with one FPIF option for the low-rate initial production lot and Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) options for the first seven full-rate production lots. A JATAS Technology Development phase contract was awarded in FY2009 and the EMD contract was awarded in 4th Quarter FY2011. 8 test articles were developed for various test events in FY 2013.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>CIRCM was a New Start for the Navy. CIRCM is an ACAT-ID Army lead acquisition program for the development, integration and production of an Infra-red Countermeasure for US Army, US Navy, and US Marine Corps assault aircraft. The Army is conducting a 21 month competitive prototyping TD phase with two contractors.  During this time the contractors will develop twelve test articles for various test events with emphasis placed on reliability in FY 2016. Contractor(s) will concurrently develop preliminary designs for the CIRCM system; conduct Systems Requirements Review, System Functional Review, and Preliminary Design Review Systems Engineering Technical Review events at appropriate times in the schedule.  Upon completion of TD, the Army will conduct a competition for award of Engineering Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract(s). The EMD phase will be no more than 26 months and will include Critical Design Reviews, Test Readiness Reviews, EMD test assets and extensive testing.  Following EMD there will be a yet to be defined Low Rate Initial Production phase where full qualification testing is conducted to support a First Unit Equipped date of FY 2018.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Fuze Development Program provides for the development of alternative and innovative fuze system and fuze sensor technologies to improve the reliability, capability and production characteristics of fuze products. This program also provides for emerging technology insertion to improve the performance and maintainability characteristics of current and future fuze and fuze sensor technologies. 

The Hard Target Void Sensing Fuze (HTVSF) is an FY08 Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (JCTD) sponsored by United States Strategic Command in coordination with the United States Air Force and United States Navy. The JCTD was a 27 month risk reduction program that was awarded to two Contractors in 3rd QTR FY08 to perform design, test, and manufacturing activities leading to a down-select to a single Contractor for Engineering Manufacturing Development (EMD) and production. The JCTD was completed in 3rd QTR FY10 and the EMD contract was awarded to a single Contractor in 2nd QTR FY11. HTVSF is designed to prosecute harder, deeper, and more complex targets that exceeded design parameters of existing conventional kinetic strike capabilities. HTVSF will be used only with BLU-109 Joint Direct Attack Munitions. 


Note: First test article quantity for HTVSF includes FY 12-Quantity 26 , FY13-Quantity 3, FY14-Quantity 3</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) contains four projects: Maritime Concept Generation and Development (CGCD), Fleet Experimentation , Allied/Coalition Interoperability and Information Dominance (ACIID), and Space and Electronic Warfare (SEW) Engineering. 

The CGCD project (2356) focuses on the generation, development and validation of warfighting concepts, Concept of Operations (CONOPS) and doctrine in order to eliminate war fighting gaps. The CGCD project also includes, for FY14 and FY15, funding for the CNO's Rapid Innovation Cell (CRIC), a small group of disruptive thinkers managed by the Navy Warfare Development Command (NWDC) to identify and quickly test in an operational environment, innovative ideas and technologies that are outside the traditional development and acquisition processes.  NWDC also manages the Fleet Experimentation program (formerly Sea Trial) under the guidance of Commander USFF and COMPACFLT.  

The FLEX project (3319) (formerly Sea Trial) develops new or improved warfighter capabilities through the experimentation of high payoff initiatives, technologies and concepts, Fleet Concepts of Operations (CONOPS), doctrine, and new tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP). The objective of FLEX is to produce recommended changes in doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership development, personnel, facilities, and policy (DOTMLPF-P) actions, with an emphasis on non-materiel solutions.  Focusing on war fighting capability improvement through experimentation aimed at delivering potential solutions in support of current Operations Plans (OPLANs), FLEX spans both operational and tactical levels of warfare and reaches across the full range of military operations to enhance war fighting capabilities or fill current or future capability gaps.

The ACIID and SEW Engineering projects (0798 and 2144 respectively) are systems engineering non-acquisition programs to develop, test, implement technical authority, and validate naval Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) architectures to support naval missions in the Joint and Coalition Theater. The mission of these projects are carried out by multiple tasks that are used to ensure naval C4ISR Command and Control Warfare (C2W) components of SEW are effectively integrated into service-oriented architecture delivering net-centric warfare capability. Additionally, these projects ensure that (1) the composite operational capabilities of SEW systems (not the individual component systems) conform to the naval C4ISR architecture and enhance war fighting capability as related to the objectives of National Defense Strategy, evolving joint visions and direction, such as net centric capability, and are guided by warfighter requirements; (2) that SEW systems and systems integration efforts involve leading-edge technology transfer of information processing technologies primarily through integration of government and commercial off-the-shelf (GOTS/COTS) products to enhance the Navy's operational capability, interoperability, warfighter effectiveness, flexible reconfiguration, as well as reduce costs; and (3) that SEW systems integration efforts promote the delivery of Information Dominance and the Navy's contribution to the Global Information Grid (GIG).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Allied/Coalition Interoperability and Information Dominance (ACIID) program advances Information Warfare (IW) (to include Command, Control, Communications, Computers; Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR); Electronic Warfare (EW); and Cyber Warfare), interoperability with Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom, United States (AUSCANNZUKUS), North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and other Allied and Coalition partners. The program determines maritime operational gaps with our allies, identifies Doctrine, Organization, Training, Material, Leadership, Personnel and Facilities (DOTMLPF) solutions with the potential to fill those gaps, and assesses these solutions and associated concepts of operation in laboratory and at-sea environments. The ACIID program includes integration and testing in support of joint and Allied war fighting capabilities, including interoperability testing of IW equipment. Allied and joint interoperability is critical for future maritime operations, especially as the United States Navy expands Internet Protocol (IP) networking throughout the fleet via Consolidated Afloat Networks and Enterprise Services (CANES), Next Generation Networks (NGEN), Multi-National Information Sharing (MNIS) and with the Global Information Grid (GiG). Currently, IP connectivity with AUSCANNZUKUS and other Allied/Coalition forces is limited, requiring extensive backhaul through ashore infrastructure. Higher bandwidth solutions suitable for use over tactical networks require development and assessment for emerging coalition and joint interoperability requirements, such as Anti-Access Area Denial (A2AD), Network Operations Without Shore (NOWS) and Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA). Increases in data throughput are required for the effective exchange of rich Information Dominance (ID) data sets and services via Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) within the limitations of High Frequency (HF), Ultra-High Frequency (UHF) and other portions of the radio frequency spectrum, coupled with appropriate Information Assurance and Computer Network Defense (IA/CND) mechanisms. Development and assessment of potential solutions will integrate improved IP capabilities with the Advanced Digital Network Systems (ADNS) and existing international standards (e.g. Allied Communications Publication 200, NATO Standardization Agreements 5066 and 4691). The continued development and refinement of advanced tactical networking technologies and protocols, as well as automatic link establishment (ALE) standards, will provide for a significant improvement in data sharing within, and between, coalition maritime elements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>OPNAVINST 3050.23 defines the policy to fuse validated and approved Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) architectures and interoperability requirements with joint requirements, milestones and program decisions. C4ISR integrated architectures are the underpinnings for all C4ISR mission areas and capabilities and, as such, requirements and acquisition processes have been reengineered to use these Integrated Architectures for decisional purposes and strategic planning.
Furthermore, Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) has defined key programs/efforts Global Information Grid Baseline Extension, Joint Tactical Radio System, Network Centric Enterprise Services, Information Assurance and standards that will drive and change the Navy's C4ISR integrated architectures and associated business processes for requirements, budgets and acquisition. To that end, the Space and Electronic Warfare provides three main functions: 1) Perform System of Systems and platform technical evaluations to establish the alignment with the N2/N6 Information Dominance vision for the Navy on the whole and identify performance and operational risks associated with the integration of multiple systems to provide a robust, mission based capability. 2) Develop C4ISR/Information Technology (IT)/Information Dominance (ID) integrated architecture products and 3) Support C4ISR/IT/ID systems engineering processes and standards. The integrated architecture products are used to support the Navy's budget process by providing the critical core architecture and enabling capabilities to the war fighter. The systems engineering processes and standards provide the construct for distributed Command and Control (C2) interoperability requirements analyses to identify capability shortfalls/gaps and for systems engineering to compare/test alternatives in a joint end-to end environment while identifying associated Navy-wide C4ISR/IT/ID implications. Processes include developing and applying criteria for use in Systems Engineering Technical Reviews and providing technical input to governance bodies. This includes Human Systems Integration (HSI) to provide a mission-centered orientation to ensure effective operational employment of fielded capability. As joint concepts and OSD driving efforts/programs are matured/defined the Navy's C4ISR integrated architectures are refined and the supporting C4ISR systems engineer processes and standards work to engineer and enact C4ISR implementations Navy-wide across all C4ISR mission areas.

                            <r2:ProjectNote>Beginning in FY 2013 this project replaced Project 2357 (Maritime Battle Center), which more accurately reflectes the current mission of Navy Warfare Development Command (NWDC) experimentation.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Funds the development of new or improved war fighting capabilities through the Concept Generation and Concept Development (CG/CD) program and the related experimentation. The priorities for the CG/CD program are to explore near/far-term technological and non-technological solutions to war fighting gaps across all naval warfare areas. The CG/CD experimentation efforts include planning, systems engineering and integration, execution, data collection, analysis, and assessment requirements for a wide-range of experiment venues, such as workshops, seminars, wargames, limited objective experiments, limited technical experiments, and live force events. Where appropriate, CG/CD experimentation will be conducted in a joint or coalition environment.

Also supports the fleet's experimentation program (Fleet Experimentation - FLEX) by providing planning, systems engineering and integration, execution, data collection, and analysis support to the Mission/Warfare Area Office of Primary Responsibility where appropriate and as available. This support conducts experimentation in support of the Comander's Guidance for Fleet Experimentation promulgated by Commander, U.S. Fleet Forces.  This program historically does not meet established execution benchmarks. It differs from other Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) programs because it relies upon fleet participation and thus is scheduled around fleet or staff availability. Because that availability frequently occurs during the spring and summer operational schedules, the overall RDT&amp;E obligation/expenditure rates do not align with OSD practice. As a result, this project's obligation rates do not begin to approach benchmark until the program nears the fiscal year's end while its expenditure rates generally do not approach benchmark until midway through the second year of its appropriation.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>The increase in funding from FY 2013 to FY 2014 reflects a new CNO directed effort to establish a CNO Rapid Innovation Cell (CRIC), managed by NWDC and supported by the Office of Naval Research.  The CRIC is intended to identify new, innovative ideas and technologies outside of the mainstream Navy development and acquisition process, and get them to the Fleet for rapid testing and evaluation.

The decrease in funding from FY2014 to FY2015 is the result of the Department of Navy re-prioritization due to budget constraints.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Fleet Experimentation (FLEX) (formerly Sea Trial) program develops new or improved warfighter capabilities through the experimentation of high payoff initiatives, technologies and concepts, Fleet Concepts of Operations (CONOPS), doctrine, and new tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP). The objective of FLEX is to produce recommended changes in doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership development, personnel, facilities, and policy (DOTMLPF-P) actions, with an emphasis on non-materiel solutions.  Focusing on war fighting capability improvement through experimentation aimed at delivering potential solutions in support of current Operations Plans (OPLANs), FLEX spans both operational and tactical levels of warfare and reaches across the full range of military operations to enhance war fighting capabilities or fill current or future capability gaps. FLEX is dedicated to providing solutions to these near term (within the Fiscal Year Defense Plan) prioritized war fighting gaps as defined by the Commander, U.S. Fleet Forces (CUSFF)/Commander, Pacific Fleet (CPF) Fleet Experimentation annual guidance. With recommendations from Commander, Navy Warfare Development Command (NWDC), experimentation campaigns are approved by CUSFF/CPF each year thus establishing the annual experimentation execution plan.

Fleet experimentation runs the gamut from campaigns workshops and seminars to limited objective/technical experiments, to advanced war fighting experiments. The campaigns involve all facets of experimentation including design, planning, systems engineering and integration, execution, data collection, analysis, assessment, and the delivery of tangible products for the fleet. While Navy-centric, FLEX efforts include joint and coalition partners when appropriate.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

In May of 2011, PE 0604786N PU 3337 was established as the principal budget line for the OASuW program and assigned as BA 04: Advanced Component Development and Prototypes.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>OASuW will be an offensive weapon system that can be air and/or surface launched in the maritime battle space environment. OASuW will be a vital component of the Joint Force Anti-Surface Warfare capability and incorporate new or emergent technologies to support an increased offensive strike capability.  

OASuW (Increment I)
The Department will transition the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) / Office of Naval Research (ONR) Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM) demonstration design into a fielded weapon system to provide an early air-launched operational Offensive Anti-Surface Warfare capability using an accelerated acquisition approach. 

OASuW (Increment II)

Funding supports Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) updates to assess fully capable OASuW/Increment II material solution(s) geared to the advanced 2024 threat. Surface and air-launched material solutions will be assessed. Study results to inform development efforts in FY16 and beyond.

This program is funded under ADVANCED COMPONENT DEVELOPMENT AND PROTOTYPES because it includes all efforts necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative models or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The effort is currently executing technology maturation of the demonstrated LRASM design in order to support weapon system fielding and integration. Upon completion of these efforts, the Milestone Decision Authority will determine the program's entry phase of the acquisition cycle and baseline parameters.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>The FY 2011 NDAA directed the Services to separate the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) program into distinct PEs to provide Congress with increased transparency and allow for more effective oversight. Transition of funding from PE 0603635M to the new JLTV PE 0605812M was effective beginning in FY 2013.  

Hardware requirements for EMD include vehicles, trailers, ballistic hulls, and kits (including armor). The U.S. Marine Corps share of the prototypes were awarded in FY 2012 and were fabricated and delivered in FY 2013.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Funding supports the development and testing of the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) Family of Vehicles (FoV).  JLTV is a joint program between the U.S. Army and the U.S. Marine Corps, of which the U.S. Army has the lead.  The goal of JLTV is a FoV capable of performing multiple mission roles that will be designed to provide protected, sustained, networked mobility for personnel and payloads across the full Range of Military Operations.  JLTV objectives include increased protection and performance over the current legacy HMWMV fleet, minimizing ownership costs by maximizing commonality, fuel efficiency, and reliability.  The commonality of components, maintenance procedures, training, etc., among vehicles is expected to be inherent in FoV solutions across mission variants to minimize total ownership cost.  Unique service requirements have been minimized.  

Major FY 2015 budget activities include the completion of three Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contracts, ballistic testing, completion of limited user testing (LUT), and analysis of live fire and operational test reports in preparation for Milestone C. FY 2015 also includes efforts associated with the contract award for live fire test assets, source selection evaluation activities, completion of Milestone C documentation in preparation for the Defense Acquisition Board, and program management support.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>The FY 2011 NDAA directed the Services to separate the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) program into distinct PEs to provide Congress with increased transparency and allow for more effective oversight. Transition of funding from PE 0603635M to the new JLTV PE 0605812M was effective beginning in FY 2013.  

Hardware requirements for EMD include vehicles, trailers, ballistic hulls, and kits (including armor). The U.S. Marine Corps share of the prototypes were awarded in FY 2012 and were fabricated and delivered in FY 2013.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Funding supports the development and testing of the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) Family of Vehicles (FoV).  JLTV is a joint program between the U.S. Army and the U.S. Marine Corps, of which the U.S. Army has the lead.  The goal of JLTV is a FoV capable of performing multiple mission roles that will be designed to provide protected, sustained, networked mobility for personnel and payloads across the full Range of Military Operations.  JLTV objectives include increased protection and performance over the current legacy HMWMV fleet, minimizing ownership costs by maximizing commonality, fuel efficiency, and reliability.  The commonality of components, maintenance procedures, training, etc., among vehicles is expected to be inherent in FoV solutions across mission variants to minimize total ownership cost.  Unique service requirements have been minimized.  

Major FY 2015 budget activities include the completion of three Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contracts, ballistic testing, completion of limited user testing (LUT), and analysis of live fire and operational test reports in preparation for Milestone C. FY 2015 also includes efforts associated with the contract award for live fire test assets, source selection evaluation activities, completion of Milestone C documentation in preparation for the Defense Acquisition Board, and program management support.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>Joint Program LRIP award planned for 4Q FY 2015.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Joint Light Tactical Vehicles (JLTV) is a Joint Services Program with the U.S. Army and Marine Corps as the two main components.  The U.S. Army is the JLTV service lead. In addition, the Navy anticipates procuring JLTV vehicles upon successful Full Rate Production (FRP) decision.

The program will use an evolutionary approach to deliver capabilities in increments based on program priorities.  All technologies entering the current Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase were Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 or higher to achieve Capabilities Development Document (CDD) requirements.

The program revised the acquisition strategy in the first quarter of FY 2012, addressing better buying power initiatives, and reduced the program schedule by fifteen (15) months to enable a 33-month Non-Development Item approach for EMD, with Milestone B approved on 9 August 2012.  The program anticipates Milestone C decision in July 2015.

Through a full and open competition, the program awarded three fixed price contracts for EMD phase on 22 August 2012 to AM General, Lockheed Martin, and Oshkosh Corporations.
   
Increment I will produce two Mission Role Variant (MRV) configurations (Combat Tactical Vehicle (CTV) and Combat Support Vehicle (CSV)) with mission packages (General Purpose, Heavy Guns Carrier, Close Combat Weapons Carrier, and Utility/Shelter Carrier).  EMD vendors fabricated a total of 66 vehicles (22 test assets per vendor) representing mission packages for both MRVs, which the Government will fully test during EMD. 

Vehicles were delivered in the fourth quarter of FY 2013 to begin the fourteen (14) month government performance and reliability testing, which will focus on demonstrating Key Performance Parameters/Key System Attributes (KPP/KSA) and safety requirements.  Test strategy represents a mix of vendor risk reduction testing and formal government testing. 
 
Market research has not identified a qualified non-EMD vendor.  Unless subsequent market research identifies a qualified non-EMD vendor capable of delivering the required capabilities, there will be a down-select from among the EMD contractors for award of the Production and Deployment (PD) phase contract.  The down-select will result in awarding a single fixed-price contract in FY 2015 with R&amp;D funded test vehicles, consisting of three years of procurement funded Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP) with an option of five years of FRP starting in FY 2018.  The PD phase contract will also include interim contractor logistics support (ICLS) and one or more options for the procurement of the JLTV Technical Data Package (TDP).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The mission of Airborne Acoustic Intelligence (AAI) (CNO Project K-0416) is to provide advanced antisubmarine warfare capabilities through rapid development of new technology and prototype mechanisms for the collection of antisubmarine warfare (ASW) related intelligence. This includes full spectrum intelligence collections and cataloging of current targets of interest. The program develops and swiftly deploys disruptive innovation to counter emerging threats in order to maintain the United States' current undersea warfare superiority. AAI employs the capability to quickly reconstruct and analyze passive and active measurements of submarine vulnerabilities providing actionable intelligence to fleet commanders. The AAI data collection program provides full spectrum intelligence data essential for the design and development of advanced sensors, weapon systems, environmental models, and tactical decision aids. AAI collection systems are installed and employed on uniquely configured aircraft, specially configured ground support facilities, ships, and other assets as required for the collection, processing, exfiltration, and dissemination of undersea intelligence. AAI includes recording systems, advanced detection and tracking systems, specially designed sensors, advanced processing systems and techniques, and specially derived tactics.

This is a Military Intelligence Program (MIP).

JUSTIFICATION FOR BUDGET ACTIVITY: This program is funded under ADVANCED COMPONENT DEVELOPMENT AND PROTOTYPES because it includes all efforts necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative models or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The mission of Airborne Acoustic Intelligence (AAI) (CNO Project K-0416) is to provide advanced antisubmarine warfare capabilities through rapid development of new technology and prototype mechanisms for the collection of antisubmarine warfare (ASW) related intelligence. This includes full spectrum intelligence collections and cataloging of current targets of interest. The program develops and swiftly deploys disruptive innovation to counter emerging threats in order to maintain the United States' current undersea warfare superiority. AAI employs the capability to quickly reconstruct and analyze passive and active measurements of submarine vulnerabilities providing actionable intelligence to fleet commanders. The AAI data collection program provides full spectrum intelligence data essential for the design and development of advanced sensors, weapon systems, environmental models, and tactical decision aids. AAI collection systems are installed and employed on uniquely configured aircraft, specially configured ground support facilities, ships, and other assets as required for the collection, processing, exfiltration, and dissemination of undersea intelligence. AAI includes recording systems, advanced detection and tracking systems, specially designed sensors, advanced processing systems and techniques, and specially derived tactics.

This is a Military Intelligence Program (MIP).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>
