                <r2:ProgramElementNote>This PE incorporates Minerva Research Initiative activities – Minerva chairs at Service Institutions and a solicitation for academic university-led research – and activities to implement the basic science office strategic plan for Department of Defense (DoD).</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Basic Research provides the DoD with a deep and broad awareness of current directions and breakthroughs in science and engineering through the scientific performers in areas of research that are relevant to U.S. military capabilities including: physics and the physical sciences, materials science, chemistry and chemical engineering, electrical engineering, mathematics, computer science, mechanical and aerodynamic engineering, ocean sciences, biological sciences, and the social sciences.  Basic Research sustains scientific and engineering communities in areas that form critical technical underpinning of DoD capabilities.  Basic Research through exploration and discovery provides unique means for disruptive non-incremental advances that can improve or radically change military strategy and operations.   

The Minerva Research Initiative is a university-based social science basic research program initiated in FY 2008 and managed within the Office of the Secretary of Defense.  Minerva seeks to build deeper understanding of the social, cultural, and political forces that shape regions of the world of strategic importance to the U.S.  This will support more effective strategic decisions, operational policies and force deployments.

The Basic Research Strategic Support program funds initiatives to implement the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering strategic plan for defense basic research.  This plan defines specific and quantifiable actions to help create conditions for defense basic research investments capable of creating high-payoff, transformative scientific breakthroughs for DoD.  These initiatives support the five aims of providing scientific leadership, attracting the Nation’s best scientists and engineers, ensuring the coherence and balance of the basic research portfolio, fostering connections between DoD performers and DoD, and improving the efficiency of the defense research business environment.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The purpose of the National Defense Education Program (NDEP) is to inspire, develop, and attract the current and future generations of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) talent.  This program ensures that the Department of Defense (DoD) delivers innovative solutions to meet DoD and national security challenges.  

NDEP addresses the DoD’s need for STEM talent and develops the current and future workforce to strengthen the Department’s scientific and technological capabilities.  NDEP’s focus is to develop a continuum of high quality, experiential STEM engagements for DoD from K-12 students through world-class researchers. 

NDEP consists of three components: a) Science, Mathematics and Research for Transformation (SMART); b) the National Security Science and Engineering Faculty Fellowship (NSSEFF); and c) K-12.

SMART awards highly competitive scholarships to undergraduate and graduate students in 19 STEM disciplines and moves them directly into DoD's workforce following graduation.  Since its inception as a pilot program in 2005, SMART has supported ~1150 students from bachelor to doctoral levels and ~380 have transitioned into the workforce.  SMART ensures that DoD has a steady infusion of newly educated and high caliber U.S. technical talent ready to fulfill its mission. 
 
NSSEFF supports 29 world-class researchers (NSSEFF Fellows) in areas of critical importance to DoD and ensures the proliferation of future and exceptional talent.  Approximately 100 undergraduate students, ~200 graduate students and ~100 post-doctoral scholars at academic institutions work with the NSSEFF Fellows.  Three cohorts of NSSEFF Fellows, with the first selected in 2008, have provided critical connections between academia and the DoD science and engineering enterprise.  Fellows’ work spans all seven DoD Science and Technology (S&amp;T) priorities and the six high interest basic science areas, often in cutting-edge areas at the intersection of these areas.

NDEP K-12 leverages the DoD’s STEM expertise as one of its most valuable assets, creating engagement opportunities for schools, students, teachers, and public sector and industry partners with DoD subject matter experts (SMEs) especially in communities adjacent to DoD laboratories and bases.  Since 2007, NDEP K-12 has increased the number of DoD facilities that directly engage their local education communities to: 1) build student interest in STEM fields and disciplines and in careers specific to the Department, 2) develop science, engineering and mathematics skills important to the DoD, and 3) fulfill DoD’s future demand for highly skilled STEM professionals.  Through after-school learning opportunities, DoD STEM professionals teach key audiences about DoD’s current and future real-world S&amp;T applications.  DoD STEM professionals also serve as role models, mentors, content experts and competition judges.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The purpose of the National Defense Education Program (NDEP) is to inspire, develop, and attract the current and future generations of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) talent.  This program ensures that the Department of Defense (DoD) delivers innovative solutions to meet DoD and national security challenges.  

NDEP addresses the DoD’s need for STEM talent and develops the current and future workforce to strengthen the Department’s scientific and technological capabilities.  NDEP’s focus is to develop a continuum of high quality, experiential STEM engagements for DoD from K-12 students through world-class researchers. 

NDEP consists of three components: a) Science, Mathematics and Research for Transformation (SMART); b) the National Security Science and Engineering Faculty Fellowship (NSSEFF); and c) K-12.

SMART awards highly competitive scholarships to undergraduate and graduate students in 19 STEM disciplines and moves them directly into DoD's workforce following graduation.  Since its inception as a pilot program in 2005, SMART has supported ~1150 students from bachelor to doctoral levels and ~380 have transitioned into the workforce.  SMART ensures that DoD has a steady infusion of newly educated and high caliber U.S. technical talent ready to fulfill its mission.  

NSSEFF supports 29 world-class researchers (NSSEFF Fellows) in areas of critical importance to DoD and ensures the proliferation of future and exceptional talent.  Approximately 100 undergraduate students, ~200 graduate students and ~100 post-doctoral scholars at academic institutions work with the NSSEFF Fellows.  Three cohorts of NSSEFF Fellows, with the first selected in 2008, have provided critical connections between academia and the DoD science and engineering enterprise.  Fellows’ work spans all seven DoD Science and Technology (S&amp;T) priorities and the six high interest basic science areas, often in cutting-edge areas at the intersection of these areas.

                                    <r2:Description>SMART is a scholarship-for-service program that provides support to high-performing U.S. graduate and undergraduate students in 19 academic Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines identified as areas of future workforce need by the Department of Defense (DoD).  

The disciplines align with the Department’s seven Science and Technology (S&amp;T) priorities and the six high interest basic science research areas.  The disciplines are: Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering; Biosciences; Chemical Engineering; Chemistry; Civil Engineering; Cognitive, Neural, and Behavioral Sciences; Computer Science; Electrical Engineering; Geosciences; Industrial and Systems Engineering; Information Sciences; Materials Science and Engineering; Mathematics; Mechanical Engineering; Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering; Nuclear Engineering; Oceanography; Operations Research; and Physics.  Upon completion of their degree, students fulfill a service commitment to the DoD on a one-to-one payback per year of education funded.

Management of the SMART program falls under the Research Directorate (RD) within the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (OASD(R&amp;E)).  Two types of individuals participate in the program: retention scholars who are current DoD employees, and recruitment scholars who are college students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate programs and who represent new talent for the Department.

Since 2005, ~1,150 students have participated in SMART at ~160 sponsoring facilities and several other DoD components.  As of September 17, 2011, ~380 SMART scholars of the ~1,150 have transitioned into the service commitment phase.  To date, scholars have transitioned into the following DoD components: ~140 at Air Force facilities, ~120 at Army, ~105 at Navy, and ~10 at other DoD components.  Among those who transitioned to employment, 92 had completed their service commitment.  Of these, 82% continue to serve beyond their commitment.

                                    <r2:Description>As the demand for highly skilled science and technical workers continues to grow, sustaining Department of Defense (DoD) operations and local economic growth depends on a diverse Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) talent pool.  Growing competition from the private sector and other countries and economies for talent, and a current STEM workforce that is nearing retirement eligibility underscores the Department’s need to invest in K-12 informal education and outreach.  NDEP K-12 leverages the DoD’s STEM expertise as one of its most valuable assets, creating engagement opportunities for schools, students, teachers, and public sector and industry partners with DoD subject matter experts (SMEs) especially in communities adjacent to DoD laboratories and bases.  The DoD is reinvesting in and strengthening these local communities by enhancing student awareness and understanding of STEM careers and improving student education and teacher capabilities by providing support for informal STEM opportunities that support current and future local economic growth. </r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program addresses applied research associated with improving the lethality, reliability, safety and survivability of munitions and weapon systems.  The goal is to develop and demonstrate joint enabling technologies that can be used by Program Managers as they develop their specific weapon programs.  The program invests in and demonstrates technologies from a Joint Service perspective, thus insuring the development of technology with the broadest applicability while avoiding duplication of efforts.

Munition Area Technology Groups (MATGs) and Fuze Area Technology Groups (FATGs) have been established for each munition and capability area and are tasked with 1) coordinating, establishing, and maintaining five, ten, and fifteen year technology development plans and roadmaps, 2) coordinating biannual meetings to review technical and programmatic details of each funded and proposed effort, 3) developing and submitting Technology Transition Agreements in coordination with appropriate Program Executive Officers (PEOs) for insertion in their Insensitive Munitions (IM) Strategic Plans / Fuze Technology Development Plan, and 4) interfacing with other MATGs / FATGs and IM / fuze science and technology projects as appropriate.  The Joint Insensitive Munitions Technology Program (JIMTP) and Joint Fuze Technology Program (JFTP) will utilize a Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) (consisting of senior Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of Energy laboratory representatives and senior Munitions PEO representatives) to provide program oversight, policy, direction and priorities during its annual meeting.

The IM effort will demonstrate enabling technologies needed to develop weapons in compliance with requirements established in United States Code, Title 10, Chapter 141, Section 2389 and DoD Instruction 5000.1.  This effort will take promising technologies demonstrated at the laboratory scale and transition them into demonstration programs utilizing generic hardware based on priority munitions identified in the PEO IM Strategic Plans.  Mature demonstrated IM technology can be transitioned, thereby decreasing their program costs and schedule risk and facilitating spin-offs to other non-compliant munitions within their portfolios.

Under the JIMTP, investments are focused on five Munition Areas:  High Performance Rocket Propulsion, Minimum Signature Rocket Propulsion, Blast and Fragmentation Warheads (BFW), Anti-Armor Warheads (AAW), and Large Caliber Gun Propulsion (LCGP).  MATGs, under tri-service leadership, have developed technology roadmaps for each Munition Area, that are used to guide investments based on goals consistent with the DoD IM Strategic Plan.  These IM technologies, alone or in combination, will be incorporated in hardware, simulating real-world munitions, to demonstrate their utility and feasibility as part of Technology Transition Agreements with PEOs.

The Enabling Fuze Technology effort will also demonstrate fuze enabling technologies needed to develop weapons that address priority capability areas identified in the Guidance for Development of the Force (GDF), the Secretary of Defense Memorandum, DoD Policy on Cluster Munitions and Unintended Harm to Civilians, and shortfalls in current weapon systems.  This effort will take promising technologies demonstrated at the laboratory scale and transition them into demonstration programs utilizing generic hardware based on priority capabilities and technology needs identified and validated by the PEOs and the Heads of the Service Science and Technology (S&amp;T) communities.  In this way, promising multi-point initiation architectures, high reliability fuze architectures, survivable components, modular fuze packaging, and components produced based on ease of manufacturing can be integrated into a munition configuration and its ability to address required capability needs can be validated.  Mature fuze technology can be transitioned, thereby decreasing program costs and schedule risk and facilitating their spin-off into other munitions within their portfolios.

Under the Joint Fuze Technology Program, investments are focused on specific capability areas that have been identified by Department strategic guidance and current shortfalls in weapon systems and will be validated by the PEOs and the Heads of the Service S&amp;T communities. These four capability areas are: 1) Hard Target Survivable Fuzing, 2) Tailorable Effects Weapon Fuzing, 3) High Reliability Fuzing, 4) and Enabling Fuze Technologies and Common Architecture.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Joint Insensitive Munitions (IM) Technology Program (JIMTP) is aimed at developing the enabling technologies needed to build weapons in compliance with requirements established in statute  (United States Code, Title 10, Chapter 141, Section 2389) and regulation (DoDI 5000.1 and CJCSI 3170.01F).  Using technology available today, the Department has incrementally improved the IM response of our current munitions.  New munitions which have fully implemented current IM technology and design practices have been able to achieve IM compliance.  However, these have been the most easily solved problems.  Without new technology, future variants of current weapon systems will have the same, or worse, response to IM stimuli.  New weapon developments will face similar challenges. 

The JIMTP, investments are focused on five Munition Areas:  High Performance Rocket Propulsion, Minimum Signature Rocket Propulsion, Blast and Fragmentation Warheads, Anti-Armor Warheads, and Large Caliber Gun Propulsion.  Munition Area Technology Groups (MATGs), under tri-service leadership, have developed technology roadmaps for each Munition Area that are used to guide investments based on goals consistent with the DoD IM Strategic Plan.  The program is structured around these five areas with clear cross-cutting tasks.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

These technologies, when applied to rocket motors, improve IM response to one or more threats, while not degrading the response to other IM threats and at least maintaining munition performance.  Operating conditions may be controlled or widely varying in both temperature and vibration.  Technologies include, but are not limited to, rocket propellant ingredients (including synthesis, characterization and scale-up), reduced smoke or smokey propellants (including formulation, characterization and scale-up), rocket motor case design, materials for active and passive thermal mitigation, shock mitigation materials and techniques, passive and active coatings, active and passive venting techniques for motor cases or containers, ignition systems, sensors and thrust mitigation techniques.  The five, ten, or fifteen year goals of the HPP MATG are concentrated on solving the IM response of missile propulsions systems due to Fragment Impacts and Slow Cookoff for the majority of HPP rocket motors, and solving the Fast Cookoff response of very large HPP motors.</r2:Description>

This effort will develop enabling technologies at the laboratory scale and transition them into 6.3 demonstration programs for weapons where priority capabilities and technology needs have been identified and validated by the Program Executive Officers (PEOs) and the Heads of the Service S&amp;T communities.  Mature 6.2 fuze technologies will be transitioned, thereby decreasing their program costs and schedule risk and facilitating spin-offs to other munitions within their portfolios.
Under the Joint Fuze Technology Program (JFTP), investments are focused on specific capability areas that have been identified by Department strategic guidance and current shortfalls in weapon systems and validated by the PEOs and Heads of the Service S&amp;T communities.  These four capability areas are: 1) Hard Target Survivable Fuzing, 2) Tailorable Effects (TE) Weapon Fuzing, 3) High Reliability Fuzing, and 4) Enabling Fuze Technologies and Common Architecture.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The Department of Defense (DoD) HBCU/MI Program encourages participation of small minority schools as well as large minority research institutions.  This competitive program provides support through grants or contracts for research, education assistance, instrumentation purchases, and technical assistance as described below:

•  Research.  The research grants are to further the knowledge in the basic scientific disciplines through theoretical and empirical activities.  Collaborative research allows university professors to work directly with military laboratories or other universities.

•  Education.  Education assistance funds are used by minority institutions to strengthen their academic programs in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) thereby increasing the number of under-represented minorities obtaining undergraduate and graduate degrees in these fields.  These grants provide equipment, scholarships, cooperative work/study opportunities, visiting faculty programs, summer programs, and a variety of other enhancements designed to support students and to encourage them to pursue careers in STEM.

•  Infrastructure.  This program allows universities to purchase basic laboratory equipment for research and education program enhancements and highly sophisticated research instruments, such as lasers and spectrometers.

•  Technical assistance.  These funds are used to design programs that enhance the ability of minority institutions to successfully compete for future Defense funding.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>(U) The Lincoln Laboratory research line program (LL Program) is an advanced technology research and development effort conducted through a cost reimbursable contract with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).  The LL Program funds innovations that directly lead to the development of new system concepts, new technologies, and new components and materials.

The LL Program has evolved in FY 2012 to include three new categories for a total of seven core technology areas and four continuing technical initiatives:
- (U) Advanced Electronics Technologies, with emphasis on development of materials, devices, and subsystems utilizing microelectronic, photonic, biological, and chemical technologies to enable new system approaches to Department of Defense (DoD) sensors.
- (U) Communications (formerly Advance Optical Communications), focusing on high-efficiency free-space optical communications links as well as development and applications of metamaterials.
- (U) Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance, including the development of novel active and passive Radio Frequency (RF) and electro-optic sensors useful for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance applications.
- (U) Net-centric Operations, with an emphasis on developing and demonstrating the key technologies that will enable composable and dynamic multi-mission net-centric operations on the Global Information Grid.
- (U) Air and Missile Defense (new in FY 2012), with an emphases on novel discrimination schemes and electronic warfare applications.
- (U) Space Control (new in FY 2012), focusing on advanced remote-sensing architectures and small satellite applications.
- (U) Information, Computation, and Exploitation (new in FY 2012), which seeks to develop novel architectures, tools, and techniques for the processing, fusion, interpretation, computation and exploitation of multi-sensor, multi-intelligence data. 
- (U) Technical Initiatives, include biological sciences to aid the warfighter and develop tools for biological research; cybersecurity technologies to develop new techniques for the protection of systems against cyber attack and exploitation; autonomous systems technologies with the objective of developing mobile, autonomous, robotic platforms that demonstrate key capabilities needed for a wide range of defense applications; and quantum information sciences to develop basic technologies that support the storage, transport, and computation of quantum information.

(U) In FY 2012, two efforts (Homeland Protection and Decision Support) no longer receive funding under the LL Program.  Work previously conducted under these initiatives is either being carried forward under the aforementioned application-specific areas or has been transitioned to external support.

(U) Supporting these and other priority technology and capability areas are work efforts entitled Technical Intelligence and Testbed for Comparative Analysis:
- (U) Technical Intelligence is working to develop a comprehensive understanding of technology emergence and advancement in a range of relevant scientific areas such as nanotechnology, directed energy, and propulsion.  Some details are classified, but one focus area is working to establish a broad horizon scanning and technology forecasting capability through a collaborative effort by the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Intelligence Community.  This effort will develop insight into our relative position in science and technology around the world over time, as well as determine potential impacts on DoD capability development and future threat environments.  
- (U) The Testbed for Comparative Analysis will enable the evaluation of quantitative and horizon scanning and technology forecasting techniques for discovering disruptive technologies that may impact the DoD.  This effort will provide the DoD with objective ways to evaluate the accuracy of existing and future horizon scanning and technology forecasting efforts.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Technical Intelligence supports Assistant Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering) priorities through two primary mechanisms: 1) leveraging the university community through the JASONs (this is not an acronym); and 2) accessing information on the emergence, maturation and development of technology globally.  

(U) JASONs is a group of approximately 65 appropriately cleared experts who provide detailed independent technical assessments of challenging technological problems.  JASON members are primarily fully tenured professors in physics, mathematics, biosciences, and engineering, disciplines who hold active Sensitive Compartmented Information-level clearances.  The outputs of the JASONs annually are studies provided across the leadership and program manager levels which inform and often shape programmatic and technical decisions involving millions of dollars.  JASONs were previously funded through university research programs, but their level of technical expertise in systems and development is appropriate for incorporation into Applied Research.

(U) The technical intelligence program will support collaborative work with the United States Intelligence community on emerging and disruptive technologies, primarily through continued development of Technical Assessment, including Science &amp; Technology (S&amp;T) Net Assessments and Baseline Assessments.  These assessments look at sets of technologies from both a domestic and foreign development perspective.  The program will also support focused technology and regional trend studies and collaborative work with international partner nations on assessments of emerging and disruptive technologies and their relevance to national defense.  The technical intelligence program also supports development of horizon scanning and technology forecasting approaches that enable broader assessment of emerging and disruptive technologies.

                                            <r2:Text>(U) Continued to focus the JASON studies and Technical Intelligence in areas critical to national security.  In 2011 the JASONs completed summer studies touching on a range of topics from electronic warfare and hypersonics to the challenge of loose nukes and a review of the basic research priority areas.  The studies have been reviewed for quality and potential to impact programs and lessons learned are being incorporated into formulation of questions for 2012.  For the Technical Intelligence portion, some details are classified.  A list of capability-based technical intelligence needs were formally provided to the intelligence community with detailed production requirements.  Subsequently, baseline assessments of current technical intelligence products were completed.  This formalized process has improved both integration of current intelligence into programs and prioritization of future intelligence collection and analysis of relevance the Department.  This program continued collaboration with the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand (invited) to assess the best practices for identifying, assessing, prioritizing and integrating information on emerging and potentially disruptive technologies.  Lists from four nations (AUS, CAN, UK, and U.S.) were integrated and topic areas of common interest were identified for case study use.  A comparative analysis of analytic tools was initiated and templates for burden sharing on expert analysis were agreed.  Data was exchanged under the auspices of The Technical Cooperation Program (TTCP) sharing scientometric studies and expert analysis on topics of mutual interest.  Discussions on identifying and assessing 'wild cards' have also been initiated.  The program also continued the effort of the National Academy of Sciences (under the National Research Council) through the Board of Global Science and Technology to engage globally on targeted areas of science and technology to understand global shifts and their relevance to national security.  The Board sponsored several workshops with an initial focus on large data and computer processing.  In coordination with the National Intelligence Manager for Science and Technology and the Defense Intelligence Community the program continued an effort to strengthen science and technology analysis through improved articulation of science and technology requirements and definition of future high impact products.</r2:Text>

This program will continue 'five eyes' collaboration with the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand to continue assessments on emerging and disruptive technologies and will leverage the best collection of methodologies for scanning/discovery, prioritization and assessment of the military relevance for those emerging technologies.  The program will continue the effort of the National Academy of Sciences (under the National Research Council) through the Board of Global Science and Technology to engage globally on targeted areas of science and technology to understand global shifts and their relevance to national security.  The Board is sponsoring several conferences in countries in reference to technologies of interest, with the initial focus on the large data challenge.  A future technology war-game will be conducted at the National Defense University, focused on the potential disruptive impact of commercially available technologies relevant to an emerging threat.  In coordination with the National Intelligence Committee and the Defense Intelligence Community effort to Strengthen Science and Technology Analysis, this program will continue a strong partnership with the intelligence community to provide clear feedback on products, improve articulation of S&amp;T requirements, and define higher impact products for future development.  Technical Intelligence will continue to update and refine the S&amp;T Intelligence priorities and mechanisms for increasing information flow from the intelligence community.  </r2:Text>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>Systems 2020 will set the technical foundation for the Department's system needs for the next decade.  This initiative funds Office of the Secretary of Defense and Service research and development efforts in key technologies and tools for design and development of complex systems.  The program seeks to develop enabling technologies that will support the rise of a new class of adaptable systems, and will spawn a new generation of engineering tools and markets that could revolutionize systems engineering practice.

Systems 2020 research initiatives will investigate advanced engineering technologies and provide experimental platforms to assess the feasibility of proposed solutions.  These areas include:  (1) Multi-dimensional, multi-feature design and engineering  tradespace analysis approaches computed rapidly, accurately and within an integrated environment; (2) Techniques to generate multiple alternative designs with data structures enabling modeling of lifecycle implications such as producibility and sustainability; and (3) Novel decision-making techniques that interface engineering and operational data and inputs while guarding against premature or stovepiped design choices.  Together these efforts address opportunities to improve system adaptability and will develop techniques to balance design choices against costs for future adaptation precipitated by unexpected threats, changing missions, and disruptive technologies, while operating with far greater speed and agility.

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>The Joint Data Management program will be restructured in FY 2012 to evolve into the revised Data to Decisions program that addresses challenges from the Quadrennial Defense Review and Combatant Commanders. This revised program builds on the FY 2011 accomplishments with increased objectives and technology development goals critical to on-going operations. This Data to Decisions program focuses on information management architecture needs located at the seams between ongoing Service research efforts.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The program will focus on developing open-architecture technologies for decision support systems to help reduce future development time and cost of data management, analytics and user interface subsystems. The program will use a spiral development model with four-steps. Each year Operational teams will choose a series of cross-service challenge problems dominated by a specific sensing modality. Representative data for each of those problems will then be collected for testing against that problem. A Development team will design algorithms and data management architectures using high-level languages and self test on controlled data sets to address those challenge problems. Independent assessment will occur with sequestered data sets, but each development tool will also be tested against new sensors not included in the self-testing to determine fragility. A Transition team will host the developed algorithms as services in a spiraling prototype system.   

The Applied Research program will concentrate on the Development portion of this collaborative effort, while the Advanced Technology Development program focuses on the infrastructure piece, to include the Operational, Assessment and Transition portions.  There will be five thrust areas in total: cyber-infrastructure, Moving Intelligence (MOVINT) analytics, Text analytics, Imagery Intelligence (IMINT) analytics and User Interactions. MOVINT analytics began in FY 2011; Text Analytics will begin in FY 2012; Cyber-infrastructure, IMINT analytics and User Interactions is planned for FY 2013.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Joint Data Management Program will be restructured in FY 2012 to a revised Data-to-Decision program. This Data-to-Decision program includes increased objectives and technology developments critical to on-going operations. The program will focus on developing open-architecture technologies for decision support systems to help reduce future development time and cost of data management, analytics and user interface subsystems.The program will use a spiral development model with four-steps. Each year Operational teams will choose a series of cross-service challenge problems dominated by a specific sensing modality. Representative data for each of those problems will then be collected for testing against that problem. A Development team will design algorithms and data management architectures using high-level languages and self test on controlled data sets to address those challenge problems. Independent assessment will occur with sequestered data sets, but each development tool will also be tested against new sensors not included in the self-testing to determine fragility. A Transition team will host the developed algorithms as services in a spiraling prototype system.   

The Applied Research program will concentrate on the Development portion of this collaborative effort, while the Advanced Technology Development program focuses on the infrastructure piece, to include the Operational, Assessment and Transition portions. There will be five thrust areas in total: cyber-infrastructure, Moving Intelligence (MOVINT) analytics, Text analytics, Imagery Intelligence (IMINT) analytics and User Interactions. MOVINT analytics began in FY 2011; Text Analytics will begin in FY 2012; Cyber-infrastructure, IMINT analytics and User Interactions is planned for FY 2013.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Our military forces require resilient, reliable networks and computer systems to conduct effective operations. However, the number and sophistication of threats in cyberspace are rapidly growing, making it urgent and critical to improve the cyber security of Department of Defense (DoD) networks to counter those threats and assure our missions. This program focuses on innovative and sustained research in both cyber security and computer network operations to develop new concepts to harden key network and computer components, design new resilient cyber infrastructures, increase the military’s ability to fight and survive during cyber attacks, disrupt nation-state level attack planning and execution, measure the state of cyber security, and explore and exploit new ideas in cyber warfare for agile cyber operations and mission assurance. 

The Cyber Advanced Technology Development program element is budgeted in the advanced technology development budget activity because it will focus on the maturation of successful applied research results and their development into demonstrable advanced cyber capabilities. The Cyber Advanced Technology
Development program will build on results of matured applied research from the Cyber Applied Research Program and other programs to develop technology demonstrations for potential transition into capabilities that support the full spectrum of computer network operations.  These approaches will include moving from cyber defense to cyber resilience by changing the defensive terrain of our existing digital infrastructure, identifying ways to raise the risk and lower the value of attack from an advanced, persistent cyber threat, and focusing on mission assurance. 

This program focuses on integrating computer network defense and computer network operations, addressing the advanced persistent threat, and filling DoD technology gaps as determined by assessments conducted by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research &amp; Engineering (OASD(R&amp;E)) over the past year.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Human Social Culture Behavior (HSCB) Modeling Program is a vertically integrated effort to research, develop, and transition technologies, tools, and systems to programs of record and users in need. The Program exists to optimize U.S. forces’ ability to perform population-centric sensing, understand behaviors driven by social and cultural variables, and take effective courses of action in the full range of military operations. Program research will enhance intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities for understanding the Irregular Warfare environment and meeting the challenges of instability and violent extremism. In three integrated program elements (PEs), the Program will conduct applied research, mature and demonstrate advanced technology, and develop transitionable  methods, technology, tools and prototypes. Work under PE 0602670D8Z  will focus on developing an applied science base, to include validated theory and methods, along with knowledge products and resources to support sociocultural behavior data collection, analysis and forecasting of sociocultural behavior, course of action planning, and effects analysis. Research will address needs in two areas: modeling, and data. It will develop and validate theoretical constructions, generate knowledge products, and develop stand-alone computational models of sociocultural behavior; and develop improved methods for valid collection of quality sociocultural data that will facilitate subsequent model development and validation. The Program will ensure that supported research is clearly tied to warfighters and their needs. 

Human behavior based theory, knowledge products, and stand-alone models will support development of software to help users represent, understand, and forecast sociocultural behavior at strategic, operational, and tactical levels.

Improved data collection methods will help build the sociocultural science base and facilitate subsequent model development and validation and address emerging data types and sources, such as social media.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Human Social Culture Behavior (HSCB) Modeling Program is a vertically integrated effort to research, develop, and transition technologies, tools, and systems to programs of record and users in need. The Program exists to optimize U.S. forces’ ability to perform population-centric sensing, understand behaviors driven by social and cultural variables, and take effective courses of action in the full range of military operations. In three integrated program elements (PEs), the Program will conduct applied research, mature and demonstrate advanced technology, and develop transitionable  tools and prototypes. Work under PE 0602670D8Z will focus on developing an applied science base, to include validated theory and methods, along with knowledge products and resources to support sociocultural behavior data collection, analysis and forecasting of sociocultural behavior, course of action planning, and effects analysis. Research will address needs in two areas: modeling, and data. It will develop and validate theoretical constructions, generate knowledge products, and develop stand-alone computational models of sociocultural behavior; and develop improved methods for valid collection of quality sociocultural data that will facilitate subsequent model development and validation. The Program will ensure that supported research is clearly tied to warfighters and their needs. 

Human behavior based theory, knowledge products, and stand-alone models will support development of software to help users represent, understand, and forecast sociocultural behavior at strategic, operational, and tactical levels.

Improved data collection methods will help build the sociocultural science base and facilitate subsequent model development and validation and address emerging data types and sources, such as social media.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program addresses advanced technology development associated with improving the lethality, reliability, safety and survivability of munitions and weapon systems.  The goal is to develop and demonstrate joint enabling technologies that can be used by program managers as they develop their specific weapon programs.  The program invests in and demonstrates technologies from a Joint Service perspective, thus insuring the development of technology with the broadest applicability while avoiding duplication of efforts.

Munition Area Technology Groups (MATGs) and Fuze Area Technology Groups (FATGs) have been established for each munition and capability area and are tasked with 1) coordinating, establishing, and maintaining five, ten, and fifteen year technology development plans and roadmaps; 2) coordinating biannual meetings to review technical and programmatic details of each funded and proposed effort; 3) developing and submitting Technology Transition Agreements in coordination with appropriate Program Executive Offices (PEO) for insertion in their Insensitive Munition (IM) Strategic Plans / Fuze Technology Development Plan; and 4) interfacing with other MATGs / FATGs and IM / fuze science and technology projects as appropriate.   The Joint Insensitive Munitions Technical Program (JIMTP) and Joint Fuze Technical Program (JFTP) will utilize a Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) (consisting of senior DoD and DOE laboratory representatives and senior Munitions PEO representatives) to provide program oversight, policy, direction and priorities during its annual meeting.

The Insensitive Munitions effort will demonstrate enabling technologies needed to develop weapons in compliance with Insensitive Munitions requirements established in United States Code, Title 10, Chapter 141, Section 2389 and DoDI 5000.1.  This effort will take promising technologies demonstrated at the laboratory scale and transition them into demonstration programs utilizing generic hardware based on priority munitions identified in the PEO IM Strategic Plans.  Mature demonstrated IM technology can be transitioned, thereby decreasing their program costs and schedule risk and facilitating spin-offs to other non-compliant munitions within their portfolios.

Under the JIMTP, investments are focused on five Munition Areas:  High Performance Rocket Propulsion, Minimum Signature Rocket Propulsion, Blast and Fragmentation Warheads, Anti-Armor Warheads, and Large Caliber Gun Propulsion.  Munition Area Technology Groups, under tri-service leadership, have developed technology roadmaps for each Munition Area which are used to guide investments based on goals consistent with the DoD IM Strategic Plan.  These IM technologies, alone or in combination, will be incorporated in hardware, simulating real-world munitions, to demonstrate their utility and feasibility as part of Technology Transition Agreements with PEOs.

The Enabling Fuze Advanced Technology effort will also demonstrate fuze enabling technologies needed to develop weapons that address priority capability areas identified in the Guidance for Development (GDF) of the Force, the Secretary of Defense Memorandum, DoD Policy on Cluster Munitions and Unintended Harm to Civilians, and shortfalls in current weapon systems.  This effort will take promising technologies demonstrated at the laboratory scale and transition them into demonstration programs utilizing generic hardware based on priority capabilities and technology needs identified and validated by the PEOs and the Heads of the Service Science and Technology (S&amp;T) communities.  In this way, promising multi-point initiation architectures, high reliability fuze architectures, survivable components, modular fuze packaging, and components produced based on ease of manufacturing can be integrated into a munition configuration and its ability to address required capability needs can be validated.  Mature fuze technology can be transitioned, thereby decreasing program costs and schedule risk and facilitating their spin-off into other munitions within their portfolios.

Under the JFTP, investments are focused on specific capability areas that have been identified by the Department strategic guidance and current shortfalls in weapon systems and will be validated by the PEOs and the Heads of the Service S&amp;T communities. These four capability areas are: 1) Hard Target Survivable Fuzing; 2) Tailorable Effects Weapon Fuzing; 3) High Reliability Fuzing; and 4) Enabling Fuze Technologies and Common Architecture.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>High Performance Rocket Propulsion is focused on the development and demonstration of technologies to improve the IM response of High Performance Propulsion systems (rocket motors with Ammonium Perchlorate and with or without a metal fuel) for rockets and missiles launched from air, ground and sea platforms.  These technologies, when applied to rocket motors, improve IM response to one or more threats, while not degrading the response to other IM threats and at least maintaining munition performance.  Operating conditions may be controlled or widely varying in both temperature and vibration.  Technologies include, but are not limited to, rocket propellant ingredients (including synthesis, characterization and scale-up), reduced smoke or smokey propellants (including formulation, characterization and scale-up), rocket motor case design, materials for active and passive thermal mitigation, shock mitigation materials and techniques, passive and active coatings, active and passive venting techniques for motor cases or containers, ignition systems, sensors and thrust mitigation techniques.

This effort will take promising technologies integrated and tested to Technical Readiness Level (TRL) five and demonstrate the technologies to a TRL-6 utilizing weapon hardware based on priority capabilities and technology needs identified and validated by the Program Executive Officers (PEOs) and the Heads of the Service S&amp;T communities. Mature demonstrated fuze technology will be transitioned, thereby decreasing their program costs and schedule risk and facilitating spin-offs to other munitions within their portfolios.  Under the Joint Fuze Technology Program (JFTP), investments are focused on specific capability areas that have been identified by Department strategic guidance and current shortfalls in weapon systems and validated by the PEOs and Heads of the Service S&amp;T communities. These four capability areas are: 1) Hard Target Survivable Fuzing, 2) Tailorable Effects (TE) Weapon Fuzing, 3) High Reliability Fuzing, 4) and Enabling Fuze Technologies and Common Architecture.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>P206, Explosive Ordnance Disposal/Low-Intensity Conflict (EOD/LIC).  The EOD/LIC Program develops and delivers advanced capabilities for military Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) operators and Special Operations Forces (SOF) to meet the challenges of improvised explosive devices (IEDs), force protection, and the war on terrorism.  EOD/LIC efforts focus in two areas:  support to SOF to combat terrorism; and access, detection, identification, and neutralization of all types of conventional explosive ordnance and improvised explosive devices.  Requirements submitted by the Joint Service EOD and Service Special Operations communities are prioritized and approved by OASD (SO/LIC).  
  
P207, Special Reconnaissance Capabilities (SRC).  The SRC Program exploits, leverages, and integrates DoD’s service and agency efforts to improve surveillance and reconnaissance tools (unattended sensors, tagging and tracking devices, data infiltration/exfiltration, remote delivery, and mobility/delivery of sensors), while providing risk reduction for DoD and other agency technology and development programs.  The SRC Program identifies, integrates, and operationalizes the technical tools for the collection of actionable information against a variety of targets and mission requirements, including emerging requirements , and maintains DoD’s on-line catalog of tools in order to minimize crisis response time for special reconnaissance and surveillance. 
 
P208, Information Dissemination Concepts (IDC).  The IDC Program addresses technology capabilities necessary to enable sustained information dissemination campaigns in denied areas.  The IDC program, working as necessary with DoD and the interagency, develops, modifies, and demonstrates concepts, mechanisms, platforms and payloads to propagate themes and messages that convince target audiences to take action favorable to the United States and its allies. 
 
P209, Irregular Warfare Support (IWS).  The IWS Program (IWSP) develops adaptive and agile capabilities and methodologies to support irregular warfare in the current and evolving strategic environments. IWSP supports joint, interagency, and international partners who conduct or counter irregular warfare through indirect and asymmetric approaches, though they may employ a full range of military and other capabilities, in order to erode an adversary’s power, influence, and will. Solutions include material and non-material operational analysis, concept development, field experimentation, and delivery of capabilities, to defeat the motivations, sanctuaries, and enterprises of targeted state and non-state actors.  </r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>P207, Special Reconnaissance Capabilities (SRC).  The primary objective of the SRC program is to seek out and identify technical tools for the collection of actionable data and information which will assist DoD in its execution of Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) tasks.  To accomplish this objective, the program leverages emerging and existing developmental technologies from government and commercial ventures and operationalizes them to meet near term reconnaissance and surveillance operational requirements.  The operational tools transition unattended sensors, tagging devices, data transfer, remote delivery, and mobility/delivery of sensors into established Programs of Record throughout the DoD.  The program evaluates new and existing technical surveillance technologies and incorporates results into a reference database for future access. </r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The IWS Program (IWSP) develops adaptive and agile capabilities and methodologies to support irregular warfare in the current and evolving strategic environments.  IWSP supports joint, interagency, and international partners who conduct or counter irregular warfare through indirect and asymmetric approaches, though they may employ a full range of military and other capabilities, in order to erode an adversary’s power, influence, and will.  Solutions include material and non-material operational analysis, concept development, field experimentation, and delivery of capabilities, to defeat the motivations, sanctuaries, and enterprises of targeted state and non-state actors.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This effort will investigate new concepts and technologies that fill critical warfighter needs with joint and interoperable systems at all echelons of warfare.  Through advanced mathematics and engineering methodologies, the Joint Interoperability Directorate will work to institutionalize joint interoperability concepts throughout the DoD to ensure reduced fratricide, increased force effectiveness, and decreased taxpayer cost through fully interoperable weapons remains a focus throughout the acquisition/program development processes.  Working closely with programs in the advanced technology development phase, this effort will result in reviews of program technology feasibility from an interoperability perspective and push to proof of concept through prototyping and modeling.

Joint Interoperability has additional efforts to develop advanced mathematics techniques to manage large volumes of sensor data to solve DoD Battlefield challenges, to review new interoperability technologies, and to review program documentation not only to ensure a joint and interoperable approach, but also to mature technologies that advance warfighter effectiveness and that apply technology rapidly to battlespace challenges.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Director, Joint Interoperability provides oversight and guidance to initiatives and programs that support the joint tactical warfighter to enable reduced fratricide, increased force effectiveness, and decreased taxpayer cost through fully interoperable weapons systems, down to the tactical level of engagement.  Joint interoperability is the force multiplier that will enable our warfighters to fight jointly, be more efficient and effective in the battlespace, and allow warfighters to fight in the battle and not the tactical Command, Control, and Communications (C3) displays.  Sharing of systems and information across Services, and with coalition and non-DoD partners, has the benefit of a more rapid and better coordinated response to an ever more agile adversary.  It also enables the full exploitation of our costly (legacy and future) weapon systems at full kinematic range and makes full use of the assets in theater.  The taxpayers also benefit from reducing the cost of weapon system procurement by paying once versus multiple times for weapons systems that are used by Services in the battlespace.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Advances in mathematics must be applied to DoD systems in order to provide a common tactical picture for real-time, tactical operations with near-term potential for application to solve the Department's most pressing operational problems.  They will develop novel approaches to implement non-classical methods to solve computationally intensive problems like fusing numerous sensors that are generating terabytes of data in Afghanistan.  Our ability to sense has far exceeded our ability to process data into information.  Developing algorithms that are more computationally efficient at discerning information from large datasets will place smaller demands on our limited bandwidth and better enable the disadvantaged user to get information down to the tactical level.  This effort includes tests against recorded live data to demonstrate relevance to identified military needs.  This effort will develop advanced mathematical software algorithms and components in DoD-relevant areas such as topological evaluation and visualization of massive and high dimensional data sets, topological data analysis, and enhanced data extraction and filtering and fusion algorithms </r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Joint Interoperability removes barriers to communication and acts as a force multiplier to enable our warfighters to fight more efficiently and effectively across the spectrum of operations and is focused on maturing technologies that advance warfighter effectiveness and that apply technology rapidly to battlespace challenges.  Examples of the types of projects that are envisioned under this Program Element will focus on reducing fratricide, increasing force effectiveness, and reducing major acquisition program costs through fully interoperable weapons systems operating at tactical levels.

Through a systematic and thorough process, including comprehensive technology assessments, net technical assessments that engage in comparative analysis of United States versus non-United States capabilities, the program will better inform early shaping of acquisition programs, to include Special Access Programs, from a capabilities portfolio management perspective to deliver improved capabilities to the current and future joint warfighter.  This shaping is supported through capability-based assessments, requirements analysis, joint capability area assessments, integrated roadmap development, and the development/integration of risk-based collaborative tools to conduct capability-based assessments.  These efforts were previously funded under Program Element 0604875D8Z, Joint Systems Architecture Development.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The mission of the Department of Defense (DoD)/Department of Energy (DOE) Joint Munitions Technology Development Program (JMP) is to develop new and innovative warhead, explosive, fuzing, and lifecycle technologies and tools to enable major improvements in conventional munitions.  The JMP supports the development and exploration of advanced munitions concepts and enabling technologies that precede Service-specific system engineering.  A Memorandum of Understanding signed in 1985 by DoD and DOE provides the basis for the cooperative effort and for cost-sharing the long-term commitment to this effort.  The JMP funds budgeted in this justification are matched dollar for dollar by DOE funds. Through this interdepartmental cooperation, DoD’s relatively small investment leverages DOE’s substantial investments in intellectual capital and highly specialized skills, advanced scientific equipment and facilities, and computational tools not available within DoD.  Under the auspices of the JMP, the integration of DOE technologies with Joint and Individual Services’ needs has provided major advances in warfighting capabilities over many years and continues to play a crucial role in the exploration, development, and transition of new technologies needed by the Services.

The JMP seeks to develop: improved modeling and simulation tools for munitions design and evaluation, including evaluation of vulnerability (for example:  design of insensitive munitions (IM)); novel experimental techniques and material property databases to support modeling and simulation; higher power and safer explosives and propellants; miniaturized, lower-cost, and higher reliability fuzes, initiators, power systems, and sensors; design tools to enable development of higher performance warheads and weapons—such as penetrators—that are hardened against high impact loads; and tools to assess the health and reliability of the munitions stockpile and predict lifetimes based on these assessments.

The JMP is aligned with Department strategic plans and policies such as:

– Munitions for contingency operations, particularly for the reduction of unintended collateral effects.
– Reducing time and cost for acquisition of munitions.
– Rapidly transitioning science and technology (S&amp;T) to support the warfighter in today’s conflicts.
– Establishing future core capabilities and maintaining our national S&amp;T capabilities through joint investment and interagency cooperation and teaming.
– Aiding in recruiting and retaining high-caliber scientists and engineers at DoD S&amp;T organizations.
– Developing advanced munitions technologies to support the increased role of conventional weapons to deter and respond to non-nuclear attack, as described in the Nuclear Posture Review report.
– Developing safer munitions that are compliant with IM standards to meet statutory and Department policy requirements.

The JMP has established a successful collaborative community of DoD and DOE scientists and engineers.  This community develops technologies of interest to both Departments within a structured framework of technical reviews and scheduled milestones.  The JMP is administered and monitored by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and reviewed annually by the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), which is comprised of over 25 senior executives from the Army, Navy, Air Force, Special Operations Command, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, OSD, and DOE.  Projects are organized in eight Technology Coordinating Groups (TCG) that bring together the disciplines necessary to properly evaluate technical content, relevance, and progress.  The TCG conduct semi-annual technical peer reviews of JMP projects and plans. DoD Service laboratory technical experts lead each of the TCG to ensure that the technologies under development address high-priority DoD needs.  The JMP also promotes more in-depth technical exchange via short-term visiting scientist and engineer assignments at both the DOE and the DoD laboratories.

The JMP has a long history of successful transitions and significant Return on Investment (ROI).

– The JMP is the primary provider of high performance structural mechanics computer codes used by DoD.  According to the FY 2010 High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP) Requirements Analysis Report, the DOE computer codes are used for over 70 percent of all (classified and unclassified) structural mechanics simulations and for virtually all of the classified calculations run by DoD on HPCMP platforms.  The Department expects this heavy reliance on DOE codes to grow for several reasons including: preference for using DOE codes because they are export-controlled; DOE codes are scalable, incorporate multiphysics, and run on massively parallel computer systems; and the Department can obtain source codes to modify for individual Service needs.
– A significant number of defense industrial contractors also use the DOE structural mechanics computer codes.
– CHEETAH, a standalone thermochemical computer code, is the most widely used code by DoD and defense contractors for predicting performance of energetic materials.
– The Army Research &amp; Engineering Development Center (ARDEC) has stated that the DOE computer codes are now routinely used to design all new warheads. The use of these tools has reduced the number of validation tests required for each new warhead from about five to one with concomitant cost and time savings.
– The Army Research Laboratory has used DOE computer codes to develop and deploy new armor solutions to Iraq and Afghanistan with unprecedented speed.
– New munitions’ case material and explosive fill technologies provide the warfighter with a lethal and low collateral damage capability.  These technologies have been transitioned to the Focused Lethality Munition variant of the Small Diameter Bomb, which is currently fielded.  The technologies are also the basis for a new GBU 129 weapon that is currently under rapid development to meet a Joint Urgent Operational Need requirement for a low-collateral Mk-82 class weapon.
– The Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization (JIEDDO) has supported applications of JMP technologies, including: compact synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems for counter-IED efforts; pre-deployment training of military personnel by DOE explosive experts on how to recognize feed stocks and processes for homemade explosives; and use of massively parallel, multiphysics computer codes to understand how explosive blast waves cause brain injury and how to mitigate these injuries.
– An erosive initiator technology developed under the JMP has been transitioned to the Services for use in selectable output weapons and self-destruct capabilities.
– A novel approach to controlling the sensitivity and therefore the initiability of explosives using microwave energy, as well two new, insensitive energetic materials have transitioned to development projects in the Joint IM Technology and Joint Fuze Technology Programs.
– Reliability analysis tools were used by Army Missile Command to assess RAM, AMRAAM, and TOW.
– Robotic demilitarization processing systems were installed at several locations, including a system at Hawthorne Army Depot to recover copper shape charge liners, Comp A5, and grenade bodies. 

The JMP also works with the Defense Ordnance Technology Consortium (DOTC) and the National Warheads and Energetics Consortium (NWEC) of industrial suppliers to equitably and efficiently transition JMP technologies to defense industrial contractors. In addition to the computer codes mentioned earlier, the JMP has transitioned case technology for low-collateral weapons, low-temperature co-fired ceramic technology for smaller, less expensive fuze electronic components, and erosive initiator technology for selectable effects weapons to defense industrial suppliers.

The integrated DoD and DOE efforts within the JMP are transitioning new munitions’ technologies to the Department and the defense industrial base through the advanced development process.  The JMP is a focal point for collaborative work by nearly 300 DoD and DOE scientists and engineers.  Technical leaders from both Departments consider the JMP a model of cooperation, both within their respective departments and between departments.  The highly challenging technical objectives of the approximately 35 JMP projects require multi-year efforts and sustained, long-term investments to achieve success.

The JMP projects are divided into five technical focus areas: Computational Mechanics and Material Modeling; Energetic Materials; Initiators, Fuzes, and Sensors; Warhead and Penetration Technology; and Munitions Lifecycle Technologies.

                                    <r2:Title>Energetic Materials</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The goals of this technical focus area are to develop new energetic materials (EM) and supporting technologies to satisfy the competing requirements for smaller, more lethal, and safer munitions.  Work is primarily focused on explosives, gun and rocket propellants, and, to a lesser extent, pyrotechnics.  The projects include development of: new EM, including new molecules in a range of particle size and morphologies; new EM formulations; a fundamental understanding of energetic properties and performance; and computational tools for analysis of performance and sensitivity.  New materials and formulations are developed with the recognition that cost must be feasible, chemical feed stocks reliable, and manufacturing processes suitable for scale-up to production levels.

Both federal statute and Department policy direct the development of safer, less sensitive munitions.  Making munitions less sensitive while maintaining explosive or propellant performance is a difficult challenge.  This goal is best attained through a combination of new EM development, EM characterization, and more sophisticated modeling and simulation tools.  It is cost-prohibitive to qualify weapons for compliance with insensitive munitions requirements through testing alone.  A better, in many cases the only means to qualify these weapons is with the combination of analysis based on validated computational tools and a few well-designed tests.

The Department requires munitions that provide selectable effects.  To achieve these effects, weapons designers need to thoroughly understand the performance of EM used in both the main weapon fill and the initiation systems.  Distributed fuzing systems can provide selectable effects as well as safer munitions, but such complex small-scale systems require more complete knowledge of EM detonation physics and in, some cases, new EM designed for this application.

The desire for smaller and lighter munitions is driven in large part by the increasing dependence on unmanned weapons platforms and to some extent by the need to reduce logistical burden, especially energy consumption.  New EM are needed to meet the munitions weight and size requirements while maintaining lethality and safety.

The Department is working to increase the range and velocity of weapons and to develop weapons against hardened targets.  These applications subject the EM to high accelerations and shock loads.  To support the development of these new systems, we need to improve our ability to model EM under impact loads and to characterize relevant properties to determine their ability to survive in these aggressive environments.  We may also need to develop new, more robust EM that survive impact loads while maintaining lethality and initiability.

                                    <r2:Description>The goals of this technical focus area are to develop new materials, components, diagnostic techniques, and modeling and simulation tools for fuzing systems. Initiators, fuzes, and sensors must work reliably together to prevent unintended detonation, to correctly detect intended targets, and to initiate detonation when required.  Projects in this focus area support the Department’s needs to miniaturize fuzing systems.  Smaller systems are required for several reasons including: compatibility with smaller and lighter weapons systems; trading volume in munitions for other components such as additional explosive, larger power sources, or guidance systems; increasing reliability through redundancy (use two or more smaller initiating systems); and upgrading existing sub-munitions with smarter and more reliable fuzing systems.  The miniaturization of fuzing systems requires new material and components, new power systems, new diagnostic techniques, and improved modeling tools for microdetonics.  The Department also needs weapons systems with selectable effects and these effects can be achieved with multi-point initiation systems.  Such systems are inherently more complex and require improved characterization of initiator materials and components as well as more sophisticated modeling and simulation tools.  To attain greater precision and to avoid unintended collateral effects when weapons are used in the complex environment of counter-insurgency or counter-terrorist operations, target sensors must be reliable and provide high-fidelity discrimination.  Two projects in this focus area are developing technologies to achieve this level of performance in compact packages.

                                    <r2:Title>Warhead and Penetration Technology</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>This focus area supports the development of new warheads and penetrator weapons through advances in materials processing and characterization, instrumentation, and computational codes. In recent years there have been very large increases in warhead performance directly attributed to our ability to understand and accurately model the physics and fine details of new warhead designs, and to advances in increasingly sophisticated material processing.  The Department’s requirement to achieve more precise weapon effects with minimum collateral damage is supported by work on controlled fragmentation, non-fragmenting warhead cases, and multiphase blast explosives (MBX). More recently, increases in performance and reductions in vulnerability (IM) are being achieved through improved warhead integration into munitions using a systems-oriented approach.

The goals for penetrator weapons are to investigate, develop, and transition advanced technologies for the design, development, and performance assessment of the next generation of high performance, precision strike weapons.  This effort directly supports national initiatives to defeat hard and deeply buried targets, which are proliferating worldwide, and to deny/defeat weapons of mass destruction.  The work addresses high-velocity penetration into granular materials (sand and soil), penetration into advanced concrete, new penetrator materials and designs, and non-inertial onboard instrumentation.

The specific projects in the warhead and penetration technology focus area are:
– Multiphase blast munitions (MBX) technology.
– Erosive initiation technology.
– Dynamic behavior of sand.
– Integrated munitions modeling &amp; experimentation.
– Modeling of strategic structures.
– Concrete perforation and penetration modeling &amp; experiments.

                                    <r2:Description>This focus area supports improving the Department’s ability to understand, measure, predict, and mitigate safety and reliability problems caused by materials aging and degradation in weapons systems.  Current stockpile assessment methods typically focus on addressing materials aging and reliability problems after they occur, rather than anticipating and avoiding future problems or failure mechanisms.  The overall objective of this work is to develop a toolset of computational models that are able to quantitatively predict materials aging processes and ultimately improve the long-term reliability of weapons systems, sub-assemblies, and/or components.  These objectives are achieved by: identifying aging mechanisms, quantifying the rates at which those aging mechanisms occur, developing predictive models, and using these models to predict the munitions stockpile reliability.  An additional objective of this work is to develop technologies and methodologies to enable munitions health management and condition-based maintenance.

The specific projects in the warhead and penetration technology focus area are:

– Predictive materials aging including: solder interconnect reliability, corrosion of electronics, and adhesive degradation
– MEMS reliability
– Military use of commercial, off the shelf (COTS) electronics
– Complex system health assessment </r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>In Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO), the United States (US) must be ready to meet the widespread and growing threat of asymmetric weapons such as Man Portable Air Defense Systems (ManPADS), unguided hostile fire and portable small weapons improvised from commercially available electronic sensors, computer modules, navigation and control components coupled with various disruptive payloads.  Such devices provide terrorists and foreign military units the novel means to rapidly construct a wide range of weapons capable of disruptive actions against civilian and military forces alike.  The US must be ready to counter such weapons on short notice.

The asymmetric nature of such devices is already well understood by terrorists.  ManPADS and mortars have been used to attack both air and ground forces, and pose a threat in any region due to their portability.  Digital processors, analog-to-digital converters and digital optical sensors give terrorists the means to deploy unexpected threats on short notice.  Conventional kinetic defenses against these devices can be impractical in urban settings.  Because the speed of appearance of these disruptive devices can be short, such threats are asymmetric in comparison with the long development cycles that are typical of US military defensive systems.  Together these asymmetries highlight the need to rapidly evolve alternative Electronic Warfare, Information Operations and Counter Terrorism capabilities suitable for neutralizing such threats in a timescale that is commensurate with their appearance.  This program element investigates novel means to detect and neutralize asymmetric threats, as well as special mission and other methods to employ asymmetric principles against our adversaries.

This program seeks to identify rapidly deployable solutions (outside of service programs of record) that can effectively mitigate asymmetric threats by integrating advanced commercial or military off-the-shelf technology in innovative ways that augment and/or reduce risk when inserted into service programs of record.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The widespread and growing availability of sophisticated, commercially available electronic sensors, computer modules, navigation and control components coupled with widely proliferated Man Portable Air Defense Systems (ManPADS), portable explosives, mortars, rockets provide terrorists and foreign military units with the novel means to rapidly construct a wide range of weapons capable of disruptive actions against military forces.  In Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO), the United States (US) must be ready to counter such weapons on short notice.  The asymmetric nature of such devices is already well understood by terrorists.  ManPADS, man portable weapons and mortars have been used to attack both air and ground forces, and pose a threat to any region due to their portability.   Digital processors, analog-to-digital converters and digital optical sensors give terrorists the means to deploy unexpected threats on short notice.  Because conventional kinetic defenses against these devices can be impractical in urban settings and because the speed of appearance of such devices can be short, such threats are disruptive and asymmetric in comparison with the typically long development cycles associated with US military defensive systems.  These asymmetries highlight the need to rapidly evolve alternative Electronic Warfare (EW), Information Operations and Counter Terrorism capabilities suitable for neutralizing such threats.  This program will investigate novel means to detect and neutralize these asymmetric threats, as well as special mission and other methods to employ asymmetric principles against our adversaries.

This program seeks to identify rapidly deployable solutions (outside of service programs of record) that can effectively mitigate asymmetric threats by integrating advanced commercial or military off-the-shelf technology in innovative ways that augment and/or reduce risk when inserted into service programs of record.  Laboratory and field testing is used to evaluate the feasibility and military utility of resultant low cost, near term capabilities.  FY 2013 efforts will investigate, integrate, test and demonstrate elements of the following technologies:

1.  Integrated Situational Awareness and Countermeasures
Department of Defense (DoD) helicopters currently use a federated architecture of sensors and countermeasures to protect themselves against guided and unguided hostile threats while simultaneously avoiding collisions with the ground and other obstacles.  These sensors typically provide the pilot with a separate display of radar, radar warning, missile warning or off-board communications to guide the pilot in selecting automatic or manual countermeasures against radar, laser, or radio frequency guided threats.  These un-fused sensors create a serial information stream which can induce an inadequate response to the threat.  Federated systems consume weight, space, and power which are at a premium in small platforms.  The initial goal of this project is to fuse multiple functions such as missile detection and countermeasures, hostile fire detection, navigation in visually degraded environments, and active search using optical detection into a one or two aperture device with a single integrated display to produce improved situational awareness.  Subsequent efforts of this joint service government/contractor team will assess integration of multi-platform sensor fusion using Radio Frequency (RF) and laser data-links to create cross-platform shared situational awareness among a section or division of helicopters or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) which is more complete than a single platform warning/tracking system.  Such efforts will be proven in a series of Rotary Wing Aircraft Survivability Equipment (RASE) experiments bringing sensors and shooters together in a collaborative learning environment using live fire with a variety of weapons and environments.

2.  Low Cost/Near Term Counter Asymmetric Systems
Investigate low cost, near term technologies solutions to allow aircraft to fly in medium to high ManPADS threat airspace in support of OCO.  Emphasis is on threats, aircraft and system approaches that are not covered by existing programs of record including but not limited to:  innovative threat warning, advanced pyrophoric decoys, miniature high reliability lasers, magnetically steered high reliability pointer-trackers, higher powered and higher duty cycle lasers, preemptive countermeasures systems.
 
Tasks leading to a rapid technology transition to be completed in FY 2013:

Begin efforts to evaluate the signatures of air platforms that are threatened by new classes of surface-to-air threats.  Efforts will include using new instrumentation in conjunction with tests that are planned for other purposes (tag-along testing) to measure relevant signatures of platforms in order to develop defensive strategies.  Additionally, FY 2013 efforts include investigation of rapidly deployable technologies that could be used to help counter emerging threats.

3.  Disruptive Technology Defeat and Utilization
This effort involves emerging and disruptive technologies analysis and rapid prototyping of technologies required to adapt counter-terrorism techniques to threats in OCO.  Primary payoff is an assessment of current system capabilities and limitations against the threat and capture of baseline system performance against the threat set for developing technologies.  Joint Electronic Advanced Technology (JEAT) will demonstrate rapid prototyping of technologies required to combat adaptive threats.  Emphasis will be on demonstrating an end-to-end kill chain and techniques which minimize or eliminate collateral damage.  Starting in FY 2011 the efforts of this mostly-government team included novel techniques to detect and locate the signatures of terrorist activities using electronic means.  Trident Spectre provides a venue for various members of Special Forces, Conventional Forces and Intelligence Community to collaborate on and evaluate technologies and techniques related to “Tactical Intelligence” in a technical, operational, and safe environment.  Trident Spectre provides an opportunity for capability developers (scientists, engineers, designers) to interact directly with tactical operators, collectors and analysts; and a process that correctly and efficiently reviews potential tactical Intelligence technologies and techniques that will enhance the operational capability of the DoD activities in OCO.   Primary payoff is improved connectivity and more efficient collection and dissemination of Tactical Intelligence.  Customers include US Central Command (CENTCOM), US Special Operations Command (SOCOM), Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research &amp; Engineering (ASD (R&amp;E)), DoD Conventional/Special Forces, and members of the Intelligence Community.  Products include an after action report and a transition plan moving management activities to SOCOM.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY 2011 funding was transferred from the Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (JCTD) BA4 PE 0604648D8Z and Defense Aquisition Executive (DAE) Pilot program BA 5 PE 605648D8Z into the JCTD BA3 PE.  The JCTD BA-4 PE and DAE BA-5 Pilot Program PEs ended.

Today's operations require even faster delivery of new capabilities.  Therefore, the JCTD Program was revised to accelerate project selection, encourage capability demonstration of more short projects (one year or less) and fewer long projects (two to three years), and increase the delivery rate of new capabilities.  This new process includes: streamlined project approval and initiation; clear one-year deliverables and decision points for projects greater than a year in duration; and annual reviews of ongoing JCTDs to assess deliverables and continuation of the project.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (JCTD) Program directly addresses Joint, Coalition, and/or Interagency capability needs expressed by Combatant Commands (COCOMs).  Due to significant successes since inception of the program (initially the Advanced Capability Technology Demonstration (ACTD) Program), the JCTD Program is now viewed by COCOMs as a primary means to rapidly develop, assess, and transition needed capabilities into operations.  Through partnering with other solution providers and resource sponsors, the JCTD Program typically leverages $2 in partner funding for every $1 in the JCTD budget.  Thus, the value and impact of JCTDs to the COCOMs is significantly greater than a typical Research and Development program.

Key values demonstrated by the JCTD program are:
- The program has a long history of providing enduring capabilities.  To date, over 90 percent of completed JCTDs have successfully transitioned capabilities to warfighters.  70 percent of completed ACTD projects successfully transitioned their products.  (See “Section D.  Acquisition Strategy” for transition discussion).
- The program delivers capabilities rapidly.  Projects execute within the Department of Defense (DoD) Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution (PPBE) process.  In other words, when a new capability need is identified, a JCTD project can be started and completed before funding can start in the traditional PPBE cycle.  The result is that 74 JCTD/ACTD projects delivered capabilities used in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and 57 projects delivered capabilities to Operation ENDURING FREEDOM.  Most of those capabilities would not have been delivered - or would have been significantly delayed – without the JCTD program.  A recent example is the Persistent Ground Surveillance System (PGSS) JCTD, which quickly (several months) demonstrated and assessed aerostat and integrated sensor technologies to provide wide area surveillance for forward operating bases.  Success has led to procurement of over 30 PGSS systems providing 24 hour protection to bases in Afghanistan.
- The program enables Coalition cooperative development by leveraging partner nation expertise and resources.  More than one quarter of JCTD projects involve some coalition participation.  As a result of successful past collaborations, the program now enjoys routine interactions with the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, the Republic of Korea, and the Republic of Singapore.
- The program enables development and execution of interdepartmental cooperation projects, such as projects with the Department of Homeland Security, Department of State, and Department of Transportation.  Recent examples are interdepartmental collaborations for maritime awareness, air domain information sharing, tunnel detection and characterization, and Arctic awareness.
- The program enables rapid response to new DoD priorities before Service PPBE cycles can respond.  For example, the Department has recently established priorities for Building Partner Capacity, understanding human terrain, and nuclear forensics.  The JCTD Program quickly responded and is providing initial capabilities that are transitioning to Service efforts.

MEASURABLE OUTCOMES:  Metrics include: all JCTDs will have deliverables within 12 months to enable assessment for project continuation; 50 percent of JCTDs will provide an operationally-relevant prototype within 12 months; and 75 percent will complete final demonstration within 24 months of receiving funding.  JCTDs will spiral products and deliverables during the demonstration.  At least 75 percent of JCTD projects will transition products to a Program of Record (POR), residual operations, or availability for procurement from the General Services Administration (GSA) Schedule.

Transition Achievement:  The JCTD program has been achieving actual transition rates in excess of the stated goal.  The JCTD Program defines transition as a project’s product(s) going to new or existing POR, providing residual capabilities sustained by non-JCTD funds in direct support of operations, or commodity-type capabilities entered onto GSA schedule for procurement by Department users.  14 of 18 completions in FY 2011 successfully transitioned.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Title>Joint Recovery and Distribution System (JRaDS) </r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>JRaDS developed and demonstrated military utility of a new family of transportation trailers.  JRaDS provides a trailer Family of Systems (FoS) which enables execution of multiple missions via a small number of trailer variants versus the large inventory of distinct trailer systems currently in DoD inventory.  The goal of this FoS is high reliability and parts commonality and modularity design to reduce Service logistics and maintenance requirements and associated costs of ownership.  Additionally, supporting personnel may be reduced due to the semi-autonomous operating capability of JRaDS, and reduced need for supplementary materiel handling equipment.  These aspects will expedite cargo movement from Sea Ports of Debarkation, Aerial Ports of Debarkation, and Theater Supply Depots to front-line users, while reducing costs associated with movement of cargo within theater.  JRaDS will also afford an expeditious and efficient method of recovering disabled and catastrophically damaged Tactical Wheeled Vehicles and light to medium weight Rotary Wing aircraft.  Residual trailers from the JCTD will be used by field units, thereby placing the JRaDS capability into forces sooner than waiting for production of trailers.  </r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>JMEWS demonstrates an updated multi-effect warhead system aboard the Tomahawk Land Attack Missile (TLAM).  This warhead technology provides a leap-ahead capability against a widely varied target set, which includes hard and soft targets.  In concert with this warhead, a Third-Party In-Flight Targeting (3PT) system will be demonstrated that allows dynamic targeting and re-tasking of the missile.  Using these technologies, Combatant Commanders will have the reliable option of neutralizing heavily defended and dynamic targets without the incursion of manned platforms.  Hardware and software changes to the TLAM Program of Record (PMA-280) will be incorporated via Engineering Change Proposals once demonstrated.  Deliverables will include documented CONOPS and TTPs.  Production of the TLAM will incorporate the JMEWS warhead, and add the data link, radio equipment, and interfaces necessary for 3PT.  JMEWS will increase the number of targets held at risk, reduce cost, increase flexibility in access denied environments, and provide a long range, survivable, high-lethality weapon.

                                    <r2:Description>The Joint Requirements Oversight Council validated the need for TEDS in FY 2010.  TEDS is the implementation of C2 Core extensions for tactical information at the battalion level so that web-services data sharing frameworks based on Universal Core (UCore) can enable data sharing among disparate systems.  TEDS focuses on exchanging data from Army and Marine Corps C2 Authoritative Data Sources for the C2 and Battlespace Awareness domains.  The efficiencies gained will be the reduction of redundant software being developed across multiple programs and the ability to seamlessly exchange data within Military Services as well as NATO and coalition partners who adopt UCore.  Transition of the C2 Core extensions and Web services for translation and semantic mediation is planned for programs of record in the U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps.  The output of TEDS will enable C2 systems to migrate to a Service Oriented Architecture environment.  The final demonstration will be in FY 2012 and the JCTD will complete in September 2012 with transition expected in FY 2013 of data pilot services.</r2:Description>

ISOM will integrate certain existing terrestrial and IP SATCOM management tools which will greatly improve the ability to make the most of underutilized SATCOM resources or to resolve complex warfighter communications outages.  ISOM integrates real-time situational awareness of SATCOM resources to provide a single, over-arching view of current SATCOM allocations and the load on these links.  It then provides an automated ability to act on this information by dynamically re-allocating or re-provisioning the SATCOM resources given to IP SATCOM networks.

                                    <r2:Title>Combat Commander Direct Participation, Transition Enabling, and Special Programs</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>This effort is comprised of three programs that support the entire JCTD Program, separate from the specific JCTD projects.  The three programs are (1) Unified  COCOM Direct Participation; (2) JCTD Transition Enabling; and (3) Program Integration Office for interagency classified projects.   Additional details follow:
(1) COCOM Direct Participation:  The COCOMs are essential in specifying capability needs, project selection, validation, demonstration, assessment, and transition of JCTDs.  However, COCOM staffs are not manned to provide the daily interactions needed to develop and execute successful JCTDs and coordinate all operational interactions.  Therefore, the JCTD Program enables COCOM staffs to directly participate in the Program, allowing each COCOM to select and fund an on-site JCTD manager, typically 1 full-time equivalent engineer with operational experience.
(2) JCTD Transition Enabling:  In FY 2011 the funding for JCTD Transition,  Program Element 0604648D8Z, was transfered to the Program Element 0603648D8Z, which is reflected in the growth of this program.  In some cases, Service or Agency partners cannot commit to transition JCTD products until demonstrations and assessments are complete at the end of the JCTD.  This leads to situations in which the Service or Agency transition funding is not available for one to two years, due to the Service or Agency prior Program Objective Memorandum commitments.  In such cases, where there is clear transition and the need to sustain the capability for a short time prior to availability of Service or Agency transition funds, the JCTD Transition Enabling fund may be used to meet that need.  
(3) Program Integration Office: A limited number of classified JCTDs are executed in special classification channels, typically involving partnership with other government agencies.  JCTD Program funds are used to provide the special classification handling capability and to provide partial funding to the selected special projects.

                                    <r2:Description>HSCDS will integrate aerial delivery components to provide a cost effective, high speed ingress/egress, low-altitude, accurate Point of Need Delivery capability, which reduces exposure to threats for aircrew, aircraft, and ground receiving units.  HSCDS will provide parachute-extracted Container Delivery System with C-130J and C-17 aircraft at maximum ramp open airspeed from as low as 250 feet above ground level.  This provides warfighters the ability to conduct low altitude, fast and accurate resupply (up to 16,000 pounds of supplies via eight Containerized Delivery System bundles) to small combat units while maintaining aircraft maneuverability, thus reducing threat exposure.  </r2:Description>

At the next invocation of the browser, a pristine, trusted desktop will be automatically invoked, removing the adversary presence, even if the intrusion was undetected.  NPDB prevents infiltration from external threats, ex-filtration of protected information, Command and Control denial of service, and delivers Cyber Surveillance/Situational Awareness through fusion of heterogeneous sensors data.  Infected sessions are restored in seconds and a pristine copy of the NPDB can be spawned quickly, and the infected copy quarantined for analysis, or discarded, without loss of functionality to the user, required of current desktop reimaging processes. </r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>CRATR developed the capability to conduct rapid airfield damage assessment, determine the minimum airfield operating surface required, identify unexploded ordnance, and repair runway damage to enable critical airfields to rapidly return to operation.  CRATR evaluated existing, new and commercial technologies and procedures, and integrated the most successful to develop both material and equipment solutions.  Successful solutions from early demonstrations will be used to create an interim modular repair kit which will form the Spiral One capability for theater.  After a successful final demonstration, products from CRATR will be packaged into a final modular repair kit that will transition to the U.S. Air Force Airfield Damage Repair program. </r2:Description>

This allows the Department to rapidly execute the JCTDs needed in FY 2012 to meet the COCOMs most pressing needs as soon as FY 2012 funds become available.  COCOMs have proposed projects addressing a range of capability gaps, including cyber defense, logistics, information distribution, interagency collaboration in humanitarian assistance/disaster relief, operations in communications and GPS jamming environments, autonomous systems in current operations, advanced munitions, energy efficiencies, and space systems.  Additional COCOM proposals will be acted on throughout the year to address emerging needs as funds are identified.  </r2:Description>

The first group of FY 2013 JCTD projects will be identified under the JCTD selection process beginning with a Candidate Nomination Board in June 2012 followed by a Candidate Decision Board (CDB) in August 2012.  This allows the Department to rapidly execute the JCTDs needed in FY 2013  to meet the COCOMs'  most pressing needs as soon as FY 2013 funds become available.  Additional CDBs will be held throughout the year to address emerging COCOM needs.  JCTDs indentified in these CDBs will be initiated as funds are identified.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>JCTD capabilities that demonstrate operational utility transition to acquisition via one of several methods:
- The capabilities address a documented capability gap in an existing Program of Record, so that the exisiting Program can acquire, further develop, sustain, and provide the capability under existing program documentation.
- The capabilities address capability gaps that naturally fit with an existing Program of Record, but program documentation addressing the new capabilities does not exist.  In these cases, existing program documentation (such as the Capabilities Development Document or Capabilities Production Document) is revised to include the new capabilities from the JCTD, and the JCTD capabilities transition to the Program of Record.
- The capabilities address a current operational need without requiring Program of Record changes.  In these cases, the JCTD capabilities may transition directly to operational use, with sustainment (operations and maintenance) funding arranged through the gaining command.  
- The capabilities may be widely applicable commodity products, useful to many commands.  In these cases, the commodity products listed on General Services Administration schedule, and made available for purchase by any commands needing the capability, using procurement funds.

                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Strategic Goals Supported in FY 2012:
- Project Selection Focus
- Spiral Technologies to Fielded Capabilities
- Time to Final Demonstration
- Adequately Shared Funding and Visibility
- Independent Assessment Capability
- Successful Military Utility Assessment (MUA)

The majority of funding from this Program Element is forwarded to the Services/Defense Agencies that execute the individual JCTD projects.  The Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense, Rapid Fielding maintains and provides overall programmatic oversight for the JCTD program, to include the individual JCTD projects.  The JCTD performance metrics center on how fast relevant joint and/or transformational technologies can be demonstrated and provided to the joint warfighter.  These metrics are driven by the overall business process which includes six parts:  (1) selection focus; (2) ability to spin-off spiral technologies; (3) time necessary to complete a final demonstration; (4) adequately resourced projects with appropriate oversight; (5) capability to complete an independent assessment of the technology; and (6) the number of successful capabilities that are actually transitioned to the warfighter.  

MEASURABLE OUTCOMES:  Metrics include: all JCTDs will deliver products within 12 months to enable assessment for project continuation; 50 percent of JCTDs will provide an operationally-relevant prototype within 12 months and 75 percent will complete final demonstration within 24 months of Implementation Directive signature.  JCTDs will spiral products and deliverables during the demonstration.  At least 75 percent of JCTD projects will transition products to Programs of Record (PoR), sustained residual operations, or availability for procurement from the GSA Schedule.

Transition Achievement:  The JCTD program has been achieving actual transition rates in excess of the stated goal.  The JCTD Program defines transition as a project’s product or products going to new or existing PoRs and/or providing residual products sustained in direct support of operations that satisfies a specific requirement, or procurement availability on GSA Schedule.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Warfighter’s today rely more and more on communications networks to support and enable actions from targeting and shooting weapons to video-conferencing.   Though military basic infrastructure capabilities follow the mainstream commercial internet, for many reasons (security, mobility, and robustness), commercial telecommunications especially commercial wireless (tactical edge) communications are not well-matched with the requirements of today’s warfighter.  These trends will continue as the military data load becomes more diverse and heavy.  The National Research Council’s Network Science Report (2005) and Army Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET) JASONS Report (January 2006) state that the type of networking projected to meet military tactical requirements is not supported by network theory, network design nor analysis tools.  These tactical edge technology challenges cut across all warfare domains (space, air, ground, and sea).  In response to recognized technical problems today, as well as anticipated problems in the future, this research will focus on two key problems in networked technologies: 1) the need for expanded wireless reach where no communications infrastructure exists, and 2) the need to create ways to manage diverse wireless communications load and heterogeneous network types.  Airborne Network Gateway will expand the wireless communications and networking reach for the tactical force in the form of an airborne network gateway capability.  Network Communications Analysis will establish the scientific foundations for military tactical mobile networking with a specific emphasis on the integrated network management of tactical networks.  This research will provide the technical basis to standardize the implementation of military network communications capabilities in the areas of airborne network gateways and network communications analysis across the military services, Joint Staff, Office of the Secretary of Defense, and defense agencies.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Tactical Mobile Networking - As studies have suggested, for instance, the National Research Council’s Network Science Report (2005) and Army Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET) JASONS Report (January 2006), the type of networking projected to meet military tactical requirements is not supported by network theory, network design, and analysis tools.  This research will define those technical parameters important to military tactical mobile networking environments, investigate the status of network design and analysis tools, and evaluate how modeling and simulation is conducted to support tactical mobile networking environments.  The role of network experimentation with respect to network modeling will be explored.  Further development and analysis will be conducted to improve the awareness of the condition of tactical mobile networking technologies.  Design tools, architectures, and technical approaches will be recommended to acquisition programs as a result of this research.  
  
Network Management Tools and Analysis - Network management in the commercial world is a highly organized, synchronized activity that has excellent tools to monitor activity and repair disrupted networks as needed.  These same tools are ill-matched for management in the wireless world, and specifically for military tactical mobile networking.  In addition, the military tactical mobile networking environment lacks the infrastructure (connectivity) and support (helpdesk) because resources (spectrum, people, and equipment) are scarce (not in harm's way).  As the complexity of networking grows and as network capabilities are introduced, improved network management is required.  For military operations, assured delivery may be needed for specific information and operations.  This requires management tools to be in place to ensure continued secure and robust operations, which is not achieved with commercial wireless technologies.  This research will assess network management tools in place for the military tactical mobile networking environment and develop technology and tools to address shortfalls with the goal to transition technology to operational systems.   
  
Spectrum Management Tools and Analysis -  For wireless, tactical mobile networking, the management of the use of spectrum effects network operations.  The demand for spectrum is increasing due to the expanded use of sensors, imagery, and voice.  This demand increases the pressure on the limited shared radio frequency (RF) spectrum for military tactical networking.  The current Department of Defense (DoD) frequency planning and management infrastructure will have a limited ability to cope with this demand through operational planning, Coalition Joint Spectrum Management Planning Tool (CJSMPT) Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (JCTD), and the Global Electromagnetic Spectrum Information System (GEMSIS).  Advanced spectrum management concepts such as sense and adapt, spectrum sharing, and dynamic reallocation are under investigation but not yet mature support operations.  This research will evaluate opportunities for more efficient and effective use of the frequency spectrum within DoD.  Technology advances are expected to advance the concept of cognitive radio and cognitive antenna devices to sense and adapt operations based on spectrum policy and usage, the management of multi-band and multifunction apertures, and the use of spectrum efficient waveforms for use in military environments.  This research will develop the models and tools to demonstrate capabilities for operational planning and monitoring of spectrum as these technologies are introduced.  
  
Integrated Network Management Capability - Network management becomes more complex as more and different types of networking capability become available.  Integrated network management across heterogeneous systems, especially wireless systems, requires definition, design, and development.  Operationally, network management assumes all functions required to share networking resources and ensure proper operation for participants.  This research will define integrated network operations tools for all aspects of network resource management and to prioritize across operational spectrum management, security management, network management, and information management.  This research will also develop test beds especially to validate models and simulations used to develop and test network management tools, and conduct experimentation on approaches developed. 

Networked Communications Analysis Open Call –  A percentage of the Networked Communications Analysis funding will be dedicated to supporting new research initiatives in this technical area.  Each fiscal year, a request for proposal is sent out with specific technical focus area and evaluation criteria for each project.  The proposals are graded by a peer review team who score each proposal based on predetermined criteria.  Proposals are then selected based on total score.

Tactical Networking Evolution and Expansion – Fielded and about-to-be-fielded tactical networks can be vastly expanded and evolved from their current capabilities by developing and applying new techniques (or existing techniques developed in basic research) to the existing systems, providing modern capability to the warfighter without the large expense to the DoD of developing new systems.  This research will focus on developing and applying new DoD specific techniques to create leap-ahead approaches to Anti-Jam resistance of tactical networks, larger, more fully exploited networks, and expanded capabilities for signal/data processing and data compression in radios and across the networks.  This research will take advantage of new software defined radios about to be fielded by the Department, as well as focus on the existing legacy systems, using the successful approach we developed when fielding the Netted Iridium capability.

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>The Joint Data Management program will be restructured in FY 2012 to evolve into the revised Data to Decisions program that addresses challenges from the Quadrennial Defense Review and Combatant Commanders. This revised program builds on the FY 2010 and FY 2011 accomplishments with increased objectives and technology development goals critical to on-going operations. This Data to Decisions program focuses on information management architecture needs located at the seams between ongoing Service research efforts.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>A critical element in nearly all defense missions is the Decision Support System, which manages the accumulation of important data and provides tools to help commanders and other operational leaders make relevant decisions. These “Data-to-Decision” systems have become increasingly more important as our operations have shifted from large-scale force-on-force engagements to asymmetric conflicts. Terrorists and insurgents are deeply buried within local populations and employ operational concepts that blend in with urban clutter. Subsequently, finding these asymmetric targets has driven an explosion in sensing capabilities and modalities. This exponential growth in sensing volume has so stressed our current technologies that the majority of data now collected is thrown away.  Additionally, because the targets are diffuse and rapidly adapt to countermeasures, there has been a rapid proliferation of decision support systems. At last count, the Research &amp; Engineering Database had over 388 references to Decision Support programs.

The goal of this program is to develop an Information Open System Architecture (IOSA) that provides a common platform for rapidly developing and integrating new Data-to-Decisions systems. This IOSA will be based on a canonical decision support architecture and support a physical infrastructure for multi-source data management as well as user-driven innovation tools for analytics. The data management infrastructure will provide easy access and management of current and emergent data sources through plug-and-play modules. Data will be contextualized, indexed, conditioned and intelligently stored with approved formats to allow rapid search and retrieval of tactically relevant data sets. The effort will integrate existing analytics tools, and develop applicable new ones where gaps exist. A library of analytic tools will be built and research into end user programming methods will support new innovation models that mimic commercially successful products. The program consists of both applied research and technology development efforts focused on solving challenge problems each year with spiral developments to a prototype system.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Joint Data Management (JDM) program will be restructured in FY 2012 to become a more encompassing Data-to-Decision program. This Data-to-Decision program builds on the FY 2010 and FY 2011 accomplishments with objectives and technology developments critical to on-going operations. The JDM program is described below and included two tasks as outlined in the accomplishments/planned program section.

As the Department of Defense increases the capability and capacity to generate increasing amounts of data from numerous sensors in the battlespace, the issue of handling very large data sets has become more challenging. This is in part due to Department of Defense response to a changing threat environment where there is an expansion of the types of sensors deployed, new types of information collected, and different features used to classify these new threats. From a technical perspective, data creation speeds have outpaced the speed and ability to transport, store and process the data created. Science and technology (S&amp;T) investigation into new and novel ways to manage and exploit this data is required to more efficiently use sensor assets and effectively use information in a timely fashion.

This advanced technology demonstration program establishes the demonstration and experimentation environment to conduct independent evaluations of research efforts that have the most potential of minimizing the impact of the increasing amount of information available and required to support military operational decision-making. The intent is to leverage existing research investments within defense S&amp;T and provide proper evaluations and assessments to facilitate technology transition. These objective assessments will be conducted and coordinated across the defense research base and with other parts of government to include Director, National Intelligence and Department of Homeland Security. 

The new Data-to-Decisions program builds on the JDM program by focusing on the development of open-architecture technologies for decision support systems to help reduce future development time and cost of data management, analytics and user interface subsystems. The program will use a spiral development model with four-steps. Each year Operational teams will choose a series of cross-service challenge problems dominated by a specific sensing modality. Representative data for each of those problems will then be collected for testing against that problem. A Development team will design algorithms and data management architectures using high-level languages and self test on controlled data sets to address those challenge problems. Independent assessment will occur with sequestered data sets, but each development tool will also be tested against new sensors not included in the self-testing to determine fragility and applicability. A Transition team will host the developed algorithms as services in a spiraling prototype system that will support rapid prototyping and transition. 
   
The Applied Research program concentrates on the Development portion of this collaborative effort, while the Advanced Technology Development program focuses on the infrastructure piece. This piece includes an Operational, Assessment and Transition initiative.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The immediate technology problem common and necessary to all the challenge missions is robust tracking of objects. The focus this year was on developing a set of tools to assess progress on vehicle tracking.
- Unclassified and Classified existing Wide Area Motion Imagery (WAMI) and Ground Moving Target Indication (GMTI) data sets were gathered and prepared for use by the development team to build advanced trackers. Methods to declassify data sets were investigated for use by the academic members of the consortium. These methods include traffic simulators and detection-derived data sets.
- The sanitization effort created options for methods to “sanitize” an experimental dataset and reviewed the legal/security approvals required to make the data public releasable.
- Hosted two Analysis workshops to focused on challenge problems, data, and metrics to define end to end assessment methodologies.</r2:Text>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Biometric technology is revolutionizing critical military operations by providing the warfighter with the ability to verify an individual’s claimed identity; and, when combined with additional intelligence and/or forensic information, establish an unknown individual’s identity, which strips away his anonymity.  These emerging technologies provide Department of Defense (DOD) warfighters and commanders with an important capability that supports such missions as base access, force protection, maritime intercept and counter-piracy operations, counterintelligence screening, humanitarian assistance, and displaced persons management.  Additionally, the biometrics and identity information collected during DOD missions are shared with the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of State, and the Department of Justice, to support homeland defense, law enforcement, and other national interests.  

In Oct 2006, the Deputy Secretary of Defense designated the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD(R&amp;E)) as Principal Staff Assistant (PSA) for biometrics, followed in April 2011 with the designation of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (USD(AT&amp;L)) as the PSA for forensics.  The PSAs for biometrics and forensics have the responsibility to fully address and exercise control over all facets of the Department’s biometrics and forensics programs, initiatives, and technologies.  A central role of the Biometrics and Forensics Program is to support each respective PSA in addressing the technology gaps that preclude our ability to quickly and accurately identify anonymous individuals who threaten our interests and provide the ability to attribute enemy activity to a specific individual.  

The Biometrics and Forensics Program develops an annual comprehensive science and technology (S&amp;T) plan and implements multiple projects to advance capabilities in both biometrics and forensics.  This S&amp;T plan includes a portfolio of emerging technologies that will support the evolving capabilities required by the commanders and warfighters in ongoing and future military operations.

                                    <r2:Description>The Tactical Analysis of Video Imagery (TAVI) system is a real-time video analysis, face recognition, and human activity recognition system.  People detected near the same time and in the same area can be connected by the software, and these connections are analyzed with social network analytical tools to determine the affiliations of the monitored people.  The payoff is to produce a system deployable at Forward Operating Bases (FOB) which will be supported by two wide-area surveillance cameras mounted on portable masts to look at an overview of the area, as well as four pan/tilt/zoom (PTZ) cameras mounted on rugged tripods at the corners of each FOB.  The wide-area and PTZ cameras work together to provide automated tracking and face recognition of observed targets at distances up to 40 meters.  In addition, two long range, manually controlled cameras are provided for extending facial recognition range to 100 meters. The outcome of this project is  a stand-off force protection capability and operational test data to inform future investments.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>This project discovered novel biological recognition elements, specifically DNA and/or RNA oligomers known as aptamers, that bind with high specificity and sensitivity to molecules of interest.  Several different platforms were investigated at the Air Force Research Laboratory to convert this binding event into optical and electrical signals which allowed for implementation into a handheld sensor.  The primary output of this project is to deliver a selection method for aptamers that can be used to detect multiple chemicals and detection assays for multiple analytes, which have been examined with several platforms, as well as a prototype microfluidic field effect transistor sensor.  This will enable the development of a handheld forensic device capable of detecting trace levels of particular chemicals. </r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>This project developed a hand-portable mass spectrometer device for the detection of explosives, chemical weapons agents, illegal drugs, gunshot residues, and other toxic and hazardous chemical compounds.  This significant reduction in size enables the warfighter to conduct chemical forensic analysis on site, and eliminates lengthy delays and costs from transporting samples back to laboratories.  Of note, this project was formally known as Desorption Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometer (DESI) but was changed due to improvements in the technical approach.  This effort delivered four miniature mass spectrometer systems and provided documentation and performance information. The primary output of this effort is a system that enables operators the ability to quickly determine whether suspect chemicals are derogatory or not and take appropriate actions.  Such actions could include performing tactical questioning of the person in possession of the derogatory chemicals, in order to gain sufficient tactical information to conduct follow-on military actions against other members of the same network. </r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>This project is researching the use of an optical dual-wavelength speckle imaging technique to capture fingerprints.  The Speckle Imaging for Fingerprint Technology (SIFT) enhances ridge details in fingerprints by optically sensing periodic variations in the surface slope in the neighborhood of ridges.  SIFT leverages a low-power, eye safe laser beam to scan the finger and detect the ridges.  The innovative use of a laser allows for contactless capture of the fingerprint as opposed to traditional fingerprint sensors, which must be in contact with the finger.  The outcome of this effort will provide a proof-of-concept for 10 meter stand-off fingerprint capture.  Non-contact fingerprint scanning technology will improve force protection at DoD installations by making the process of fingerprint collection and identification faster and easier for the end user while avoiding long lines. </r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>This project evaluated, selected, and internally validated an automated liquid handling system and sample tracking software capability.  This technology is being used for casework applications within DOD DNA labs and has the potential to save 1,800 man-hours annually, while also improving test reliability by reducing the possibility of human error during sample preparation and processing.  This effort produced an assessment and recommendation for implementing two systems for automated DNA handling.  The outcome of this project is technology that should save 1,800 man-hours annually at each location the technology is implemented, while also improving test reliability by reducing the possibility of human error during sample preparation and processing. </r2:Description>

                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Defense Biometrics and Forensics Science &amp; Technology (S&amp;T strategy) is to annually assess biometric and forensic technology gaps in the Department's combined S&amp;T portfolio, and sponsor projects that help close those gaps.  These projects are designed to advance immature technologies and deliver a prototype.  This strategy was initiated in FY 2008 concurrent with the first year of funding, and the first five projects each delivered prototypes in October 2009.

In FY 2011, eight projects were completed with prototype or final product delivery.  Six projects were focused on biometrics and transitioned to the Army as the Executive Agent for Biometrics.  Two of the projects were focused on forensics and were transitioned to the Army as the Executive Agent for Forensics.  Additional development will be required for these prototypes prior to selection for production.  The Biometrics transition rate of 100% for FY 2011 exceeds the 30% benchmark established by DOD Strategic Objective 4-2D.

In addition, project performance metrics specific to each effort are identified in the project plan, and individual project success will be monitored through these metrics.  The metrics include items such as target dates from project work break down schedules, production measures, production goals, production numbers and demonstration goals and dates.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Our military forces require resilient, reliable networks and computer systems to conduct effective operations.  However, the number and sophistication of threats in cyberspace are rapidly growing, making it urgent and critical to improve the cyber security of Department of Defense (DoD) networks to counter those threats and assure our missions.  This program focuses on innovative and sustained research in both cyber security and computer network operations to develop new concepts to harden key network and computer components, design new resilient cyber infrastructures, increase the military’s ability to fight and survive during cyber attacks, disrupt nation-state level attack planning and execution, measure the state of cyber security, and explore and exploit new ideas in cyber warfare for agile cyber operations and mission assurance. 

The Cyber Advanced Technology Development program element is budgeted in the advanced technology development budget activity because it will focus on the maturation of successful applied research results and their development into demonstrable advanced cyber capabilities.  The Cyber Advanced Technology
Development program will build on results of matured applied research from the Cyber Applied Research (0603668D8Z) and other programs to develop technology demonstrations for potential transition into capabilities that support the full spectrum of computer network operations.  These approaches will include moving from cyber defense to cyber resilience by changing the defensive terrain of our existing digital infrastructure, identifying ways to raise the risk and lower the value of attack from an advanced, persistent cyber threat, and focusing on mission assurance. 

This program focuses on integrating computer network defense and computer network operations, addressing the advanced persistent threat, and filling DoD technology gaps as determined by assessments conducted by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research &amp; Engineering (OASD(R&amp;E)) over the past year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Human Social Culture Behavior (HSCB) Modeling Program is a vertically integrated effort to research, develop, and transition technologies, tools, and systems to programs of record and users in need. The Program exists to optimize U.S. forces’ ability to perform population-centric sensing, understand behaviors driven by social and cultural variables, and take effective courses of action in the full range of military operations. Program research enhances intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities for understanding the Irregular Warfare environment and meeting the challenges of instability and violent extremism. Under three integrated program elements (PEs), the Program conducts applied research, matures and demonstrates advanced technology, and develops transition-ready components and prototypes. Work under PE 0603670D8Z is focused on developing and demonstrating general-use, cross-domain tools in two areas: computational modeling; and sociocultural behavior data collection, management, and dissemination. Research results in more effective cultural understanding in existing intelligence, influence operations, and operations planning systems; modeling capabilities for forecasting reactions to U.S./coalition actions; demonstration of strategic decision making tools that highlight political, religious, cultural, and related factors; tools and technologies enabling more widespread and effective use of sociocultural behavior models in operations and mission rehearsal; and toolsets that can be used as strategic decision making tools to account for sociocultural factors.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Defense-wide Manufacturing Science and Technology (DMS&amp;T), established within the Manufacturing Technology Program directed in Title 10 USC Section 2521, provides the Department with a comprehensive manufacturing program to achieve the strategic goals of focused technology, improved acquisition across the life cycles, and cost-effective logistics.  By designing for manufacturability early in development, anticipated results will have an impact on increasing reliability and decreasing the life cycle burden of weapon systems. The mission to anticipate and close gaps in defense manufacturing capabilities and drive significant system life cycle affordability benefits makes DMS&amp;T an increasingly important leveraging tool in the current budget environment.
			
DMS&amp;T will: 1) address manufacturing enterprise game-changing initiatives that are beyond the scope of any one Military Department or Defense Agency or platform and, 2) establish and mature cross-cutting manufacturing processes required for transitioning emerging technologies which impact the time lines, affordability, and productivity of acquisition programs and shorten the deployment cycle times.
			
The DMS&amp;T program is fundamental to a coordinated development process.  Concurrent development of manufacturing processes with the S&amp;T development enables the use of emerging technologies.  Key technical areas for investment for DMS&amp;T include Advanced Electronics and Optics Manufacturing, Advanced Materials Manufacturing, and Enterprise and Emerging Manufacturing.  Advanced Electronics and Optics addresses advanced manufacturing technologies for a wide range of applications such as sensors, radars, power generation, switches, and optics for defense applications.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The DMS&amp;T program has a two-pronged approach: 1) technology initiatives and 2) specific single projects.  Technology initiatives, in collaboration with the Joint Defense Manufacturing Technology Panel (JDMTP) and industry, identify and develop investment strategies to advance the manufacturing processes needed to support the specific technology.  Above-the-shop-floor investments focus on new manufacturing processes that have potential to significantly improve manufacturing efficiencies. Single specific projects address investment opportunities not associated with selected technology initiatives and enable the program to respond to urgent, compelling manufacturing needs and provide seed funding to more high risk-high payoff technologies.
 			
Data calls are launched through two methods to identify technology initiatives and single specific issues requiring investment.  One method is through the JDMTP.  The JDMTP is comprised of the ManTech Directors from the Services, Defense Logistics Agency, and Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD).  The call is distributed through the ManTech Directors to the four JDMTP sub panels: Metals Processing and Fabrication Subpanel, Composites Processing and Fabrication Subpanel, Electronics Processing and Fabrication Subpanel and Advanced Manufacturing Enterprise Subpanel. Potential candidates are evaluated by the JDMTP based on criteria set forth in the call and announcements and down-selected for further development prior to final selection.  The other method is through Broad Agency Announcements to industry.  Priority is given to investments that support affordability and producibility of critical enabling manufacturing technologies that cut across multiple platforms.  Investments also balance defense priorities in specialty materials, electronics, propulsion and power, and manufacturing processes including "above the shop floor" (lean and business technologies facilitating interoperable manufacturing).  Final projects are selected by the OSD ManTech Director, considering input from the JDMTP and Director of Manufacturing, and as approved by Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense, Manufacturing and Industrial Base Policy (MIBP).  Technology initiatives and projects are executed at the Component level.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The IBIF programs all serve to address key defense-wide manufacturing science and technology issues, with the additional requirements of addressing surge and/or diminishing material source issues.  In addition, these programs have a clear transition path with implementation on a current platform or one undergoing acquisition targeted to be within 2-3 years of project completion.  The following areas of investment were selected for funding and enable advanced manufacturing production improvements for transparent armor, stealth technology, targeting systems and other key joint defense technologies:

•Adaptive Machining – to develop part measurement technology for direct measurement on the tool surface and/or during machining 
•Automation of Non-destructive Evaluation – to develop automated analysis methods for assessing part quality at reduced labor time and cost
•Electro-optical Targeting System Producibility – to develop automated technology for the production of a targeting system, reducing cost and hand labor
•Low Observable Producibility – manufacturing scale-up for stealth technology materials
•Metals Direct Digital Manufacturing – to advance direct digital manufacturing for metallic structures, reducing lead times for critical parts
•Optical Windows – to improve manufacturing capabilities for large aluminum oxynitride (ALON) structures for transparent armor and airborne sensors 
•Supply chain Technical Data Package – to increase the ability for smooth operation of the defense industrial base supply chain
•Connecting American Manufacturing – to create a national-level, integrated framework to enable rapid, high-density, multi-sector brokering between buyers and US suppliers

Multiple platforms will benefit from these programs including joint light tactical vehicles (JLTV), mine resistant ambush protected (MRAP) vehicles, F-35, and the Zumwalt class destroyer (DDG-1000).

Broad agency announcements and requests for proposals sent to industry for the IBIF topics.  Most projects are in the final stages of procurement or have been awarded.</r2:Text>

                                    <r2:Description>Advanced Materials Manufacturing:
While current body armor is effective, it is too heavy for some threats, environments, and operations. Even a 10% reduction in system weight would significantly increase warfighter acceptance, mobility, agility, and endurance.  This effort will leverage prior DoD investments to mature three complimentary manufacturing technologies that will reduce body armor weight by 10% - 15% while improving ballistic performance and flexibility. Cost will be reduced 5% - 10% and cycle time will be reduced by 10X-20X. The project will mature three manufacturing technologies for lighter weight armor from a capability to produce the technologies in a laboratory to a capability to produce them in an environment representative of a production facility. The three technologies are: 1) Dissimilar Material Assembly Technology to integrate ceramic, polymer adhesives, composites, and other organic and inorganic constituents into a unified body armor system. 2) Co-consolidation processing, to reduce cost and cycle time for the production of composite material enabling 10% lighter armor while maintaining ballistic performance. 3) Multi-scale modification of ballistic ceramics and associated processes, which will include new additive processes and metallic substrates to improve ballistic integrity and manage adverse shock events due to ballistic impact.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Advanced Electronics Manufacturing:  
This effort will apply an existing radar system already in production to satisfy a low-cost, open-architecture radar requirement for the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) program. This program will reduce the cost of the current radar system by ~20% and fit into the existing TRS-3D top side and below decks available footprint. The open architecture configuration will allow upgrades for new technologies over the lifetime of the program as well as offer lower cost via open competition for the radar’s building blocks. Finally, the plastic packaging effort as a part of this program will have a direct impact on the Volume Search Radar (VSR) on CVN-79 – creating an additional $1M/hull cost savings for the Navy (a total of $51M). Manufacturing technology improvements will have a direct impact on the rate and quantity of this capability delivered to current operations. This effort will provide the Navy with the first truly open architecture radar solution that will be able to accommodate different MMIC technologies, Line Replaceable Unit (LRU) technologies, processor, and power supplies from multiple vendors.  The system will use fiber optics to enhance radar performance, resulting in faster antenna rotation rates (enabling more exposure of targets) and greater flexibility in location of below-desks equipment (allowing a lower center of gravity and thus improved ship stability).</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Advanced Electronics Manufacturing:  
Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems require precise timekeeping even if the Global Positioning System (GPS) is unavailable. The size, weight, power, and cost components of conventional atomic clocks are too high for tactical applications. Chip Scale Atomic Clock (CSAC) provides improved long-term frequency stability that gets integrated into long-term time accuracy. The focus of this project is to leverage DARPA investments in the CSAC technology to reduce operational costs and transition beyond custom fabrication of the current CSAC.  Objectives include improving the existing batch manufacturing processes such as atomic cell filling, cell sealing, physics package assembly, and sub-system testing to reduce the “touch hours” required for CSAC assembly and testing. Development of a network of multiple vendors to foster competition and ensure a viable supply base is a complementary goal. Current manual assembly processes can produce CSAC in small quantities with low yield at high cost ($8,000 / unit).  The DMS&amp;T funding will enable producibility at an affordable cost ($100 – 300 / unit). Successful performance will enable an environment of continued operation of critical C4ISR systems, regardless of the presence or absence of GPS. The ability to rapidly reacquire GPS military code in a hostile Electro Magnetic Interference (EMI) environment is an additional targeted benefit.  </r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Title>Fiber Placement of Out of Autoclave Composites </r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>Advanced Materials Manufacturing:
An alternative to the traditional use of autoclaves in the production of large carbon fiber composites is Out-of-autoclave (OOA) processing, which uses far less expensive ovens.  Fabrication of large carbon fiber composite parts is limited by the small number of existing large autoclaves that are currently tied up with Boeing 787 and F-35 production.  In addition, the high capital cost of buying large autoclaves is prohibitive.  The ability to use less expensive ovens, coupled with the use of resins at lower cure temperatures, will allow more suppliers to enter the market and fabricate a greater number of larger carbon fiber composite parts at lower costs.  The initial phase of this project focused on the development of the fiber placement process.  The goal is to demonstrate the lay down rates required to meet projected fabrication rates of quality laminates with autoclave-equivalent mechanical performance.  Candidate aircraft for this technology are: Air Force/Army Joint Future Theatre Lift (C-130 successor) – 180’ wingspan and 140’ fuselage; National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Ares V - 33’ diameter; Navy P-8 Raked Wing Tip.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Advanced Materials Manufacturing:
This effort addresses limitations of conventional sintering processes.  Conventional sintering takes from hours to days in a sintering oven, and the beneficial characteristics of nano-structured materials are lost when the material is sintered.  Field Assisted Sintering Technology (FAST) is a new technology that has the potential to dramatically reduce cycle time and manufacturing costs, and to maintain the beneficial characteristics of nano-structured materials. The FAST process passes a pulsed direct current through the part while it is pressed in a die, and the combination of rapid heating and compressive loading results in fine grained, fully dense materials in short processing times that are not possible with conventional sintering processes. Many parts that are made with a powder press and sinter process are candidates for FAST, but this project will focus on ceramic body and vehicle armor, tungsten kinetic energy penetrators, infrared windows, heat sinks for electromagnetic propulsion cooling, and hypersonic and high temperature for enhanced performance jet propulsion. The project will mature the technology, resulting in reduced cost and cycle times for conventional materials, and higher performance for nano-structured materials.</r2:Description>

Current F-35 Electro-Optical Targeting System (EOTS) and Electro-Optical Distributed Aperture System (EODAS) focal plane arrays (FPAs) are vulnerable to jamming and damage from enemy lasers.  In addition, these FPAs are suffering manufacturing yield and cost issues.  This effort will leverage prior and concurrent DoD investments to make manufacturing improvements that incorporate laser protection technology into the FPA’s Read-Out Integrated Circuits (ROICs) while concurrently reducing ROIC defects and cost, and increasing size and yield.  The TRL will increase to 6 and the program will demonstrate the capability to produce a prototype in a production environment. The goal is to transition laser-hardened FPAs in time for the F-35 Block 5 Upgrade.  These technologies are applicable to any Medium Wavelength Infrared detector, including those on tactical and reconnaissance sensor systems.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Advanced Electronics Manufacturing:  
High performance infrared (IR) focal plane arrays (FPAs) are grown on Cadmium Zinc Telluride (CZT) substrates that are currently only available in relatively small wafer sizes (6cm x 6cm) from a single foreign source. This effort will leverage prior and concurrent Department of Defense (DoD) investments to enable a domestic source to manufacture 12cm x 12cm CZT substrates. The results will be reduced cost and assured availability of CZT substrates that will enable affordable, high performance ground and air IR sensor systems with rapid wide area search, long range ID, and dual band multispectral aided target detection capability against difficult targets while on-the-move.  Large, affordable CZT substrates from a domestic source will initially transition on FPAs for the 3rd Gen FLIR Engine Engineering Manufacturing Development program, to be followed by multiple transitions to other DoD weapon systems including the Army’s Common Sensor Payload, Air Force’s High Stare, Missile Defense Agency’s SM-3 Programs, and also rapid Prototype Systems (LRAS3) to be deployed in theatre.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Advanced Materials Manufacturing:
There is a strong need to fabricate timely and affordable aerospace structures in a production environment for rapid fielding of materials and systems to serve the defense manufacturing base.  An example of a system that could benefit from direct part manufacturing (DPM) is one in which there are multiple, complex, embedded systems, such as air flow control actuators within an inlet duct.  This demonstration will involve design, fabrication, testing and analysis of performance, manufacturability and maintainability.  Other designs such as conformal lattice structures, with high strength and low mass, are highly advantageous for micro air vehicle designs, but may only be successfully manufactured using methods such as direct digital manufacturing.  </r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Advanced Electronics is a series of efforts addressing advanced manufacturing technologies for a wide range of applications such as sensors, radars, power generation, switches, and optics for defense applications.  These efforts will provide significant productivity and efficiency gains in the defense manufacturing base.  These manufacturing technologies will accelerate delivery of technical capabilities to impact current warfighting operations, and manufacturing technologies to reduce the cost, acquisition time and risk of our major defense acquisition programs.

One significant issue is the need to move toward lead-free electronics.  However, current methods to produce lead-free solder create further issues such as the formation of unwanted tin whisker structures, which can cause electronics to short out.  The Tin Whisker Mitigation project will demonstrate controlled grain structure in soldered joints and plated surfaces.  The objective is to show significantly reduced or completely prevented tin whisker growth, while maintaining the original performance characteristics of the test components.

Another emerging manufacturing technology undergoing development is for Silicon Carbide High Efficiency Power Switches to enable a new class of power electronics that allows flexible new architectures at higher voltages, higher frequencies, less volume / weight, higher temperatures, higher efficiency (reduced fuel consumption), and better power quality for PEO GCS and the AMDR Radar Power Conversion Module.

Future efforts will focus on advances in fuel cells, radars, conformal sensors, and solder free electronics.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Overwatch is an overarching ground capability development effort which seeks to leverage technology and new concepts to fill ground combat and interagency capability gaps.  It contains multiple initiatives seeking to cultivate and leverage emerging technologies and concepts to counter the current and future challenges characteristic of the irregular warfare environment.  Projects are oriented toward increasing war fighter effectiveness on the battlefield and/or the development/enhancement of “whole of government” irregular warfare capability.
  
The capability development effort furthers interagency capabilities by pursuing concept experimentation/validation, interoperability enhancements, and command and control development.  Ground capabilities focus on command and control, force protection, situational awareness, and networked, cooperative engagement.  These solutions include completed operational assessments, equipment prototypes, or validated concepts which can be used to inform and drive formal procurement processes and/or policy decisions.

                                    <r2:Description>As a complement to the Stiletto dedicated maritime demonstration vessel, the Maritime Irregular Warfare portfolio investigates and develops irregular warfare capability gaps in the maritime domain.  Recent projects conducted by RRTO have highlighted a significant gap in maritime capability against non-traditional challenges, which this portfolio addresses.  Stiletto is a maritime demonstration platform designed to assist in the rapid transition of technologies applicable across the range of military operations to higher Technology Readiness Levels.  The 88-foot long boat is an experimental, all carbon fiber craft originally built to explore the scalability of non-mechanical dynamic lift, composite carbon fiber construction, and high-speed performance for military operations.  The craft was purposefully designed to rapidly acquire, deploy, and employ new capabilities to explore the military utility of emerging technologies and concepts of operation for special and expeditionary forces.  Both the craft and its systems were designed to be flexible, modular, and re-configurable to enable near “plug-and-play” installation of C4I equipment used as part of experimentation.

The Stiletto program, managed in partnership with the Naval Surface Warfare Center’s Combatant Craft Division and the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division’s Warfare Innovation Cell, streamlines the experimental process and helps facilitate the rapid demonstration, exploration, and risk reduction of emerging technologies and capabilities.  The craft’s simple application process for experimentation is intended to provide low cost access for industry, government and academic organizations to install and prove their systems in a realistic maritime environment.  The demonstration process also encourages system developers to engage directly with the warfighter in the maritime environment to rapidly adapt technologies around warfighter needs.  The Stiletto vessel is homeported in Norfolk, Virginia.

                                            <r2:Text>The Maritime Irregular Warfare Portfolio explores the development of counter evolved non-state capabilities such as semi and fully submersible vehicles and swarms, countering unmanned swarms, maritime non-lethal weapons systems, and low cost littoral fire support, among other capabilities.  Within that context, NAUTICUS is a new FY 2012 effort to non-invasively identify contraband materials such as explosives or illegal drugs being transported by maritime vessels underway. Stiletto will continue to serve as a maritime demonstration platform.  Increase in funding reflects the development of the maritime domain irregular warfare capability development portfolio.  For Stiletto, the intent is to expand the number of opportunities for non-traditional businesses that have not worked with DoD to utilize Stiletto as a low cost, accessible demonstration venue to enter the defense support realm.  Priority will be given to demonstrations that directly assist an acquisition program.  Specific focus for demonstrations will be on evaluating unmanned systems capabilities; sensors; launch and recovery; and human factors.  Stiletto plans to participate in the Trident Warrior operational experiment in FY 2012 as a “control ship” for multiple unmanned autonomous vessels.  Additional opportunities will be sought to assist the Combatant Commands (COCOMs) and services in experiments and exercises, as well as in demonstrating state-of-the-art capabilities in anticipation of future needs.</r2:Text>

                                    <r2:Title>Hybrid Airship</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>In conjunction with the NASA-Ames Research Center the USAF Research Laboratory, and U.S. Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM), the Department has undertaken a hybrid airship project  which is a non-deployable technology demonstrator that integrates independent technologies into a single, rigid aeroshell variable buoyancy (RAVB) air vehicle.  The project will demonstrate the technical maturity of a scalable vertical takeoff and landing aircraft.  Key technologies to be demonstrated include a buoyancy management system to enable ballast-independent operations, composite lightweight rigid external structure to reduce environmental restrictions, a responsive low-speed/hover control system with associated control algorithms, and a ground handling subsystem to enable operations on unimproved landing surfaces.

The program objective is to mitigate long-term technical risk by integrating and demonstrating a suite of technologies with the potential to reduce operational constraints on future heavy-lift, buoyant-aircraft development programs.  If successful, the prototype will enable the rapid development of a nascent class of air vehicle which will radically reduce the energy use per ton-mile of airlift operations, permit high-payload operations directly into and out of austere regions with little infrastructure, and enable long-endurance manned or unmanned air operations.

RAVB aircraft appear to be potentially scalable to payloads of 500-1,000 tons (compared with payloads in the 125-ton range for the largest current U.S. cargo aircraft).  With cruise speeds of 80-100 knots, RAVB aircraft could surpass by several times the speed of fast sealift.  With the potential to operate from land or water with very little infrastructure, RAVB aircraft may also drastically reduce the need for intermodal transportation as cargo moves from origin to point of need, with corresponding reduction in delivery times.

Using a two step process, the project has been reduced to a four year program.  Step one, in FY 2011, consisted of Assistant Secretary of Defense (ASD) Research and Engineering (R&amp;E) providing an additional $6.000 million to the program (new total FY 2011 $14.000 million) to fund acceleration of the actions needed for early completion.  These actions consisted of finalizing vehicle design, analysis, and subsystem prototyping/testing.  Step two of this process was to roll some of the requested FY 2013 funding ($5.000 million) into FY 2012 to fund systems integration and construction plus ground and flight testing.  This project is an interagency effort between the Department of Defense, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Ames Research Center, and the USAF Research Laboratory.

                                    <r2:Title>Thunderstorm</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description> Thunderstorm is an enduring multi-Intelligence technology demonstration venue for the Office of the Secretary of Defense, interagency partners, Combatant Commanders, Services, academia, government laboratories and commercial vendors.  It provides participating partners with an opportunity to evaluate and assess the capabilities of new and emerging Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconaissance (ISR) technologies and related information collection, processing, exploitation, and dissemination (PED) capabilities prior to full-scale operational employment.  Within this context, as many as four multi-intelligence technology demonstration opportunities per year can be conducted in mission-related, geographically and operationally relevant areas where the effectiveness of offensive and defensive capabilities of evolving ISR architectures, emerging technologies and transformational concepts can be tested and evaluated.  DoD, other government organizations, international, commercial and academic partners can demonstrate new, legacy and emerging detection, cueing, monitoring, tracking and handoff ISR technologies in real-world and simulated scenarios.  Thunderstorm technology demonstrations lend themselves to developing enduring interagency ISR information sharing tactics, techniques, procedures and collaboration tools and developing scenarios, using multi-Intelligence engagement, which minimize in-theater or on-site information processing, exploitation and dissemination (PED) requirements to advance remote PED capabilities for the DoD and interagency partners.  Using Thunderstorm demonstration objectives, performance measures, lessons learned, and post-demonstration assessments and data evaluation, ISR operational and architectural improvements are developed and codified.</r2:Description>

                                            <r2:Text>In FY 2012, funding supports the planning and execution of the Thunderstorm Spiral 5.0 technology demonstration.  Execution of this summer 2012 spiral in the Rio Grande Valley Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Sector will leverage DHS/CBP involvement as well as Joint Task Force North (JTF-N) and Joint Inter-Agency Task Force-South (JIATF-S) in supporting roles.  The Rio Grande Valley was chosen for this spiral because it offers multi-Intelligence demonstration opportunities against land, air, sea and littoral scenarios.  These scenarios serve to challenge ISR assets in multiple domains and will highlight the strengths and weakness in each.  

In the Spring of FY 2012, a related, but less complex Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) technology demonstration called Bluegrass will take place.  The objective of the Bluegrass exercise is to amass large urban/suburban data sets using ISR/wide-area motion imagery sensors tracking designated actors and use these data sets with known or “ground truth” information to develop and improve urban/suburban wide-area motion analysis techniques for the DoD, agencies and industry.

Using Thunderstorm Spiral 5.0 demonstration objectives, performance measures, lessons learned, and post-demonstration assessments and data evaluation, detailed plans will be developed to complement current operational challenges.  Thunderstorm Spiral 5.1 will return to the Rio Grande Valley to employ lessons learned in FY 2012 and improve the tactics, techniques and procedures using more complex scenarios to improve sensor capabilities, data integration, and processing, exploitation, and dissemination capabilities.

Results of the FY 2012 Bluegrass demonstration will be used to determine follow-on activities for this effort.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Joint Robotics Program/Autonomous Systems program supports the technology development activities of the Joint Ground Robotics Enterprise (JGRE) with a focus on the development of subsystems and components, and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and/or tests in simulated environments. Projects deliver advanced technology with direct relevance to enhancing war fighters' capabilities that have been identified during operational assessments and field feedback of current unmanned systems.  By exercising its oversight role through a Technology Advisory Board, O-6 Council and Senior Steering Group (Flag level), Joint Ground Robotics applies this program to enable coordination between the Services and places emphasis on interoperability and commonality among unmanned ground systems.  The primary purpose of this program is to support efforts to overcome technology barriers in the thrust areas of unmanned ground system technologies to include Autonomous &amp; Tactical Behaviors, Manipulation Technologies, Collaborative Operations, Interoperability, Man-portable Unmanned Ground Systems, and Technology Transition/Transformation.  Development and integration of technologies within the thrust areas of unmanned ground system technologies will expedite technology transition from the laboratory to operational use.  The technologies are generally at Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) of three or four with the intent to mature them through JGRE efforts to TRL six.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:Text>1)  Natural Human Robot Interface - This effort involves the development of a natural human-robot interface that eliminates the need for bulky platform-specific controllers (OCUs) that are operator intensive, with minimal dependence upon robot-specific hardware.  The Natural Human-Robot Interface (HNRI) can control both a mobile platform and one or more highly dexterous (six plus DOF) manipulators.  This project is expected to start in FY 2012.
2)  Distributed Control &amp; Data for Small Unmanned Ground Vehicles - Distributed control and data sharing for EOD small UGVs will increase capabilities of EOD technicians during tactical operations.  The majority of EOD missions require two EOD technicians to safely and effectively carryout tactical procedures.  One of the EOD technicians operates the UGV, while the other technician (the lookout EOD technician) observes the mission from over the shoulder of the UGV operator.  The distributed control and information capability will provide the lookout EOD technician with independent control and data from the UGV visual sensors.  This capability will reduce time on target and increase mission effectiveness by evenly distributing tactical tasks between the EOD team members.  This project is expected to start in FY 2012.
3)  Non-Radio Frequency (RF) Communication for Small Unmanned Ground Vehicles - This project will research, develop, and evaluate alternative methods to RF communications small UGV.

     -  Track technologies will be combined with state-variable information describing the mission to determine the proper supporting behavior for the robot under    the current conditions, somewhat analogous to the synergistic interaction of a hunter and a bird-dog
     -  A non-obtrusive human-robot interface will be developed that will allow the Warfighter to employ the same equipment currently used to communicate with other Warfighters in order to interact with the UGV to supervise or modify its behavior if needed, thus obviating the need for a dedicated OCU

                                            <r2:Text>1)  Highly Dexterous Manipulators for Explosive Ordnance Disposal Robots - The purpose of this project is to develop a Highly Dexterous Manipulator that approaches the dexterity of a human and is targeted for use on a small EOD UGV with a total vehicle weight (including the manipulator) of 164 pounds.  The manipulator is to be capable of performing bimanual tasks as required in the Capability Development Document (CDD) for Advanced Explosive Ordnance Disposal Robotic System (AEODRS).  The direct benefit to the Warfighter is increased performance and capability over the current state-of-the-art which will translate into reduced mission time.

2)  Modular Point to Manipulate - Robot manipulators on current configured EOD robots are predominately controlled one joint at a time.  This type of control makes it difficult for the robot operator to precisely control the position of the manipulator, increasing operator workload and the time it takes to complete the EOD ssion.  In order to assist the robot operator in performing manipulation tasks, point to manipulate technology will be developed.  With point to manipulate technology, the robot operator simply identifies an object within a video feed on the control unit, and the manipulator automatically moves into position for further inspection and manipulation.  The design of the point to manipulate technology, both hardware and software, will focus on a modular design that can be easily ported to different robot platforms with different manipulators.  The design will also focus on providing a compact and lightweight package using low-cost parts, such that even inexpensive lightweight platforms can benefit from the technology.  This project is expected to start in FY2012.
3)  On-Board Shock Tube Dispenser - The purpose of this effort is to develop an On-Board Shock Tube Dispenser (ORSTD) for robotic platforms that allows for greater maneuverability of the platform, a reduction of the operator’s time on target, more inclusive searches of the target area, and a reduction in the amount of shock tube that must be transported.  The ORSTD will allow the robot operator the flexibility to stage a counter charge on-board the MTRS prior to proceeding down range initially making more efficient use of the on-board firing circuit, and would not require the robot to be tethered to the command post.  The ORSTD would provide a reusable spool for shock tube that would enable connection of counter charges to the on-board robot firing system, a designated payload area to carry the counter charge reachable by the robot manipulator, and an automatic cutter for separating the robot from the shock tube once the charge has been initiated.

                                            <r2:Text>1)  University Support and Outreach - This project provides support to develop our future engineers in the field of robotics at Universities through two separate events/avenues.  Support to the Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition allows the event to take place each year up at Oakland University in Rochester Michigan. 
Design and construction of an Intelligent Vehicle fits well in a two semester senior year design capstone course, or an extracurricular activity earning design credit. The deadline of an end-of-term competition is a real-world constraint that includes the excitement of potential winning recognition and financial gain. 
Support to the United States Air Force Academy allows a senior design team to work on systems designed to fulfill the anti-tunnel capability by performing ISR in cave environments where weapons and/or high value targets are located.  The project employs five to ten cadets from USAFA, graduate student(s) (likely from the 
University of Texas (UT) at Austin), faculty advisors from both USAFA and other universities, as well as engineering mentors/sponsors.  Execution of the project design effort involves creative and well established engineering design methods used in both education and industry.  A specific focus for this project is to 
investigate creative design solutions that have not been previously used.
      -  Supported the Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition and provided judging for the Joint Architecture for Unmanned Systems challenge as well as the autonomy challenge.
2)  SBIR Fast Track - Current cargo pallet on-load/off-load operations are rate-limited by availability of manpower and pallet handling equipment at both garrison and contingency airbases. As such, steps to move to an automated cargo handling system are necessary.
      -  Fabricated and built a prototype system, and demonstrated requirements of objective and description above
      -  Developed Engineering Design Package
      -  Developed a plan for system demonstration
      -  Conducted system demonstration
      -  Prepared demonstration report 
3)  Cost Benefit Analysis - This study will provide the Department of Defense with an independent cost benefit assessment of the potential effects that robotic systems could have on force structure, focusing on manpower savings within several yet to be determined mission areas (logistics, convoy operations, demining efforts, combat operations, etc).  It is expected to start in FY 2012.
4)  Test &amp; Evaluation - As more and more Unmanned Ground Systems needs are being determined the number of programs of record for UGVs is increasing.  An issue that has been encountered across the UGV community is the minimal capabilities that the test community currently has for testing and certifying safety for these systems.  This effort will help to determine what the current capability gaps are and where the T&amp;E community needs to invest resources to fill those gaps.  This effort is expected to start in FY 2012.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:Text>1)  Adverse Environment Obstacle Detection - Much work has been done to develop the capabilities of UGV perception sensors for autonomous navigation, however the main advancements to date have focused on performance in a clear and unobstructed environment.  While various techniques using multi-sensor 
perception have shown the ability to extend the detection range of static and moving obstacles, in many cases the addition of dust, rain, snow, or fog in the local 
environment causes sensor performance degrading or complete failure.  This project will endeavor to answer the questions:  When do perceptual sensors fail, and why?  What combination of sensors would be appropriate for a given operational scenario?  Can perceptual sensor failure be reliably detected and mitigated?  This project is expected to start in FY 2012.
2)  Real Time Radio Modeling - The goal of the Real Time Radio Modeling for Robotics project for FY 2011 is to integrate and demonstrate the capability to perform tradeoff analysis of different radios and waveform technologies in performance of the tele-operation functionality in a simulated relevant mission environment.

These models can be updated and integrated into the Qualnet tool as needed to measure their performance on streaming video.  RS JPO is interested in evaluating COFDM performance on streaming         video
     -  Development of Common Data Link (CDL) Model 
     -  Development of Digital Data Link  (DDL) Model
     -  COFDM/CDL/DDL JTRS Comparison Analysis
     -  Integration of Building Properties of the systems into the model
3)  3D Mapping for Off Road Terrain - A real-time (20 Hz or better) 3D mapping and visualization system is needed to realistically field small UGVs that can operate and provide situational awareness in both indoor and outdoor environments. Most 3D mapping solutions for small UGVs are heavily stereo and visual odometry based, which present significant overload for computation and, in some cases, for illumination for nighttime performance.  Therefore, a lidar-based solution is solely proposed here, providing all of the following: 
     -  Day and night capabilities, with significant range in both indoor and outdoor conditions, including off-road environments 
     -  Operate in robust to complex, dynamic environments that are composed of varying objects such as indoor clutter, outdoor vegetation, etc. 
     -  Adaptable to varying 3D sensor fidelity and scalable to varying small UGV configurations 
     -  Output high-resolution 3D data capable of being streamed, rendered, and/or displayed in real-time within reasonable bandwidth constraints
     -  Implemented in a modular fashion with government-owned API’s to ensure 3rd party integration and comparison to new algorithms and sensors that become available in the future
4)  Negative Obstacle Detection - This project will be a focused effort to examine perception requirements and surveying the existing, new, and "coming soon" 
sensor systems. Based on that analysis, a development approach will be determined and executed to combine existing sensors, modify existing sensors, or 
develop sensors for this specific application. A large part of the project will be in developing the algorithms to fuse and utilize the selected combination of sensor.  This project is expected to start in FY 2012.
5)  Enhanced Traversability Analysis for Small Unmanned Ground Vehicles - This project will address the difficulty of small UGVs perceiving off-road environments, which inhibit them from reliably navigating in rough, vegetated terrain. A new class of sensors will be used to greatly improve small UGV traversability analysis and terrain classification. This project will fuse this data with camera imagery to provide enhanced information for better terrain classification. Typical obstacle detection/avoidance will be improved by allowing small UGVs to classify and thus navigate traversable objects, such as grass, brush, and vegetation that would otherwise be perceived as solid objects to avoid completely. The 3D geometry of the terrain can also be better analyzed from a perspective low to the ground, enhancing terrain analysis for off-road path planning.  This project is expected to start in FY 2012.</r2:Text>

Section 2901-2904) to address Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of Energy (DOE) environmental concerns.  It is conducted as a DoD program, jointly planned and executed by the DoD, DOE, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), with strong participation by other Federal agencies, industry, and academia.  SERDP`s objective is to improve DoD mission readiness and environmental performance by providing new scientific knowledge and cost-effective technologies in the areas of Environmental Restoration, Munitions Response, Resource Conservation and Climate Change, and Weapons Systems and Platforms.  SERDP does this by addressing high priority DoD environmental technology requirements.  SERDP enhances military operations, improves military systems` effectiveness, enhances military training/readiness, sustains DoD’s training and test ranges and installation infrastructure, and helps ensure the safety and welfare of military personnel and their dependents by eliminating or reducing the generation of pollution and use of hazardous materials and reducing the cost of remedial actions and compliance with environmental laws and regulations.  As a secondary benefit, SERDP helps solve significant national and international environmental problems.  The keys to a growing list of SERDP technological successes are the ability to respond aggressively and proactively to priority defense environmental needs; the pursuit of world-class technical excellence; and an emphasis on constant technology transfer.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The OSD Joint Warfighting Program (JWP) account supports two related activities supporting development of the Department's joint warfighting capabilities.  In anticipation of constrained military budgets, there will be increased demand for JWP support as Combatant Commanders will be under pressure to refine their requests for supplementary capabilities.  

The Joint Advanced Warfighting Program (JAWP) segment provides innovative, responsive and timely analytic support on joint capability development serving the needs of  Combatant Commanders.   It provides an independent source to examine potential remedies for mission  capability gapsand can establish a framework for subsequent field experiments, capability demonstrations or accelerated acquisition.   JAWP often represents the first effort to define alternative solutions across the range of Doctrine, Organization, Training, Material, Leadership and Personnel-Facilities.       JAWP resources underwrite a small dedicated staff of civilian military operation research analysts (currently hosted by the Institute for Defense Analysis - IDA).    Administered by the Joint Operations Support cell within OSD/AT&amp;L, the JAWP conducts an annual call for inputs from Combantant Command staffs elements  that formulate Capability Gap assessments and technology based initiatives .   Project selection is undertaken in consulatation  with the OSD staffs  serving AT&amp;L and Policy and with lements of the Joint Staff. 

The balance of JWP resources are dedicated to direct support of  joint commands with analytic resources to translate capability gap assessments into actionable military needs statements, identification of candidate solutions via experimentation, translation of solution concepts into field demonstrations, and remedy of joint capability gaps in partnership with Defense agents for doctrine changes and technology development.  JWP resources dedicated to direct support joint commands provides analytic expertise not normally allocated via formal staffing billets.   In this activity, JWP underwrites small grants to invigorate employment of experimentation and analysis, to formulate strategies to resolve joint capability gaps, and to stimulate participation in the Department enterprises for joint experimentation and joint capability development.   JWP resources also research and development of  tools supporting joint commander analytic efforts.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The OSD Joint Warfighting Program (JWP) account supports two related activities supporting development of the Department's joint warfighting capabilities.  In anticipation of constrained military budgets, there will be increased demand for JWP support as Combatant Commanders will be under pressure to refine their requests for supplementary capabilities.  

The Joint Advanced Warfighting Program (JAWP) segment provides innovative, responsive and timely analytic support on joint capability development serving the needs of  Combatant Commanders.   It provides an independent source to examine potential remedies for mission  capability gapsand can establish a framework for subsequent field experiments, capability demonstrations or accelerated acquisition.   JAWP often represents the first effort to define alternative solutions across the range of Doctrine, Organization, Training, Material, Leadership and Personnel-Facilities.  JAWP resources underwrite a small dedicated staff of civilian military operation research analysts (currently hosted by the Institute for Defense Analysis - IDA).  Administered by the Joint Operations Support cell within OSD/AT&amp;L, the JAWP conducts an annual call for inputs from Combantant Command staffs elements  that formulate Capability Gap assessments and technology based initiatives .   Project selection is undertaken in consulatation  with the OSD staffs  serving AT&amp;L and Policy and with elements of the Joint Staff. 

The balance of JWP resources are dedicated to direct support of  joint commands with analytic resources to translate capability gap assessments into actionable military needs statements, identification of candidate solutions via experimentation, translation of solution concepts into field demonstrations, and remedy of joint capability gaps in partnership with Defense agents for doctrine changes and technology development.  JWP resources dedicated to direct support joint commands provides analytic expertise not normally allocated via formal staffing billets.   In this activity, JWP underwrites small grants to invigorate employment of experimentation and analysis, to formulate strategies to resolve joint capability gaps, and to stimulate participation in the Department enterprises for joint experimentation and joint capability development.   JWP resources also research and development of  tools supporting joint commander analytic efforts.

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>The High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP) was transferred from the Office of the Secretary of Defense to the Department of the Army in FY 2012.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Today, the Department of Defense (DoD) faces many challenges.  The High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP) provides cost effective tools the Department needs to address the most difficult defense problems.  These tools include modern high performance computing hardware, parallel software, wide area networking services and the expertise to use them.  The HPCMP helps enable DoD personnel to:

-  Conduct basic research into areas such as materials, fuels, turbulence, proteins, electromagnetic fields, signal image relationships, structural response, blast effects, and combustion;  
-  Conduct applied research into areas such as aerodynamics applied to fighter and transport manned and unmanned aircraft; automated target recognition; hydrodynamics applied to new hull forms, structural performance of new armor and penetrator concepts; and explosives performance;
-  Design elements of weapon systems such as the Hellfire missile, F-35, Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicle, C-17, the Javelin missile, and directed energy weapons systems;
-  Test and evaluate weapons system performance on systems such as F-16, F-22, F-35, C-17, FCS, AIM-9X, GBU-39 and Striker;
-  Immediately support urgent operations for efforts such as counter Improvised Explosive Devices (IED), Hurricane Katrina related flood modeling, and the 2010 Gulf oil spill migration modeling.

High Performance Computing (HPC) has been identified as a key enabling technology essential to achieving the DoD's research development, test and evaluation (RDT&amp;E) objectives.  Validated requirements collected across the DoD reflect the needs of 4,400 scientists and engineers located at hundreds of locations (DoD Laboratories, Test Centers, academic institutions and commercial businesses).  The integrated HPCMP consists of DoD Supercomputing Resource Centers (DSRCs), the Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN), and Software Application Support.  DSRCs are responsible for as much of DoD`s RDT&amp;E computational workload as feasible.  DSRCs provide extensive capabilities to address user requirements for hardware, software, and programming environments.  Dedicated HPC project investments (DHPIs) augment the DSRCs to form the total HPCMP computational capability.  DHPIs address critical HPC requirements that cannot be met at DSRCs, such as real-time and near real-time computing requirements, and leverage significant HPC and mission expertise located at these remote sites.  All elements of the HPCMP are interconnected with all science and technology and test and evaluation user sites via the DREN.  DREN provides the flexible wide area network fabric needed by the RDT&amp;E community to support technology demonstrations and distributed test and evaluation events in addition to providing access to the supercomputing centers.  The Software Application Support component develops critical common DoD applications programs that run efficiently on advanced HPC systems, supports technology transition activities with academic and commercial institutions, trains users, and builds collaborative programming environments.  The Computational Research and Engineering Acquisition Tools and Environments (CREATE) produces supercomputer-based engineering design and test tools, improving the acquisition process for major weapons systems.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>The High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP) transferred from the Office of the Secretary of Defense to the Department of the Army in FY 2012.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Department of Defense (DoD) High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP) supports the needs of the warfighter for technological superiority and military dominance on the battlefield by providing advanced computational services to U.S. weapons system scientists and engineers.  By exploiting continuous advances in high performance computing (HPC) technology, the defense research, development, test and evaluation (RDT&amp;E) community is able to resolve critical scientific and engineering problems more quickly and with more precision.  The results of these efforts feed directly into the acquisition process by improving weapons system designs through an increased fundamental understanding of materials, aerodynamics, chemistry, fuels, acoustics, signal image recognition, electromagnetics, and other areas of basic and applied research.  As such, HPC has been identified as a key enabling technology essential to achieving the objectives of the DoD's RDT&amp;E.

The program primarily provides supercomputing services through DoD Supercomputing Resource Centers (DSRCs).   Additionally, support for specialized programs is provided through dedicated HPC project investments (DHPIs).  DHPIs support a one-time need and have no support tail within the HPCMP.  Centers and DHPIs directly support the DoD RDT&amp;E laboratories and test centers and are accessible to local and remote scientists and engineers via high-speed network access.  An integral part of the program is providing for the adaptation of broadband, widely used applications and algorithms to address RDT&amp;E requirements, along with continued training of users as new system designs and concepts evolve.  The program pursues continuous interaction with the national HPC infrastructure, including academia, industry, and other government agencies to facilitate the sharing of knowledge, tools, and expertise.

Annually validated requirements, collected across the DoD, reflect the needs of 4,400 scientists and engineers located at hundreds of locations (DoD Laboratories, Test Centers, academic institutions and commercial businesses), and help drive program decisions.  The integrated HPC program consists of DoD Supercomputing Resource Centers (DSRCs), the Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN), and Software Application Support.  DSRCs are responsible for as large a fraction of DoD`s science and technology (S&amp;T) and test and evaluation (T&amp;E) computational workload as feasible.  DSRCs provide extensive capabilities to address user requirements for hardware, software, and programming environments.  DHPIs augment the DSRCs to form the total HPCMP computational capability.  DHPIs address critical HPC requirements that cannot be met at DSRCs, such as real-time, and near real-time computing requirements, and leverage significant HPC and mission expertise located at these remote sites.  All elements of the HPCMP are interconnected with all S&amp;T and T&amp;E user sites via the DREN.  Additionally, the Software Application Support component develops critical common DoD applications programs that run efficiently on advanced HPC systems, supports technology transition activities with academic and commercial institutions, trains users, and builds collaborative programming environments.

True modernization of DoD`s HPC capability and fulfillment of the program's vision and goals requires an on-going program strategy that addresses all aspects of HPC.  While advancing the level of hardware performance is critical to success, the higher objective is to enable better scientific research, T&amp;E environments, and technology development for superior weapons, warfighting, and related support systems.  The Program goals are to (1) acquire, deploy, operate and maintain best-value supercomputers; (2) acquire, develop, deploy and support software applications and computational work environments that enable critical DoD research, development and test challenges to be analyzed and solved; (3) acquire, deploy, operate and maintain a communications network that enables effective access to supercomputers and to distributed S&amp;T/T&amp;E computing environments; (4) continuously educate the RDT&amp;E workforce with the knowledge needed to employ computational modeling effectively and efficiently; and (5) promote collaborative relationships among the DoD computational science community, the national computational science community and minority serving institutes.

The DREN provides wide area network (WAN) connectivity among the Department's S&amp;T and T&amp;E communities.  The DREN is implemented through an Intersite Services Contract awarded to MCI (WORLDCOM) during FY 2002.  A new DREN network services contract is planned to be awarded in FY 2011.  DREN currently provides services to sites throughout the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, and can be extended overseas where necessary.  A Secret DREN using common Secret systems high key with NSA certified Type-1 encryptors that can transport classified traffic at OC-3 (155 Mbps) has also been deployed.  The HPCMP employs state-of-the-art WAN security and strong host and user security creating a defense-in-depth security architecture.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Software is key to meeting the Department of Defense’s (DoD’s) increasing demand for high-quality, affordable, and timely national defense systems.  Systemic software issues are significant contributors to poor program execution, and reliance on software-intensive mobile and net-based products and systems has been increasing (e.g., Joint Tactical Radio System, DDG-1000, Joint Strike Fighter, F-22, and Army Modernization).  As stated in the 2010 National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences report entitled Critical Code, “It is dangerous to conclude that we are reaching a plateau in capability and technology for software producibility.”  The report notes that software is “…unconstrained by traditional physical engineering limitations…” and what we can accomplish is derived “…from [the] human intellectual capacity to conceptualize and understand systems…”  With growing global parity in software engineering, the DoD must maintain leadership to avoid strategic surprise.  The Software Engineering Institute (SEI) Program Element (PE) addresses the critical need to research, develop, and rapidly transition state-of-the-art technology and best practices to improve the engineering, management, fielding, evolution, and acquisition of software-intensive DoD systems.  The SEI PE’s program of work seeks to coordinate across the Department and the Services and leverages expertise in industry and academia to enable the development of Joint capabilities.

Software is more pervasive than ever, and computer programs are growing in size and complexity.  Designing, managing, and securing integrated, complex, and large-scale mission-critical systems are abilities that the DoD and Defense Industrial Base (DIB) have not yet been mastered.  P781 of this PE funds the SEI Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC).  The SEI FFRDC is an institute which enables the exploitation of emerging software technology by bringing engineering, management, and security discipline to software acquisition, development, and evolution, focusing on software technology areas judged to be of the highest payoff in meeting defense needs.

Private sector investment has created rapid advances in information technologies, but the pace of transition to DoD applications is often very slow or the commercial applications do not meet DoD-unique needs (e.g., high assurance software or large scale integrated systems). The DoD needs to create opportunities to discover emerging technologies, to evaluate their potential to fit DoD needs, and, where appropriate, conduct critical tests of the technologies under DoD conditions.  P783 of this PE includes the Software Producibility Initiative and Technology from Non-Traditional Sources (TNTS) Initiative.  The Software Producibility Initiative seeks to research and transition software science and tools to model and evaluate the performance and control complexities of software-intensive systems.  It also seeks to improve the design and sustainment of those systems.  The TNTS Initiative seeks to facilitate early interactions between innovative companies and DoD users to accelerate the application of emerging technical solutions addressing DoD needs, reduce development costs, avoid technological surprise, and understand how commercial developments impact DoD programs.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The SEI FFRDC was established in 1984 as an integral part of the DoD’s initiative to identify, evaluate, and transition high-leverage software engineering technologies and practices.  The SEI grows unique software research and program support capability in a space where the Defense Industrial Base (DIB) and academia cannot as readily address challenges.  The mission of the SEI is to provide technical leadership and innovation through research and development to advance the practice of software engineering and technology in support of DoD needs.  The Center works across government, industry, and academia to improve the state of software engineering from technical, acquisition, and management perspectives; engages in applied research and development of critical software technologies and tools, and collaborates with the larger software engineering research community; facilitates rapid, value-added transition of software engineering technologies into practice; and evaluates and calibrates emerging software engineering technologies to determine their potential for improving the development and evolution of software-intensive DoD systems.  Since its inception, the SEI has helped to transform the fields of software engineering and acquisition, network security, real-time systems and software/system architecture and construction, and software engineering process management.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Shortcomings in software development often lead to schedule slippage, cost growth, and mission compromise.  These shortcomings can frequently be traced to software development technologies which are not capable of addressing the scale and complexity of the software needed in today’s systems.  The Software Producibility Initiative seeks to conduct an integrated program of research from applied research through demonstration and evaluation to advance the state-of-the-art in the producibility of software for DoD systems, particularly those systems characterized by high complexity, need for robustness, information assurance, real-time performance, and physical distribution.  The Initiative maintains a portfolio of work relevant to the Warfighter and DoD needs by periodically evaluating technology development efforts, retiring those that are under performing, and starting new efforts based on a risk-reward priority list.

In addition, obtaining an early, accurate understanding of the technological advances emerging from small, innovative companies has been problematic for the DoD due to these companies often avoiding or failing to notice federal sales opportunities.  Redoing work that is being conducted in the private sector does not effectively utilize resources.  The Technology from Non-Traditional Sources (TNTS) Initiative identifies and selectively funds experimentation with innovative, emerging technologies to evaluate their potential for DoD application, with the ultimate goal of accelerating the delivery of capabilities to the Services and the Warfighter.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY 2013,  the Strategic Multi-Layered Assessment (SMA) project (P833) was inserted as a result of a functional transfer of resources and mission from United States Strategic Command (STRATCOM). 

The program increase from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is attributable to two major factors. 

In FY 2013, $16.000 million has been allocated to two new focal areas, within P828, related to Combatant Commanders, DoD and other Government Agencies concerns and requirements. The new focal area “Biometrics and Forensics” has been allocated $11.000 million to resource emerging technologies as DoD seeks to attribute enemy activity to specific individuals. The new focal area “Urban Characterization” has been allocated $5.000 million to resource development of intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR), electronic warfare, kinetic and other capabilities needed for future military operations in a wide range of urban areas. 

The remaining factor relative to the FY 2012 to FY 2013 increase reflects the restoral to baseline of a FY 2012 budget reduction and DoD's continued emphasis on QRSP's proven ability to expedite development and transition of new technologies to the warfighter. 

</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The QRSP Program supports five separate projects that provide rapid funding to expedite development and transition of new technologies to the warfighter.  The projects that are part of the QRSP are the Quick Reaction Fund (QRF), the Rapid Reaction Fund (RRF), the RDT&amp;E Architecture and Integration (RAI) program, Joint Rapid Acquisition Cell (JRAC) support, and Strategic Multi-Layered Assessment (SMA) support.  QRSP provides the flexibility to respond to emergent DoD issues and address technology surprises and needs within the years of execution outside the two-year budget cycle. 

P826:    Projects supported by Quick Reaction Funds (QRF) focus on responding to emergent conventional warfare needs during the execution years that take advantage of breakthroughs in rapidly evolving technologies.  Examples of the types of projects that are envisioned include:  force protection projects to enhance anti-access and area denial capabilities, and broad electronic warfare capabilities.  QRF focuses on maturing technologies critically needed for the combatant commands and produces prototypes or demonstrates capabilities for evaluation within 12 months. 

P828:    The Rapid Reaction Fund (RRF) objectives are to leverage the DoD science and technology base and those of the other federal departments; stimulate interagency coordination and cooperation; accelerate the fielding of capabilities and concepts to counter emerging threats; and provide feedback to the S&amp;T community to guide long term developmental strategies.  The RRF is executed by the Rapid Reaction Technology Office (RRTO).  RRTO works to anticipate adversaries' exploitation of new technologies and advanced capabilities and develop counters to those capabilities.  Additionally, the office works to leverage technology developed outside of DOD in the commercial sector, academia, international arenas and small, non-traditional businesses to expose them to specific DoD needs areas as identified by Combatant Commanders, Military Service organizations and other Defense Agencies and interagency organizations. The typical length of an RRTO program falls within a six to twelve month range in order to more effectively aid the warfighter. RRF consistently exceeds the transition objective of 30 percent for demonstration programs (DOD Strategic Objective 4-3).  

P830:    The RDT&amp;E Architecture and Integration program objectives are to enhance and expand Yuma Proving Grounds rapid technology assessment capability in general and to enhance the Joint Experimentation Range Complexes (JERCs) venue in particular.  This include:  improving the broad-spectrum of evaluations to include analysis of a cohesive Forward Operating Base (FOB) defensive architecture; emerging homemade explosives (HME); future Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs); counter IED capability development; and, characterization of evolving electro-magnetic environments.  These focal align under the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) focal area “Institutionalizing Rapid Acquisition Capability” and its third tenant “Assessing Alternatives and Executing a Solution (Acquisition).”

P831:  The Joint Rapid Acquisition Cell (JRAC) objectives are focused on responding to Joint Urgent Operational Needs (JUONS) that have been submitted by Combatant Commanders and validated by the Joint Staff.  The JRAC’s objective is to manage the delivery of capability as requested by the Combatant Command (COCOM) in a time frame acceptable to the COCOM.  The JRAC manages the overall effort to fulfill JUONS.  Efforts, in most instances, are conducted outside of the processes described for the Defense Acquisition System in DoD Directive 5000.1 and utilize contingency and other rapid acquisition authorities.

P833:  The objective of the Strategic Multi-Layered Assessment (SMA) Cell is to support all COCOMs, Joint Force Commanders and all other government agencies by assessing complex operational/technical challenges which require multi-agency and multi-disciplinary approaches.  With input from across the United States Government, academia and the private sector, the SMA cell develops solution options to COCOM generated challenging problems and informs the command’s senior leadership.  Each SMA effort is initiated at the request of senior COCOM leadership.  Products are typically produced within six months and directly contribute to the decision making process of COCOM’s senior leaders.

                            <r2:ProjectNote>The FY 2012 to FY 2013 increase reflects the restoral to baseline of a FY 2012 budget reduction and continued DoD emphasis on QRF's ability to address conventional, disruptive, catastrophic, and irregular threats. 
</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Quick Reaction Special Projects (QRSP) Program supports five separate projects that provide rapid funding to expedite new development and transition of new technologies to the war-fighter.  QRSP provides the flexibility to respond to emergent Department of Defense (DOD) issues and addresses technology surprises and needs that may arise outside the two-year budget cycle. 

Projects supported by Quick Reaction Funds (QRF) focus on responding to emergent conventional warfare needs during the execution years that take advantage of breakthroughs in rapidly evolving technologies.  Examples of the types of projects that are envisioned include:  force protection projects to enhance anti-access and area denial capabilities, and broad electronic warfare capabilities.  QRF focuses on maturing technologies critically need for the combatant commands and  produces prototypes or demonstrates capabilities for evaluation within 12 months. 

The QRF Program also provides Services, Components, Combatant Commanders and force providers opportunities to capitalize on technologies that are at a relatively high Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and to rapidly field-test promising new operational prototypes that can have immediate impact on military operations.  It should be noted that QRF initiatives are limited to those that will deliver a military operational prototype application within twelve months of being funded.  

The QRF program focuses on projects that have the potential to address conventional, disruptive, catastrophic, and irregular threats.  More specifically, initiatives that address the following interest areas:  Anti-Access/Area Denial,  Base Protection; Electromagnetic Bandwidth and Spectrum Enhancement; Persistent Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR); Newly Emerging National Threats; Directed Energy Capabilities; Low-Cost Precision Engagement Capabilities; Operational Field Demonstrations; Unmanned and Robotics Systems; Over the Horizon-Radar Technologies; and Counter-Electronic Warfare Technologies.

In FY 2012 and FY 2013 QRF will continue to identify and fund new projects that are best equipped to respond to critical operational needs and new technology opportunities.  Current and future efforts that show significant effectiveness can be leveraged by additional investments in order to accelerate transition of capabilities.

Although each project is unique, all QRF projects were monitored for schedule deviation and transition outcome, as well as for meeting reporting requirements.  Additionally, some projects were monitored for the delivery of additional deliverables, such as test reports, studies, components, and equipment.  Generic performance metrics applicable to the Quick Reaction Fund (QRF) includes attainment of DOD Strategic Objective 4-2D.  The title of this objective is "Speed Technology Transition Focused on Warfighting Needs" and the metrics for this objective is to transition 30 percent of completing demonstrations program per year.  For projects that were completed in FY 2011, the QRF achieved a transition rate of approximately 60 percent.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>In FY 2013, the RRF reflects the addition of two new focal areas related to Combatant Commanders, DoD and other Government Agencies concerns and requirements. The new focal area “Biometrics and Forensics”  has been allocated $11.000 million to resource emerging technologies as the department seeks to attribute enemy activity to specific individuals. The  new focal area “Urban Characterization” has been allocated $5.000 million to resource development of intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR), electronic warfare, kinetic and other capabilities needed for future military operations in a wide range of urban areas. 

The FY 2012 to FY 2013 increase reflects the above new focal areas, a restoral to baseline of a FY 2012 budget reduction, and  DoD emphasis on RRF's ability to address and anticipate adversaries' exploitation of new technologies and develop counters to those capabilities.
</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Quick Reaction Special Projects Program (QRSP) (Program Element 0603826D8Z) supports five separate projects that provide rapid funding to expedite the development and transition of new technologies or initiatives that support the warfighter.   

The Rapid Reaction Fund (RRF) (Project P828) is fully executed through the Rapid Reaction Technology Office (RRTO).  The RRTO was stood up to provide rapid response to enhance operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and other theaters in support of Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO); and, to accelerate the transition of high-potential science and technology projects into operationally useful products in the execution years.  RRTO leverages the Department of Defense (DoD) science and technology base and those of the other Federal Departments; stimulates interagency coordination and cooperation; accelerates the fielding of capabilities and concepts to counter emerging threats; and, provides feedback to the Science &amp; Technology (S&amp;T) community to guide long term developmental strategies.  RRTO anticipates adversaries' exploitation of technology, including available and advanced commercial capabilities.  In prior years, RRTO has explored methods and approaches of persistent surveillance stimulation for counterinsurgency; developed alternate power sources for sensors and systems; expanded human, social and cultural knowledge; increased small unit situational awareness; advanced the interface between law enforcement and military operations; developed biometrics and forensics capabilities; supported denied area operations; strategic multi-layer assessment; and, established an innovation outreach cell that is facilitating better interactions with small companies with emerging technologies that do not normally do business with the DoD.  In FY 2012 and FY 2013, RRTO will continue to explore new and emerging capabilities to support irregular warfare operations while working to support Under Secretary of Defense (Advanced Technology &amp; Logistics) (USD (AT&amp;L)) and the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering) (ASD(R&amp;E)) goals.  With project selection occurring during the execution year, potential focus areas for FY 2012 and FY 2013 Rapid Reaction Technology Office projects include:  Forward Operating Base (FOB) protection; persistent Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) architecture; ISR sensors; interface of law enforcement and military operations; biometrics and forensics; autonomous operations; data processing, exploitation and dissemination (PED); cyber security; exploitation of new and emerging cell phone technologies; support to border patrol initiatives; counter proliferation initiatives; capabilities to exploit denied areas; strategic communications and multi-layer assessments; and nontraditional approaches to leverage innovative businesses.  The typical length of a RRTO project falls within a six to twelve month range in order to more effectively aid the Warfighter.

CLOUDBREAK will demonstrate capabilities which can be provided as composable services on the Global Information Grid (GIG).  Success will be achieved when capabilities from multiple Programs of Record (PoR), JCTDs and other tools are reused by multiple COCOMs, based on common standards to meet changing needs.  The CLOUDBREAK campaigns will demonstrate existing mature capabilities in Cyber, Ops/Intel, Situational Awareness and Regional Domain Awareness that meet COCOM priorities.  </r2:Description>

Generic performance metrics applicable to the Rapid Reaction Fund (RRF) includes attainment of DoD Strategic Objective 4-2D.  The title of this objective is "Speed Technology Transition Focused on Warfighting Needs" and the metrics for this objective is to transition 30 percent of completing demonstrations program per year.  For projects completed in FY 2010 and FY 2011, the RRF achieved a transition rate of greater than 75 percent.

In FY 2012 and FY 2013, RRF investment decisions will be made during the execution year, to rapidly respond to combatant commander requirement and new threats/new opportunities.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The National Counterterrorism/Counterinsurgency Integrated Test and Evaluation Center (NACCITEC) at Yuma Proving Grounds consists of three Joint Experimentation Range Complexes (JERCs), which to date have been leveraged primarily to support development of counter Improvised Explosive Device (IED) technologies.  The JERCs, with additional investments, are capable of functioning as a venue for a much wider spectrum of evaluations designed to support the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) mandated development of an institutionalized “Rapid Acquisition Capability.”  The requested funding supports the development of a representative forward operating base (FOB) infrastructure designed to assess force protection systems and to support future rapid prototyping and rapid fielding initiatives.  This expanded focus into FOB defense technologies and to future threat and capabilities assessments will continue to be updated and enhanced as the threat evolves.  Potential focal areas include analysis of future homemade explosives (HME), future IEDs, counter IED capability development, characterization of future electro-magnetic environments and the integration of multiple sensors and weapons in a cohesive FOB defensive architecture.  This initiative aligns under the QDR focal area “Institutionalizing Rapid Acquisition Capability” and its third tenant “Assessing Alternatives and Executing a Solution (Acquisition).”</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

In addition, project completions and successes are monitored against schedules and deliverables stated in the proposals and statements of work. The metrics include items such as target dates, production measures, fielding dates, and demonstration goals and dates.  Generic performance metrics applicable to the RDT&amp;E Architecture and Integration initiative includes attainment of DOD Strategic Objective 3.5.2D.  The title of this objective is "Maintain a strong technical foundation within the Department's Science and Technology (S&amp;T) program"  and the metrics for this objective is to transition 30 percent of completing demonstration programs per year.  

In FY 2013, investment decisions will be made during the execution year, to rapidly respond to combatant commander requirement and new threats or new opportunities as they relate to technologies emerging from non-traditional sources.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Consistent with strategic guidance, the Joint Experimentation (JE) Program Element targets DoD’s highest priority experimental needs, defined by combatant commands and Services, and synchronizes development of relevant and actionable Doctrine, Organizational, Training, Materiel, Leadership, Personnel, Facilities, and Policy (DOTMLPF-P) solutions to enable trained, ready and adaptable joint and coalition forces and improve capabilities of current and future Joint Force Commanders.  The program is governed through the JCD&amp;E Executive Council, which is composed of generals, admirals, and members of the Senior Executive Service representing the combatant commands and Services.  The JE program is the key synchronizing program for a diverse portfolio of concept development and solution evaluation and validation focused on combatant command and Service problems defined in Integrated Priority Lists (IPL), Joint Urgent Operational Needs (JUON), and Warfighter Challenges (WFC).  In addition to defining the problems, the combatant commands and Services prioritize the JE program of work and are active partners in the execution, oversight, and governance of the efforts.  Partners also include a broad range of civilian agency, multinational, academic, and private sector partners.  When appropriate, state and local governments participate in the development of solutions.  Projects typically confirm critical joint mission capability gaps; identify potential remedies; explore a range of DOTMLPF-P solutions; and establish the best path to solving security challenges.   The JE program is the Department’s primary program to explore the connecting ideas and processes that cannot be solved by buying a new tool or creating a new acquisition program.  Experiments span a spectrum from early efforts to develop new joint operational concepts, to refinement of joint doctrine, to scenario-based examination of science and technology-based solutions, to validation of non-material solutions such as organization structure, new processes, improved training and education, and recommended policy changes.  By defining emergent shortfalls and exploring force enhancement options, JE serves as an early risk mitigation tool that precedes implementation of doctrine changes, capability demonstrations, acquisition investment decisions, and policy changes.  JE supports the development of projected mission critical capabilities through rigorous, objective assessment of enabling processes and technologies, identification of capability/system requirements and innovative employment of existing capabilities in the context of scenarios depicting current and projected Defense operations.  Combatant commanders and Services are the primary customers of projects funded by the JE Program, but through a whole of government approach, projects also provide collateral benefits to a wider Defense Experimentation Enterprise including Agencies and the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), intra-government, international and Non-Government Organization (NGO) partners.  The experiments funded by this program establish the path to resolve current joint warfighting deficiencies and lay the foundation for trained, ready and adaptive joint and coalition forces.  The Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research &amp; Engineering (ASD(R&amp;E)) within the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) provides oversight to ensure alignment with strategic guidance and emphasizes disciplined design and cost control of individual projects with meaningful results that can be assessed with metrics based on incremental force improvements.   The experimentation efforts in this program align directly to the Key Mission Areas (KMA) outlined in the February 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), the National Military Strategy, and the Secretary of Defense’s Efficiency Initiatives.  Flexibility will be maintained in the JE Program to address emergent requirements identified by combatant commanders and Services and will be prioritized by the JCD&amp;E Executive Council.  The Joint Staff J7 executes the JE program and leads the JCD&amp;E Enterprise.  The Joint Staff J7 works with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research &amp; Engineering (ASD(R&amp;E)) to provide responsive support to customers and partners.

The JE Program Element provides funding for the Department’s Joint Experimentation (JE) effort, carried out by the JCD&amp;E Enterprise, governed by an Executive Board composed of admirals, generals and Senior Executive Service members, and led by a JCD&amp;E Executive Agent.  The JCD&amp;E Enterprise includes the combatant commands, the military services, the National Guard Bureau, the Joint Staff, the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), and several Defense agencies.  Intra-government agencies and coalition partners often participate in JCD&amp;E processes and projects.  The JE program element focuses on producing validated concepts and solutions to combatant command and Service defined problems.  Important collateral benefits accrue to other members and partners in the extended experimentation community; much of the joint content in military "Title 10" wargames can be traced to coordination within the JCD&amp;E Enterprise.  To ensure the program focuses on needs of the warfighters, joint experiments originate from an annual call for nominations from combatant commands and Services, and from assessment of combatant command identified critical warfighting capability gaps articulated in combatant command Integrated Priority Lists and Joint Urgent Needs documents submitted, to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS).  JE nominations undergo preliminary analysis by the JCD&amp;E Enterprise to confirm suitability for experimentation, alignment to strategic guidance and, where feasible, to associate closely related subjects for economy of effort. The resultant list is termed Warfighter Challenges (WFCs), and constitutes experimentation efforts eligible for design and execution. These efforts are prioritized and approved by the combatant command and Service members of the Executive Council.  Experimentation plans are developed in consultation with JE partners, and consolidated into an annual program of joint experimentation, known as the JCD&amp;E Campaign Plan.  The Executive Council meets regularly to review and approve the progress of the efforts in the campaign plan.  The JCD&amp;E Campaign Plan allows the Department to synchronize experimentation efforts over multiple years to avoid duplication of effort and to create synergy among the defense experimentation entities.    
  
JE experiments and activities examine potential solutions for combatant command operational needs through targeted DOTMLPF-P improvements.  JE tackles joint concept and capability issues demanding sophisticated analysis, innovative design and complex execution.  JE addresses topics that would prove difficult for individual combatant commands and Services to capture in the context of their immediate operational and force generation responsibilities.  Experiments and efforts produce a range of outcomes inclusive of fundamental joint doctrine, inputs to major policy documents such as the Quadrennial Defense Review and the Defense Planning and Programming Guidance (DPPG). In partnership with the combatant commands and Services, JE mitigates operational risk by establishing procedural models to conduct emergent concepts like Irregular Warfare, Integrated Financial Operations and Joint Operational Access that are not yet instantiated in conventional force generation.  The results are briefed to Functional Capability Boards who integrate solutions into their functional investment plans.

JE examines joint concepts and develops exploratory concepts to describe how the Joint Force Commander will meet current and future security challenges, and explores joint capabilities required to execute those concepts.  To support the continued transformation of the joint force even while it is engaged in operations around the world, joint concept development applies historical precedents, lessons learned from current operations, and Defense planning scenarios, then studies the projected joint operational environment to lay the conceptual foundation for the future force.  After the current adjustment, a relatively stable investment projection for the JE Program drives aggressive efforts to derive greater return on investment for the DOD in the face of increasing demand for projects from combatant commands and joint experimentation partners.

Joint and Service experimentation are complementary efforts and require a unified approach.  Joint experimentation focuses on the needs of the Joint Force Commander, while Service experimentation enables the components the Joint Force Commander will employ.  Complementing the efforts undertaken by the JCD&amp;E Executive Agent (USJFCOM and/or successor organization), other combatant commands conduct Limited Objective Experiments (LOEs) to address operational capability gaps and support identification of potential solutions for theater specific and functional joint warfighter needs, as part of the overall JCD&amp;E campaign.  Within the process, the JCD&amp;E enterprise leverages Service wargame/experimentation to address joint challenges.   Experimentation activities are coordinated within the JCD&amp;E enterprise to cover gaps and pursue efficiency, and the results are shared throughout the enterprise.  The collaborative planning effort of the JCD&amp;E enterprise is intended to ensure coherent and transparent application of JE funds, joint context, and concepts capabilities are integrated into Service experimentation as appropriate.  

A biennial report captures activities across the Defense Experimentation enterprise activities to inform Congress of program execution and project accomplishments.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>In FY 2013, funds will be transferred to Joint Staff Accounts dependant on the Secretary of Defense approval of the governance plan.  The governance plan is still under review in the Department.

The department will make the appropriate notifications.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Consistent with strategic guidance, the Joint Experimentation (JE) Program Element targets DOD’s highest priority experimental needs, defined by combatant commands and Services, and synchronizes development of relevant and actionable Doctrine, Organizational, Training, Materiel, Leadership, Personnel, Facilities, and Policy (DOTMLPF-P) solutions to enable trained, ready and adaptable joint and coalition forces and improve capabilities of current and future Joint Force Commanders.  The program is governed through the JCD&amp;E Executive Council, which is composed of generals, admirals, and members of the Senior Executive Service representing the combatant commands Services.  The JE program is the key synchronizing program for a diverse portfolio of concept development and solution evaluation and validation focused on combatant command and Service problems defined in Integrated Priority Lists (IPL), Joint Urgent Operational Needs (JUON), and Warfighter Challenges (WFC).  In addition to defining the problems, the combatant commands and Services prioritize the JE program of work and are active partners in the execution, oversight, and governance of the efforts.  Partners also include a broad range of civilian agency, multinational, academic, and private sector partners.  When appropriate, state and local governments participate in the development of solutions.  Projects typically confirm critical joint mission capability gaps; identify potential remedies; explore a range of DOTMLPF-P solutions; and establish the best path to solving security challenges.   The JE program is the Department’s primary program to explore the connecting ideas and processes that cannot be solved by buying a new tool or creating a new acquisition program.  Experiments span a spectrum from early efforts to develop new joint operational concepts, to refinement of joint doctrine, to scenario-based examination of science and technology-based solutions, to validation of non-material solutions such as organization structure, new processes, improved training and education, and recommended policy changes.  By defining emergent shortfalls and exploring force enhancement options, JE serves as an early risk mitigation tool that precedes implementation of doctrine changes, capability demonstrations, acquisition investment decisions, and policy changes.  JE supports the development of projected mission critical capabilities through rigorous, objective assessment of enabling processes and technologies, identification of capability/system requirements and innovative employment of existing capabilities in the context of scenarios depicting current and projected Defense operations.  Combatant commanders and Services are the primary customers of projects funded by the JE Program, but through a whole of government approach, projects also provide collateral benefits to a wider Defense Experimentation Enterprise including Agencies and the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), intra-government, international and Non-Government Organization (NGO) partners.  The experiments funded by this program establish the path to resolve current joint warfighting deficiencies and lay the foundation for trained, ready and adaptive joint and coalition forces.  The Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research &amp; Engineering (ASD(R&amp;E)) within the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) provides oversight to ensure alignment with strategic guidance and emphasizes disciplined design and cost control of individual projects with meaningful results that can be assessed with metrics based on incremental force improvements.   The experimentation efforts in this program align directly to the Key Mission Areas (KMA) outlined in the February 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), the National Military Strategy, and the Secretary of Defense’s Efficiency Initiatives.  Flexibility will be maintained in the JE Program to address emergent requirements identified by combatant commanders and Services and will be prioritized by the JCD&amp;E Executive Council.  The Joint Staff J7 executes the JE program and leads the JCD&amp;E Enterprise.  The Joint Staff J7 works with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research &amp; Engineering (ASD(R&amp;E)) to provide responsive support to customers and partners.

The JE Program Element provides funding for the Department’s Joint Experimentation (JE) effort, carried out by the JCD&amp;E Enterprise, governed by an Executive Board composed of admirals, generals and Senior Executive Service members, and led by a JCD&amp;E Executive Agent.  The JCD&amp;E Enterprise includes the combatant commands, the military services, the National Guard Bureau, the Joint Staff, the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), and several Defense agencies.  Intra-government agencies and coalition partners often participate in JCD&amp;E processes and projects.  The JE program element focuses on producing validated concepts and solutions to combatant command and Service defined problems.  Important collateral benefits accrue to other members and partners in the extended experimentation community; much of the joint content in military "Title 10" wargames can be traced to coordination within the JCD&amp;E Enterprise.  To ensure the program focuses on needs of the warfighters, joint experiments originate from an annual call for nominations from combatant commands and Services, and from assessment of combatant command identified critical warfighting capability gaps articulated in combatant command Integrated Priority Lists and Joint Urgent Needs documents submitted, to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS).  JE nominations undergo preliminary analysis by the JCD&amp;E Enterprise to confirm suitability for experimentation, alignment to strategic guidance and, where feasible, to associate closely related subjects for economy of effort. The resultant list is termed Warfighter Challenges (WFCs), and constitutes experimentation efforts eligible for design and execution. These efforts are prioritized and approved by the combatant command and Service members of the Executive Council.  Experimentation plans are developed in consultation with JE partners, and consolidated into an annual program of joint experimentation, known as the JCD&amp;E Campaign Plan.  The Executive Council meets regularly to review and approve the progress of the efforts in the campaign plan.  The JCD&amp;E Campaign Plan allows the Department to synchronize experimentation efforts over multiple years to avoid duplication of effort and to create synergy among the defense experimentation entities.    
  
JE experiments and activities examine potential solutions for combatant command operational needs through targeted DOTMLPF-P improvements.  JE tackles joint concept and capability issues demanding sophisticated analysis, innovative design and complex execution.  JE addresses topics that would prove difficult for individual combatant commands and Services to capture in the context of their immediate operational and force generation responsibilities.  Experiments and efforts produce a range of outcomes inclusive of fundamental joint doctrine, inputs to major policy documents such as the Quadrennial Defense Review and the Defense Planning and Programming Guidance (DPPG). In partnership with the combatant commands and Services, JE mitigates operational risk by establishing procedural models to conduct emergent concepts like Irregular Warfare, Integrated Financial Operations and Joint Operational Access that are not yet instantiated in conventional force generation.  The results are briefed to Functional Capability Boards who integrate solutions into their functional investment plans.

JE examines joint concepts and develops exploratory concepts to describe how the Joint Force Commander will meet current and future security challenges, and explores joint capabilities required to execute those concepts.  To support the continued transformation of the joint force even while it is engaged in operations around the world, joint concept development applies historical precedents, lessons learned from current operations, and Defense planning scenarios, then studies the projected joint operational environment to lay the conceptual foundation for the future force.  After the current adjustment, a relatively stable investment projection for the JE Program drives aggressive efforts to derive greater return on investment for the DOD in the face of increasing demand for projects from combatant commands and joint experimentation partners.

Joint and Service experimentation are complementary efforts and require a unified approach.  Joint experimentation focuses on the needs of the Joint Force Commander, while Service experimentation enables the components the Joint Force Commander will employ.  Complementing the efforts undertaken by the JCD&amp;E Executive Agent (USJFCOM and/or successor organization), other combatant commands conduct Limited Objective Experiments (LOEs) to address operational capability gaps and support identification of potential solutions for theater specific and functional joint warfighter needs, as part of the overall JCD&amp;E campaign.  Within the process, the JCD&amp;E enterprise leverages Service wargame/experimentation to address joint challenges.  Experimentation activities are coordinated within the JCD&amp;E enterprise to cover gaps and pursue efficiency, and the results are shared throughout the enterprise.  The collaborative planning effort of the JCD&amp;E enterprise is intended to ensure coherent and transparent application of JE funds, joint context, and concepts capabilities are integrated into Service experimentation as appropriate.  

A biennial report captures activities across the Defense Experimentation enterprise activities to inform Congress of program execution and project accomplishments.

Description (JE Program):  The JE Program delivers relevant, sufficient, and necessary DOTMLPF-P comprehensive solutions responding to specific needs of Joint Force Commander articulated Warfighter Challenges.  Warfighter Challenges are DOD’s most important security challenges now and in the future; inform and are informed by strategic guidance; and address issues from the tactical to strategic levels of war.   From the perspective of OSD engagement and oversight, emphasis will be focused on the following refinements to influence the JE business model.

Refinements to the JE Business Model.
The JE program is executed through a global business model that is governed by a 2-Star Executive Council, operates on a 1 year cycle, supported by integrating technologies to close geographic gaps, standardized through systems engineering discipline, and progresses through formal enterprise decision making.  Lean principals are applied to enterprise, technical, and supporting processes to maximize program efficiency. The JE program continues to evolve with solution spirals included in experimentation efforts to drive affordable speed to capability.
   
The JCD&amp;E Enterprise strives to:
•	Trace JE efforts to discriminate changes to joint capabilities.
•	Tie JE closer to DoD operational analysis &amp; Defense Planning Scenarios.
•	Provide specific input to joint training and joint capability development to ensure adaptable joint forces.
•	Position joint experimentation in a larger scheme of overarching capability development that begins with lessons learned and critical analysis, enjoins experimentation tools, and progresses through demonstration, acquisition, and training.
•	Design experiments for more responsive deliverables through quicker starts, event-driven "go/no go" reviews, and incremental designs permitting faster "do-learn-decide" cycles for continued investment.

Analytical Rigor.
Increased emphasis has been placed on adherence to standards of analytical rigor in design, conduct, and exploitation of experiments.  Typical of this rigor is aligning the experimentation concepts to the Key Mission Areas specified in the Quadrennial Defense Review.  FY 2011-2012 experimentation efforts seek to provide innovative joint solutions and joint interoperability standards to address capability shortfalls identified by Warfighter Challenges conforming to the DoD Joint Capability Areas (JCAs) employed by the Department to validate joint needs.  The FY 2012 Warfighter Challenges mapped to six JCAs:  Building Partnerships, Battlespace Awareness, Command and Control, Force Application, Logistics, and Net-Centric.  No FY 2012 WFCs were submitted by the COCOMs or Services in the JCAs.  The JE enterprise is capable and prepared to accept Warfighter Challenges from all nine JCA’s and accepts emergent requirements throughout the year.     

Initiatives.
- Solution spin offs (spirals), are included in experiment design to identify affordable capability deliveries and increase speed to capability.
- Lean six sigma principals have been implemented for metrics based efficiency assessments. Achieved 46 percent improvement in contracting process, 26 percent cycle time or 17 percent cost reduction in enterprise process, and 31 percent reduction in experimentation conduct. - Integrated framework for Joint Experimentation.  Transparent decision-making, systems engineering thinking, and application of Lean management principles have been integrated into a technical framework for lifecycle management of the joint experimentation program. JCD&amp;E Enterprise members now submit WFCs with supporting technical information that promotes accelerated starts, spiral development and reduced costs and schedules for experimentation and concept development.
- Improvements to Networked Coordination.  Upgrade of the Virtual Operations Center (VOC) has enhanced Enterprise-wide participation during project planning and execution, decreasing travel associated with customer service and enterprise-wide coordination.  Increasing use of distributed experimentation design will allow geographically separated groups to join experimental projects from their home bases, again saving travel funds and increasing the potential partner base.  
- Increased integration with the S&amp;T community to address the science and technology element COCOM S&amp;T Integrated Priority Lists in JE, and to both include Joint Capability Technology Demonstrations (JCTD) in, and inform JCTD efforts through, experimentation to Increase speed to capability.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

(Joint Irregular Warfare ten concepts carrying into FY 2011 and US-Israel Hybrid Threat Seminar).
•  Planned and conducted the Joint Urban Wargame 2011 in order to determine the capability and capacity to systematically assess the critical functions, processes, and structures of an urban system and its embedded adversaries.  This includes identifying critical functions, processes and structures of an urban system and its embedded adversaries that must be understood to enable integrated planning and execution of military and non-military actions in an urban operational environment, and identify measures of success for military and non-military actions in an urban environment.
•  Partnered with NATO to wargame the “Military Support to Countering Hybrid Threats” concept in order to gain the NATO Military Committee’s endorsement of the concept and tasking to accomplish future work.</r2:Text>

                                    <r2:Description>The Joint Futures Group (JFG) is a unique DoD team specifically focused on identifying the next big challenges or opportunities for the joint force and Combatant Commanders that are not being addressed elsewhere in DoD.  It is a unique entity within DoD that utilize analytic and research processes integrates doctoral level future thinking and extrapolates likely future operational environments within which innovative ideas about challenges and military implications for the Department of Defense are generated.  The JFG integrates the results of its “futures” research into downstream processes for concept and development, experimentation scenarios, capabilities definition, doctrine, and inclusion in the majority of professional military education (PME).  Their unclassified professionally developed products are globally disseminated and inform every Service, Combatant Command and all of our multinational partners.  "We must focus concept development on the specific problems identified in the Joint Operating Environment or on identified gaps in doctrine…" – General Mattis

The objective of the JFG is to provide a vision of the future and support identification and articulation of joint force implications, through collection, analysis, synthesis, dissemination of the world's strategic and international relations futures.  The current means of articulation is the Joint Operating Environment (JOE) report. Unlike other classified DIA or JCS “future focused” documents the unclassified JOE provides the foundational problem statement for the CJCS’s Capstone Concept for Joint Operations (CCJO), and is intended to inform the development of Joint Operating Concepts and Joint Integrating Concepts, as well as to provide a framework for Combatant Command and Service LOEs and experiments through its vision of the future. The JOE has been downloaded globally well over two  million times in the past two years and is a key Combatant Command, Service and CJCS reference document on future challenges and opportunities.  Support to the DoD analytical agenda consists of improving and refining the classified Integrated Security Contexts (ISCs).  This dedicated analytical support ensures that the ISCs reflect a balanced and plausible set of future warfare challenges.

Set the “context” for the future fight.
•  Provided detailed input to support the development of products, papers and classified studies that support the DoD Analytical Agenda as it transitions to Support to Strategic Analysis.  Senior analyst  reviewed and refined OSD’s Integrated Security Contexts (ISCs) and Foundational Activities (FA) scenarios and participation in the Support to Strategic Analysis process; provided input to the Comprehensive Joint Assessment (CJA) and other policy and strategy “future focused” documents.
•  Researched, analyze, synthesized and promoted a vision of the future that includes critical analysis of battlefield innovation of disruptive technologies through partnership with Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), command and service intelligence, information dominance and national defense intelligence agencies. To this end, planned, coordinated, and executed international conferences focused as follows and provided DoD, JCS, Combatant Command, Service and Multinational attendee actionable white papers on:
•  Ideological Conflict over Global Networks “Winning the Global War of Ideas”
•  The Rise and Fragmentation of Great Powers: China
•  The Rise and Fragmentation of Great Powers: India
•  Specific and measurable outcomes include:
•  A clear statement of the future challenges and implications for the joint force that allows concepts to be developed to prepare for these challenges.
•  A set of alternative futures scenarios to guide focused scenario development for joint exercises and Combatant Command and Service LOEs and experiments.</r2:Text>

This effort will seed a team of about 5-10 analysts who will be responsible for identifying specific analytic limitations, developing the technical analysis plan, and implementing the plan.  These analyses will be acquisition-centered net analyses of the end-to-end blue (US and Allies) capabilities compared to specific red (potential adversary) capabilities focused on identifying the most promising technologies for application to A2/AD problems.  All of these analyses will address acquisition specific questions—can a system be accelerated?  Can a group of capabilities be combined in different ways to improve the overall effectiveness of US systems, and so forth.  This office is expected to work closely with the Joint Staff and the Military Departments and in particular with the Air Sea Battle Office. </r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>    The Test and Evaluation/Science and Technology (T&amp;E/S&amp;T) program seeks out and develops test technologies to stay in pace with evolving weapons technologies.  This program is critical to ensure that the Department of Defense (DoD) has the ability to adequately test the advanced systems that will be fielded in the future.  To meet this objective, the T&amp;E/S&amp;T program performs the following activities:
• Exploits new technologies and processes to meet important test and evaluation (T&amp;E) requirements.
• Expedites the transition of new technologies from the laboratory environment to the T&amp;E community.
• Leverages industry advances in equipment, modeling and simulation, and networking to support T&amp;E.
Additionally, the T&amp;E/S&amp;T program examines emerging T&amp;E requirements resulting from Joint Service initiatives to identify T&amp;E technology needs and to develop a long-range roadmap for technology insertion.  The program leverages and employs applicable applied research efforts from the highly developed technology base in DoD laboratories and test centers, other government agencies, industry, and academia to accelerate development of new test capabilities.  This program element also provides travel funds for T&amp;E/S&amp;T program oversight, special studies, analyses, and strategic planning related to test capabilities and infrastructure.
     The Secretary of Defense, in a memorandum dated April 19, 2011, established seven strategic science and technology (S&amp;T) investment priorities for fiscal years 2013-2017, specifically 1) Data to Decisions, 2) Engineered Resilient Systems, 3) Cyber Science and Technology, 4) Electronic Warfare/Electronic Protection, 5) Counter Weapons of Mass Destruction, 6) Autonomy, and 7) Human Systems.  The T&amp;E/S&amp;T Program has been re-aligned and reprioritized to prepare the T&amp;E community to test warfighting capabilities that emerge from these S&amp;T priority investments.
     The T&amp;E/S&amp;T program is funded within the Advanced Technology Development Budget Activity because it develops and demonstrates high payoff technologies for current and future DoD test capabilities.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>   High-speed/hypersonic weapons are being developed to ensure the continued military superiority and strike capability of the United States.  Current weapon system demonstrations and technology development programs include high-speed and hypersonic air-breathing missiles, maneuvering reentry and boost/glide weapons, hypersonic gun-launched projectiles, and air-breathing space access vehicles.  These systems require development of high-speed turbine, ramjet, scramjet, and combined cycle engines; high temperature materials; thermal protection systems; and thermal management systems.  In addition, important advancements are underway in systems such as conventional turbine engines and high-speed (supercavitating) torpedoes.
     In response to advances made in technologies to achieve prompt strike weapons, the Advanced Propulsion Test Technology project has been renamed to High Speed System Test (HSST) to address test technology needs beyond propulsion testing, including aerodynamic and aerothermal testing, so that the test community has the technology to support the required test scenarios for concepts under development in the science and technology (S&amp;T) community.  Furthermore, the technology development efforts within the HSST project have been re-prioritized to align to Secretary of Defense guidance on S&amp;T priority investments for FY2013-2017.  The HSST project is developing advanced test and evaluation (T&amp;E) technologies for ground test (both advanced propulsion and aerodynamic/aerothermal testing), for open-air range flight test, and for advanced computational tools, along with instrumentation and diagnostics systems that could be used both in ground tests and flight tests of high speed systems.
     The HSST project develops technologies to enable robust, accurate, and timely T&amp;E of these future weapon systems.  Department of Defense (DoD) acquisition regulations require weapon systems to undergo a thorough T&amp;E process to detect deficiencies early and to ensure system suitability and survivability.  However, the extreme environments in which these weapons operate preclude accurate determination of their performance with today’s T&amp;E assets.  Current national test capabilities have deficiencies in data accuracy, flight condition duplication and simulation, test methods, productivity, modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) fidelity, and range safety.
     The HSST mission is to provide test technologies that will enable high-speed and hypersonic weapon systems to be successfully developed through accurate, robust, and efficient T&amp;E.

                                            <r2:Text>   Significant advancements were made in ground test technologies for both air-breathing propulsion and boost/glide weapons, development of new flight test capabilities, demonstration of new instrumentation for ground and flight test, and release of new M&amp;S tools.
   Analysis and reporting were completed on the results of a scramjet engine test program conducted in a specially designed ground test facility showing, for the first time, effects of using “vitiated air” (air contaminated with the products of combustion) on the performance of a hydrocarbon fueled scramjet engine.  Current production ground test facilities can only create the high temperature inlet conditions necessary for scramjet engine tests by burning fuel in the airflow prior to entering the engine.  The resulting “vitiated air” has different gas properties than clean air which significantly affects the engine’s performance and introduces artificiality in the test environment and errors in predicted flight performance.  These landmark reports will improve the understanding of results from existing vitiated T&amp;E facilities, help explain flight test results, improve the accuracy of M&amp;S, and guide investments in future T&amp;E capabilities.
   Tests were also completed comparing the performance of identical engines in impulse and blow down aero propulsion facilities in order to quantify the accuracy of the different test methods.  The tests revealed significant differences, providing the T&amp;E community with important new information to guide future weapon system test plans.
   Two new technology developments were initiated to develop the test techniques necessary to accurately test large scramjet engines in our existing national facilities which would otherwise be deemed too small a scale for accurate measurements.  One effort will evaluate a means of truncating the long inlet section of an engine while still accurately replicating its performance.  The other effort will quantify and improve the accuracy of direct connect and semi-free jet test techniques by comparing them to a benchmark free jet test.  Collectively, all of the aforementioned technology developments will allow weapons system developers to maximize the use of our existing infrastructure and better understand test results, thereby reducing flight test and acquisition risks.
   The two key technologies necessary for revolutionary improvements to the accuracy and productivity of aero propulsion ground test are clean air heat addition (i.e. non-vitiated air) and variable Mach number test capability.  Component technologies for these desired capabilities were previously developed by the T&amp;E/S&amp;T program and are now being incorporated into a small scale, clean air, variable Mach number, aero propulsion test facility.  Integrating these technologies into an operational facility will complete their development to Technology Readiness Level 6, provide an on-going test asset to the DoD, and provide risk reduction for construction of a full scale facility.  Significant progress was made this year with the completion of all Phase I design work, fabrication of the heater’s pressure vessel, and initiation of production of the yttria-stabilized-zirconia heat storage bricks and the modifications required for integration into an existing host facility.
   Understanding ablation characteristics of thermal protection systems is critical for maneuvering reentry and boost/glide vehicles.  A new electrode design that increases arc jet facilities’ maximum enthalpy (available energy to simulate flight conditions) and run time, was successfully demonstrated this year allowing for more realistic tests of leading edge materials.  Additionally, a new test technique was established utilizing low temperature ablators in existing wind tunnels which do not achieve true reentry temperatures to determine the affect of ablation on vehicles’ stability and control and to provide data for validating ablation computer models.  Final tests in this technology development were successfully conducted at Mach 8 and 14 with a boost-glide vehicle nose tip.
   Advances in flight test technologies included advances in flight termination technology and flight maneuvers.  Hardware-in-the-loop testing and final design of a flight rated, autonomous flight termination system were completed.  The autonomous flight termination system is designed to assure destruction of an errant hypersonic vehicle if it leaves its designated safety corridor.  Advanced parameter identification maneuvers were designed, qualified, and programmed into the flight computer of the second X-51 flight.  These special maneuvers are designed to collect far more stability and control data per flight than possible using traditional methods thus reducing the number of flight tests and costs.
   Progress was also made in advanced high speed systems test instrumentation.  Fabrication of a flight-weight, laser-based, non-intrusive measurement system was completed for an upcoming flight test.  A similar laser-based system for ground testing was transitioned and is being used in a hypersonic wind tunnel.  Further advancement of this technology is being made by utilizing newly available lasers operating in the mid-infrared spectrum to significantly lower measurement uncertainties.  Design and fabrication of a miniaturized, temperature compensated wind tunnel balance specifically addressing a T&amp;E gap in supersonic store separation capabilities was completed.  Finally, testing of a fiber optic heat flux gauge was also successfully completed. 
   Investment in a state-of-the-art validated computational fluid dynamics tool culminated in release of an updated version to the hypersonic community that can simulate the complex flows within scramjet engines and includes physical modeling for turbulence, fuel-air combustion, and heat transfer.  The code was successfully used to model combustion phenomenon in a scramjet engine.

                                            <r2:Text>     FY 2012 will see continued efforts to improve hypersonic ground test capabilities to levels required for acquisition programs including demonstration of new flight test techniques, improvements in instrumentation, and continued validation/improvement of computational fluid dynamics codes.
   Scramjet ground tests in free jet, semi-free jet, and direct connect test modes will be conducted to quantify their respective accuracies and identify optimal test methods for larger, next generation scramjet engines.  Further vitiation effects data will be collected to increase the community’s knowledge base. 
   Phase I work to integrate advanced ground test component technologies into a clean air variable Mach hypersonic aero propulsion facility will be completed with the clean air heater being demonstrated to Mach 8 temperature levels.  Phase II work will be initiated including design of the variable Mach number nozzle and fabrication of components to vary set conditions.
Testing of improved arc jet facility electrodes will be completed enabling greatly improved T&amp;E of maneuvering reentry and boost/glide vehicles.  A technology for enabling propulsion testing beyond Mach 8 using magnetohydrodynamics to accelerate flow ionized by electron beams will be demonstrated.
   Advanced flight parameter identification maneuvers will be demonstrated during an upcoming X-51 test.  A flight-weight, laser-based, non-intrusive combustion gas analysis system will be demonstrated on a HIFiRE flight and development of a more accurate, mid-IR laser based system will continue.  Construction and testing of a miniaturized, temperature compensated wind tunnel balance for supersonic store separation will be completed.
   Validation and improvement of the computational fluid dynamics codes will continue, making use of the unique datasets obtained from the scramjet engines tests mentioned above.

                                            <r2:Text>   Continuing efforts in FY 2013 will be centered on completion of Phase II of the clean-air, variable Mach number development, including completion of the variable Mach number design and demonstration of clean air aero propulsion testing up to Mach 8.  This phase will culminate with demonstration of the technology to vary pressure, temperature, and enthalpy with fixed nozzles up to Mach 8 conditions.  Testing for vitiation, test methodology and scale effects will conclude and cumulatively provide the most extensive examination of hypersonic aero propulsion methods yet accomplished and will enable significant improvements in the quality of data provided to weapon system developers and computational fluid dynamics tool developers.  Work on a new mid-infrared non-intrusive flow measurement will conclude in FY 2013.
   New test technology efforts will be initiated addressing:  test technologies, techniques, and methodologies to determine full-scale propulsion system performance and operability from subscale tests; technology for continuous flow, clean air heat addition up to Mach 6 to enable full-scale, combined cycle, propulsion system test; further development of M&amp;S codes for accurate prediction of flow fields, boundary layer transition, and heat transfer in high-speed flow; new and more accurate instrumentation systems; and application of advanced test technologies to other needs such as gas turbine engines, electromagnetic rail guns, and supercavitating torpedoes.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription> Weapon systems have become drastically more complex in recent years, resulting in the need for significantly more data to be passed among these systems, and between the systems and our test infrastructure.  A vast amount of data must be collected, transmitted, and analyzed, which requires a large amount of spectrum resources.  However, the amount of radio frequency spectrum designated to support test and evaluation (T&amp;E) is decreasing, most notably due to reallocation for commercial use.  The combination of decreasing radio frequency spectrum and increasing data requirements results in an urgent need to create test technologies that maximize the use of spectrum resources for Department of Defense (DoD) T&amp;E operations.
   The L and S frequency bands are the traditional spectrum allotted for military use.  The explosive need for spectrum in the commercial sector has resulted in reallocation of portions of these bands to industry.  To compensate, DoD was authorized to use the C-Band spectrum which offers numerous benefits, including a three-fold increase in available bandwidth, but comes with technical challenges.  Most notably, our current test infrastructure for telemetry is not designed to accommodate C-Band.  Technologies are required to implement innovative techniques that efficiently extend our use of C-Band without a major overhaul to our national test infrastructure.  For instance, commercial telemetry transmitters operating in C-Band exist but do not have the form factor (size and weight) or packaging (not ruggedized) to survive airborne test applications.
   Traditional telemetry applications employ streaming telemetry where data is moved one-way from the instrumented system under test to our test infrastructure.  Modern network based telemetry capabilities, like those being developed by the Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program (CTEIP), enable more robust/efficient bidirectional transfer of data.  DoD’s strategy is to create technologies for streaming telemetry capability in C-Band, opening up legacy L- and S-Bands for networked telemetry usage.
   The Spectrum Efficient Technology (SET) project is developing test technologies that enable more efficient use of legacy telemetry bands and expansion into non-traditional areas of the radio frequency and optical spectra at DoD test ranges.  These technology advancements will address both the growing data requirements of warfighting systems and the limited availability of spectrum to support testing.  The technology development efforts within the SET project have been re-prioritized to align to Secretary of Defense guidance on science and technology priority investments for FY2013-2017.  The SET project is structured to develop test technologies to advance range communications, networked telemetry capabilities, and enhanced management of spectrum at DoD test ranges.

                                            <r2:Text>   The SET project developed technologies to meet networked telemetry requirements and perform risk reduction for CTEIP.  Technology enabling the dynamic reconfiguration of transmitted test data over a telemetry network was further matured.  Policy-based (i.e., predefined technical rules for equipment configuration) management tools to optimize data throughput and increase spectrum utilization was matured.  Spectrum and network management technology continued, with a focus on capabilities that allow for dynamic distribution of spectrum resources amongst test participants.  The spectrum management technologies matured by SET provided risk reduction in support of spectrum management needs exacerbated by spectrum selloff activities.  The SET project matured and demonstrated the capability of a radio network to rapidly change operating frequencies based on policies in the presence of non-cooperative interference, thus maintaining connectivity with no perceivable impact on telemetry network performance.  Additionally, the SET project initiated the development of a three dimensional channel model tool for modeling and simulation of telemetry channels in various environments to provide higher fidelity simulations for use in researching the effects of terrain and other factors on telemetry channels.  The SET project also initiated efforts to address a CTEIP requirement for networked test articles to operate between various test ranges without losing data connectivity.
   Development continued on advanced waveform technologies to increase radio frequency bandwidth efficiency.  A networked telemetry transceiver using an advanced waveform was developed and tested as a risk reduction effort for the CTEIP integrated Network Enhanced Telemetry (iNET) development.  The SET project initiated an effort to develop a networked data recorder to provide risk reduction in support of iNET development.  Efforts continued in developing forward error correction schemes for use in aeronautical telemetry to increase data reliability in dynamic test environments.  A Space Time Code implementation and associated hardware prototypes were demonstrated to show significant improvement in data reliability in highly dynamic multiple airborne antenna installations.
   The SET project investigated techniques to expand telemetry operations into non-traditional spectrum bands by characterizing multipath effects in multiple range environments.  Development of a wideband power amplifier capable of efficiently operating with advanced waveforms within the traditional telemetry bands was matured to increase efficiency in spectrum utilization.  Additionally, SET initiated efforts to develop airborne phased array antenna technology that will enable flexible scheduling of the T&amp;E spectrum by incorporating both the traditional and C-Band frequencies.  These technologies will reduce the technical risk associated with beam steering in the C-Band frequencies, reduce the amount of infrastructure modifications needed to implement a C-Band telemetry capability, and provide over-the-horizon data connectivity to test articles such as missiles.

                                            <r2:Text>  The SET project will further advance development of technologies required for network telemetry.  Efforts to develop policy-based network management tools will be completed, demonstrated, and transitioned to support CTEIP developments.  Spectrum and network management systems, including a suite of network protocols, will be demonstrated and transitioned to the test ranges.  Technologies to develop advanced waveforms designed to increase bandwidth efficiency will be matured.  The development of advanced waveforms will enable the telemetry network to support multiple high data rate test assets and increase efficiency and spectrum utilization.  Development of a networked data recorder in support of iNET continues.  Development of technology to enable inter-range data connectivity continues.  Technologies to develop a three dimensional channel model tool used in modeling and simulation of telemetry channels in various environments will be matured. Emphasis will be placed on development and maturation of technologies required to expand telemetry operations in other frequency ranges.
   Phased array antenna technology utilizing both the traditional and C-Band frequencies will continue to be matured to enable flexible spectrum scheduling and alleviate technical risk associated with tracking and beam steering in the C-Band.  The SET project will initiate efforts to develop an airborne multiband transceiver to support networked telemetry, increase spectrum scheduling efficiency, and support two-way data transmission of the telemetry network in both traditional and C-bands.  Development of forward error correction schemes for use in aeronautical telemetry to increase data reliability will be completed and transitioned to ranges.  Additionally, SET will begin an effort to provide risk mitigation and transition to iNET in the area of optimizing transmission synchronization parameters.

                                            <r2:Text>   The SET project will initiate development of radio technology that can utilize alternate spectrum in the upper frequency bands.  These efforts will determine the feasibility of some of the upper bands for use in telemetry.  Additional efforts on alternate data link technologies in the optical realm will be initiated.  If efforts in this area are successful, these technologies can provide augmentation to the existing telemetry bands.  The SET project will continue efforts to mature phased array technology for use on the ground as well as in airborne applications.  The high directionality of phased array antenna technologies on aircraft will enable the ability to leverage spectrum spatial reuse techniques for more effective spectrum scheduling.  The SET project will begin investigation and development into systems that will provide autonomous self forming telemetry networks to provide connectivity in flight line and other areas that currently suffer from limitations in communications coverage caused by buildings, terrain and multipath fading effects.  Work will be completed on forward error correction schemes for use in aeronautical telemetry to increase data reliability.  Efforts will complete the development of a three dimensional channel model tool used in modeling and simulation of telemetry channels in various environments.
   Additionally, continued efforts will provide risk mitigation and transition to iNET in the area of optimizing transmission synchronization parameters for use with the iNET radio network.  Efforts will continue to facilitate mobility of test articles between iNET network instances.  The SET project will continue work on the development of a networked data recorder to provide risk reduction in support of iNET capability.  The SET project will complete work to mature technologies in optimization and management of the telemetry networks through spectrum management tools designed to optimize spectrum utilization.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>   Readily available, infrared (IR) seeking, man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS) are difficult to detect and pose an imminent and lethal threat to military aircraft of all types.  Our ability to counter such threats is essential to owning the airspace in theater.  Therefore, the ability to test missile warning systems (MWS), hostile fire indicators, infrared countermeasures (IRCM), and advanced sensors is critical to our national defense.  Additionally, a new generation of enemy radio frequency (RF) missile seekers is both currently fielded and in further development, requiring a correspondingly new generation of test technologies to test the latest countermeasures.  The test and evaluation (T&amp;E) community is required to test IRCM and RF countermeasure systems in a repeatable manner with validated ground-truth data before and after integration into warfighting systems.  Without new test technologies, the Department of Defense (DoD) will be unable to perform adequate T&amp;E of advanced countermeasure systems.
     In response to Secretary of Defense guidance on science and technology priority investments for FY2013-2017, the T&amp;E/S&amp;T program restructured and reprioritized on-going Multi-Spectral Test (MST)technology efforts to address emerging Electronic Warfare/Electronic Protection test needs.  Accordingly, the MST project was renamed to the Electronic Warfare Test (EWT) project, to align with the Department’s priorities.  The EWT project is focusing on the test needs in both the electro-optic (EO) and the radio frequency domains, and by concentrating on the core test technology needs, technical advancements in this area have applicability to other EO and RF test requirements, such as in fire control systems, reconnaissance sensors, and missile seeker subsystems.
     The EWT project develops test technologies to stimulate IRCM and RF system sensors through the high-fidelity simulation of scenes viewed by the sensors.  Stimulation can be as simple as testing to see if a system under test responds to an image or as complex as simulating battle phenomena to measure the response of a system under test in a more relevant, cluttered scenario.  Simulations and stimulations are used at open air ranges (OAR) and in installed system test facilities (ISTF), and in hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) test beds.

                                            <r2:Text>   The EWT project has made progress developing the technology for the high-temperature scene emitter for the Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program (CTEIP) Joint Distributed IRCM Ground-Test System (JDIGS) development, which is improving the DoD test capabilities for directional infrared countermeasures (DIRCM) systems.  For example, the EWT project is in the final stages of testing a new superlattice light-emitting diode source that can provide two-color, high-temperature scenes with a frame rate fast enough to test new IRCM and missile warning systems.
   The EWT project has made significant progress with read-in integrated circuit technology, which supplies electrical energy to emitters that generate images in ISTF and HWIL test facilities.  This technology is preparing for final testing before transition.  Most significantly, this read-in integrated circuit technology will make future DoD development of scene projectors more affordable since it is capable of supporting a variety of next generation of emitters, of which several are currently in development within the EWT portfolio.
   The EWT project initiated an effort to develop a breadboard capability to produce high-fidelity electronic counter-countermeasures radar signal processing techniques that employs sophisticated waveforms with algorithms, such as adaptive filtering.  This technology development is to address a need identified by the Navy-led, CTEIP-sponsored Tri-Service Electronic Warfare Test Capabilities Study, to improve testing against modern surface-to-air missile threats.

The EWT project will concentrate on addressing new test technology needs identified in the update to the IRCM Test Resource Requirements Roadmap.  Furthermore, EWT technology developments will focus on stimulating synthetic aperture radars with radio frequency injection, including realistic background clutter, and research will be conducted for testing wide area emitters.
   To address the testing of systems operating in the mid-wave infrared band, the EWT project will develop technologies to enable the full testing of mid-wave infrared sensor/seekers by adding clutter models and scene generators to real-time stimulation.  Furthermore, efforts to develop technology to test against electronic counter-countermeasures techniques of modern surface-to-air missiles will continue.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>   The Advanced Instrumentation Systems Technology (AIST) project addresses the test technology gaps resulting from emerging weapon systems that need to be tested at Department of Defense (DoD) open air ranges, undersea ranges, installed systems test facilities, hardware-in-the-loop laboratories, and measurement test facilities.  Instrumentation requirements for systems under test are increasing exponentially for new weapons systems.  On-board and wearable instrumentation are required for sensing and collecting critical performance data; determining accurate time, space, position, and attitude information; interfacing with command and control data links; monitoring and reporting system-wide communications; recording human operator performance; and storing and transmitting data.  The technology development efforts within the AIST project have been re-prioritized to align to Secretary of Defense  guidance on science and technology (S&amp;T) priority investments for FY2013-2017, particularly in support of human systems, engineered resilient systems, and counter weapons of mass destruction.  The AIST project has been concentrated to support technology developments for advanced Time Space Position Information (TSPI) instrumentation (especially with limited or no use of the Global Positioning System (GPS)), advanced sensors, advanced energy &amp; power systems for instrumentation, non-intrusive instrumentation, mitigating range encroachment issues, and measuring warfighter cognitive performance.  
     The AIST project addresses requirements driven by the need to enable technologies for miniaturized, non-intrusive instrumentation suites with increased survivability in harsh environments.  Minimal space is available to add instrumentation to new or existing weapon systems subsequent to their development; furthermore, additional weight and power draw can adversely affect weapon system signature and performance.  Instrumentation for humans-in-the-loop, such as dismounted soldiers, is required to not adversely affect soldier performance, induce artificiality in the test environment, nor create operational burden.  New technologies can be exploited to integrate small, non-intrusive instrumentation into emerging platforms during design and development, and, in some cases, into existing platforms.  This class of instrumentation can provide the data required for continuous assessment throughout a system’s lifecycle and can enable the collection of critical system performance data during test, training, and combat missions, thereby enabling a continual feedback loop between the developer, test personnel, and operators.

                                            <r2:Text>   The warfighter must be able to conduct military operations in a diverse array of locations, to include urban, mountainous, and densely forested environments.  Consequently, a continued major thrust for FY 2011 included the development of test technologies to support collection of TSPI data for soldier systems (manned or unmanned), particularly in GPS-denied or degraded situations, such as in urban areas and tunnels.  A wideband local positioning system was developed to locate soldiers and unmanned ground systems in GPS-denied/impaired areas using radio frequency waveforms and techniques that penetrate structures found in urban environments.  Test results indicate that position accuracy less than one meter can be achieved with radio frequency signals going through up to four concrete block walls, which constitutes typical structural conditions encountered in urban operations.
   To support testing high-acceleration systems, an ultra-high dynamics GPS receiver was developed that performs significantly better than existing test instrumentation.  In preliminary tests, the prototype ultra-high dynamics GPS receiver demonstrated the ability to acquire satellite signals at velocities up to 5.0 kilometers per second (km/s) and during accelerations at 50-1100 times the force of gravity.  As a result, position solutions were obtained at velocities up to 10 km/s with time-to-first-fix under 0.5 seconds, which is important for testing air-to-air missile systems launched from under the wing or from a weapons bay.
   Other major development areas in FY 2011 included the development of advanced sensor instrumentation technologies (non-intrusiveness, miniaturization, and hardened for harsh environments).  A probe was developed for simultaneous analysis of turbine engine exhaust products (i.e., carbon, nitrogen, water vapor, and hydrocarbons) and will be used in ground testing of the C-17 engine.  Technology investments are also being applied to develop a fiber-optic instrumentation test suite capable of measuring electric and magnetic fields to support testing electromagnetically-propelled weapons.
   Additional efforts to test systems that operate in a GPS-denied environment include a technology that enables networking of GPS-enabled systems within the test environment, and then using the network to integrate GPS and other positional information across the connected nodes by sharing raw observables from GPS and inter-node ranges to locate each network node with high reliability.  Simulation results indicate that this technology will deliver high accuracy tracking performance upon completion.  A related technological approach employs a layered system of navigation sensors leveraging collaborative navigation, existing radio frequency ranging technology, and a Doppler velocimeter to achieve more precise positional information.
   Several new efforts were initiated in FY 2011.  A holographic optical memory system was designed for data recording and retrieval, extending the data storage capacity of current state-of-the-art holographic memory up to 16 terabytes.  An attachment technology initiated development with new adhesive formulations that employ an electrically releasing foil patch, for use in attaching sensors to non-conductive painted exterior surfaces of aircraft and other combat vehicles, significantly improving the turnaround time to return the system under test back to its operational configuration.  To improve testing at DoD undersea range complexes, algorithms and methodologies were investigated to automate detection and classification of marine mammal vocalizations from ocean floor range sensors.  This test technology will allow the Navy to conduct critical test and evaluation (T&amp;E) events without jeopardizing marine mammal populations.  Boot-mounted sensors were investigated to track the geolocation of dismounted war fighters with sub-meter accuracy during testing.  Additionally, an effort has been initiated to leverage microsystems technology under development at universities, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and government laboratories that will be applicable to T&amp;E of modern war fighting systems.

Furnishing adequate energy and power to instrument such systems for testing is a significant technological challenge.  Major thrusts for FY 2012 include continuing the FY 2011 efforts in advanced sensors, TSPI instrumentation, and advanced data acquisition and transformation along with the development of advanced power sources for test instrumentation.
   The AIST project will develop hardware prototypes of GPS nodes with radio frequency inter-node ranging capabilities and ad hoc network connectivity for technology demonstrations in a GPS-degraded environment.  Magnetic field sensors will be tested with an air gun and developed to survive the harsh environment of an electromagnetic rail gun firing.
   The AIST project will complete algorithm optimization development and the application specific integrated circuit architectures with high dynamic, multi-frequency, anti-jamming capability to provide TSPI in GPS-denied environments.  This test technology will support range safety, system analysis, T&amp;E mission optimization, and end game scoring of highly dynamic objects.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>   The Department of Defense (DoD) is exploring the military utility, safety, and suitability of directed energy weapons.  A robust test capability to assess directed energy weapons is essential to understand their effectiveness and limitations, including determining their efficiency to perform counter improvised explosive device (C-IED) operations.  Such assessments will depend upon knowledge acquired through the test and evaluation (T&amp;E) of the directed energy technologies and testing of operational concepts.  Directed energy weapon technologies, primarily consisting of high energy lasers (HEL) and high powered microwaves (HPM), are outpacing available test capabilities.  Traditional test techniques for evaluating conventional munitions (with flight times ranging from seconds to minutes) are not sufficient for the T&amp;E of directed energy weapons that place energy on target instantaneously.  Consequently, new test technology solutions are needed to ensure that adequate developmental, live-fire, and operational test capabilities are available when directed energy programs are ready to test.
     Directed energy system and component testing requires three principal assessments:  (1) energy or power on target; (2) the effects on the target; and (3) the propagation of the directed energy to the target through the atmosphere.  In addition, the vulnerability of DoD systems to HEL and HPM threats are required to be characterized in accordance with Military Standard (MIL-STD)-464C.  Current test capabilities do not provide the detailed data required to understand directed energy system performance and effects.
      The Directed Energy Test (DET) project is developing the technologies necessary for quantitative assessment of HEL and HPM performance, as well as the vulnerability of DoD weapons system to directed energy threats.  The technology development efforts within the DET project have been re-prioritized to align to Secretary of Defense  guidance on science and technology priority investments for FY2013-2017.

                                            <r2:Text>   To assess HEL energy on target, sensor array designs have been developed to directly measure high irradiance across laser spots on target materials.  Additional developments have produced alternative sensor array designs to measure the temperature maps on the back surface on a HEL-irradiated target and alternative inverse heat conduction algorithms to estimate the temperature on the front (HEL-heated) surface.  In this same HEL area, a hyperspectral sensor system that remotely measures radiance from an HEL spot on the target and applies an algorithm to calculate the target front surface temperature has been designed and is under fabrication.
   In the area of HEL effects on target, an adaptive optics system has been designed that will allow improved remote imaging of an HEL spot on a remote target.  A prototype is under fabrication and is designed to be readily adaptable to telescopes at various test facilities.
   In the area of HEL atmospheric propagation, a multi-light detection and ranging system to measure important atmospheric profiles along a slant path adjacent to the HEL beam propagation path is being fabricated.  This one system measures profiles for three parameters: optical turbulence, water vapor content, and aerosol attenuation.
   Addressing the HPM energy at the source,a flash X-ray characterization prototype provided the capability to successively image explosively generated HPM prime energy to understand why expected increases in capability with more energetic explosives was not being realized.  At least one of the issues with achieving explosive source expectations was revealed during the field testing of this prototype.
   In the area of surrogate shooters to support the recently approved MIL-STD-464C requirements, a high frequency wideband prototype was delivered providing the required fields on target, while also being capable of achieving significantly greater power.  As a result, the transition partner has requests from several organizations to test concepts for advanced systems using the source.  Several prototypes were delivered to improve HPM test tempo in MIL-STD-464C test activities including rapid polarization changes and broad power variation.  The demonstrated test technologies have wide application to other HPM test sources.
   A test technology supporting both HPM energy on target and effects on target was demonstrated.  This capability measures the electric field arriving at eight locations on the target and the temperature rise resulting from those fields.  A family of HPM sensors demonstrated test technologies for measuring energy inside larger targets during HPM engagements.  The sensor technology can be used singly or in combination to non-intrusively measure electric and magnetic field vectors at the same location.  After promising field tests, the National Institute of Standards and Technology is now characterizing the performance of these new sensors so they can be adopted by the test ranges as authoritative data collection devices.
   Early testing of electric field sensors for support of electromagnetic rail gun testing identified a prime source for examined rail wear, a key issue for rail gun systems.  To better support C-IED testing, the test technology development to measure soil electrical properties built a brass board sensor with three interchangeable heads to cover the required frequencies.  The brass board has been used in proving the concept to measure the soil electrical properties for portions of the test site, with results showing measurements similar to those taken by legacy technologies.  An advantage of the new test technology is that it measured in 20 minutes what the legacy measurements systems could do in two months.

                                            <r2:Text>   Within the HEL area, efforts will focus on completing the technology developments for measuring energy on target and characterizing effects on target using onboard sensing.  The performance of these matured technologies will direct the focus of future investments to optimize HEL measurement capabilities.  New efforts will be initiated to address identified areas of technology shortfalls, including HEL test safety and HEL collateral effects.  In addition, test technologies will focus on the characterization of solid state laser effects on targets in support of weapons systems in development and demonstration by the Army, Navy, and Air Force.  Test technologies to support the measurement of laser lethality on rockets, artillery, mortars, and unmanned air vehicle targets will remain a key area of investment.  Furthermore, efforts to characterize beam propagation through the atmosphere will center on the maritime environment in support of emerging needs of the Navy.  Investment will be placed in laser safety software and hardware to allow testing at multiple test ranges without affecting aircraft and space sensors.  
   In the area of HPM, the prototype to measure soil electrical properties will be matured to determine the soil depth to which the new technology can measure while adding the ability to determine if the magnetic properties of soil are interfering with the advanced technique.
   The initiatives to achieve very small non-intrusive electric and magnetic field sensors will be completed to measure HPM effects inside a target and transitioned to at least two locations to demonstrate the flexibility of this technology.  The widely dispersed HPM data recording and wireless reporting effort will be completed supporting the CHAMP demonstration and then be transitioned to initially support rapid testing of C-IED systems and fratricide issues with other ground HPM systems.  A smaller less intrusive data acquisition device with a wide bandwidth to match that of the non-intrusive electric and magnetic field sensors will be investigated.
   The capability to characterize the Terahertz beam quality in support of testing the proliferating number of Terahertz sensors and detectors for force protection and explosives or biological hazards determination will be transitioned.  A risk reduction effort will be performed to determine the best approach to construct a more durable pressurized – radio frequency transmitting dome that does not leak over time for a test capability that emulates wideband threats.

                                            <r2:Text>   Investments in HEL will assess and target the changes in HEL effects due to the shift of HELs to shorter wavelengths near 1 micron.  Such HELs include solid state, fiber, and free electron laser systems.  Test technologies to support the testing of HEL energy on target will continue to be advanced.  As development of electromagnetic rail guns and the free electron lasers advance, investments in test technologies supporting these weapon systems will be initiated.  Tunable over a wide range, free electron lasers present unique testing challenges for open air testing, including measuring laser energy on target, as well as characterizing the beam propagation and thermal blooming effects.  
   In the HPM area, measuring the actual cause of HPM electronics effects will be addressed by electrical current measurements in the wires and chips of the electronic targets.  To better support weapon research and design, a method will be sought to determine the time out of action for targets, such that HPM effects on targets need not be permanent.  In weapons development testing, these sensors will indicate how much increase in HPM weapon output is required to make a weapon effective.  In survivability testing, these sensors will support assessment of susceptibility with lower power HPM sources.  Additionally, the DET project will address technology for small, powerful HPM sources to allow testing of the susceptibility of United States equipment in a chamber environment.  A new effort will be initiated to develop a technologically viable alternative to provide the neutron radiation required for nuclear survivability testing.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>   The Net-centric Systems Test (NST) project is pursuing test technologies to emulate multi-Service, Joint, and coalition net-centric operations in a system of systems test and evaluation environment and to analyze and evaluate the increasingly massive amounts of structured and unstructured data generated by complex net-centric tests. Information systems and weapon/sensor platforms that support the kill chain in a Joint operation must provide an accurate transfer of timely data (e.g., target tracks, weapons allocation, mission tasking and situational assessment), as it passes among different systems, Service, and coalition participants.  The NST technologies advance test automation (test planning, test execution, test control, and analysis) that enable the virtual integration of Department of Defense (DoD) weapon laboratories and open air ranges.  Using models and simulations along with hardware-in-the-loop laboratories, the effectiveness of Joint missions can be assessed in terms of System-of-Systems interoperability and effectiveness in executing Joint mission operations, including testing of weapons and Command and Control systems accessing and providing information to the Global Information Grid.  The technology development efforts within the NST project have been re-prioritized to align to Secretary of Defense guidance on science and technology priority investments for FY2013-2017, particularly in measuring “Data to Decision” techniques and warfighting capabilities.  Ultimately, the NST portfolio enables the test community to “test like we fight” by replicating net-enabled, Joint mission operations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:Text>   The NST project emphasized test technologies supporting the abilities to manage a net-centric test battlespace, including planning a complex, multi-player, mission-level net-centric test in a distributed live-virtual-constructive (LVC) environment and controlling test execution through management of the mission scenario.  The NST project developed test planning technologies to address test integrations and interoperability issues.  Ontologies were developed to formalize concepts pertaining to LVC test resources in a net-centric joint mission environment.  Knowledge bases were developed that capture subject matter expertise on setup and execution of a test event and characteristics of test resources.  Reasoning capabilities were extended and integrated to automate test planning tasks.  The NST project developed a planning/visualization technology to support joint mission thread testing to better correlate test data to the effectiveness of mission operations.
   The NST project advanced technologies to support the execution of distributed tests with active network control, enhanced the degree of dynamic management of the test infrastructure, and improved the integration of Service laboratories and test ranges by transitioning new technologies into the Test and Training Enabling Architecture (TENA).  
   The NST project is investing in technologies to test military systems that employ Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA), including test technologies to help the tester understand what is happening inside of and between SOA services and resources during test events.  These test technologies will allow the tester to understand the environment, including but not limited to network hardware and software.  The NST project also developed technologies for the next generation of TENA middleware that support a broad range of networks, including wireless networks, and provide native support for handheld and embedded computing platforms.
   The NST project transitioned test technologies to the Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program (CTEIP) Interoperability Test and Evaluation Capability (InterTEC) development that will provide the capability to automate testing of the Net-Ready Key Performance Parameters (KPP) solution architecture element.  In addition, this test technology will perform compliance assessments of architectures against governing standards and allow a tester to plan a test event based on authoritative Joint mission threads.  The test technology will also allow the tester to visualize the execution of mission threads by mapping the progress of the test to architecture views.  An additional FY2011 NST transition involved technologies that will ingest test plans and provide automated, rule-based control of the test infrastructure during a large-scale complex test event.
   Finally, the NST project transferred two on-going cyberspace test technology developments to the new Cyberspace Test project, which would be better suited within that portfolio.

The NST project will also focus on test technologies to extend the TENA Meta-Model to address emerging security and trusted systems requirements, as well as extend TENA into embedded instrumentation and smart devices, including optimizing data structures to operate more efficiently over wireless networks.  Additionally, the NST project will continue the development of technologies to support the measurement and analysis of the net-centric test environment.  The analysis of joint mission threads in near real-time will be assisted by the development of a test technology that will allow effective characterization and replication of Joint mission threads.
  The testing of SOA will be emphasized through the research and development of instrumentation and analysis tools utilizing embedded agent-based technologies.  Additional test technology development will be conducted in semantic interoperability and defining ontologies that formalize concepts pertaining to distributed test resources in a net-centric Joint Mission Environment.

                                            <r2:Text>  The NST project will focus predictive smart dead-reckoning technology to address the challenge to adequately synchronize the distributed test environment.  This effort will leverage the ultra-high-speed policy-enabled agent and the policy server to provide the necessary distributed intelligence to manage time space position information (TSPI) updates in the net-centric test battlespace with a distributed LVC architecture.  To accomplish this capability, the NST project will build upon previously developed technologies by NST and add additional capabilities to solve the test challenges of producing accurate TSPI predictions under all network conditions, to include both unpredictable network latency and missing information.  The predictive smart dead-reckoning technology will include capabilities, such as highly accurate clock synchronization, fast clock convergence under unreliable network conditions, and fast TSPI calibrations.  Since the predictive smart dead-reckoning technology will be built on top of the policy-enabled agent, it will be able to provide fast response under complex test event conditions.
   NST project will continue developing technology that will automate the planning of test events, based on advanced semantic web technology.  Development will continue on technologies to support the use of TENA over a broad range of networks and to provide a common interoperability test architecture.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>   Unmanned and Autonomous Systems (UAS)support every domain of warfare, operating in space, in air, on land, on sea, undersea and in sub-terrain conditions to support a vast variety of missions.  UAS is experiencing exponential growth in technological capabilities and employment in current operations.  The emergence of robotics brings a host of revolutionary capabilities that will profoundly influence warfare.  The Unmanned and Autonomous Systems Test (UAST) project addresses current and emerging challenges associated with the test and evaluation (T&amp;E) of these critical warfighting capabilities.  The UAST project is developing test technologies to simulate, stimulate, instrument, measure, and assess the capability of an autonomous system to perceive its environment, process information, adapt to dynamic conditions, make decisions, and effectively act on those decisions in the context of mission execution.  The technology development efforts within the UAST project have been re-prioritized to align to Secretary of Defense guidance on science and technology priority investments for FY2013-2017, particularly in assessing autonomy.
     The UAST project will provide the test technologies to effectively measure performance and characterize risk, thereby increasing the warfighter’s trust in autonomous systems.  Current Department of Defense (DoD) test capabilities and methodologies are insufficient to address the testing of increasingly autonomous units and teams of unmanned systems operating in unstructured, dynamic battlespace environments.  Furthermore, advancements are being made in developing collaborating system-of-autonomous-systems, working in concert as a swarm or pack and in close proximity with humans.  New test technologies are needed to stress the collective set of autonomous systems under realistic conditions, predict emergent behavior of autonomous systems, emulate the complex environment, and assess mission performance of these highly coupled and intelligent systems.

                                            <r2:Text>   The UAST project focused on investments in predicting and assessing the autonomy functions of unmanned and autonomous systems through the initiation of a series of new technology developments.  The complexity of operational unmanned and autonomous systems, with all possible interactions occurring between sensing, perception, reasoning, mapping, decision making and action, results in an almost infinite set of potential interactions and correspondingly, an almost infinite set of test conditions.  An effort was initiated to employ evolutionary/genetic algorithms in a software-in-the-loop environment to accurately predict the fault conditions of a complex, long-duration autonomous system.  Initially to be demonstrated on the Long Duration – Unmanned Underwater Vehicle, this test technology will improve the ability to predict fault conditions and thereby enable focused test strategies that dramatically improve the efficiency of testing.
   An effort was initiated in the UAST project to develop test technologies that enable stress testing of UAS software at the interfaces of the core components without requiring source code, while being agnostic to the specific component interface.  This test technology will provide the tester with a perspective of system performance and an ability to predict behavior that is not currently available.
   The UAST project has initiated a technology development to create a virtual UAS test bed that consumes environmental data from external sources (to include imagery from operational areas of interest) and injects that data into simulations of a given UAS to predict the behavior of the system in the operational environment.  This technology will facilitate efficient testing in an operationally representative environment and allow for safe operations at “edge of the envelope” performance parameters.

The UAST project will additionally explore investments in the challenges of testing autonomy, leveraging advances made in the standardization of UAS architectures, functional components, and interfaces.
   The test technology to adapt evolutionary algorithms to predict fault conditions will be expanded to address evaluation functions for multiple missions of a long duration UAS.  The effort to stress test UAS software will delve into technologies to integrate UAS models with software exceptions databases to allow for sharing of test data across multiple UAS platforms.  The effort to create a virtual UAS test bed will complete its architecture, complete the terrain modeling, develop perceptual boosting algorithms based on vehicle sensors, integrate all sensor modules and simulation modules into a complete virtual test bed, and validate the complete system through comparison of the outputs of the models inside the virtual proving ground with real data acquired during field tests.

The UAST project will continue to invest in technology that addresses mid-term UAS test challenges (autonomy) and initiate efforts to explore the far term challenges of testing system intelligence.  This effort will include an examination of test technologies that measure the logical flow of sensing data, to perception, decisions, and action.  The UAST project will focus on enhancing the test environment to assess unmanned threat systems system mission capabilities, and to identify vulnerabilities.  The UAST project will develop instrumentation and analysis technologies to enable UAS testing that furnishes data to support the evaluation of mission performance.  Furthermore, the UAST project will invest in efforts to enable dynamic construction, control, measurement of complex systems-of-autonomous-systems and tactically meaningful counter-unmanned aerial systems analysis.  Test requirements will expand to integrate multi-UAS test beds that support a simulation-based methodology to seamlessly integrate constructive simulation, UAS-in-the loop simulation, and live UAS tests.  The UAST project will deliver complementary tools to predict UAS behavior by monitoring how autonomous systems process data in response to environmental changes.  Simulated systems will replicate multiple platforms for the evaluation of multi-platform behaviors, supporting repeatable events, and detailed system/event logging.  Modeling and simulation techniques will be expanded to provide high fidelity representations of appropriate environmental complexity in order to stress the UAS and establish confidence in the safety and capabilities of future systems.</r2:Text>

Accordingly, the Multi-Level Security for test and evaluation (T&amp;E) project was renamed to the Cyberspace Test project, to align with the Department’s priorities.  Furthermore, two technology developments, previously in the Net-Centric System Test (NST) portfolio, that were investigating creating representative cyberspace attack threat effects were re-aligned within the Cyberspace Test project.  The Cyberspace Test project will address all test technology shortfalls in cyberspace testing, including planning cyberspace tests, executing cyberspace tests, and creating representative cyberspace threats.  The Cyberspace Test project will develop high fidelity live-virtual-constructive (LVC) test environments to measure cyberspace attacks and countermeasures across all information technology stack layers, while leveraging cyberspace technologies being developed across the S&amp;T community.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Technology Transfer and Transition (TT&amp;T) program element has two sub-elements: Technology Transfer (P942), and Technology Transition Initiative (P949).

Defense Technology Transfer's three-fold mission is (1) integration of advanced commercial-sector technologies into Department of Defense (DoD) systems, particularly from nontraditional defense contractors; (2) spinoff of DoD-developed technologies to industry for product development and to make these technologies available for military acquisition; and (3) establishment of collaborative Research and Development (R&amp;D) projects with the private sector for cost-sharing of new dual-use technology development. 

The Technology Transition Initiative (TTI), authorized by Title 10 and Section 242 of the FY 2003 Defense Authorization Act, facilitates the rapid transition of new technologies from the DoD science and technology (S&amp;T) base into DoD acquisition programs.  The program addresses the funding gaps that exist between the time a mature technology is demonstrated and the time it can be funded and procured for use in an intended weapons system or operational capability for the warfighter. Since the TTI (P949) program inception in FY 2003, 78 projects have been initiated and 50 have completed. Of the 50 completed projects, 35 (70%) successfully transitioned to DoD Acquisition Programs of Record or procurement contracts for operational use and subsequent fielding.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>This project integrates Electronic Image Intensifier (EI2) technology into a lightweight sensor for the Apache Modernized-Pilot's Night Vision System (M-PNVS). Four form-fit, function and flight ready EI2 prototypes will be engineered, built, and delivered to PM Apache for aircraft qualification and users evaluation flights.  The EI2 camera will provide performance that is equal to or greater than the current aviator's night vision goggles and at the same time allow for image fusion with the second generation Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) on the Apache helicopter.

Program Outputs and Efficiencies: meet pilotage requirements for dynamic motion, resolution, and contrast through improved readout electronics and high definition format (1920 x 1080); exit criteria to be met include Aviator's Night Vision Imaging System (ANVIS) performance and $35 thousand per camera cost; four pre-production prototype cameras delivered for operational flight testing in FY 2011. TTI funding accelerates the transition of this capability by two to three years.

                                    <r2:Title>Medium Caliber Cartridge Improvements using Micro Electro-Mechanical Systems and Direct Write Explosive Ink</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>40 millimeter (mm) high-explosive, dual-purpose (HEDP) M433 and M430 cartridges have been in service since the 1950's and 1970's respectively, and are used with the M203 low-velocity grenade launcher and the MK-19 grenade machine gun by all services.  Both cartridges use point detonating fuzes with mechanical safe and arm (S&amp;A) devices which do not reliably detonate on soft impact targets or high graze angles.  The objective of this effort is to improve the reliability of these cartridges through a Micro-Electro-Mechanical (MEMS) fuzing system that incorporates electronic initiation, improved target sensing using paired MEMS impact sensors, self-destruct capability, command arm enable, more accurate arming distance, and automated explosive ink loading.  In addition to improved reliability, these design enhancements will reduce volume and cost.

Outputs and efficiencies: Incorporate impact sensors that will sense initial impact and electronically send a signal to initiate the explosive train for improved lethality and improved reliability on soft targets (from 50 percent current performance to 90 percent), and also significantly reduce the number of duds on the battlefield and training ranges.  The 40mm MEMS Fuze also will require less volume providing room for improvements in lethality or other future alternate applications.  TTI accelerates transition of this technology from the Army Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC) to Project-Manager Soldier Weapons (PM-SW) in approximately three years.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Title>Precision Fires Image (PFI) Software Suite Handheld Capability (Navy)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>Currently Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) missions are planned using traditional means and require dismounted operators, (conventional and Special Operations Forces (SOF)), who do not carry laptop computers.  The mission set is currently supported by paper.  The objective of this project is to integrate Battlespace Awareness (Mission Planning, Force Protection, Direct Action, etc.) capability on a Windows CE/mobile handheld computer by building upon already proven and deployed technology.  The availability of these software tools on a handheld computer will immediately advance warfighter capabilities by enhancing situational awareness, precision targeting, and rapid employment at the tactical level. 

Program Outputs and Efficiencies:  This project will generate and transition a software suite that provides image, video, and geographical capabilities on the Army's Pocket Sized Forward Entry Devices (PFED) and compatible Special Operations Forces Windows CE/mobile handheld computers.  These forward operating Battlespace Awareness applications will be built around the previously transitioned and deployed Precision Fires Image (PFI), which is a National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) validated, Central Command (CENTCOM) approved, image based targeting tool for coordinate seeking weapons.  Integration to the handheld computer will be advantageous in achieving advanced mission capability with less weight, space, and provide shorter operational readiness delays. The TTI funding will accelerate the acquisition and integration of this handheld software capability by two to three years.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Title>Hellfire Height of Burst (HOB) Sensor (Army)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The HOB Sensor is a miniaturized radio frequency (RF) target detection device that will be integrated into the new Electronic Safe and Arm Device (ESAD) being incorporated into the next generation Hellfire missile (Hellfire R).  The HOB sensor provides for improved lethality against targets in the open by detonating the warhead at a height above ground optimized for these targets.  This TTI project funds the final design and engineering of the HOB sensor optimized for Hellfire, provides component and system level environmental and hardware-in-the-loop testing, and allows two flight tests of HOB sensor equipped missiles.

Program Outputs and Efficiencies:  The HOB sensor will be integrated into the Hellfire missile and undergo hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL), environmental, and flight testing.  The final outcome will be two missile flights incorporating the HOB sensor.  The first flight will replace the warhead with a telemetry package to record the missile flight data as well as the point at which the HOB sensor triggers the warhead.  The second flight will incorporate both the HOB sensor and the Hellfire warhead. Lethality data will be collected to validate the modeled performance against targets in the open.  Simulation has shown that the HOB sensor will significantly increase the lethality when fired from platforms that allow a steep angle of impact.  TTI accelerates the transition of this capability by two years.</r2:Description>

The unit will be a self-powered, low-cost autonomous system capable of measuring and recording key health status parameters.  The unit will be an electronic data acquisition device embedded into each missile and will be optimized for long life to automatically monitor temperature exposure, drop shock events and record vibration levels that can cause degradation to the missile over time.

Program Outputs and Efficiencies:  The primary outputs and efficiencies to be demonstrated in the project are: (1) reduced costs and maintenance burden to Warfighter; (2) increased reliability; (3) enhanced system safety; and (4) increased readiness.

                                    <r2:Description>An end-of-service-life indicator (ESLI) has been developed for chemical, biological radiological, nuclear (CBRN) protective mask filters that will alert the user to exchange the filter following exposure to acid gas chemical warfare agents (CWAs).  The technology to be transitioned consists of thin colorimetric indicator films coated with pondus hydrogenii (pH) sensitive dyes and reagents that target common functional groups and chemical properties of the major classes of blood agents and select Toxic Industrial Chemicals (TICs).  The approach is to place the ESLI along the inside wall of the filter in contact with the carbon bed so it can react with the passing agent wave front to produce a color change, thereby alerting the user to replace the filter well before its gas-life capacity is depleted. 

Program Outputs and Efficiencies:  The Joint Service General Purpose Mask (JSGPM) CBRN filter housing will be equipped with a transparent plastic window to view the indicator response.  The ESLI will be designed to provide a visual signal when approximately 20 to 60 percent of the filter's service life capacity is expired, depending on the target agent.  The ESLI technology will be transitioned to the M50 JSGPM acquisition program as a spiral upgrade (product improvement) to the current primary CBRN filter.  TTI funding accelerates this transition by two years. </r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Title>Integrated Information Management System (IIMS) Transition (Air Force)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The Integrated Information Management System (IIMS) is a collaborative situational awareness tool which aids in the management of conventional and Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) events at fixed, expeditionary and incident response sites.  IIMS includes detector/ warning networks, access to CBRN models, and information exchange with civil sector and coalition partner organizations.  IIMS is in the base defense component of the AF Theater Battle Management Core System – Unit Level/Unit Command and Control (TBMCS-UL/UC2).  It addresses both conventional and CBRN incidents.  It is replacing the Survival Recovery Center (SRC).  It improves decision making and battle management activities in the event of a conventional or CBRN incident.

The objective of this effort is to transition IIMS into TBMCS-UL/UC2 Increment Two, and subsequently into the final TBMCS-UC2.  The additional IIMS capabilities will augment the fielded TBMC-UL/UC2 to extend original capabilities, provide a stand-alone capability, and to incorporate joint CBRN tools.  A successful transition of IIMS to TBMCS-UC2 through this spiral development process will significantly increase the base defense/response capabilities available to the warfighter.  

Program outputs and efficiencies:  TTI funding accelerates the SRC replacement with planned upgrades to IIMS that more efficiently identify and respond to issues preventing the flying mission by 1-2 years.  The transition of IIMS into the TBMCS-UC2 N-tier Service Oriented Architecture enables transition of new capabilities into TBMCS-UC2 through the IIMS framework and the adjudication of any Priority I or Priority II software trouble reports at the time of transition.  The software will adhere to general quality and reliability standards and include standard software product sets upon delivery (i.e. source code, executable code, documentation, test results). TTI funding accelerates upgrades to integrate sensor/detector networks and improve communications with off-base agencies by 4+ years.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Mature a multi-purpose surfactant technology to accelerate its transition to the Decontamination Family of Systems (DFoS).  There is an immediate and unmet requirement for a cargo aircraft decontaminant.  The primary means to decontaminate aircraft is ineffective in decontaminating most Chemical and Biological (CB) hazards and material compatibility issues exist with currently fielded decontaminants and aircraft exteriors.  Current decontaminants are single purpose items and carry a significant logistics burden.  The surfactant technology will provide the Warfighter with a multi-use, advanced formulation for mitigating CB hazards to operational (threshold) or thorough (objective) levels.  MIL-PRF-87937D testing will be conducted to qualify the surfactant system as an aerospace cleaning compound and enable it to be inserted on the Qualified Products List (QPL).  The surfactant technology can be used as a routine cleaning compound as well as an aircraft-cleaning compound.  TTI accelerates transition by more than two years.

Outputs and efficiencies:  a) Validate chemical efficacy (via contact and vapor testing) on priority painted materials; b) demonstrate biological efficacy; c) MIL-PRF-87937D qualified product (physical, chemical, toxicological properties, environmental impact). </r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The objective of this program is accelerate the transition of interlocking mortar increment container (MIC) design and fabrication technology to ensure uniform propellant ignition and reduce differential pressures which will eliminate a noted safety critical mechanism and reduce the possibility of critical short rounds &lt;80% of intended range) due to shearing of fin blades and asymmetrical burn.  The interlocking MIC design eliminates the potential alignment of the open ends of the propelling charges and will greatly reduce the chances of more propellant being on one side of the mortar fin boom.  This eliminates the imbalance of the energetics and associated potential problematic pressure differential within the mortar tube.  The warfighter will have no chance of a sheared fin failure due to unexpected alignment of propelling charges which, in turn, will reduce the possibility of a critically short flight 120mm rounds in theater. Accelerating the maturation, transition, and insertion of this interlocking "high hat" mortar increment container technology into the 120mm mortar ammo program of record (PoR) will improve safety and accuracy for our light and dismounted ground forces. It also will lay the foundation for potential subsequent application to 60mm and 81mm mortar ammo if warranted .  

Program Outputs and Efficiencies: Provides the warfighter with safer mortar ammunition; further prevents the possibility of unexpected short flight of 120mm mortar rounds in theater; improves soldier safety during training. TTI accelerates the deployment of this capability by 18 months.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The basic mission of the Operational Energy Capability Improvement Fund (OECIF) is to fund innovation that will improve the Department’s operational effectiveness via targeted science and technology investments that are intended to improve the energy performance of key elements of our forces.  As Defense-Wide funding, it will incentivize long term change in the science and technology portfolio of the Department to be more in line with the Department-wide Operational Energy Strategy and foster generally needed innovations to improve operational energy performance.  This mission has two keys aspects.  First, to develop or demonstrate and rapidly transition into the force operational energy technologies or practices that will improve the Department’s military capabilities and reduce its costs.  Second, to establish within the military Services sustainable institutional capacities that will continue to research, develop and adopt operational energy innovations.  OECIF funds serve as “seed money” to consolidate or initiate promising operational energy programs or directions to be sustained by the Services; accordingly, OECIF generally emphasizes supporting or establishing programs, rather than a series of one-off projects.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The diverse and complex Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) – nuclear, biological and chemical threats – mission space requires an integrated approach towards capability development. Capability development must be based on a systems perspective that links strategic objectives with interrelated tasks and associated capabilities. The broad CWMD military strategic objectives and mission areas encompass many nontraditional capabilities for the Warfighter, and CWMD is not an isolated mission set unique to DoD – it is intertwined with counter-terrorism and homeland defense. Accordingly, developing an overall CWMD capability should and must leverage complementary capabilities through integration and synchronization. This program addresses developing an integrated and interconnected CWMD capabilities-based system that defines and enables a comprehensive, global awareness and readiness for CWMD steady-state and surge postures. A global CWMD situational awareness capability will be established and deployed worldwide via current communications systems and common operating pictures in support of this mission.  This program will incorporate portfolio management tools and comprehensive analyses to enable a balanced and integrated CWMD systems portfolio, an optimized CWMD force structure, and the integration with and utilization of existing military assets to fill intelligence, sensor and reconnaissance gaps in CWMD.

This program also responds to the strategic needs outlined in the President's initiative, stated in his April 2009 speech in Prague; the US Combatant Commands integrated priorities and requirements; the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review; and the FY12-16 Defense Planning and Programming Guidance by providing improved timeliness and relevance through modernizing CWMD support to the Combatant Commands, Office of the Secretary of Defense, Joint Staff, Intelligence Community (IC), and other U.S. Government agencies as required. This program is designed to leverage existing DoD resources and proven approaches to achieve its goals and rapidly deliver a capability to the Warfighter. It will ensure sufficient funding is available for travel to support the requirements of this program element.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The diverse and complex Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) – nuclear, biological and chemical threats – mission space requires an integrated approach towards capability development. Capability development must be based on a systems perspective that links strategic objectives with interrelated tasks and associated capabilities. The broad CWMD military strategic objectives and mission areas encompass many nontraditional capabilities for the Warfighter, and CWMD is not an isolated mission set unique to DoD – it is intertwined with counter-terrorism and homeland defense. Accordingly, developing an overall CWMD capability should and must leverage complementary capabilities through integration and synchronization. This program addresses developing an integrated and interconnected CWMD capabilities-based system that defines and enables a comprehensive, global awareness and readiness for CWMD steady-state and surge postures. A global CWMD situational awareness capability will be established and deployed worldwide via current communications systems and common operating pictures in support of this mission.  This program will incorporate portfolio management tools and comprehensive analyses to enable a balanced and integrated CWMD systems portfolio, an optimized CWMD force structure, and the integration with and utilization of existing military assets to fill intelligence, sensor and reconnaissance gaps in CWMD.

This program also responds to the strategic needs outlined in the President's initiative, stated in his April 2009 speech in Prague; the US Combatant Commands integrated priorities and requirements; the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review; and the FY12-16 Defense Planning and Programming Guidance by providing improved timeliness and relevance through modernizing CWMD support to the Combatant Commands, Office of the Secretary of Defense, Joint Staff, Intelligence Community (IC), and other U.S. Government agencies as required. This program is designed to leverage existing DoD resources and proven approaches to achieve its goals and rapidly deliver a capability to the Warfighter. It will ensure sufficient funding is available for travel to support the requirements of this program element.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) addresses the need to defend and deter against weapons of mass destruction (WMD) threats and to safeguard personnel; prevent unauthorized access to equipment, installations, material, and documents; and to safeguard the foregoing against espionage, sabotage, damage, and theft.  This program oversees advanced engineering development throughout DoD for an integrated and systemic RDT&amp;E approach for countering nuclear threats and nuclear and conventional physical security equipment (PSE) technology and systems.  The funding has been centralized in this Defense-wide PE since the early 1990s and represents a substantial portion of all DoD PSE RDT&amp;E funding.  Priorities for this PE RDT&amp;E efforts are driven by inputs from Quadrennial Defense Review guidance, Combatant Command and Service requirements, analysis reports such as “Protecting the Force:  Lessons from Fort Hood, January 2010, the Integrated Unit, Base, and Installation Protection Cost Benefits Analysis, Multi-national Work Plans established through the Nuclear Security Summit process, and DoD Directive 5210.41, Security Policy for Protecting Nuclear Weapons-directed requirements and associated security deviation reports.  

Under this integrated approach, funds are used to provide PSE advanced component development and prototypes for the Department in seven capability areas:  (1) Detection and Assessment; (2) Access Controls; (3) Installation and Transport Security; (4) Storage and Safeguards; (5) Prevention; (6) Decision Support Systems; and (7) Analytical Support.  The projects under the Program Element either (a) lead to Programs of Record – which can transition to Program Element 0604161D8Z for systems development and demonstration (SDD); (b) become technology insertions into existing programs; or (c) advance to being a certified Commercial/Government off-the-shelf product.  The PE initiatives are coordinated by the Security Policy Verification Committee and the Physical Security Equipment Action Group.  These groups work together to avoid duplication of effort and when applicable ensure systems integration and promote interoperability and sustainability.  

This PE can fund travel to support the requirements of this program.

This appropriation will finance work, including manpower, performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant
arrangement with the government who conduct research (systematic study directed toward fuller scientific knowledge or understanding of the subject studied),
development (systematic use of the knowledge and understanding gained from research, for the production of useful materials, devices, systems, or methods, including the design and development of prototypes and processes) and test and evaluation efforts.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) addresses the need to defend and deter against weapons of mass destruction (WMD) threats and to safeguard personnel; prevent unauthorized access to equipment, installations, material, and documents; and to safeguard the foregoing against espionage, sabotage, damage, and theft.  This program oversees advanced engineering development throughout DoD for an integrated and systemic RDT&amp;E approach for countering nuclear threats and nuclear and conventional physical security equipment (PSE) technology and systems.  The funding has been centralized in this Defense-wide PE since the early 1990s and represents a substantial portion of all DoD PSE RDT&amp;E funding.  Priorities for this PE RDT&amp;E efforts are driven by inputs from Quadrennial Defense Review guidance, Combatant Command and Service requirements, analysis reports such as “Protecting the Force:  Lessons from Fort Hood, January 2010, the Integrated Unit, Base, and Installation Protection Cost Benefits Analysis, Multi-national Work Plans established through the Nuclear Security Summit process, and DoD Directive 5210.41, Security Policy for Protecting Nuclear Weapons-directed requirements and associated security deviation reports.  

Under this integrated approach, funds are used to provide PSE advanced component development and prototypes for the Department in seven capability areas:  (1) Detection and Assessment; (2) Access Controls; (3) Installation and Transport Security; (4) Storage and Safeguards; (5) Prevention; (6) Decision Support Systems; and (7) Analytical Support.  The projects under the Program Element either (a) lead to Programs of Record – which can transition to Program Element 0604161D8Z for systems development and demonstration (SDD); (b) become technology insertions into existing programs; or (c) advance to being a certified Commercial/Government off-the-shelf product.  The PE initiatives are coordinated by the Security Policy Verification Committee and the Physical Security Equipment Action Group.  These groups work together to avoid duplication of effort and when applicable ensure systems integration and promote interoperability and sustainability.  

This PE can fund travel to support the requirements of this program.

This appropriation will finance work, including manpower, performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant
arrangement with the government who conduct research (systematic study directed toward fuller scientific knowledge or understanding of the subject studied),
development (systematic use of the knowledge and understanding gained from research, for the production of useful materials, devices, systems, or methods, including the design and development of prototypes and processes) and test and evaluation efforts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>(U) This Program Element (PE) was established in response to Congressional guidance to consolidate DoD robotic programs on unmanned ground systems and related robotic technologies in order to increase the focus of the robotic programs on operational requirements. Technologies in the PE support the continued development of technologies beyond Budget Activity 3 (PE 0603711D8Z) for technology transition and transformation to close warfighter requirement capability gaps. By exercising its oversight role through a technology advisory board, senior military Council and Senior Steering Group (Flag level), Joint Ground Robotics (JGRE) applies this PE to enable coordination between the Services and places emphasis on interoperability and commonality among unmanned ground systems. This PE funds efforts to overcome technology barriers in thrust areas of unmanned ground system technologies to include Autonomous &amp; Tactical Behaviors, Collaborative Operations, Interoperability, Man-portable Unmanned Ground System Technologies, Manipulation Technologies, and Technology Transition/Transformation. This PE funds unmanned ground system technologies and supports the integration of technologies into representative models or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment and expedites technology transition from the laboratory to operational use. Emphasis is on proving component and subsystem maturity prior to integration in major and complex systems and may involve risk reduction initiatives. Within this PE, funded projects will continue the delivery of advanced technology directed at enhancing the warfighter's capabilities identified during new concept development, operational assessments and field feedback of current unmanned systems. The technologies are generally at TRL 4 or 5 with the intent to mature them through JGRE efforts to TRL 6.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:Text>1)  Human Robot Interface (HRI) for Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) - The purpose of this project is to develop an intuitive user interface (UI) for the family of UGV systems to be fielded under the Advanced EOD Robotic Systems (AEODRS) program. This project will focus specifically on the usability and human robot interface (HRI) design issues. The end result will be a UI that provides a common look and feel across the family of UGVs, fully supports the operator in accomplishing the most common EOD mission tasks and functions, and in general makes the EOD operator’s job easier rather than more difficult. Although this effort is focused on the EOD mission, many of the resulting lessons, UI design techniques, and the underlying software will be applicable to a wide range of UGV systems and missions.
       -  Identified and documented Human-Robot Interface software requirements
       -  Define user interface screens and controls
       -  Update Multi-robot Operator Control Unit (MOCU)
       -  Usability test for HRI system
       -  Final Delivery of MOCU
2)  High Speed Small Tele-operation Command &amp; Control - The purpose of this project is to develop and demonstrate an advanced system to employ UGV-based stability technologies, low latency operator control and feedback, and necessary autonomy to support high speed assisted-tele-operation for small UGVs. High speed tele-operation is defined here as greater than 25 kph on improved surfaces and 15 kph on unimproved surfaces.  This project addresses the problem of sub-optimized robotic performance during military operations due to a lack of operator situational awareness.
       -  Capstone Demonstration of the system
3)  Automated Mobile Communication Relay - This project will develop an automated communications relay on a man-portable robot. The lead robot will be outfitted with sensors that detect pertinent elements in the environment, and communicate them to the communications robot, all transparent to the EOD technician. The initial effort will focus on a robust single relay and then explore extending the approach to include additional relays, perhaps on smaller platforms.  This project is expected to start in FY2012.
4)  Non-Radio Frequency Communication for Small UGVs – This project will research, develop, and evaluate alternative methods to RF communications small UGV.

                                            <r2:Text>1)  Miniature 3D Spatial Phase Sensor - Mature, miniaturize and further develop the 3D Spatial Phase Imaging (SPI) technology. SPI technology addresses fundamental limitations of other sensor technology such as stereo-vision and lidar. The SPI Sensor is not a range sensor but does provide 3D surface detail in far greater resolution than any other technology currently identified. When combined with a ranging technique like stereovision or lidar the SPI Sensor will greatly enhance the perception capabilities of unmanned ground vehicles.
      -  Receive relevant data from 2nd generation sensor at SSCPAC for Government evaluation and algorithm development.  
      -  3rd generation sensor development is currently ahead of schedule but still contains risk due the significant design effort required to miniaturize the Hyper-X processing board to the desired size.

The DoD test bed program exploits the Department's existing built infrastructure to test energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies in three areas: component technologies (i.e., HVAC, lighting, distributed energy generation); system approaches to building energy design, control, and management; and installation-level smart micro-grid technologies.  It is a distributed test bed designed to evaluate energy technologies under the varied climatic conditions and building types DoD manages. The test beds key elements are: 1) competitive selection of new technologies, 2) systematic and consistent evaluation to determine performance, operational readiness and life cycle costs, and 3) development of guidance and design information for future deployment across installations.  This process has been developed, piloted, and validated through previous Congressional funding. Information on existing demonstrations can be found at WWW.SERDP-ESTCP.ORG.</r2:Text>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Humanitarian Demining Research and Development (HD R&amp;D) program element develops, demonstrates and evaluates prototype mine/UXO clearing technologies for U.S. forces and for indigenous, DoD-supported, host nation-conducted demining operations. The HD R&amp;D Program focuses on development of technologies to improve the efficiency and safety of removing post-conflict landmines and UXO, which are a significant danger to U.S. forces performing peace and stability operations, as well as to civilians. The HD R&amp;D Program adapts commercial-off-the-shelf equipment, integrates mature technologies, and leverages R&amp;D activity within DoD, particularly in the Army's Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD) Tactical Countermine mission area.  Equipment capabilities are assessed by host nation demining partners (foreign military, non-governmental organizations and mine action centers) in actual demining conditions.  Since 1995 the Program has fielded technology for 130 evaluations in 36 countries, including Iraq and Afghanistan.  The program aims to improve existing technologies for: mine/UXO detection, technical survey/area reduction, mechanical mine/UXO and vegetation clearance, mine neutralization, individual deminer protection, and post-clearance quality assurance (QA).  Areas of emphasis are identified and validated at a biennial Requirements Workshop held by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict (OASD SO/LIC).  The Requirements Workshop involves representatives from DOS, U.S. combatant commands (COCOMS) and mine-affected nations.  Under OASD SO/LIC, the HD R&amp;D Program works closely with the COCOMS and the Humanitarian Demining Training Center (HDTC) to “support the Warfighter” by reducing insurgent access to explosives, providing engagement opportunities for DoD personnel, and speeding improvements to detection and clearance technologies used by U.S. forces in support of USG operations.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Humanitarian Demining Research and Development (HD R&amp;D) program element develops, demonstrates and evaluates prototype mine/unexploded ordnance (UXO) clearing technologies for U.S. forces and for indigenous, DoD-supported, host nation-conducted demining operations. The HD R&amp;D Program focuses on development of technologies to improve the efficiency and safety of removing post-conflict landmines and UXO, which are a significant danger to U.S. forces performing peace and stability operations, as well as to civilians. The HD R&amp;D Program adapts commercial-off-the-shelf equipment, integrates mature technologies, and leverages R&amp;D activity within DoD, particularly in the Army's Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD) Tactical Countermine mission area.  Equipment capabilities are assessed by host nation demining partners (foreign military, non-governmental organizations and mine action centers) in actual demining conditions.  Since 1995 the Program has fielded technology for 130 evaluations in 36 countries, including Iraq and Afghanistan.  The program aims to improve existing technologies for: mine/UXO detection, technical survey/area reduction, mechanical mine/UXO and vegetation clearance, mine neutralization, individual deminer protection, and post-clearance quality assurance (QA).  Areas of emphasis are identified and validated at a biennial Requirements Workshop held by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict (OASD SO/LIC).  The Requirements Workshop involves representatives from Department of State (DoS), U.S. combatant commands (COCOMS) and mine-affected nations.  Under OASD SO/LIC, the HD R&amp;D Program works closely with the COCOMS and the Humanitarian Demining Training Center (HDTC) to “support the Warfighter” by reducing insurgent access to explosives, providing engagement opportunities for DoD personnel, and speeding improvements to detection and clearance technologies used by U.S. forces in support of USG operations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Following a rapid prototyping strategy, the program emphasizes the use/modification of existing, commercially-available items and components to build functional prototype equipment suited for humanitarian demining operations.  This approach is required due to the immediate need for new demining technologies in the face of ongoing U.S. forces and host nation citizen casualties in mine-affected countries.  The program evaluates prototype equipment by acquiring it off-the-shelf from industry using competition to the extent possible, by leveraging ongoing countermine R&amp;D efforts in other U.S. and foreign R&amp;D activities, and by taking advantage of extensive in-house fabrication capabilities at the Army's Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Division (NVESD).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Long Term Strategies:  Obtain adequate funding to support critical shortfalls; prioritize proposals that are deemed acceptable and allocate funding accordingly; and establish outreach programs to leverage institutional knowledge and expertise.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Coalition Warfare Program (CWP) is the only Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) program dedicated to initiating cooperative research, development, test and evaluation (RDT&amp;E) projects with allies and coalition partners.  CWP projects accelerate the delivery of high-quality solutions to warfighter problems, improve U.S. interoperability with its coalition partners, and strengthen global partnerships.  Projects leverage foreign investments in technology and manpower to address Combatant Command (COCOM) requirements and support DoD RDT&amp;E community undertakings.  CWP can also help program offices convert U.S.-only projects into coalition solutions, with the expenses and benefits shared by the U.S. and international partners.  

Current U.S. military strategy and the global security environment make coalition warfare and multinational operations fundamental features of the U.S. national security strategy.  Coalitions provide a broad-base of technological, operational, and logistical support for military operations and ease the U.S. financial and manpower burdens associated with meeting military goals and objectives.  In addition, effective responses to global humanitarian disasters require broad international, interagency, civilian, and non-governmental coordination.  As national defense budgets decline, but threats to mutual security do not, coalition operations will continue to grow in importance.  

Despite decades of conducting multinational operations, the United States and its partners continue to experience interoperability issues.  Shortcomings in areas such as C4ISR (command, control, communications, and computers and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance), battlespace awareness, and logistics reveal the complexities and challenges associated with multinational air, land, and sea campaigns and encumber warfighters’ abilities to effectively and safely complete missions.  Small investments in interoperability early in the research and development process can help avoid larger expenses related to adding coalition capability later in the development cycle.  Partner nations participate in CWP to the extent permitted by security considerations and when such partnering is advantageous to the U.S. government. </r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Coalition Warfare Program (CWP) is the only Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) program dedicated to initiating cooperative research, development, test and evaluation (RDT&amp;E) projects with allies and coalition partners.  CWP projects accelerate the delivery of high-quality solutions to warfighter problems, improve U.S. interoperability with its coalition partners, and strengthen global partnerships.  Projects leverage foreign investments in technology and manpower to address Combatant Command (COCOM) requirements and support DoD RDT&amp;E community undertakings.  CWP can also help program offices convert U.S.only projects into coalition solutions, with the expenses and benefits shared by the U.S. and international partners.  

Current U.S. military strategy and the global security environment make coalition warfare and multinational operations fundamental features of the U.S. national security strategy.  Coalitions provide a broad-base of technological, operational, and logistical support for military operations and ease the U.S. financial and manpower burdens associated with meeting military goals and objectives.  In addition, effective responses to global humanitarian disasters require broad international, interagency, civilian, and non-governmental coordination.  As national defense budgets decline, but threats to mutual security do not, coalition operations will continue to grow in importance.  

Despite decades of conducting multi-national operations, the United States and its partners continue to experience interoperability issues.  Shortcomings in areas such as C4ISR (command, control, communications, and computers and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance), battlespace awareness, and logistics reveal the complexities and challenges associated with multinational air, land, and sea campaigns and encumber warfighters’ abilities to effectively and safely complete missions.  Small investments in interoperability early in the research and development process can help avoid larger expenses related to adding coalition capability later in the development cycle.  Partner nations participate in the Coalition Warfare Program (CWP) to the extent permitted by security considerations and when such partnering is advantageous to the U.S. government. </r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>(U) The purpose of this program is to develop a comprehensive capability to prevent and mitigate corrosion and its effects on Department of Defense (DoD) weapon systems and infrastructure.  Corrosion severely impacts system and facility reliability, readiness and safety, and consumes a disproportionate amount of material and labor hours for repair and treatment of corrosion damaged systems and facilities.  The cost of corrosion across the DoD has been estimated at over 23 billion each year. The impact and cost of corrosion are so pervasive that Congress enacted Public Law 107-314 Sec: 1067 [portions codified in 10 U.S.C. 2228]: Prevention and mitigation of corrosion of military infrastructure and equipment.  This legislation requires that DoD develop a long-term corrosion strategy to include establishment of a coordinated R&amp;D program with transition plans.  The legislation also requires that DoD designate a responsible official or organization to oversee a corrosion prevention and mitigation program.  The responsibilities of the Director, Corrosion Policy and Oversight and the Military Department Corrosion Prevention and Control Executives were further delineated in DODI 5000.67 "Prevention and Mitigation of Corrosion on Military Equipment and Infrastructure" of 01 February 2010.
 
(U) The Deputy Secretary of Defense designated the Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics) (PDUSD(AT&amp;L)) as the DoD Corrosion Executive in May 2003.  The DoD Corrosion Executive subsequently established a Corrosion Control and Oversight office to implement the program.  Subsequently, in accordance with Section 371 of the 2008 National Defense Authorization Act, the Under Secretary of Defense (USD(AT&amp;L)) designated a Director, Corrosion Policy and Oversight to perform the duties of the DoD Corrosion Executive with responsibilities as described in the 2008 NDAA legislation.  A major responsibility of the Director, Corrosion Policy and Oversight is to select high payoff research and development projects that promise to prevent or mitigate corrosion and significantly reduce the total cost of corrosion along with the adverse impact of corrosion effects on weapon system and infrastructure operational capability.  This office chartered a Corrosion Prevention and Control Integrated Product Team (CPCIPT) that has selected and funded Operation and Maintenance projects for each Fiscal Year (FY) commencing in FY 2005. However, the DoD CPCIPT has determined that the biggest payoff in corrosion prevention and mitigation will come from investing in up-front prevention technologies, materials, and processes to leverage downstream cost avoidance in corrosion maintenance and repair.  Likewise, development of improved predictive and prognostic techniques can eliminate unseen failure and reduce unnecessary maintenance and repair costs.  Thus, technology development, demonstration, and transition projects have been selected and funded since FY 2006.  In FY 2009, the Military Departments assigned corrosion executives and began submitting reports to Congress on inserting corrosion planning into the acquisition process. The FY 2011 NDAA added a requirement for the DoD to report the amount of funds requested in the preceding year budget for each planned project or activity, as compared to the funding required for each project or activity.  These funds provide a portion of the funds used to implement associated corrosion control projects and activities.
 
(U) The Corrosion Prevention Control Integrated Product Team membership consists of both the equipment and infrastructure corrosion control experts from the Services, the Joint Staff, the Coast Guard, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.  The Services are given project submission instructions, evaluation procedures and selection criteria.  The CPC project selection board, chaired by the Director, Corrosion Policy and Oversight, reviews the projects and makes recommendations to the USD(AT&amp;L) for final approval.

(U) The former DoD Corrosion Executive issued a policy letter that states: "Basic systems design, materials and processes selection, and intrinsic corrosion-prevention strategies establish the corrosion susceptibility of Defense material.  The early stages of acquisition provide our best opportunity to make effective trade-offs among the many competing design criteria. . ."  The Congress and former DoD Corrosion Executive made it clear that research and development into materials and methods to prevent or mitigate corrosion should receive high priority.  Since Congress has clearly established this program as one of its highest priorities, and has reiterated its expectations regarding funding levels and methods, our budget request is designed to reflect both fiscal realities of one or more on many proposed projects over the next five to ten years.
 
These projects address critical corrosion issues in both Department of Defense infrastructure as well as warfighting systems.  A number of low-risk, high-payoff technologies promise to vastly improve the service life and significantly reduce the maintenance costs of storage tanks and other mission support facilities essential to maintain support for the warfighter.  Each of the services has identified important projects that vastly increase operational readiness and reduce operations and maintenance costs.  All services are studying corrosion inhibitors that improve reliability and life of electrical and avionics equipment.  Likewise, an array of highly effective, rapid cure coatings that are easy to apply and can forestall corrosion for many years on aircraft and ships are being developed.  Other vital projects being considered include sealants, wash down systems, sensors and prognostic technologies that have joint service applications and potential to prevent and mitigate corrosion and its effects over a wide range of systems.  The FY 2012 budget request will provide a critically needed resource to trigger even larger investment and cost avoidance.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>U) The purpose of this program is to develop a comprehensive capability to prevent and mitigate corrosion and its effects on Department of Defense (DoD) weapon systems and infrastructure.  Corrosion severely impacts system and facility reliability, readiness and safety, and consumes a disproportionate amount of material and labor hours for repair and treatment of corrosion damaged systems and facilities.  The cost of corrosion across the DoD has been estimated at over 23 billion each year. The impact and cost of corrosion are so pervasive that Congress enacted Public Law 107-314 Sec: 1067 [portions codified in 10 U.S.C. 2228]: Prevention and mitigation of corrosion of military infrastructure and equipment.  This legislation requires that DoD develop a long-term corrosion strategy to include establishment of a coordinated R&amp;D program with transition plans.  The legislation also requires that DoD designate a responsible official or organization to oversee a corrosion prevention and mitigation program.  The responsibilities of the Director, Corrosion Policy and Oversight and the Military Department Corrosion Prevention and Control Executives were further delineated in DODI 5000.67 "Prevention and Mitigation of Corrosion on Military Equipment and Infrastructure" of 01 February 2010.
 
(U) The Deputy Secretary of Defense designated the Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics) (PDUSD(AT&amp;L)) as the DoD Corrosion Executive in May 2003.  The DoD Corrosion Executive subsequently established a Corrosion Control and Oversight office to implement the program.  Subsequently, in accordance with Section 371 of the 2008 National Defense Authorization Act, the Under Secretary of Defense (USD(AT&amp;L)) designated a Director, Corrosion Policy and Oversight to perform the duties of the DoD Corrosion Executive with responsibilities as described in the 2008 NDAA legislation.  A major responsibility of the Director, Corrosion Policy and Oversight is to select high payoff research and development projects that promise to prevent or mitigate corrosion and significantly reduce the total cost of corrosion along with the adverse impact of corrosion effects on weapon system and infrastructure operational capability.  This office chartered a Corrosion Prevention and Control Integrated Product Team (CPCIPT) that has selected and funded Operation and Maintenance projects for each Fiscal Year (FY) commencing in FY 2005. However, the DoD CPCIPT has determined that the biggest payoff in corrosion prevention and mitigation will come from investing in up-front prevention technologies, materials, and processes to leverage downstream cost avoidance in corrosion maintenance and repair.  Likewise, development of improved predictive and prognostic techniques can eliminate unseen failure and reduce unnecessary maintenance and repair costs.  Thus, technology development, demonstration, and transition projects have been selected and funded since FY 2006.  In FY 2009, the Military Departments assigned corrosion executives and began submitting reports to Congress on inserting corrosion planning into the acquisition process. The FY 2011 NDAA added a requirement for the DoD to report the amount of funds requested in the preceding year budget for each planned project or activity, as compared to the funding required for each project or activity.  These funds provide a portion of the funds used to implement associated corrosion control projects and activities.
 
(U) The Corrosion Prevention Control Integrated Product Team membership consists of both the equipment and infrastructure corrosion control experts from the Services, the Joint Staff, the Coast Guard, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.  The Services are given project submission instructions, evaluation procedures and selection criteria.  The CPC project selection board, chaired by the Director, Corrosion Policy and Oversight, reviews the projects and makes recommendations to the USD(AT&amp;L) for final approval.

(U) The former DoD Corrosion Executive issued a policy letter that states: "Basic systems design, materials and processes selection, and intrinsic corrosion-prevention strategies establish the corrosion susceptibility of Defense material.  The early stages of acquisition provide our best opportunity to make effective trade-offs among the many competing design criteria. . ."  The Congress and former DoD Corrosion Executive made it clear that research and development into materials and methods to prevent or mitigate corrosion should receive high priority.  Since Congress has clearly established this program as one of its highest priorities, and has reiterated its expectations regarding funding levels and methods, our budget request is designed to reflect both fiscal realities of one or more on many proposed projects over the next five to ten years.
 
These projects address critical corrosion issues in both Department of Defense infrastructure as well as warfighting systems.  A number of low-risk, high-payoff technologies promise to vastly improve the service life and significantly reduce the maintenance costs of storage tanks and other mission support facilities essential to maintain support for the warfighter.  Each of the services has identified important projects that vastly increase operational readiness and reduce operations and maintenance costs.  All services are studying corrosion inhibitors that improve reliability and life of electrical and avionics equipment.  Likewise, an array of highly effective, rapid cure coatings that are easy to apply and can forestall corrosion for many years on aircraft and ships are being developed.  Other vital projects being considered include sealants, wash down systems, sensors and prognostic technologies that have joint service applications and potential to prevent and mitigate corrosion and its effects over a wide range of systems.  The FY 2012 budget request will provide a critically needed resource to trigger even larger investment and cost avoidance.

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>There is an annual Corrosion Prevention and Control Integrated Project Team (CPCIPT) call for proposed project plans in April.  Projects are submitted by the Services annually in June.  The project plan format is contained in the DoD Corrosion Prevention and Mitigation Strategic Plan.  Each project plan contains:   
1. Problem statement:  Description of the problem or situation, including background, history, issues, operational problems and support costs.   
2. Impact statement:  Details regarding why project is important including description of the operational and/or logistic impact if no action is taken.   
3. Technical description:  Definition of the corrosion prevention and control objective and description of the system affected by this project; applicable technologies and associated development; expected operations and logistics performance improvement characteristics; brief description of the user community and how it will apply to their mission; and current acquisition status.    
4. Risk analysis:  Description of the risk in managing/developing/prototyping/ testing/qualifying/manufacturing/completing the technical effort including assumptions that could affect project development or implementation.   
5. Proposed phases:  If project is complex and will be performed in phases, description of each phase objective.   
6. Expected deliverables and results or outcomes:  Description of products to be delivered such as type/number of hardware, technical orders/drawings, installation, training, etc.; and description of expected operations and/or logistics performance improvements.   
7. Program management:  Description of the overall approach and tasks to be taken to accomplish the project, including organization, coordination and acquisition approach.   
8. Cost/benefit analysis:  Definition of all resources necessary to accomplish project, description of resulting benefits, computation of Return-On-Investment (ROI), documentation of mission criticality, and description of joint applicability.   
9. Schedule:  Milestone chart showing all significant events through project completion.   
10. Implementation plan:  Explanation of how the project will be implemented when completed including a description of the transition approach, and plans to evaluate ROI during the first two years of implementation.   
   
The Corrosion Prevention and Control Integrated Project Team (CPCIPT) receives project plans and engages an evaluation panel to review proposed projects and make recommendations regarding project selection.  Projects are also evaluated using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to rank projects by relative efficiency.  DEA factors include project performance period, ratio of OSD funding to Service funding, return-on-investment (ROI), degree to which the proposed technology addresses high-cost corrosion problems, potential benefits, and joint service applicability.  DEA efficiency scores are provided to the evaluation team to assist in their prioritization of projects for funding.  In addition, evaluators consider the following in recommending final priorities:
1. Return on investment credibility: Degree to which there is evidence that the project will achieve an acceptable return on investment
2. Technology maturity:  Degree to which proposed technology has been developed or demonstrated and will satisfy project objectives 
3. Schedule confidence:  Degree to which the project is likely to be completed on time
4. Budget confidence:  Degree to which the project is likely to be completed within the proposed budget
5. Management support: Degree to which management actively supports this project and has committed program resources to both manage and support this project
The project priority ranking is finalized and sent to the CPCIPT lead for a final decision..  Upon acceptance and approval of the projects by the CPCIPT, the projects are briefed to the Corrosion Forum.  Funding is distributed between the Services based on funding priorities associated with the evaluation process results.     
   
Upon selection by CPCIPT of the highest priority projects and final funding approval, Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) transfers individual project funding to the appropriate funding sites that are provided by the Services.  After receiving the project funding, the Services are responsible for the funding and management of the projects.  OSD retains oversight and direction of the Corrosion Prevention and Control initiative through the CPCIPT.  Project oversight includes the review of quarterly status reports which address progress summary, performance goals and metrics and upcoming key events, as well as reports to periodic Corrosion Forums.   
   
The quarterly project report (PR) format has been defined and requires the following input:   
1. Statement of progress 
2. Outstanding issues 
3. Performance goals and metrics 
4. Upcoming events
5. Schedule status 
6. Current return on investment (ROI) status 
These project reports (PRs) are submitted to the CPCIPT.  The CPCIPT analyzes project status, progress and project statistics and informs the Service points of contact (POCs) of any project problems.  Projects are also required to report verbally at Corrosion Forums, as appropriate.   
   
Corrosion Prevention and Control (CPC) Program direction, control and oversight include the following activities to be performed by staff and support contractors:   
1. Plan and schedule Corrosion Forums and oversee Corrosion Forum activities and working Integrated Product Team (IPT) meetings.   
2. Oversee project performance including review of quarterly status reports which address progress summary, performance goals and metrics and upcoming key events, as well as reports to periodic Corrosion Forums.   
3. Perform Department of Defense (DoD) cost of corrosion study.   
4. Develop improved, standard DoD-wide specifications, standards and qualification processes.   
5. Develop corrosion training courses.   
6. Prepare and publish Corrosion Prevention and Control Planning Guidebook spirals.   
7. Prepare and publish annual Reports to Congress. 
8. Update short-term and long-term metrics.   
9. Develop corrosion control program management guide for selecting materials.   
10. Develop, implement, and update the DoD Corrosion Prevention and Mitigation Strategic Plan.   
11. Develop and maintain Roadmaps of IPT activities and accomplishments.   
12. Assist in the annual project plan implementation and evaluation process, including the assessment of return on investment associated with proposed projects. 
13. Respond to Congressional, Government Accountability Office and DoD inquiries regarding the CPC Program. 
14. Perform CPC Program communication and outreach to services, agencies and other organizations. 
15.  Develop and implement corrosion prevention and control policies applicable for acquisition and sustainment of both weapons systems and infrastructure.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Department plans to transition from the U-2 to the Global Hawk (GH), but today's restrictions on airspace access preclude this.  GH and the Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS) UAS, also an RQ-4 aircraft, need an autonomous, sense-and-avoid (SAA) as an alternate means of compliance to Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 91.113, requirement to see-and-avoid other aircraft.  MQ-1 Predator, MQ-1C Gray Eagle, and MQ-9 Reaper have similar requirements for SAA capability; their SAA technology development will leverage the GH/BAMS technology. Development of a Ground Based Sense-and-Avoid (GBSAA) system using existing technology can provide a near-term solution for improved airspace access, both for terminal operations (e.g., Beale AFB, GH transit to/from controlled airspace) and for operations/training within the GBSAA system's coverage area (e.g., Gray Eagle at El Mirage, Shadow operations at Cherry Point).
 
Provides joint funding for the BAMS and GH programs to accelerate the development of a common onboard, autonomous SAA (ABSAA) capability (one upon which a similar SAA system for Predator, Gray Eagle and Reaper can be based).    BAMS program is the lead for the ABSAA development.  Also, provides a GBSAA capability to meet DoD training and operational objectives at locations where airspace restrictions currently limit training and operations, and establishes dedicated funding to develop standards, modeling and simulation tools, and technology to enable DoD UAS to routinely access the national and international airspace systems.

Initiated development for a common, ABSAA system that satisfies common sense-and-avoid requirements of the United States Air Force (USAF) Global Hawk (GH) and United States Navy (USN) Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS) Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) that is scalable to medium-altitude UAS. The program successfully conducted a System Requirements Review (SRR) and System Functional Review (SFR).   
Standards Development - Developed and initiated plan for development of UAS airworthiness certification criteria, standards, and methods of compliance for both fixed and rotary wing UAS (GCS and links included) for incorporation into MIL-HDBK-516. Developed, assessed, &amp; published evolutionary DoD UAS Airspace Integration CONOPS defining the airspace use profiles. Initiated the development of a consistent methodology across all Military Services for developing a UAS Safety Case and a mid-air target level of safety (TLS) for UAS operations in all classes of airspace. Completed Target Level of Safety series of workshops and Safety Case Analysis of Alternatives. Developed UAS Airspace Integration Recommended Requirements for Terminal Area Operations, and a Sense and Avoid Blueprint tracking tool and definitions for Core Capabilities, Cross-Cutting Capabilities, and SAA attributes. Created UAS Profile Selection Guide and Visual Line of Sight Recommended Practices Guide.  
Modeling &amp; Simulation (M&amp;S) - Completed 2011 Modeling and Simulation Roadmap and UAS Technical Standards Development Process. 
GBSAA – The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) granted the first Certification of Authorization (COA) allowing UAS flight in the NAS with a GBSAA system for operations at El Mirage, CA.  In addition, Cherry Point MCAS made strides in FAA/NAVAIR system certification process with a COA approved for GBSAA test/data collection period, augmented with visual observers.  In executing these first GBSAA-enabled UAS flights in the NAS, experiences in the following areas were gained: refinement of the process for safety case development and subsequent FAA approval; establishment of a data collection and mitigation tracking process to fulfill service certification and FAA requirements; and identification of an end-to-end process for developing, testing, qualifying, and implementing a GBSAA system.  These flights utilized the first stage of GBSAA capability.  The Phase 1 capability was advanced in the areas of data fusion, target classification, safety case development and initial algorithm design for maneuvering in airspace with other aircraft.  A parallel development effort was conducted for Phase 2 (self-separation, including work on advanced maneuver algorithm requirements, optical sensor trade studies, and Human-Machine Interface (HMI) Studies for an improved user interface.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Human Social Culture Behavior (HSCB) Modeling Program is a vertically integrated effort to research, develop, and transition technologies, tools, and systems to programs of record and users in need. The Program exists to optimize U.S. forces’ ability to perform population-centric sensing, understand behaviors driven by social and cultural variables, and take effective courses of action in the full range of military operations. Program research enhances intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities for understanding the Irregular Warfare environment and meeting the challenges of instability and violent extremism. Under three integrated program elements (PEs), the Program conducts applied research, matures and demonstrates advanced technology, and develops transition-ready components and prototypes. Work under PE 0604670D8Z creates transition-ready software tools that help intelligence analysts, operations analysts, operations planners, wargamers, and others represent, understand, and forecast sociocultural behavior at the strategic, operational and tactical levels. This program focuses on maturing, hardening, and validating human, social, culture, and behavior modeling software for transition to meet the needs of the warfighter, integration into the architectures of existing programs of record, and/or maturing software via open architectures to allow broad systems integration. The 6.4 program provides a development to product transition pathway for sociocultural models, tools, and capabilities to rapidly meet immediate and emerging warfighter needs. The work supports the testing, validation, and transition of model-based technology into existing and developing systems in coordination with Program Executive Offices/Program Managers, Combatant Commanders, Joint and Service organizations, warfighters in need, and other transition customers. The Program matures sociocultural relevant data and tools to provide essential sociocultural understanding and forecasting capabilities at the strategic, operational and tactical levels. </r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Program creates transition-ready software tools that help intelligence analysts, operations analysts, operations planners, wargamers, and others represent, understand, and forecast sociocultural behavior at the strategic, operational and tactical levels. The Program focuses on maturing, hardening, and validating human, social, culture, and behavior modeling software for transition to meet the needs of the warfighter, integration into the architectures of existing programs of record, and/or maturing software via open architectures to allow broad systems integration. The 6.4 Program provides a development to product transition pathway for sociocultural models, tools, and capabilities to rapidly meet immediate and emerging warfighter needs. The work supports the testing, validation, and transition of model-based technology into existing and developing systems in coordination with Program Executive Offices/Program Managers, Combatant Commanders, Joint and Service organizations, warfighters in need, and other transition customers. The Program matures sociocultural relevant data and tools to provide essential forecasting capabilities at the strategic, operational and tactical levels. </r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:Text>-  This program element (PE) establishes the dedicated funding to carry out the duties as described in the FY 2011 National Defense Authorization Act for the rapid insertion of innovative technologies into military systems or into programs that meet critical national security needs, such as those articulated through a Joint Urgent Operational Need (JUON) statement. The Defense Rapid Innovation Program (RIP) emphasizes rapid response acquisition and the engagement of small innovative businesses in solving defense problems. The Department did not request funds for RIP in either FY11 or FY12.

- The Rapid Innovation Program goals involve: transitioning Small Business Innovation Research Phase II projects that resolve JUONs or other critical national security needs into acquisition programs to include Acquisition Category I-IA, II, III, IV programs; leveraging ideas and technologies developed by the small business community and DoD-reimbursed Independent Research and Development (IR&amp;D) defense industrial base tier 2 and 3 suppliers that solve DoD's operational challenges.

JSIC serves as the technical analysis and operational assessment activity in support of the Joint Staff capability-driven requirements process, the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS).  JSIC also serves as a joint interoperability compliance activity for the milestone decision authorities/program managers in the Defense acquisition enterprise.

The FY 2005 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) directed the transfer for Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) funding for joint warfare experimentation and training programs from Navy accounts to new Defense Wide RDT&amp;E accounts beginning in FY 2007.  Joint Staff J8 is the executive agent for the JSIC PE and Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD (R&amp;E)) provides execution oversight.

JSIC provides Combatant Commands, at the joint force headquarters level, with a laboratory and assessment environment for the warfighter and capability developer.  This environment provides for assessment of current and near-term joint and coalition capabilities primarily at the operational and tactical levels. JSIC's Persistent Command and Control (C2) Environment accurately replicates an operational C2 environment. With this capability, JSIC assesses system of systems interoperability, operational capability, procedural compliance and technical suitability of emerging and existing systems and programs to confirm readiness for deployment.  Through JSIC's analysis and assessment, systems are evaluated for "value-added" prior to employment in joint and coalition environments typical of deployed theaters of operation.  

By establishing ground truth for interoperability and suggesting remedies for demonstrated shortfalls, JSIC is an enabler for interoperable joint and coalition solutions and provides a means to foster rapid, near-term insertion of C4ISR technology by promoting the ability to meet the DoD direction for spiral development and evolutionary acquisition.  JSIC's mission is to provide for the fielding of warfighter C2 systems through rapid systems integration, technical assessment, and operational evaluation using laboratory environments and field venues.  In the world of C2 and ISR interoperability, performance in the field is the bottom line. In terms of investment, JSIC is the "ounce of prevention" that precludes a "pound" of mission failure and loss of life due to interoperability failures in military operations.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Title>Capability Assessment</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>Primary Outcome (objective) for this effort is to provide objective based assessment of  Doctrine, Organizational, Training, Materiel, Leadership, Personnel, Facilities (DOTMLPF) solution sets supporting the Joint Task Force Commander.  JSIC will analyze COCOM near-term requirements using DOTMLPF criteria.  JSIC will identify current, emerging, or mature technologies to address materiel requirements.  Comprehensive assessments covering joint maturity, interoperability, warfighter utility, and operational effectiveness will be conducted on legacy and transformational projects.  JSIC will provide DOTMLPF recommendations on fielding strategies for Joint Staff endorsement.

The primary outputs and efficiencies realized are: 1) Increased number of recommended improvements that enhance the capability of Joint Task Force Headquarters (JTF HQ); 2) Increased number of verifiable capability solutions recommended for fielding to the Combatant Commander based on quantified capability improvements; 3) Increased empirical data to support benefit-cost ratio improvements of JTF HQ investment decisions to ensure JTF HQs command and control (C2) capabilities are interoperable from technical and operational standpoints; 4) Increased number of assessments conducted that identify current force JTF HQs C2 systems that are interoperable and supported, that inform and recommend solutions to integrate, modify, or retire current force systems; 5) Increased number of assessment based recommendations of technology solutions that address the military utility of proposed and existing Service solutions; and  6) Increased number of solutions deployed with recognized DOTMLPF impacts.

Program Management offices benefit because the JSIC program provides a venue for Military Utility Assessments (MUAs) of technologies before committing to implementation.  The potential savings associated with finding existing commercial technologies to provide gap filler solutions, and avoid the fielding of systems that are not interoperable or that fail to meet warfighter needs, are difficult to quantify.  Potentially life-threatening shortfalls are identified and fixed in advance of fielding.  Services benefit directly by reduced Program Manager costs and by fielding systems that are interoperable and meet warfighter needs.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Joint Fires Integration &amp; Interoperability Team (JFIIT) funded by this program is a compact cell of unique Joint fires experts adding value to much larger Service investments in force elements delivering kinetic and non kinetic effects supporting ground operations. Services, Joint, and Combatant Commanders and their Staffs proactively seek JFIIT advice and assistance to improve the execution of combat fires applied in complex coalition and joint environments.   

Prior to Fiscal Year 2007, funding to support the JFIIT Program originated in the Navy's Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) Program Element 0603857N.  Subsequent realignment brought the JFIIT Program into oversight by Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD R&amp;E) and converted the program element into a Defense-wide account. 

Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memorandum (JROCM) 183-4, dated 8 October 2004, directed United States Joint Forces Command (USJFCOM) to establish a Joint Fires Support Organization.  JROCM 241-05, dated 3 November 2005, validated the JFIIT mission.  USJFCOM Directive Number 5170.2 dated 30 November 2007, Charter for JFIIT, assigns JFIIT responsibility to improve Joint fires planning, training and execution as a critical capability for deployed joint warfighters.  

The JFIIT mission is to improve the integration, interoperability, and operational effectiveness of Joint fires.  JFIIT takes a holistic approach to improving Joint fires by providing solutions that produce effective target acquisition, command and control, and interoperable firing systems, thereby reducing fratricide and collateral damage.  This results in not only near-term tactical identification of issues and solutions, but also informs and provides a foundation for short and long-term operational and tactical capabilities. </r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>Employ scientific methods to research, investigate, test, assess, and evaluate current and emerging Joint fires capabilities.  These activities identify shortfalls and root cause, verify recommended solutions, and validate joint capabilities.  The resultant empirical outcomes influence Joint Capability development in areas such as Joint Tactics, Techniques and Procedures; integration of service capabilities; and digital interoperability, and can inform acquisition decisions.

The emphasis of JFIIT Assessment efforts is the evaluation of Joint fires and combat identification to provide Services and Agencies findings and recommendations based on quantifiable data in order to improve Joint fires. JFIIT collects and analyzes data and provides observations, findings, conclusions, and recommendations to identify Joint doctrine, tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) and material solutions and products that promote capability improvement. Evaluations range from small, single-focus events to large, multi event/ venue exercises.

JFIIT conducts assessments in conjunction with Service and Combatant Command (COCOM) exercises, experiments, and test &amp; evaluation events. The emphasis of this JFIIT effort is assessing Joint fires and combat identification capabilities to ensure that Services and Agencies field interdependent and interoperable systems. 

The primary outputs and efficiencies include:
- Improvement in the Services’ ability to employ Joint fires.
- Recommendations for system integration and interoperability.
- Ability to include Joint context during new system acquisition or development. 
- Development of Joint fires related Universal Joint Tasks (UJT).
- Updates and revisions to Joint fires related doctrine, TTP, and other Joint publications.
- Development and refinement of analytical tools (i.e. Data Collection Architecture for Analytical Feedback (DCAAF), Joint Windows-based Warfare Assessment Model (JWinWAM)).
- Recommended solutions integrated within the Joint Staff Joint Capabilities Integration Development System (JCIDS) and OSD Joint C2 Capability Portfolio Manager (JC2 CPM) processes.
- Identification of specific key performance parameters (KPPs) and key system attributes (KSAs) for new systems that meet Joint warfighter operational requirements to ensure Services and Agencies field interdependent and interoperable systems.
- Increased effectiveness and confidence in combat identification and a reduction in fratricide.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology &amp; Logistics) defined the mission for the Reduction in Total Ownership Cost (R-TOC) program as the reduction of ownership costs for defense systems.  The R-TOC program funded activities and initiatives that:

1. Increased the reliability, maintainability, and supportability; thereby increasing readiness of new or existing defense systems.
2. Reduced logistics footprint.
3. Generated future cost reductions in total ownership cost.

Individual Service Projects are complete efforts within themselves that yield complete developments/redesigns which the Services are committed to put into production and operation.  The initiatives optimized cost avoidance, which ultimately reduce the operating and support costs for systems.  Each project was evaluated against a rigorous set of criteria to assess its viability and probability of success.  Individual projects addressed specific Service needs and high Operations and Support (O&amp;S) cost areas.

The Department set a FY 2010 R-TOC goal of reducing the total defense systems inflation increase in O&amp;S cost by 30 percent between FY 2004 and FY 2010.  This PE provided a major portion of the program funding to achieve this goal.  The successful demonstration of the R-TOC program initiatives stimulated additional initiatives by the Services to achieve even greater cost avoidance.  In FY 2012 the program devolves to the Services.

Individual R-TOC Project Management will continue to rest with the Services and their Project Managers after being devolved.  Each Service has an active R-TOC Point of Contact (POC) for the initial interface between the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and the R-TOC Project Managers.

The average Return on Investment (ROI) for FY 2010 projects (based on discounted cash flow calculations) is approximately 80:1 with $1.333 billion in cost avoidance across the life cycle of the affected systems.  The average ROI for the FY 2011 projects (based on discounted cash flow calculations) is approximately 53:1 with $2.049 billion in cost avoidance across the life cycle of the affected systems.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Under Secretary of Defense, Acquisition, Technology &amp; Logistics (USD(AT&amp;L)), defined the mission for the Reduction in Total Ownership Cost (R-TOC) program as the reduction of ownership costs for defense systems.  The R-TOC program funded activities and initiatives that:

1.  Increased the reliability, maintainability, and supportability, thereby, increasing readiness of new or existing defense systems.
2.  Reduced logistics footprint.
3.  Generated future cost reductions in total ownership cost.
 
These individual initiatives were complete efforts within themselves that yield complete redesigns which the Services were committed to put into production and operation.  The initiatives optimize cost avoidance, which ultimately reduce the operating and support (O&amp;S) costs for systems.
 
The Department set an FY 2010 R-TOC goal of reducing the total defense systems inflation increase in operations and support cost by 30 percent between FY 2004 (baseline) and FY 2010.  In FY 2011, the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) will transition the program to the Services.  OSD will only fund those projects that will be completed during FY 2011.  There will be no R-TOC PE funded carry-over projects into FY 2012.  The Services will assume responsibility for the program in FY 2012.
 
The average Return on Investment (ROI) for FY 2009 projects (based on discounted cash flow calculations) is approximately 45:1 with $1.174 billion in cost avoidances across the life cycle of the affected systems.  The average ROI for the FY 2010 projects (based on discounted cash flow calculations) is approximately 80:1 with $1.333 billion in cost avoidances across the life cycle of the affected systems.

Cost avoidances established for the projects listed below are based on engineering estimates of the benefits provided by project implementations. Sources of cost avoidances are defined as part of the project submittal and come from any O&amp;S cost source (fewer spares, lower maintenance hours, faster turnaround times, reduced scheduled maintenance, reliability/maintainability/supportability problems, etc.). </r2:Description>

                                            <r2:Text>In FY 2011, OSD transitioned the program to the Services.  OSD will only fund those projects that are completed during FY 2011.  No R-TOC funded carry-over projects into FY 2012.  The Services assume responsibility for the program in FY 2012.

The primary objective of the projects listed below continued to be the reduction of O&amp;S costs for the affected systems. 

Army Projects: 
- The Army continued six FY 2010 projects and completed these projects in FY 2011.  The HH-60 Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) work continued to redesign the HH-60 FLIR turret to prevent damage during hovering and landings by reducing the size of the turret.  
- The Special Operations Forces (SOF) Common Avionics Architecture System (CAAS) continued work to demonstrate a common interface for the CAAS software.  The goal was to integrate the CAAS interface solution into existing and future virtual flight training simulators significantly reducing the costs to modify, recompile, and port training simulation software.  
- The UH-72A project continued to evaluate and implement a coating process to improve the reliability of the UH-72A main rotor blade in harsh environments.  
- The need for the Hellfire Warhead missile to carry multiple warhead models adds unnecessary operational burden.  The Army proposed to develop a new combined warhead to accept three different warhead configurations into a single package for the Hellfire missile replacing the current three variants. 

Navy Projects:  The Navy continued one FY 2010 project and started and completed ten new projects in FY 2011.  The primary themes for FY 2011 were power conservation, better corrosion control through improved surface coatings, and maintenance cost reductions through streamlining.  
- General illumination standards employed the use of fluorescent and incandescent lighting fixtures that had a short service life and were energy inefficient.  One of the conservation projects included the replacement of legacy fluorescent lighting with LED lighting on test ship (USS PEARL HARBOR) to lower maintenance and energy costs.  
- LHA-1 and LHD-1 Class Ships have directional stability issues.  Tests with other types of ships have shown that appendages installed to eliminate these maneuvering issues reduced total energy costs by improving the steering.  
- The Navy proposed to reduce weight and maintenance costs by eliminating some current Electronic Cooling Water systems on DDG 51 and CG 47 Class Surface Combatants to reduce weight and chill water system load requirements.  These systems used the ship’s chilled water instead of demineralized electronic cooling water.  
- To control corrosion O&amp;S costs the Navy proposed the use of prototype cameras in shipboard tank voids to analyze condition and structural degradation eliminating the need to open tank.  The Navy also proposed to test alternative corrosion coatings on shipboard crash-cranes to reduce excessive corrosion related maintenance costs.  
- The Navy proposed to redesign the night vision goggles used in tactical aircraft because ½ AA batteries are very expensive compared to AA alkaline batteries and are not readily available aboard ship or while forward deployed.  The deliverable was redesigned AN/AVS-9 mounts that were capable of using AA alkaline batteries, which resulted in increased durability and better electromagnetic performance.  
- Naval Seas Systems Command (NAVSEA) introduced the use of conditioned based maintenance practices in the new LCS class ships and mission modules to help control O&amp;S costs. 
- NAVSEA proposed upgrading high-maintenance components in shipboard munitions transporters to reduce maintenance requirements.  This project extended the periodic maintenance to a 5-year minimum and extended the service life of current assets to 25 years.  
- Naval Air Systems Command proposed to establish common procedures and practices for Airborne ForceNet (Afn) network maintenance, troubleshooting, and updates.   This was applied immediately to EP-3 and P-3AIP platforms and will extend to P-8A and Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS).  
- The Next Gen Navy Cash project leveraged the industry electronic banking advances to streamline shipboard banking and expenditure transactions for Sailors at sea.  The potential savings were equivalent to 31 percent of existing program costs.

Air Force Projects: The USAF continued eleven projects started in FY 2010 and completed the projects in FY 2011.  Nine projects were applicable across multiple systems to leverage investment funding.  The projects included improving maintenance of the F-119 jet engine Integrally Bladed Rotor; eight projects focused on improving mid-level and depot level processes; and an effort to identify and qualify laser based alternatives to Metal Inert Gas (MIG), Tungsten Inert Gas (TIG), and electron beam (EB) manual welding processes for repairing F-15 and F-16.</r2:Text>

DAC funds the test and evaluation of technologies and products with potential to improve performance, affordability, manufacturability, or operational capability of current acquisition programs at the subcomponent, component, or system level.
 
Since the program inception in FY 2003, Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD) has initiated 151 projects; 96 projects have been completed to date; 69 met Service or Agency testing requirements and 49 led to procurements with technology currently in use by our warfighters in Iraq, Afghanistan, or at U.S. training facilities.  Given the program tests developed equipment, Service and United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) program managers report that the average Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) and Operations and Support (O&amp;S) non-recurring cost avoidance is at least 5-to-1.

The DAC program provides the Department an efficiency that is not generally recognized.  With centralized DAC funding in OSD, funding can be readily moved among the Services and USSOCOM to take advantage of emerging opportunities and fund joint projects.

DAC increases opportunities for domestic vendors to enter the DoD acquisition process.  Although business size is not an evaluation criterion, approximately 60 percent of the projects awarded are with technology providers at the small or mid-sized enterprise level.  DAC has the additional DoD/National Security benefit of expanding the industrial base for Defense acquisition.

DAC provides opportunities for the increased introduction of innovative and cost-saving technology in acquisition programs of the DoD.  DAC funding is used to fund testing of commercial and non-developmental items that could result in improvements in performance, affordability, manufacturability, or operational capability of an existing acquisition program.  It is expected that, should testing be successful, the cognizant acquisition program of record will procure.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

The title of this objective is "Speed technology transition focused on war-fighting needs" and the metrics for this objective is to transition 30 percent of completing demonstrations program per year. From program inception in 2003 until 2010, the Office of Secretary of Defense has initiated 151 projects; 96 projects have been completed to date; 69 met Service or Agency testing requirements and 49 led to procurements with technology currently in use by our warfighters in Iraq, Afghanistan, or at U.S. training facilities.  The FY 2011 DAC will have a transition rate of 80 percent for completed projects, exceeds the objective of 30 percent for demonstration programs (Strategic Objective 4-2D, Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Acquisition, Technology &amp; Logistics (OUSD (AT&amp;L)).  FY 2012 we anticipate the majority of our FY 2011 projects to complete successfully and transition to the warfighter.   </r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) addresses the need to defend and deter against weapons of mass destruction (WMD) threats and to safeguard personnel; prevent unauthorized access to equipment, installations, material, and documents; and to safeguard the foregoing against espionage, sabotage, damage, and theft.  This program oversees advanced engineering development throughout DoD for an integrated and systemic RDT&amp;E approach for countering nuclear threats and nuclear and conventional physical security equipment (PSE) technology and systems.  The funding has been centralized in this Defense-wide PE since the early 1990s and represents a substantial portion of all DoD PSE RDT&amp;E funding.  Priorities for this PE RDT&amp;E efforts are driven by inputs from Quadrennial Defense Review guidance, Combatant Command and Service requirements, analysis reports such as “Protecting the Force:  Lessons from Fort Hood, January 2010, the Integrated Unit, Base, and Installation Protection Cost Benefits Analysis, Multi-national Work Plans established through the Nuclear Security Summit process, and DoD Directive 5210.41, Security Policy for Protecting Nuclear Weapons-directed requirements and associated security deviation reports.  

Under this integrated approach, funds are used to provide PSE system development and demonstration for the Department in seven capability areas:  (1) Detection and Assessment; (2) Access Controls; (3) Installation and Transport Security; (4) Storage and Safeguards; (5) Prevention; (6) Decision Support Systems; and (7) Analytical Support.  The projects under the PE become technology insertions into existing programs or advance to being a certified Commercial/Government off-the-shelf product.  The PE initiatives are coordinated by the Security Policy Verification Committee and the Physical Security Equipment Action Group.  These groups work together to avoid duplication of effort and when applicable ensure systems integration and promote interoperability and sustainability.  

This PE can fund travel to support the requirements of this program.

This appropriation will finance work, including manpower, performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant
arrangement with the government who conduct research (systematic study directed toward fuller scientific knowledge or understanding of the subject studied),
development (systematic use of the knowledge and understanding gained from research, for the production of useful materials, devices, systems, or methods, including the design and development of prototypes and processes) and test and evaluation efforts.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) was established to develop and demonstrate technologies that advance conventional prompt global strike (CPGS) warfighting capabilities. The program uses a national team with coordination between the Services, Agencies and national research laboratories to pursue integrated portfolio objectives leading to the acquisition and operation of a CPGS system.   This program funds the design, development, and experimentation of boosters, payload delivery vehicles (PDVs), non-nuclear warheads, guidance systems, and mission planning and enabling capabilities, with the goal of competitive acquisition beginning in FY 2013 or 2014.  Timing will be driven by the outcome of flight events and DoD budgets.  To support these development activities, the program procures modeling and simulation capabilities, command and control interfaces, test range support, and launch system infrastructure.  Additionally, expert resources address strategic policy and treaty issues. Program emphasis is on demonstrating component and subsystem technology maturity with risk reduction initiatives.  As a result of flight tests and supporting activities, there are several boost-glide concepts available in preparation for a competitive acquisition.  In FY 2012, funding for the individual service initiatives will be contingent upon their abilities to execute and achieve satisfactory progress towards project goals as determined by the CPGS portfolio manager. </r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) was established to develop and demonstrate technologies that advance conventional prompt global strike (CPGS) warfighting capabilities. The program uses a national team with coordination between the Services, Agencies and national research laboratories to pursue integrated portfolio objectives leading to the acquisition and operation of a CPGS system.   This program funds the design, development, and experimentation of boosters, payload delivery vehicles (PDVs), non-nuclear warheads, guidance systems, and mission planning and enabling capabilities, with the goal of competitive acquisition beginning in FY 2013 or 2014.  Timing will be driven by the outcome of flight events and DoD budgets.  To support these development activities, the program procures modeling and simulation capabilities, command and control interfaces, test range support, and launch system infrastructure.

                                    <r2:Description>This sub-project matures technologies that could lead to a system capable of global reach from Continental United States (CONUS) or forward bases with the following characteristics: effects on targets in a very short-period of time from execution order; non-ballistic flight over the majority of the flight path; positive control from launch to impact; adequate cross-range/ maneuverability to avoid overflight issues; controlled stage drop over Broad Ocean area(BOA), and  provides for in-flight target updates.   The technologies developed will have cross-service and cross-concept applicability and will be developed through close coordination among DoD components. This activity will support both ground and flight tests, and provide all national data to the competitive acquisition program.

The objectives of this sub-project are to: 
- Assess boost-glide technologies in light of ground and flight test events and associated modeling and simulation
 Perform analysis of the military utility of vehicle performance with respect to thermal protection materials, aerodynamics and control surfaces, navigation, guidance, control, and weapons performance
 Assess the feasibility of producing an affordable solution to fill the CPGS capability gap.
 Continue systems engineering/development  of weaponized payload delivery vehicles
 Continue flight test planning and support
 Continue KEP warhead and penetrator development for application to range of CPGS concepts</r2:Description>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) was established to develop and demonstrate technologies that advance conventional prompt global strike (CPGS) warfighting capabilities. The program uses a national team with coordination between the Services, Agencies and national research laboratories to pursue integrated portfolio objectives leading to the acquisition and operation of a CPGS system.   This program funds the design, development, and experimentation of boosters, payload delivery vehicles (PDVs), non-nuclear warheads, guidance systems, and mission planning and enabling capabilities, with the goal of competitive acquisition beginning in FY 2013 or FY 2014.  Timing will be driven by the outcome of flight events and DoD budgets.  To support these development activities, the program procures modeling and simulation capabilities, command and control interfaces, test range support, and launch system infrastructure.  Additionally, expert resources address strategic policy and treaty issues. Program emphasis is on demonstrating component and subsystem technology maturity with risk reduction initiatives.  As a result of flight tests and supporting activities, there are several boost-glide concepts available in preparation for a competitive acquisition.  In FY 2012, funding for the individual service initiatives will be contingent upon their abilities to execute and achieve satisfactory progress towards project goals as determined by the CPGS portfolio manager.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>(U) This Program Element (PE) was established in response to Congressional guidance to consolidate DOD robotic programs on unmanned ground systems and related robotic technologies in order to increase focus of the Services' robotic programs on operational requirements.  Technologies in the PE support the continued development of technologies in Budget Activity 3 and 4 (PEs 0603711D8Z and 0603709D8Z) for technology transitions and transformations and closing war fighter requirement capability gaps. By exercising its oversight role through a technology advisory board, O-6 Council and Senior Steering Group (Flag level), Joint Ground Robotics applies this PE to enable coordination between the Services and places emphasis on interoperability and commonality among unmanned ground systems. This PE supports the effort to overcome technology barriers in thrust areas of unmanned ground system technologies to include Autonomous &amp; Tactical Behaviors, Manipulation Technologies, Collaborative Operations, Interoperability, Man-portable Unmanned Ground System Technologies, and Technology Transition/Transformation.  The purpose is to further the development and fielding of affordable and effective mobile ground robotic systems, develop and transition technologies necessary to meet evolving user requirements, and serve as a catalyst for insertion of robotic systems and technologies into the force structure.  Through application of funds against the thrust areas of unmanned ground system technologies, this PE supports the integration of technologies into representative models or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment and expedites technology transition from the laboratory to operational use. Emphasis is on proving component and subsystem maturity prior to integration in major and complex systems and may involve risk reduction initiatives. Within this PE, funded efforts will continue the delivery of advanced technology needs directed at enhancing the war fighters' capabilities identified during concept development, operational assessments and field feedback of current unmanned systems.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:Text>1)  Remote Checkpoint - The purpose of this project is to develop and demonstrate a prototype unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) system with semiautonomous capabilities to support operations at remote security checkpoints. The proposed solution will be a sensor-fused approach to integrate the Talon UGV with Idaho National Lab’s robotics intelligence kernel (RIK) Iris recognition and personnel identification and explosives detection. This integrated sensor approach will enable the Talon to semi-autonomously perform several remote checkpoint tasks yet allow operator intervention when needed, especially to employ systems to delay or deny hostile personnel.  The project will result in a capstone demonstration as well as a final report.
      -  Finalized and delivered system design drawings
      -  Delivered complete user’s manual
      -  Conducted Capstone Demonstration
      -  Delivered final report with results of the overall project as well as the results from the Demonstration

2)  Man-Portable ISR Robot - A current challenge for military ground forces is providing sustained intelligence gathering, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) in remote, ungoverned, denied, and/or isolated environments.   Highlighting the importance of this high-priority need, the Department of Defense Joint Requirements Oversight Counsel has identified “provide persistent surveillance in ungoverned/denied areas” as the second item on its current list of most pressing military issues.  This need is of particular relevance in relation to the IED problem in Iraq, but is also a global requirement to support the War on Terrorism, as well as counter-narcotic and boundary enforcement operations in multiple areas of responsibility.  The purpose of this project is to develop and evaluate a prototype unmanned system capable of providing sustained reconnaissance and surveillance in remote and/or denied areas. This project will develop a prototype UGV with enhanced capabilities that specifically support persistent surveillance and reconnaissance applications. It will have a power system to support 72-hour endurance, communication to support long-range operation, an integrated sensor suite, and low light color cameras to perform night surveillance.
      -  Integrated new EMCCD cameras
      -  Integrated new pan and tilt unit
      -  Integrated Velodyne LIDAR
      -  Conducted military user trials

3)  Cargo Unmanned Ground Vehicle - The goal of this project is to determine the feasibility of reducing the exposure of Marines to lethal attacks by replacing a portion of the manned vehicles in logistics convoys with unmanned vehicles.  Two Medium Tactical Vehicle Replacements (MTVRs) will be autonomized, and a third MTVR will be equipped with an Operator Control Unit (OCU).  This project is advancing the current state of robotics through the development of its perception technology (including methods of sensor data fusion and object classification) and methods of GPS-denied navigation.

                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>1.  Technologies to be funded &amp; developed are reviewed by Joint Capability Area focused working groups and the Joint Staff Functional Capabilities Boards to determine progress, transition plans, and relevance of each project. 
2.  Project plans are submitted, evaluated and analyzed by the Joint Robotics Ground Enterprise (JGRE) management and technical staff for risk and progress.
3.  Project progress toward goals and milestones is assessed during mid-year and end-of-year reviews.
4.  Technologies developed by the JGRE are tracked and documented using the DOD Technical Readiness Level (TRL) scale for developing TRL 3 or 4 technologies to TRL 6 and adhering to the integrated baselines with regard to cost and schedule.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>As a Department efficiency the ASD(NII) has been disestablished.  Starting in FY 2013 the funding in ASD(NII) PE 0604771D8Z and PE 0305199D8Z supporting acquisition related functions has been transferred to OUSD(AT&amp;L).

This funding provides resources for acquisition support and management oversight of critical command, control, communications (C3) and non-intelligence space capabilities as the Department continues its transition to netcentric operations. Funds will be used to provide technical, systems engineering and acquisition management oversight of programs, projects and activities to maximize the Department’s return on investment in information technology resources and effect a comprehensive approach for assessing and procuring critical information systems from initial design, through development to capability delivery in support of improved weapons systems performance and military operations. Resources will be allocated for architecture design and development, portfolio management, enterprise-wide systems engineering and operational impact analyses related to C3 and non-intelligence space systems. They will also be used to provide expertise required for exercising technical direction over design, performance and cost parameters of key systems and their dependencies. The goal of this funding is to eliminate redundancy, reduce time to the field, evaluate projects and concepts for adherence to net-centric guidelines, minimize performance and operational risk of developing and fielding complex major systems which rely on networks and supporting applications, ensure program dependencies are documented and included in acquisition decisions and address interoperability requirements, gaps and required technical solutions. Typical deliverables associated with the instantiation of net-centric capabilities for these mission areas include network and vulnerability assessments, migration plans, investment strategies and technical and policy guidance directives.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Exportability Program is a result of a USD(AT&amp;L) sponsored legislative proposal for authorities to better prepare warfighting systems for non-US use. The program funds will be replenished through non-recurring cost recoupment in future Foreign Military Sales (FMS) cases, Cooperative Program MOUs, or direct commercial sales contracts for sale/transfer of DoD systems benefiting from exportability investments. This program funds activities to support identification of major defense acquisition programs for possible export, and the planning for design and incorporation of exportability features during research and development of these programs. Features include, but are not limited to, technology and engineering design activity such as capability differentials, anti-tamper, system assurance, and software assurance. Activities include the development of program protection strategies for the program; the design and incorporation of exportability features into the system; implementation of exportability requirements onto contracts; and research, development, test, and evaluation activities. 

Defense exportability features plays a critically important role in United States Government/DoD efforts to build partnership capacity.  Funds support building joint and coalition environments by enabling the export of DoD systems to a wide range of partner nations, resulting in improved security and interoperability.  In addition to the operational benefits, by providing these resources up front, then collecting ‘fair share’ non-recurring cost recoupment, the United States and partner nations will save significant resources by more efficiently designing and producing exportable U.S. systems.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Department’s budget focuses on institutionalizing and financing our capabilities to fight the wars we are in today and the scenarios we are most likely to face in the years ahead, while at the same time providing a hedge against other risks and contingencies. It also begins a fundamental overhaul of the DoD’s approach to procurement, acquisition, and contracting.  As such, the complex details of budgeting and tracking of funds become increasingly critical to senior leader decision making and to provide accountability to the taxpayer.  Incorporating information technology toward current and emerging business processes manifesting into a state-of-the art system of systems will result in increasing efficiencies, timely diagnostics, and reducing lifecycle costs to maintain, sustain and repair.

Today, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense Comptroller OUSD(C) and the Cost Analysis and Program Evaluation (CAPE) uses various distinct automated systems (Comptroller Information System (CIS), PBD Wizard, Program Resource Collection Process (PRCP), Supplemental Resource Collection Process (SRCP), Budget Exhibits Generator and Standard Data Collection System (SDCS) to formulate, justify, and execute DoD budgets.  These six or more systems interact with at least several computer-based systems controlled by external organizations and agencies.  These systems manage very similar financial information, yet each uses its own scheme for representing information.  Much of the information managed by these systems is redundant.  Cross-system data representations and redundancies make it difficult to exchange and to reconcile information.  The capabilities provided by Comptroller systems, in some cases, fail to deliver services needed by its users, or fail to operate in ways that complement current and emerging business practices.  They fail to give executives information in a comprehensible form, making it difficult to draw conclusions.  Data disparities and functional redundancy make these systems more costly to keep than they need to be.

There is a critical need for the development of a state-of-the-art information technology system to modernize and replace multiple, antiquated legacy systems and processes used to formulate, justify, present and defend the entire Department of Defense Budget in the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) (OUSD(C)) to meet Title 10 and Title 31 mission and reporting requirements.  The Comptroller’s plan for mitigating the deficiencies and capability gaps associated with current systems is development of the Next Generation Resource Management System.  

This initiative exploits emerging technology, processes, trends, capabilities, and techniques to incorporate state-of-the-art information technology enabling the ability, agility, and level of fidelity to collect, process, administrate and report resource management data and to automate business processes within a more robust analytical environment within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) OUSD(C). Funded efforts will improve the timeliness of resource management reviews and decisions for senior leaders and Congress.

                    <r2:SummaryExplanation>In FY 2012, select organizational missions and functions of the ODCMO and the Business Transformation Agency (BTA) were integrated and consolidated within the ODCMO as directed by the Secretary of Defense.  This transfer of select functionality to the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) / ODCMO will provide focused integration and synchronization of business improvement activities in support of the war fighter across all Departmental components.

In FY 2013, the labor adjustment is the result of transfer of labor dollars to the Defense Wide Operations and Maintenance account (O&amp;M), specifically realigning funds in compliance with Financial Management Regulations (FMR) which require expenses of research and development management at headquarters and administrative organizations be funded with O&amp;M; to centralize and consolidate contracting services and realize contracting efficiencies to improve acquisition  planning and oversight. And the final adjustment is the ODCMO portion of Secretary of Defense efficiencies initiatives.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Department of Defense (DoD) and National Security Agency (NSA) require uninterrupted access to state-of-the-art design and manufacturing processes to produce custom integrated circuits designed specifically for military purposes.  In accordance with DoD Instruction 5200.39, integrated circuits in critical/essential systems need to be procured from trusted sources in order to avoid counterfeit, tampered, or sabotaged parts.  Worldwide competition from foreign state-subsidized manufacturing facilities (foundries) is making fabless semiconductor companies the norm in the United States.  Sophisticated off-shore design and manufacturing facilities with engineering labor rates vastly less than U.S. engineering rates have resulted in outsourcing of electronics components and integrated circuits.  These trends threaten the integrity and worldwide leadership of the U.S. semiconductor industry by eliminating many domestic on-shore suppliers and reducing access to trusted fabrication sources for advanced technology.  These trends are of acute concern to the defense and intelligence community.  Secure communications and cryptographic applications depend heavily upon high performance semiconductors where a generation of improvement can translate into a significant force multiplier and capability advantage.  Important defense technology investments and demonstrations carry size, weight, power, and performance goals that can only be met through the use of the most sophisticated semiconductors.

The Trusted Foundry program provides DoD and NSA with trusted state-of-the-art microelectronics design and manufacturing capabilities necessary to meet the performance and delivery needs of their customers.  The program will also provide the Services with a competitive cadre of trusted suppliers that will meet the needs of their mission critical/essential systems for trusted integrated circuit components.  NSA, in their role as the Trusted Access Program Office, has successfully looked to commercial sources to satisfy their requirements.  Access to trusted suppliers is imperative to ongoing and future DoD/NSA systems, and most centrally, Trusted Foundry access is absolutely necessary to meet secure communication and cryptographic needs for state-of-the-art semiconductor technologies.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>NSA has negotiated a "commercial" capacity type IDIQ contract with IBM with 10 one-year options.  IBM will provide custom and semi-custom integrated circuit parts in production and prototype quantities to meet DoD/NSA leading-edge integrated circuit needs.  Additional suppliers of leading-edge production processes will be developed and accredited as Trusted Suppliers by the DMEA.  This will provide program managers the flexibility to acquire trusted parts appropriate to the minimum risk and vulnerability of their particular system needs.  Process IP will be obtained from trusted suppliers to assure the availability of parts over the long term.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Synchronized Pre-Deployment and Operational Tracker - Enterprise Suite (SPOT-ES) is the joint enterprise suite of products employed for the management, tracking and visibility of contracted capability and contractors authorized to accompany U.S. forces in support of overseas contingency operations (OCO), humanitarian assistance and disaster relief efforts both domestic and abroad.   

SPOT ES assists the Combatant Commander (CCDR) in maintaining awareness of the nature, extent, and potential risks and capabilities associated with the contracted support in contingency, humanitarian or peacekeeping operations, or military exercises designated by the CCDR.  As such, SPOT- ES: Serves as the central repository for up-to-date status and reporting on contingency contractor personnel; Provides by-name accountability of DoD-funded contingency contractor personnel and other personnel as directed by Public Law, USD (AT&amp;L), or by the CCDR; Tracks contract capability information for all DoD-funded contracts supporting contingencies or designated military exercises; Contains contract information necessary to establish and maintain accountability and visibility of contractors and contract capabilities for operational contract support.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>A key part of DoD’s strategy to meet its energy goals is to develop an energy information management environment that will enable the Services and OSD to track energy production and usage across the real property portfolio.  Information on energy usage is critical for day-to-day management and accountability, troubleshooting building systems, and planning for capital investments.  These funds will support the development and procurement of an enterprise-wide energy data warehouse that will be integrated with existing and future real property systems.  AT&amp;L has already conducted a comprehensive requirements analysis for this prospective warehouse using funds provided through the now-disestablished Business Transformation Agency.  We have defined a standard set of energy information management requirements and are now assessing and planning which information management technologies (future and current) will best support them.  Funding is required to keep this project on track and ensure that the DoD-wide energy management data environment becomes a reality.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Care Management, Disability Evaluation, and Transition Systems IM/IT.  Funding includes development of  web-based tools for use in overseeing the Service member recovery and facilitating resolution of disability and transition processing issues.  In FY 2008, the Departments of Defense and VA made significant progress leveraging the Veterans Tracking Application with access to existing Department of Defense Care Management (CM) tools and resources. The work continued through FY 2009 with a prototype dashboard that leverages existing case management tools and resources in a single sign on construct, and continued in FY 2010 to include further enhancements of the prototype and integration of care management models.  The Department of Defense’s request includes funding for development of content management systems.  
Justification:  Non-medical Care Managers are responsible for provide oversight of welfare and quality of life issues.  They assist the service member and family in resolving problems involving financial, administrative, personnel, and other non-medical issues that may occur during the recovery, rehabilitation and reintegration phases across the continuum of care.  Full funding will provide the capability for DoD Case Managers to view non-clinical data on a Wounded Warriors from one location.  FY 2009 funding began the implementation of the July 2007 Dole-Shalala Recommendations and initial development of the 2008 NDAA required comprehensive policy.  During FY 2010, the Recovery Care Plan systems solution was developed and underwent Government Acceptance Testing.  RCP-SS systems deployments began in 3Q FY 2010 to selected field locations.  </r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>Funding facilitates the discovery, analysis, and integration of existing DoD and VA web-based tools, and the development of a single application that will be used across the agencies to oversee the Service member recovery and facilitating resolution of transition and disability processing issues.   Non-Clinical Case Management Recovery Care Plan and Benefits Portal Development.  Funding facilitates the research, analysis, and integration of existing DoD and VA web-based tools, and the development of a single application that will be used across the agencies to oversee the Service member recovery and facilitating resolution of transition process issues.   This initiative provides public and secure web access to benefits and services supporting Wounded Warriors through a secure/interactive Web-based portal tailored to the needs of the Wounded Warrior, identifying both VA/DoD benefits and services important to a Wounded Warrior’s recovery plan.  The Portal customizes benefits information based upon user profiles to include display of benefits to support stage recovery and leverages existing VA/DoD business services/systems to create “One Pathway” for the Wounded Warrior so that they may more actively participate in their clinical recovery plan, and interfaces with their Individual Recovery Plan. In FY 2008 the Department of Defense and Veteran Affairs (DoD/VA) established a Portal presence with links to MyHealthe-Vet, eLearning LMS, and pre-negotiated access for all members with the establishment of secure, single sign-on infrastructure. </r2:Description>

                                            <r2:Text>The Federal Voting Assistance Office contracted a study on absentee voting that supports Wounded Warriors, disabled military members, military members,
their dependents and overseas civilian voters. Wounded Warriors reported low electoral participation due to a lack of motivation as they focused on medical issues, a lack of awareness of voting assistance resources available to them, and the need for additional assistance when completing registration forms and absentee ballots. This observation is not surprising as most Wounded Warriors who were interviewed were in the 18-24 year age-group--an age group that has historically exhibited low participation rates.

In its research and analysis, the Federal Voting Assistance Program Office reviewed business processes and procedures, data sources for voter demographics and voting behavior information, and statutory, regulatory, and policy requirements for voting related information with the intent of developing a Federal Voting enterprise architecture to support revisions to the automated Federal Write-In Absentee Ballot (FWAB) and Federal Post Card Application (FPCA) for Wounded Warriors.

The Federal Voting Assistance Program Office conducted a mock election where Wounded Warriors were observed and interviewed after voting on six
commercial electronic voting systems.  The goal of this research was to evaluate the usability, accessibility and privacy provided by the electronic voting systems.  Wounded Warriors, in general, provided positive feedback regarding their experience in using the electronic voting systems.  Some Wounded Warriors reported difficulties related to usability and accessibility issues.  This feedback is available to electronic voting system manufactures for future improvements assisting Wounded Warriors and other challenged citizens.</r2:Text>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This funding supports Defense Planning Guidance (DPG) directing the Department of Defense (DoD) components to develop guidelines and procedures for a comprehensive readiness reporting system that evaluates readiness on the basis of the actual missions and capabilities assigned to the forces. The Defense Readiness Reporting System (DRRS) establishes a capabilities-based, adaptive, near real-time readiness information system for the DoD. This system is being designed to measure the readiness of military forces and supporting infrastructure to meet missions and goals assigned by the Secretary of Defense. DRRS also hosts information and applications used to support Joint Forces Command (JFCOM), Transportation Command (TRANSCOM), Special Operations Command (SOCOM) and Strategic Command (STRATCOM) in their roles as the Joint Force Providers.

The transformation of readiness reporting into a new comprehensive readiness system presents a number of significant challenges. First, there are thousands of new potential reporting entities to include in DRRS, such as Combatant Commands, Joint Task Forces, Services, Active and Reserve component units, installations, depots, ports, and major elements of the industrial base. These entities must not only define and implement reporting based on specific readiness metrics, but they must make their readiness status continuously available in near real time to DRRS. Second, the current National Military Strategy (NMS) makes substantially more complex demands on readiness reporting. Instead of basing readiness on traditional MTW-based scenarios, the NMS asks us to contemplate readiness for an entire range of operational forms, and to design DRRS to assess global readiness impact based on our integrated ability to project and sustain a mix of constructed forces in simultaneous engagements. Finally, Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom sourcing challenges mean that force managers need applications that will query the entire Department for suitable, available organizations to meet current needs. The need for these applications and the underlying data are a top priority for the DRRS project.

The realization of DRRS requires integrating a host of key technologies in order to achieve an information system that supports distributed, collaborative, and dynamic readiness reporting in addition to continuous tool-based assessment. The primary technical goal is the creation of a highly reliable and securely integrated readiness data environment to leverage and extend current readiness information systems. This system is based on intelligent agents, dynamic databases, semantic middleware, and publish/subscribe concepts; providing a logically uniform view into the multiple databases and information sources that feed DRRS. Crucially, through this type of advanced information environment, we dramatically expand the range of readiness queries that DRRS can be able to handle. This environment supports a suite of analysis tools that allow users to explore the consequences of readiness deficiencies in terms of the ability to generate forces and assess transportation feasibility as it pertains to specific scenarios. These tools and tool suites harness the power of the information environment to make possible the kind of quick-turnaround, excursion-driven readiness assessment that is at the heart of DRRS.

Defense Readiness Reporting System Efficiency Reductions - To be achieved through implementation of Government Accountability Office recommendations to staff the DRRS program office on the basis of human capital strategy that is grounded in an assessment of core competencies and essential knowledge, skills, and abilities needed to perform key DRRS program management functions, an inventory of the program office's existing workforce capabilities, and an analysis of the gap between the assessed needs and the existing capabilities. Also, DRRS Implementation Office will work with the Acquisition Component Executive to ensure all acquisition requirements are being met prior to any further certification requests.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) and acquisition reform initiatives call for top down, national security strategy-driven capabilities-based planning. Department of Defense (DoD) Instruction 5000.02 and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 3170.01 promulgate capabilities-based requirements and acquisition processes. The Joint System Architecture Development (JSAD) program enables collaborative efforts to achieve these goals. These efforts include providing support to conduct warfighting capability-based analysis; performing assessments of joint capability areas and joint integrating concepts; developing and supporting needed sets of system and system-related data; creating integrated roadmaps to support acquisition investment decisions; and performing assessments of major defense acquisition programs and major automated information systems in a capability area context.  Activities in the JSAD project are divided into three areas:  (1) capability-based analysis; (2) roadmaps; and (3) support tools and guidance. Capability-based analysis provides analysis of the different technology, functionality, and integration impacts of systems on warfighting capability.  Acquisition roadmaps guide systems development and associated investment plans.  JSAD support tools and guidance initiatives develop systems data, and tools, exploit modeling and simulation and architecture efforts to improve DoDs overall assessment capability.  These efforts guide the development and improve the testing and fielding of integrated systems of systems in order to achieve Joint mission capabilities.  The QDR also lays out the need for an institutional reorientation or shift in emphasis from organization-specific to enterprise-wide approaches. This means:  (1) horizontal integration within the Department and unity of effort through greater interagency collaboration; (2) engaging in a coordinated and portfolio-based approach to planning,  programming, budgeting and execution; and (3) significant reforms at the governance, management and execution levels.  To accomplish this direction, there needs to be a focused  goal and concerted emphasis on shifting from systems acquisition to capabilities-based portfolio management (or portfolio systems acquisition).  Starting in FY 2008, this  program enables collaborative efforts to implement the QDR direction outlined above in order to achieve portfolio systems acquisition goals.  The program is broken up into two  focus areas (Portfolio Management and Reform Initiatives) and consolidates work previously performed under various other Program Elements.  </r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Departments 2005 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) laid out the need for an institutional reorientation or shift in emphasis from organization-specific to enterprise-wide approaches.  This meant:  (1) horizontal integration within the Department and unity of effort through greater interagency collaboration; (2) engaging in a coordinated and portfolio-based approach to planning, programming, budgeting and execution; and (3) significant reforms at the governance, management and execution levels.  The Department’s 2010 QDR report further addressed reforming how we buy, noting that the conventional acquisition process is too long and too cumbersome to fit the needs of the many systems that require continuous changes and upgrades—a challenge that will become only more pressing over time. The Department will improve how it matches requirements with mature technologies, maintains disciplined systems engineering approaches.   To accomplish this direction, there needed to be a focused goal and concerted emphasis on shifting from acquisition of individual systems to portfolio management (or portfolio systems acquisition).  This program enables collaborative efforts to implement the QDR direction outlined above and to achieve portfolio systems acquisition goals and to develop and implement acquisition reform initiatives.  The program is broken up into two focus areas (Portfolio Management and Reform Initiatives) and consolidates work previously performed under various other Program Elements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription> Since its inception in FY 1990, this program element has been used to fund the development of critically needed, high priority Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) capabilities for joint/multi-Service requirements.  The Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program (CTEIP) uses a corporate investment approach to combine Service, Defense, and other government agencies T&amp;E needs, maximize opportunities for joint efforts, and avoid unwarranted duplication of test capabilities.  CTEIP focuses investments on projects that will have high productivity returns on investment.  Projects under the CTEIP Program Element (PE) support two basic tasks: investments to improve the test capabilities base (Joint Improvement and Modernization (JIM) projects) and development of near-term solutions to test capability shortfalls in support of ongoing operational test programs (Resource Enhancement Project (REP)).

The JIM funds critically needed T&amp;E investments in the major functional areas of: air combat; armament and munitions; Command, Control Communication, Computer and Intelligence (C4I) and networks; common range instrumentation; electronic combat; land combat; sea combat; space combat; target systems; and test environments.  Examples of project subject matter include: highly accurate time-space-position information, network enhanced telemetry, miniaturized flight safety systems, realistic urban test environments, ground testing for hypersonic systems and satellites, and end-to-end testing of infrared countermeasure systems.  CTEIP continues as the focal point for fostering common architectures throughout the test and training communities to enhance the sharing of resources and links between test and training ranges.

CTEIP has provided special focus to institutionalize the use of modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) as a practical test tool; to link ranges through internetting to enhance inter-range and inter-Service cooperation and resource sharing; and, to ensure development and acquisition of common instrumentation necessary for a more efficient test infrastructure.

Analyses of alternative solutions are conducted for each investment project to validate T&amp;E requirements, to define integrated support systems, and to determine overall cost effectiveness of the proposed test investments.  The use of Department of Defense (DoD)-wide criteria for requirement validation, prioritization, and risk assessment ensures an effective test resource investment program.

The REP funds development of near-term solutions for critical ongoing operational tests supporting decisions on major, high priority defense acquisition programs.  These unanticipated operational test (OT) capability requirements arise from several sources such as a new threat system identified during OT planning, acquisition of foreign military assets that are critical in determining weapon system operational effectiveness, short timelines between system design maturity and scheduled OT, and emerging technologies and test requirements resulting from operational concept changes mandated by Congress or Director, Operational Test &amp; Evaluation (DOT&amp;E), or system-of-systems testing.  Funding these activities under the CTEIP provides the opportunity to coordinate and integrate these near-term test requirements with the total DoD test and evaluation investment planning, and ensures their availability and legacy for other programs that may have similar testing requirements.

This Research Category 6.4 PE includes special studies, analyses, and strategic planning related to test capabilities and infrastructure, and supports the development and application of proven technologies to provide major test and evaluation capabilities required to meet DoD component weapon system test requirements.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Joint Mission Environment Test Capability (JMETC) program was established for the purpose of implementing the Department’s strategy to move to an enterprise-centric, distributed test capability that results in acquisition systems fielded with enhanced joint capabilities, reduced program costs, and improved acquisition timelines.  The JMETC program implements the infrastructure capabilities defined in the DoD’s “Testing in a Joint Environment Roadmap” to provide acquisition program managers a robust nation-wide capability to “test like we fight.”  JMETC provides a persistent, distributed test and evaluation (T&amp;E) capability that otherwise would not be readily available to Service/Component acquisition programs.  This program is funded within the RDT&amp;E Management Support Budget Activity because it is intended to provide test capability in support of RDT&amp;E programs. 

	JMETC creates a common corporate capability to link live systems with virtual and constructive representations in order to generate a realistic joint mission test environment for the system(s) being tested.  JMETC is a widely applicable, persistent, service provider for the Department’s acquisition and net-centric programs.  Key JMETC products include readily available connectivity over existing networks, standardized data transport solutions, tools and utilities for planning and conducting distributed integrations, DoD corporate distributed testing expertise, and a reuse repository.  This common integration capability, through the use of the Test and Training Enabling Architecture (TENA), provides compatibility between JMETC and the Joint National Training Capability (JNTC), streamlining reuse of technical resources across the test and training communities.  In turn, this integration capability enables combined test and training exercises.

	By linking distributed facilities, JMETC allows acquisition programs to efficiently evaluate their warfighting capability in a realistic joint mission environment.  This enables a customer-defined joint mission test environment for systems engineering and testing, extensible to training and experimentation, in a timely and cost effective manner.

       JMETC’s institutional funding builds, maintains, and operates the JMETC infrastructure and pays for persistent availability of national connectivity for testing; data communications middleware; identification and development of interface standards; common software tools and components; and a reuse repository.  It also funds JMETC program management, facilities, equipment, operating costs, and special studies and analysis related to distributed test capabilities and infrastructure.  Key attributes of the JMETC include:  persistency; interoperability; reuse; various combinations of distributed capabilities (reconfigurable infrastructure to meet customer requirements); modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) linkage; Live-Virtual-Constructive (LVC) test resource integration; and distributed test support to satisfy both Service and Joint needs.  System engineering, training, and experimentation all benefit from a corporate JMETC developed for T&amp;E.
	
The Test Resource Management Center (TRMC) is the Department’s lead for the JMETC program, and oversees both its development and its operations.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program is a key source of funding for the Office of the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Staff to manage studies, analysis, management, and technical support efforts strategically to improve and support policy development, decision making, management and administration of DoD programs and activities. Studies and analysis will examine current and alternative policies, plans, operations, strategies and budgets, and are essential for managing and responding to the ever-changing complex international, political, technological, economic, military, and acquisition environments in which national security planning decisions are made.  The need for independent analysis has become particularly acute with the evolution of requirements for planning the reconstitution of forces affected by operations, and there is a strong need to incorporate the effects of operational analysis in force planning assessments. With the persistently complex security, threat, and economic environment, the need for objective analysis and forward looking planning for the mid and long-term is vital.

 Beginning in FY 2010, this program element includes the budget request for the Global Theater Security Cooperation Management Information Systems (TSCMIS) program, which is an existing program that will be executed by the Joint Staff separately from the Technical Studies, Support, and Analysis program. The Global Theater Security Cooperation Management Information Systems program responds to OSD's Guidance for Employment of the Force so that Combatant Commanders, Military Department Chiefs, CSA Directors, and applicable Defense Agency and Field Activity Directors are able to use a tracking mechanism to account for their steady-state activities that is accessible to other DoD components. Together these tracking mechanisms will provide a global view of all steady-state activities conducted by DoD components. The intent of this program is to encourage further development of tracking mechanisms in order to achieve full visibility of Defense Department activities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

This program conducts over one-hundred actions per fiscal year to support a wide variety of national security goals of the Department and is designed to encourage a collaborative research approach among the components of OSD and the Joint Staff.  The research and study projects supported by this program are closely integrated with the strategic goals of the Department of Defense.  The focus of studies varies across a wide spectrum including weapons systems cost analysis, strengthening and leveraging alliances, human resource and military personnel management, examination of innovative technologies, application of technology to operational doctrine, and many other issues of emerging importance.  Most of the actions are long to intermediate-range in outlook, and the program allows organizational leaders to plan and guide their research toward meeting their highest-priority goals and other high-level guidance such as executive branch performance management objectives and the National Security Strategy of the United States of America.

In following the program efficiencies guidance of the Secretary of Defense, the scope and detail of studies and analyses will be abridged in order to focus upon issues of the highest strategic importance to the Department of Defense while continuing to make every effort to support requirements from legislative direction.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>(1) Export Control Program:

The Militarily Critical Technologies Program (MCTP) provides the technical reference guidance in support of development and implementation of DoD technology security policies on international transfers of defense related goods, services, and technologies.  The export control program provides an ongoing assessment and analysis of global goods and technologies.  Determines significant advances in the development, production, and use of military capabilities by potential adversaries.  Determines goods and technologies being developed worldwide with potential to significantly enhance or degrade U.S. military capabilities in the future.  Identified in the Export Administration Act of 1979 and extended by Presidential Executive Order to review militarily critical goods and technologies and to consider worldwide technology capabilities.  The Militarily Critical Technologies List (MCTL) is a congressionally mandated source document for identification of leading edge and current technologies monitored worldwide for national security, nonproliferation control of weapons of mass destruction, and advanced conventional weapons.

Specific activities include:
- Develop and publish in electronic form (including Internet version) restricted editions of the MCTL document that describe the military and proliferation significance of various technologies.
- Monitor and assess dual-use and military technologies worldwide.
- Assist in the development of proposals for negotiation in various multilateral export control regimes.
- Limited worldwide technology capability assessments for the MCTL and other U.S. international critical technologies efforts.
- Identification and determination of technical parameters for proposals for international control of weapons of mass destruction.
- Identification of foreign technologies of interest to the DoD and opportunities for international cooperative research and development.

(2) The DoD Damage Assessment Management Office (DAMO) Program:  The Defense Industrial Base (DIB) secures critical DoD programs and technology by protecting DoD unclassified information resident on and transiting DIB unclassified networks.  This project further establishes the DoD DAMO to coordinate the conduct of assessments involving the loss of DoD information requiring controls resulting from the unauthorized access and/or exfiltration of technical data maintained on unclassified DIB networks.  The DAMO identifies and categorizes the impact of the loss of acquisition information contained on the affected systems, organizes and coordinates the assessment reports with all affected components and DIB members, and establishes a process to appropriately share collected information with all affected parties.  The DAMO establishes policy and procedures for conducting damage assessments applicable to all DoD components and in concert with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation (DFAR) procedures pertaining to contracts with the DIB.

Specific activities include:
- Provide technical expertise and analyses in assessing the impact of data lost as a result of the unauthorized access and/or exfiltration. 
- Develop a damage assessment ontology and data repository in order to provide analysis to identify trends in the targeting and compromise of defense program information.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>(1) Export Control Program:

The Militarily Critical Technologies Program (MCTP) provides the technical reference guidance in support of development and implementation of DoD technology security policies on international transfers of defense related goods, services, and technologies.  The export control program provides an ongoing assessment and analysis of global goods and technologies.  Determines significant advances in the development, production, and use of military capabilities by potential adversaries.  Determines goods and technologies being developed worldwide with potential to significantly enhance or degrade U.S. military capabilities in the future.  Identified in the Export Administration Act of 1979 and extended by Presidential Executive Order to review militarily critical goods and technologies and to consider worldwide technology capabilities.  The Militarily Critical Technologies List (MCTL) is a congressionally mandated source document for identification of leading edge and current technologies monitored worldwide for national security, nonproliferation control of weapons of mass destruction, and advanced conventional weapons.

Specific activities include:
- Develop and publish in electronic form (including Internet version) restricted editions of the MCTL document that describe the military and proliferation significance of various technologies.
- Monitor and assess dual-use and military technologies worldwide.
- Assist in the development of proposals for negotiation in various multilateral export control regimes.
- Limited worldwide technology capability assessments for the MCTL and other U.S. international critical technologies efforts.
- Identification and determination of technical parameters for proposals for international control of weapons of mass destruction.
- Identification of foreign technologies of interest to the DoD and opportunities for international cooperative research and development.

(2) The DoD Damage Assessment Management Office (DAMO) Program:  

The Defense Industrial Base (DIB) secures critical DoD programs and technology by protecting DoD unclassified information resident on and transiting DIB unclassified networks.  This project further establishes the DoD DAMO to coordinate the conduct of assessments involving the loss of DoD information requiring controls resulting from the unauthorized access and/or exfiltration of technical data maintained on unclassified DIB networks.  The DAMO identifies and categorizes the impact of the loss of acquisition information contained on the affected systems, organizes and coordinates the assessment reports with all affected components and DIB members, and establishes a process to appropriately share collected information with all affected parties.  The DAMO establishes policy and procedures for conducting damage assessments applicable to all DoD components and in concert with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation (DFAR) procedures pertaining to contracts with the DIB.

Specific activities include:
- Provide technical expertise and analyses in assessing the impact of data lost as a result of the unauthorized access and/or exfiltration. 
- Develop a damage assessment ontology and data repository in order to provide analysis to identify trends in the targeting and compromise of defense program information.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Foreign Comparative Testing (FCT) Program supports the warfighter by leveraging mature technologies and equipment from allied nations and coalition partners to satisfy U.S. defense requirements, thereby accelerating the U.S. acquisition process and lowering development costs.  Authorized by Title 10, U.S. Code, Section 2350a(g), the FCT Program is managed by the Office of Secretary of Defense (Rapid Fielding Office), Comparative Technology Office (CTO).  FCT projects are nominated by the Services and U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) each year.  Evaluation processes for project selection include a detailed review to confirm the proposed item addresses valid requirements, a thorough market survey, and development of a viable acquisition strategy.  A seven-day Congressional notification of the intent to fund the projects is required, prior to the issuance of funds to the Services and USSOCOM for execution.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Foreign Comparative Testing (FCT) Program supports the warfighter by leveraging mature technologies and equipment from allied nations and coalition partners to satisfy U.S. defense requirements, thereby accelerating the United States (U.S.) acquisition process and lowering development costs. Authorized by Title 10, U.S. Code, Section 2350a(g), the FCT Program is managed by the Office of Secretary of Defense (Rapid Fielding Office), Comparative Technology Office. FCT projects are nominated by the Services and U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) each year.  Evaluation processes for project selection include a detailed review to confirm the proposed item addresses valid requirements, a thorough market survey, and development of a viable acquisition strategy.  A seven-day Congressional notification of the intent to fund the most meritorious projects is required, prior to the issuance of funds to the Services and USSOCOM for execution.

Since the program's inception in 1980, Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD) has initiated 646 projects; 551 projects have been completed to date.  Of the 279 evaluations that met the sponsors' requirements, 231 led to procurements worth approximately $10.950 billion in FY 2011 constant year dollars.  With an Office of Secretary of Defense investment of about $1.128 billion, the FCT Program realized an estimated RDT&amp;E cost avoidance of $7.800 billion in FY 2011 constant year dollars.

The FCT Program is a catalyst for teaming or other business relationships between foreign and U.S. industries.  Many successful FCT projects result in the licensed production of the qualified foreign item in the U.S.  Other nations recognize the long-term value of such practices for competing in the U.S. defense market and the resultant strengthening of the "two-way street" in Defense procurement.  The result often means the creation of jobs and contributions to local economies throughout the United States. To date, companies across 33 states benefited from FCT projects.

Final selection of FY 2013 FCT new start projects were determined in September 2012.

This system will incorporate active and electronic noise reduction, spatial separation of multiple radio channels from multiple sources, and three dimensional threat audio cueing from on-board threat detection systems. The A-10 and the F-16 do not have active or electronic noise reduction capability. The primary output is a 3D audio input capability that automatically sorts and presents information spatially in real time to the pilot.  It increases situational awareness and allows the pilot to respond quicker by reducing pilot and information overload. It will provide noise reduction, which all but eliminates outside engine and other noise clutter. </r2:Description>

The primary outputs of the ASTOR System aboard the Sentinel Aircraft are Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images and Moving Target Indicator (MTI) contacts. Software modifications to the ISR processing, exploitation, and dissemination (PED) components currently used by DCGS-N will be implemented and tested to verify that ISR data from ASTOR Systems can be rapidly received, processed, screened for potential mission application, and exploited to produce targeting data that can be used by US weapon systems. This capability will allow United States (US) forces to leverage coalition ISR assets and reduce mission requirements for US ISR platforms.</r2:Description>

The Headquarters Air Combat Command/A7OI, in Langley Air Force Base, Virginia will evaluate the BC11 computer-controlled caliper-disk aircraft arresting system from Scama of Vderstad, Sweden.  The current 40 year old Barrier Arresting Kit 12 (BAK 12) aircraft arresting system cannot handle arresting a F-22 through its full range of operational loads. The output will be a computer controlled arresting system that will safely stop an F-22 throughout the F-22's full operational range of stopping speeds without over-stressing the tail hook and airframe. The system is cheaper to maintain and operate, has extensive self-diagnostics, would provide feedback to the airfield tower,  and will provide automated recordkeeping.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Title>Deployable Runway Rubber Removal System (Air Force)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>Deployable Runway Rubber Removal System evaluates a system that lifts rubber deposits and paint from airfield pavement surfaces to restore runway friction, and provides a safe operating runway surfaces for military aircraft.  Removal system is equipped with a vacuum to remove runway debris and mitigate foreign object debris damage to airplanes.  The system uses 60 percent less water than the current system and completes rubber removal in half of the time, with half of the manpower.  The Ultra-High Pressure (UHP) System can evacuate the runway in the event of an emergency landing, while the current system cannot. The primary output is a deployable, UHP water runway rubber and paint removal system.

                                    <r2:Title>Marine Grade Aluminum Plate (Navy) </r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>Marine Grade Aluminum Plate evaluates an engineered aluminum plate with superior corrosion resistance for use as a repair and replacement material for a ship’s superstructure. A unique manufacturing technique produces a multi-layered material that is rolled into sheet having a marine grade aluminum core with a corrosion resistant outer layer.  A particular concern is an aluminum alloy’s susceptibility to sensitization, a micro-structural phenomenon that increases corrosion susceptibility, and provides an environment for stress corrosion cracking.  The primary output of this project is superior aluminum with multi-layered material that is corrosion resistant in a marine environment. This will provide increased survivability, sustainability, and operational readiness compared to current decking and bulkhead plate.  Estimations for CG repair and replacement costs due to sensitization and cracking of aluminum plate is between $1.000 million and $2.000 million per repair cycle. Extrapolating this cost across the fleet over the first repair cycle would translate to costs in excess of $22.000 million that would be saved using an aluminum plate material that is capable of meeting the service lifetime requirements of 35 years.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The United States (U.S.) Navy will evaluate a module for autonomous mission planning that integrates the existing Common Operator Interface Navy (COIN) tool to permit adaptive mission execution with unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs). In addition to demonstrating new behaviors and algorithms, including automated target recognition (ATR), the tool will be adapted to provide an open and modular interface for third-party autonomy algorithms that will support Navy's ongoing applications and produce competition for future capabilities.  The effort aims to increase UUV mission capabilities through autonomy and provide an interface for application of existing Navy adaptive behaviors to improve fielding efforts. Efforts will produce an estimated 33% decrease in mine countermeasures (MCM) total mission time and a 33% decrease in human-caused pre-programming errors without degradation of system key performance parameters.  Based on reported present capabilities and open integration model, the effort is also estimated to avoid Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) and Operations and Support costs worth over $2.000 million.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Provide the Distributed Common Ground System – Navy (DCGS-N) and Distributed Common Ground System - Marine Corps (DCGS-MC) with a capability to receive in near real-time, via Common Data Link (CDL) antenna systems, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) data from the Reconnaissance Airborne Pod for Tornado (RAPTOR) Systems. Systems are carried by Royal Air Force (RAF) GR-4 platforms. The primary outputs of the RAPTOR System are Electro-Optical (EO) and Infrared (IR) images in a digital format. Software modifications to the ISR Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (PED) Systems currently used by DCGS-N will be implemented and tested to verify that ISR data from RAPTOR Systems can be rapidly received, screened for potential mission application, and exploited to produce targeting data that can be used by US weapon systems. This capability will allow United States (US) forces to leverage coalition ISR assets and reduce mission requirements for US ISR platforms.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Ultra High Energy Rechargeable Battery tests a new rechargeable BB-2590/U battery, which consists of lithium-ion cells and replaces a battery used in many United States (US) Army portable radios and electronics equipment. The batteryis the most widely used battery in the Army inventory.  Compared to the current production battery, the new BB-2590/U battery will have one hour (30 percent) greater service time, 1.6 Ampere hour (Ah) (24 percent) greater capacity, and 38 Watt-hours (20 percent) greater energy.  At -32 degrees Celsius (°C) and five amperes, the new battery will provide 1.3 hours service time and 165 Watt-hours energy; whereas, the current production battery will not operate at -32 °C.  The battery weight will be reduced by 71 grams per battery.  Less weight, creates greater run time, and equals fewer batteries required for missions.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) establishes the dedicated funding line to carry out the duties as described in Title 10 US Code, Section 139, the Weapons Systems Acquisition Reform Act of 2009.  The Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Systems Engineering (DASD(SE)) is the principal advisor to the Secretary of Defense, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (USD(AT&amp;L)) and the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD(R&amp;E)) on systems engineering, development planning, and related technical fields in the Department of Defense.  The DASD(SE) develops policies and guidance for (1) the use of systems engineering principles and best practices; (2) the use of systems and software engineering planning and contracting approaches to enhance reliability, availability, and maintainability on major defense acquisition programs (MDAPs); (3) the systems engineering plans (SEPs) for MDAPs including software, and systems engineering considerations in support of lifecycle management and sustainability; and (4) the inclusion of provisions relating to systems engineering and reliability in requests for proposals.  The DASD(SE) reviews and approves the SEP for each MDAP and monitors and reviews the systems engineering and development planning activities of MDAPs and other defense acquisition programs as directed by the Secretary of Defense or the USD(AT&amp;L).  Based on the Director’s continuous program engagement, the DASD(SE) advises and makes recommendations to the Secretary of Defense and the USD(AT&amp;L) regarding systems engineering, development planning and the execution of these activities.  As a member of the Defense Acquisition Board, the DASD(SE) provides independent assessments of defense acquisition program’s systems engineering, development planning, technical execution, and risk.  The DASD(SE) also provides input on the inclusion of systems engineering requirements as part of the Joint Requirements Oversight Council's process for joint military requirements, to include developing specific inputs relating to each capabilities development document.

The DASD(SE) issues guidance to, and consults with, the Services and Agencies with respect to systems engineering in the Department and provides advocacy, oversight, and guidance to elements of the acquisition workforce responsible for systems engineering, development planning, and lifecycle management and sustainability functions and developing policies and guidance for the integration of specialty engineering functions.  The DASD(SE) integrates systems engineering with Mission Assurance in the acquisition system.  The DASD(SE) periodically reviews the organizations and capabilities of the military departments with respect to systems engineering, development planning, and lifecycle management and sustainability, and identifies needed changes or improvements to such organizations and capabilities. 

The DASD(SE) prepares and submits an annual report to Congress on systems engineering activities and effectiveness.

This PE includes effort by the office of the DASD(SE) in implementing the Department’s Cyber initiatives.  Specifically, the PE will develop and address the critical subdiscipline of systems engineering - system security engineering and Program Protection.  This includes study and maturation of discipline fundamentals such as best practices, tools, guidance, and policy, and will also pilot system security practices in defense acquisition as a fundamental element of systems engineering and technical reviews.  Efforts in this area are directly driven by cyber and malicious supply chain threats that the Department faces, and therefore, will include implementing Department directives and regulations to protect critical program information.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Department of Defense (DoD) must address cyber security and supply chain risks to DoD networks, weapons systems and information stored and processed on both DoD and Defense Industrial Base (DIB) unclassified networks that support DoD programs.  Increased reliance on the internet as a vehicle for sharing information, globalization of the supply chain, and advanced persistent threats (APTs) that can evade commercially available security tools and defeat generic security best practices, drive the need for better and smarter program protection planning and execution.  The President's Cyber Initiative has moved to counter these threats and mitigate the risks.  The Acquisition Cyber Security Initiative links high level policies and practical expertise to specific acquisition practices, systems engineering activities, and risk reduction activities.  Through this initiative the Department will pilot activities with the DIB to reduce risks in sharing and storing critical program information, better understand and mitigate supply chain risks, improve program protection planning, and improve and streamline program protection engineering.  The Department has developed a Trusted Systems strategy which integrates Protection Planning for the development of capabilities, the use of proven mitigation techniques and tools, the ongoing refinement of risk management processes, and creation of needed technology.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Joint Service programs were established by the Secretary of Defense to improve the training and readiness of the Active and Reserve Components.  This project expedites the prototype development of new training and readiness technologies and Joint Service training and readiness systems, which improve the training and readiness effectiveness and enhance the performance of the military forces.  It also facilitates the sharing of training and readiness information, while allowing for the transfer of emerging and innovative technologies among the Services and private sector.  Efforts have included: development of mission essential tasks; design, development, and implementation of performance metrics, data, and methodologies for the Joint Assessment and Enabling Capability to guide Training Transformation and support the Department’s balanced scorecard and Defense Readiness Reporting System; identified and defined joint urban training requirements, identified methods to conduct effective joint training, and determined best means to develop simulations, military construction, and other urban training facilities that meet Service, joint, and fiscal demands and requirements; developed joint training regimen requirements and investments ranging from the joint strategic level down to the joint tactical level for joint asymmetric warfare; and developed a joint stability and support operations training roadmap and investment plan for operations other than war including peace enforcement, peacekeeping, and humanitarian assistance.

In addition, this project supports DHRA and DoD training managers (OSD, Joint Staff, Unified Commands, and the Services) in promoting more efficient and effective use of training resources, increasing the effectiveness of military training, and enhancing the readiness and performance of the military forces.  Projects analyze the contributions to readiness of various training techniques and programs and use the results to expedite new training concepts and procedures that increase unit effectiveness or decrease costs.  Emphasis is placed on developing analytical tools and systematic methodologies to improve training resource allocations.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The purpose of the Nuclear Matters program is to sustain the U.S. nuclear deterrent posture, counter nuclear threats, and to develop nuclear and conventional physical security equipment. The funds for this program are used to support research, development, test and evaluation efforts as well as studies and analyses for nuclear weapons security; use control; nuclear weapons stockpile safety, survivability and performance; countering nuclear threats and office management.  Funds are also used to develop and implement plans for stockpile transformation; infrastructure analyses and assessments; DoD-NNSA Nuclear Weapons Council activities, as mandated by Title 10 USC, section 179; radiological and nuclear emergency response efforts; and management of international programs of nuclear cooperation, particularly with respect to enhancing international nuclear safety and security and office management.  Nuclear Matters is also responsible for policy development and implementation for personnel reliability; nuclear weapons, nuclear command and control, and special nuclear materials security; use control; nuclear weapons transportation; physical security equipment; countering nuclear threats; and nuclear and radiological incident response.

This Program Element can fund travel to support the requirements of this program.

This appropriation will finance work, including manpower, performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant arrangement with the government who conduct research (systematic study directed toward fuller scientific knowledge or understanding of the subject studied), development (systematic use of the knowledge and understanding gained from research, for the production of useful materials, devices, systems, or methods, including the design and development of prototypes and processes) and test and evaluation efforts.

                                    <r2:Description>To meets its security needs and those of its allies, the U.S. will need a safe, secure, and reliable nuclear deterrent for the foreseeable future.  There's increased risk, absent nuclear testing, in assuring long-term safety and reliability of today’s aging stockpile—the legacy warheads left over from the Cold War.  Today’s nuclear weapons complex is not sufficiently “responsive” to technical problems in the stockpile, or to potential emerging threats.  The task is to ensure the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile and supporting infrastructure, meets long-term national security needs.</r2:Description>

                    <r2:SummaryExplanation>FY 2011:  Includes Department reductions for Secretary of Defense Efficiencies (Studies Contract Efficiency – 1.253 million, Service Support Contract Efficiency -0.382 million), Program adjustment -0.501 million.
FY 2012:  FFRDC reduction -0.063 million, SBIR reduction -0.222 million, STTR reduction -0.030 million.
FY 2013:  Program adjustment -1.401  million

Studies contract Efficiencies will be realized by reducing the number of studies that we participate in while still supporting enterprise-wide information technology goals critical to DoD Mission.
Service Support Contract efficiencies will be realized by reducing the reliance on DoD Service Support Contractors by utilizing in-house government support in a constrained personnel and resource environment.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription> The CISA program provides a structured planning process based on Information Technology (IT) best business practices to define current and objective capabilities for IT support to assigned missions in a net-centric environment.  CISA is the DoD program that provides architectures in compliance with the Clinger-Cohen Act, OMB Circular A-130, E-Gov Act and other related higher level guidance from the Federal CIO Council and the Federal Enterprise Architecture Program Management Office, which mandates the development and use of architectures as validation for IT investment decisions. The CISA program develops and maintains the Global Information Grid Enterprise Architecture, the Department’s enterprise architecture as directed by Title 40. It supports the development of the framework, processes, and standards for developing and maintaining a DoD federated enterprise architecture. CISA is the leading developer for the net-centric reference model, the standard evaluation guide used by DoD Program Managers at all echelons of command for transitioning DoD programs to the net-centric environment.  The CISA program supports the development of architectural standard tools and systems, including the DoD Architectural Framework manual and artifacts as well as facilitating the effective use of architectures in IT portfolio management. Develop and maintain key GIG policy and guidance documents that drive the acquisition, transition to and operation of a net-centric GIG; the implementation of policy/guidance through a set of critical supporting activities such as IT standards management, and DoD transition to Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6); Real Time Service and IP convergence and enforcing policy through key enterprise governance mechanisms.  Review and assess Command and Control, Computers, Communications and Intelligence Support Plans / Information Support Plans for the DoD CIO, identifying interoperability, supportability, net-centric and integration issues.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>DARS is the Department’s enterprise registry, catalog and navigation map for enterprise architecture.  It serves as the Department’s primary catalog of architecture data holdings and provides users the ability to register holdings metadata and search, retrieve, and use DoD architecture data in federated architecture data repositories across DoD.  DARS provides a key component of the Department’s net-centric data management capability by federating enterprise architecture data across the Department.  It enables alignment of program architecture components with the Federal Enterprise Architecture Business Reference Model - consistent with OMB directives for exhibit 300s - via the DoD Business Reference Model.  DARS implements a federated search capability and metadata catalog that will interoperate with the Department’s Net-Centric Enterprise Discovery Service and enterprise content metadata catalog.  Architecture metadata is searchable using the DARS federated discovery web service.  The discovery search results provide links to architecture data that is retrievable based on user roles and access permissions.  Implementations are accessible on both the NIPRNET (unclassified) and SIPRNET (Collateral Classified).  Key features of the DARS program focus on: (1) Making architecture data visible, accessible, trusted, understandable, and interoperable (2) enabling reuse of validated architecture data to build “composite” integrated architectures; (3) enabling architecture analysis; and, (4) integrating architecture data into the DoD mainstream decision-making processes.  The Department of the Air Force, Army, and Navy CIO’s are collaborating in the development of DARS federation web services via the Federated Joint Architecture Working Group under the auspices of the DoD Enterprise Architecture Summit to ensure DoD-wide access to and usability of all components of the composite DoD enterprise architecture model.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>(U) The SBIR/STTR Program is executed in three phases. The purpose of Phase I is to determine, insofar as possible, the scientific technical and commercial merit, and feasibility of ideas submitted under the SBIR/STTR Program. Phase II awards are made to firms that have been awarded a Phase I contract on the basis of the results of their Phase I effort and the scientific, technical, and commercial merit of the Phase II proposal. Phase II is the principal research or research and development effort and is expected to produce a well-defined deliverable prototype. Phase III SBIR/STTR efforts derive from, extend or conclude Phase I or Phase II efforts, and are not funded with SBIR/STTR funds. Under Phase III, companies participating in the SBIR/STTR Program are expected to obtain funding from the private sector and/or non-SBIR/STTR government sources to develop the prototype into a viable product or non-R&amp;D service for sale in military and/or private sector markets.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Pursuing the R&amp;E mission requires attention to: identification and development of new technological opportunities; insertion of new technologies into warfighting systems and operations; and management and evaluation of the effectiveness of technology programs.  This program element provides mission support to the Office of the ASD(R&amp;E) (OASD(R&amp;E)).  It covers a wide range of studies and analysis in support of the R&amp;E program and it impacts the Department's decision to fund RDT&amp;E efforts.  

The program element provides funding for the Defense Laboratory Office within the OASD(R&amp;E)).  The Defense Laboratory Office advocates and invests in the DoD laboratory system in three areas: facilities and infrastructure; quality of workforce; and global insight of critical or strategic technologies important to the Department and the Nation.

The program element also provides engineering, scientific, and analytical support to the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research in its responsibility for direction, overall quality, and content of the science and technology (S&amp;T) program and ensures that the technology being developed is affordable and minimizes system development risk.  The Defense Technology Analysis program conducts assessments and analysis to ensure maximum utilization of research and development funds to accomplish the overall objectives of the S&amp;T program.  The Weapons Systems Acquisition Reform Act (WSARA) of 2009 expanded the role of the ASD(R&amp;E) in acquisition decisions.  Full implementation of the Act requires increases in both the number and depth of technology maturity assessments.  Funds are required for technical, analytical and management support, equipment and supplies, travel, and publications.

The DoD's key expertise for reviewing and guiding R&amp;E programs resides in the OASD(R&amp;E).  The OASD(R&amp;E) staff augment their responsibilities through their connections to technology experts in various fields throughout academia, industry, and government.  The Defense Support Teams project supports the directed responsibilities by building teams of technology experts to conduct program technical assessments.  The teams analyze the key engineering problem areas and offer adjustments in the development and test plan; alternate technical approaches; or new technologies that could enable successful development.  The teams constitute expert non-advocate reviews and gather advice from the Nation's leading technical experts.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:Text>Areas of emphasis included:
•	Identification of Department-wide laboratory in-house core technical competencies (CTCs);
•	Understanding Service and laboratory performance within CTCs;
•	Ensuring that CTCs are performing at the cutting-edge of global science, technology, and engineering;
•	Advocacy for investment in CTCs; and
•	Measurement of performance of the Defense laboratory enterprise.

DoD Lab CTCs are derived from COCOM S&amp;T Planning Scenarios, Quadrennial Defense Review Technology Area Studies, Intelligence Community products, Technology Horizon Scanning, and DoD/Service strategic plans. Laboratory fiscal information and program execution was collected via the Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC) R&amp;E database. The Defense Laboratory Office, in partnership with DTIC, developed a new data structure and architecture which facilitated the gathering and subsequent analysis of relevant information.  This new database architecture represents a consolidation of the existing R&amp;E, Work Unit Summary, and in-house S&amp;T report databases.  From the analysis, the Laboratory Office is able to track the status of the DoD laboratory enterprise’s program performance in support of the CTCs.  OASD(R&amp;E) teamed with the Services to determine modifications of programs and investments to ensure alignment of the laboratory enterprise with DoD technology goals.</r2:Text>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This funding request supports the development of emerging capabilities under the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering) Rapid Reaction Technology Office (RRTO).  These funds are used to advance technical capabilities in mutual areas of interest through focused partnerships and projects with other federal departments and agencies.  In addition to supporting interagency cooperation, this PE incubates selected concepts and technologies of interest to joint warfighters and their interagency partners to provide mature options as capability needs emerge in and beyond the Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP).  This includes developing risk-reducing prototypes to demonstrate capabilities in response to joint warfighter and interagency partners’ shared requirements; and informing the Joint Capabilities Integration &amp; Development System (JCIDS) and acquisition system through technical demonstrations.  Individual projects are developed and funded with interagency partners over a two to three year period – products are demonstrated and fielded in spirals within that project timeline – and generally do not include stand-alone studies.  Funding for this PE permits support for four to five major projects per year.  Typically, these projects support mid-term irregular warfare needs aligned with those of interagency partners, and often supports near term capability needs in support of the Department’s Rapid Fielding efforts.  This program element has evolved from exclusive support of force transformation activities to the activities described above, more closely aligned with departmental goals.  This PE will transition from PE 0605799D8Z to PE 0603699D8Z in FY 2012.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>The project sought to answer the fundamental question:  In a fast onset disaster, how do we generate unity of effort amongst all actors when unity of command is neither possible nor desirable and what technologies can contribute to this effort?  In previous humanitarian responses, ineffective coordination has led to a lack of unity amongst various responders and the host nation government, resulting in a time gap between quickly available financial, human, and relief resources and their application to problems faced on the ground.  This project seeks to capitalize on crowd-sourcing to determine how unity of effort can be achieved to help close the gap between identifying resources and their rapid utilization.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The problem of failing and failed states is increasingly recognized as a key challenge in the contemporary world and lies at the root of global insecurity.  Currently there are estimated to be some 40 to 60 countries that fall short of standards of state functionality, including but not limited to Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Somalia, Yemen, Haiti and Sudan.  There has been increasing recognition within the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and the broader interagency of the need to develop a United States Government (USG) approach to realize the concepts articulated by the Institute for State Effectiveness (ISE).  Given the strong demand at senior levels throughout government and a present deficit within USG of actionable tools for effective institution building, this project is a critical next step to define the operational technologies, templates and tools required to facilitate implementation.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Title>Enhanced Mortar Targeting System (EMTS)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>Existing Forward Operating Base (FOB) defense systems currently provide only the capability to detect, provide warning, and assess potential threats.  At smaller, more remote locations, the kinetic response capability is limited only to existing organic weapon systems, which can become overwhelmed; or, to supporting arms which may be unavailable due to weather, competing requirements or Rules of Engagement (ROE).  In addition, mortar crews are routinely exposed to enemy fire and/or unable to man their system due to enemy action.  The integration of a more robust response capability into detect/warn/assess systems will enhance the capability of small units/FOBs to defend themselves, which in turn enables greater tactical flexibility.  In the near term, this project augmented current kinetic capabilities available to units occupying small FOBs by providing the capability for precision mortar fire.  In the longer term, integrating this system and other weapons with existing and future sensors in order to maximize current capabilities and accelerate the development of future FOB defense technologies.   The EMTS provided rapid, 360 degrees indirect fire capability from a single firing position using an integrated fire control system and an electronic drive which provides auto-laying capability at a traverse rate of 15 degrees per second.  The mortar uses either 120 millimeters or 81 millimeters United States standard mortar tubes and provides an accuracy of 1 percent of range (for example: 30 meters at 3 kilometers).  The project seeks an end state where next generation FOB defense capabilities are integrated with a robust, precise, kinetic response scalable for application to FOBs ranging from sub-platoon to company sized locations.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Stiletto was developed to provide the DOD a dedicated operational Research and Development (R&amp;D) maritime platform.  Although the craft incorporates experimental naval architecture to explore the scalability of non-mechanical dynamic lift, carbon fiber construction, and high speed performance for military operations, it's the craft's electronic keel and associated craft characteristics (for example:  covered payload space, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) flight deck, shallow draft, and ability to easily integrate Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence (C4I) systems) that provides Stiletto her agile R&amp;D capabilities.  The electronic keel is flexible, modular and re-configurable to support near plug-and-play installation of C4I equipment used as part of experimentation.  In addition to testing C4I equipment, Stiletto is ideally suited for operational experimentation and has tested unmanned systems, sensors, and coastal warfare concepts of operations for various commands and agencies.  The Stiletto vessel is homeported at the Combatant Craft Division of the Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC), Carderock in Norfolk, Virginia.</r2:Description>

Stiletto’s operational experimentation in FY 2011 included participation in the Irregular Warfare Innovation Cell’s Blue Dragon demonstration.  Blue Dragon was a technology demonstration project between the National Maritime Intelligence Center, Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division and NSWC’s Combatant Craft Division.  Blue Dragon featured Stiletto as a “mothership” in conjunction with a family of maritime ISR sensors and platforms to advance the state of the art in the Maritime Domain Awareness arena.

                                    <r2:Description>Griffin leveraged the Navy’s Autonomous Maritime Navigation program to develop and install autonomous command and control systems and integrated the associated sensors on maritime platforms.  The goal was to provide a system that is capable of supporting a patrol mission with minimal human interaction, until a target of interest is identified, at which time the system either interrogated the target autonomously with its sensors, or requested operator support for interacting with the target.  There is no other fully functional autonomous unmanned surface vessel (USV) within DOD nor a system by which autonomous unmanned systems are able to act cooperatively.  Unmanned systems represent a large growth area for the warfighter, but currently require a greater logistics and personnel footprint than a similarly capable manned system.  This effort worked with cutting edge technologies to minimize human-machine interaction during the mission phase, while still producing high quality ISR data.  This will reduce manning requirements, allowing the tender vessel/station to conduct normal operations while the USV is conducting its assigned mission.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Project Pelican is a non-deployable airship technology demonstrator that integrates independent technologies into a single, rigid aeroshell variable buoyancy (RAVB) vehicle.  Pelican will demonstrate the technical maturity of a scalable vertical takeoff and landing aircraft. Key technologies to be demonstrated include a buoyancy management system to enable ballast-independent operations, composite lightweight rigid external structure, a responsive low-speed/hover control system, and a ground handling subsystem to enable operations on unimproved landing surfaces.

The program seeks to reduce risk by integrating and demonstrating a suite of technologies with the potential to reduce operational constraints on future heavy-lift, buoyant-aircraft development programs.  Success may lead to a nascent class of air vehicle which will radically reduce energy use per ton-mile, permit high-payload operations in austere regions with little infrastructure, and enable long-endurance manned or unmanned air operations.  RAVB aircraft appear to be scalable to payloads of 500-1,000 tons (compared with payloads in the 125-ton range for the largest current US cargo aircraft).  In addition, RAVB aircraft may also reduce need for intermodal transportation as cargo moves from origin to point of need, with corresponding reduction in delivery times.

                                    <r2:Title>Thunderstorm</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>A follow-on to RRTO’s “Bluegrass” efforts, Thunderstorm has established an enduring multi-platform, multi-sensor Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) test bed using Southern Command's (SOUTHCOM) Joint Interagency Task Force South (JIATF-S) and Joint Task Force North (JTFN), along with DHS/Customs and Border Protection (CBP) locations as venues to conduct operational experiments with next generation detection, cueing, monitoring, tracking, and handoff capabilities against asymmetric target sets.  

In FY2011 the U.S. Southwest border was chosen as exercise venues because the operational environment is similar to deployed locations (i.e. Iraq and Afghanistan), and contains many of the same elements (i.e., non-state actors, ad hoc available to facilitate the development of government and industry capabilities to meet warfighter networks, and an adaptive enemy).  The availability of CBP operational intelligence architectures coupled with a true interagency organizational construct made the Southwest border a realistic environment to vet capabilities prior to deployment to more stressing operational environments.

In addition to providing relevant intelligence to support JIATF-South, and now JTFN operations, Thunderstorm also encourages greater cooperation with multi-agency/multinational partners, and identifies improvements in ISR concepts of operations that can be exported for other areas of responsibility to leverage.  OSD has made Thunderstorm exercise data requirements.

Operations were conducted from a tactical operations center, located in the CBP Information and Operations Control Center (IOCC) located in Tucson, AZ.  Air and ground assets were tasked each day to perform two basic missions. First, each would be tasked to collect against actors performing scripted activity in Catalina State Park, AZ.  This activity provided ground truth for each of the sensors.  Following this, assets were tasked to fly along the border west of Nogales, AZ in support of real-world CBP activities. Sightings were relayed to CBP for their action.  Next year, Spirals 4.1 and 5.0 will be conducted in the same operational area, once again supporting CBP counter-drug efforts.  </r2:Text>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports and assesses the DT&amp;E efforts of each Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP) and other Special Interest acquisition programs as designated by USD (AT&amp;L), assesses the DT&amp;E capabilities of the Military Departments and DoD Components, oversees the DT&amp;E acquisition workforce, issues policy and guidance for the conduct of DT&amp;E within DoD, and produces the annual DT&amp;E report to Congress.  Specific activities include the following:

- Review and approve the Test and Evaluation Strategy (TES) and Test and Evaluation Master Plans (TEMPs) for each MDAP and USD (AT&amp;L) designated Special Interest program.
- Provide the Milestone Decision Authority with independent evaluations of acquisition program DT&amp;E planning, execution, and system performance.
- Coordinate closely with the Director of Systems Engineering to ensure that the developmental test and evaluation activities of the Department of Defense are fully integrated into and consistent with the systems engineering and development planning processes of the Department.
- Provide Assessments of Operational Test Readiness (AOTRs) to inform the Service Acquisition Executive on readiness of Programs to proceed into Initial Operational Test and Evaluation with a high probability of being found operationally effective, suitable and survivable.
- Develop policy and guidance to ensure efficient and effective DT&amp;E across DoD, including policy and guidance for joint T&amp;E and, in conjunction with Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&amp;E), integrated DT&amp;E and OT&amp;E.
- Provide DT&amp;E assessments for the Systems Engineering Program Support Review process, Nunn-McCurdy certification review teams, and the Director, Performance Assessment and Root Cause Analysis (PARCA).
- Review the organizations and capabilities of the military departments with respect to developmental test and evaluation and identify needed changes or improvements to such organizations and capabilities, and provide input regarding needed changes or improvements for the test and evaluation strategic plan developed by TRMC. 
- Developing policy, guidance and certification standards to enhance DT&amp;E acquisition workforce planning and progression.  Monitoring and facilitating Defense Acquisition University (DAU) updates of T&amp;E courses to ensure the curriculum supports the certification standards and provides the appropriate education and training.

The decrease in funding from FY 2010 to FY 2011 is due to the WSARA of 2009, which directed a new Office of the Director, Systems Engineering, in FY 2011 to receive their a new Systems Engineering Program Element (0605142D8Z). </r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program supports the Office of the Director, Cost Assessement &amp; Program Evaluation (CAPE).  It funds assessments that help to resolve budget and programmatic issues across the full range of the Department’s activities.  Projects that support this effort help to inform the leadership on program alternatives, capability concept development, design and cost, the appropriate balance of capabilities across the force, and also to identify how well the Department’s expenditures are meeting its goals, and how well the force can implement the Defense strategy.

This program provides for analytical research across a spectrum of  issues and concerns.  The research agenda is focused on near to long-term problems identified by the Secretary of Defense, and addresses difficult and complex questions linked to program alternatives for current and future capabilities and forces in order to enhance the senior leadership's deliberations and decision-making.

This program provides the scientific and technical engineering services needed for research studies in the development of models and simulations and the evaluation of current analytical tools and scientific methods used to evaluate and assess weapons systems and warfighting capabilities for warfighting environments and scenarios, and related force structure.  Deliverables from this program will include reports, briefings, and analyses designed to illuminate critical issues facing the Department.  Outcomes include recommendations for new modeling techniques, programmatic alternatives, and scenario development.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Develop and test promising aviation safety technologies.  This funding supports Secretary Gates’ direction to achieve a 75% reduction in accidents and supports the Defense Safety Oversight Council's (DSOC) pursuit of aviation safety technologies, as endorsed in the Secretary’s May 30, 2007 memorandum, “Zero Preventable Mishaps.”  In FY 09, there were 29 Class A aviation accidents with 18 destroyed aircraft and 28 fatalities. Mid-air collisions are currently the #2 cause of fatalities in fighter/attack aircraft.

The DSOC used a data-driven approach to identify and evaluate the most effective hardware and software technologies to be implemented to reduce preventable aviation mishaps. The DSOC task force surveyed existing programs and provided an assessment of the viability and advisability of future resource investments. These investments will fund hardware and software technology to prevent helicopters and fighter aircraft mishaps.

Specifically, this effort will develop and flight test an Automatic Air Collision Avoidance System (AACAS) suitable for use in the dynamic, fighter air-to-air training environment.  This effort completes the design and flight test of an automatic air collision avoidance system in an F-16 test-bed, with applicability to all modern fighters and potentially UASs.

From FY 06 – FY 10 a team of automatic collision avoidance experts from AFRL, NASA, and Lockheed-Martin Aeronautics developed and flight tested the Automatic Ground Collision Avoidance System (AGCAS).  Following a highly successful flight test, this system is now undergoing operational integration in the F-16, F-22, and F-35 and is projected to prevent over 150 Class A mishaps over the lifespan of these aircraft, saving the Department over $10B in replacement costs.  In FY 10, with funding directed by RMD 802, this same team began design work on the AACAS.   Design efforts are on track with simulation testing scheduled for early FY11. Collision avoidance was recommended for funding in FY 2010. The Secretary stated that we can not and should not tolerate the injuries, costs, and capability losses from preventable accidents.  In FY11 continuation of algorithm development and begin simulator testing.   In FY12, completion of simulator and flight testing.  </r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This funding supports Secretary Gates direction to achieve a 75% reduction in accidents and supports the Defense Safety Oversight Council's (DSOC) pursuit of aviation safety technologies.  The Guidance for the Development of the Force (GDF) directs DoD Components to pursue accident reduction and prevention initiatives that emphasize safety in the workplace and hold leaders accountable for their safety programs. In FY 2008, there were 89 Class A aviation accidents with 61 destroyed aircraft and 32 fatalities.  The aviation accidents cost the Department over $2.9 billion with indirect costs approximately four times that amount.  

The DSOC used a data-driven approach to identify and evaluate the most effective hardware and software technologies to be implemented to reduce preventable aviation mishaps.  The DSOC task force surveyed existing programs and provided an assessment of the viability and advisability of future resource investments.  These investments will fund hardware and software technology to prevent helicopters and fighter aircraft mishaps.  

Collision avoidance was recommended for funding in FY 2010.  Automatic Collision Avoidance Technologies (ACAT) has been developed by the Air Force to prevent the most prevalent causes of fighter/attack mishap fatalities and destroyed aircraft. An Automatic Ground Collision Avoidance (Auto-GCAS) component of ACAT has matured and is ready for fleet integration. FY 2010-FY 2012 money will leverage the successes of ACAT by furthering  the development of Auto-ACAS, while retaining scarce technical expertise and flight test resources currently in use.  As an unintended side benefit, Auto-ACAS may also hold a key to Unoccupied Aerial Vehicle access to the National Airspace.

The Secretary stated that we can not and should not tolerate the injuries, costs, and capability losses from preventable accidents.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Defense Operations Security Initiative (DOSI) is a risk mitigation function that protects Joint and Coalition personnel, and aids in mission accomplishment.  The Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence signed on June 7, 2010 the DOD Operations Security (OPSEC) Program Annual report stating, " We must now focus on the application of OPSEC in support of missions and operations - moving beyond the checklists and incorporating OPSEC as a daily tool to enable operations."  Additional language within the Defense Planning and Programming Guidance for Fiscal Years 12-16; the 2010-2013 Chairman's Joint Training Guidance, 31 August 2009; the Universal Joint Task List (UJTL), 20 February 2009; and the Electronic Warfare Capability Based Assessment, dated June 2008, all endorse increasing OPSEC efforts across the information environment.  These documents support increasing non-kinetic efforts such as the Joint Operations Security Initiative (JOSI).

While the security function of limiting access in OPSEC is established, the "operational" function of managing patterns and indicators is deficient.  Advances in technology and data aggregation continue to increase operation risk due to the adversary's ability to identify, analyze, and act in a timely manner.  The JOSI will identify OPSEC requirements and eliminate shortfalls across the operational environment which includes the land, air, maritime, space, and cyberspace domains.  The JOSI is in line with the Secretary of Defense's emphasis on efficiently moving assets from overhead to operational forces.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program is part of the Defense Department’s coordinated effort to integrate Information Operations (IO), Cyber, and Intelligence Operations Integrations (IOI) test and evaluation capabilities to assess IO, Cyber, and IOI technologies and tactics in a representative operational environment against realistic targets.  The Defensewide IO Program Review revalidated the need for a suite of automated data analysis and decision support software tools to facilitate joint-IO.  The advent of critical Cyberspace Operations mandate Cyber Technologies be assessed in a like environment.  In addition, joint warfighter requirements are driving the need for the integration of intelligence and operations capabilities/capacities.  This program enables users to accomplish Joint Intelligence Preparation of the Operational Environment (JIPOE), develop effective IO, Cyber, and operational strategies and candidate campaign targets, plan missions, and monitor and assess execution of operations.  The objectives of this program are to create a flexible, seamless and persistent environment enabling Combatant Commanders to achieve the same level of confidence and expertise in employing IO and Cyber capabilities that they have in kinetic weapons; to lead the development of joint IOI capabilities and capacity that facilitate operational and intelligence planning activities by the Services and COCOMs; and to transform IO, Cyber, and IOI activities to support  joint IO training, education, and exercises.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The National Military Strategy of the United States stresses the importance of integrating Information Operations (IO) capabilities for the success of Joint Operations and Decision Superiority.   The Defense-Wide IO Program Review revalidated a requirement for an integrated range supporting “exercises, testing, and development of IO capabilities.”  Further direction by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) identified the need for an “integrated IO test and evaluation capability to assess IO technologies and tactics in a representative operational environment against realistic targets.” The 2006 National Security Strategy identifies "Strengthen Alliances to Defeat Global Terrorism and Work to Prevent Attacks Against Us and Our Friends", which involves significant Information Operations (IO) and Cyber operations as a goal.  Through the Defense Planning Guidance (DPG) and the Integrated Priority Lists, COCOMs repeatedly state the need to expand IO/Cyber training and education for the developing cadre of IO/Cyber professionals and provide an environment for analysis, testing, training, combat assessments, and measures of effectiveness for more reliable IO/Cyber capabilities.  Deputy Secretary of Defense Memorandum on the IO Range established the requirement for creating a cooperative IO range among the Military Services.  

The IO Range provides a secure, flexible, and seamless environment for the Military Services and Joint warfighters to test, train, develop tactics, and exercise selected IO/Cyber capabilities.  The basis of the functional structure of the IO Range is the integration of existing ranges, laboratories, information warfare centers, and other Government facilities that currently support IO/Cyber test, training, exercise, and experimentation events.  Capabilities at the selected sites are securely connected and integrated into the IO Range.  A key feature of this concept is a persistent, secure connection that links the sites together, allowing the exchange of data and the visualization of effects as we employ capabilities.  Creation of a “virtual range” based on persistent connections significantly reduces the amount of lead-time required to set up each new warfighter event.  The long-term goal for the IO Range is to be a full spectrum IO/Cyber Range supporting: operations security (OPSEC), computer network operations (CNO), electronic warfare (EW), military information support operations (MISO), and military deception (MILDEC).  This environment enables the  warfighters to visualize non-kinetic weapons effects, understand the intricate and interactive effects generated by kinetic and non-kinetic weapons and achieve the same level of confidence and expertise in employing IO/Cyber capabilities as they have with kinetic capabilities. </r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Department must rapidly transform its processes in order to better support the agile warfighter.  This PE is dedicated to Rapid Acquisition Incentives – Net Centricity (RAI-NC) which serve DoD by providing RDT&amp;E proof-of-concept early implementation of key initiatives targeted at advancing and moving the Mission Areas of DoD towards Net Centricity.   For example, a coherent and timely transition across DoD Enterprise networks and infrastructure to the next generation of the Internet Protocol, ( IP) IP Version 6 (IPv6), is critical to leveraging the power of information by the business and warfighting mission areas through net-centric operations/warfare. The PE permits accelerating domain support processes thru rapid proof of concept development and early implementation.  

RAI-NC provides funding for Net Centric initiatives that directly support and facilitate the transformation of the DoD enterprise.   This effort is consistent with the Department’s strategic goals to: enable net-centric operations and warfare, reduce costs; improve efficiency; increase effectiveness by improving the efficiency and effectiveness of process redesign; business systems modernization; strategic sourcing; infrastructure reductions; and optimal-sized inventories.  The objective of RAI-NC is to accelerate DoD’s net centric transformation in support of the warfighter.  Fully achieving net-centricity requires the ubiquity, mobility, security and performance achievable through implementation of the value added features of IPv6.   The DoD IPv6 transition and implementation program has been incorporated into the DoD Unified Capabilities (UC) implementation program.  DoD UC is the integration of voice, video, and/or data services delivered ubiquitously across an interoperable, secure, and highly available IP network infrastructure, independent of technology, to provide increased mission effectiveness to the warfighter.  DoD UC integrates standards-based communication and collaboration services including, but not limited to:  messaging; voice, video, and Web conferencing; and unified communication and collaboration applications or clients.  These standards-based UC services are integrated with available enterprise applications, both business and warfighting.  As stated earlier, DoD UC includes DoD IPv6 implementation.  The scope of Rapid Acquisition Incentives – Net Centricity encompasses defense policies, processes, people, technologies and systems that guide, perform or support aspects of warfighter support processes within the Department.  Each RAI-NC initiative provides proof of concept sustainability, as well as the scalability necessary for Domain enterprise wide implementation that will allow end-to- end accessibility to net-centric based decision-making information.  Successful implementation will result in more reliable, accurate and timely net- centric management information upon which managers can make more effective business decisions in a timely manner for the Department.  

RAI-NC enables the acceleration of DoD efforts to implement network centric operational environments while providing a secure, flexible, reliable, affordable, integrated network to achieve high effectiveness in joint and combined operations.  This program employs RDT&amp;E funds to plan, develop, prototype and oversee proof of concept initiatives.  Successful initiatives with supporting business cases demonstrating the achieved goals and outcomes and mission area support will be allowed to enter full deployment.  This program is funded under BA-6, Management Support because it includes studies and analyses in support of R&amp;D efforts.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Department must rapidly transform its processes in order to better support the agile warfighter.  This PE is dedicated to Rapid Acquisition Incentives – Net Centricity (RAI-NC) which serve DoD by providing RDT&amp;E proof-of-concept early implementation of key initiatives targeted at advancing and moving the Mission Areas of DoD towards Net Centricity.   For example, a coherent and timely transition across DoD Enterprise networks and infrastructure to the next generation of the Internet Protocol, IP version 6 (IPv6) is critical to leveraging the power of information by the business and warfighting mission areas through net-centric operations/warfare. The PE permits accelerating domain support processes thru rapid proof of concept development and early implementation.  

RAI-NC provides funding for Net Centric initiatives that directly support and facilitate the transformation of the DoD enterprise.   This effort is consistent with the Department’s strategic goals to: enable net-centric operations and warfare, reduce costs; improve efficiency; increase effectiveness by improving the efficiency and effectiveness of process redesign; business systems modernization; strategic sourcing; infrastructure reductions; and optimal-sized inventories.  The objective of RAI-NC is to accelerate DoD’s net centric transformation in support of the warfighter.  Fully achieving net-centricity requires the ubiquity, mobility, security and performance achievable through implementation of the value added features of IPv6.   The scope of Rapid Acquisition Incentives – Net Centricity encompasses defense policies, processes, people, technologies and systems that guide, perform or support aspects of warfighter support processes within the Department.  Each RAI-NC initiative provides proof of concept sustainability, as well as the scalability necessary for Domain enterprise wide implementation that will allow end-to end accessibility to net-centric based decision-making information.  Successful implementation will result in more reliable, accurate and timely net centric management information upon which managers can make more effective business decisions in a timely manner for the Department.  

RAI-NC enables the acceleration of DoD efforts to implement network centric operational environments while providing a secure, flexible, reliable, affordable, integrated network to achieve high effectiveness in joint and combined operations.  This program employs RDT&amp;E funds to plan, develop, prototype and oversee proof of concept initiatives.  Successful initiatives with supporting business cases demonstrating the achieved goals and outcomes and mission area support will be allowed to enter full deployment.  This program is funded under BA-6, Management Support because it includes studies and analyses in support of R&amp;D efforts.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>These programs are part of a coordinated effort to develop and deploy capabilities for rapidly linking and integrating Live, Virtual, and Constructive (LVC) forces for Services, Combatant Commanders (COCOMs), coalition, and other government agencies.  These programs will create a realistic battlespace environment in which to train as a Joint Warfighting force to meet emerging mission requirements including adapting to new and future realities.  These investments support the Secretary of Defense’s (SECDEF) Commanders Exercise and Engagement Training Transformation (CE2T2) initiative to enable and enhance Joint Warfighting readiness by training as we intend to fight.  The elements associated with this coordinated effort consist of:

- Joint National Training Capability (JNTC)
- Joint Simulation Systems (JSS)
- Joint Knowledge Development &amp; Distribution Capability (JKDDC)
- U.S. Forces Korea Training &amp; Exercise Support (USFK)
- Immersive Trainer 
- Air Force JNTC
- Navy JNTC

JNTC:  Established in 2003, JNTC continues to develop and integrate Advanced Training Technologies into a seamless Joint training environment.  JNTC establishes the overarching Joint framework and context necessary for COCOMs and Services to achieve a Joint training environment through an integrated network of training sites and nodes.  JNTC provides the common standards, architecture, and development processes required to link Joint training programs.  By leveraging existing training programs or initiating specific actions, JNTC is developing credible opposing force capabilities and expanded access to assets from other Services and locations which are typically unavailable to the training audience by developing and integrating modeled and simulated representations of these capabilities. This furthers the integration of Joint training objectives into Service training events, while capturing the objective data necessary to provide a complete and accurate after action review.  This program develops and enhances current and future Joint training enterprise capabilities.

JSS:  This effort provides warfighters with Joint Simulations and Tools that enhance and enable Joint training across Services, COCOMs, Agencies and Coalition partners.  These Joint Simulations and Tools are part of an overall Joint Live, Virtual, and Constructive (JLVC) baseline of training capabilities resident in the Joint Force Trainer Toolkit (JFTT).  The JFTT is a set of training enablers, and “certified systems” that are interoperable and acceptable for usage within the Joint training environment.  The Joint Simulations and Tools provided by JSS are critical enablers that support the delivery of trained, capable, and interoperable Joint Forces.  

JKDDC:  Develop a Joint Individual Training Toolkit of web-enabled individual and small group training products and services.  Products and services are developed in response to JKDDC Joint Knowledge Online (JKO) Stakeholder (COCOMs, Services, and Combat Support Agencies) prioritized training requirements.  JKDDC JKO supports a career-long joint learning continuum, joint professional military education and tailored common training standards to Service members for tasks that are jointly executed, resulting in trained, capable, and interoperable joint forces.  JKDDC JKO technology initiatives principally include Virtual Cultural Awareness Training (VCAT) web-based gaming, Small Group Scenario Trainer (SGST), and mobile courseware training devices.  These capabilities facilitate the training and preparation of tens of thousands of military and civilian personnel deploying to COCOM theaters of operation prior to serving in their assigned Combined/Joint Task Force (C/JTF) billets. Specifically, VCAT supports one of the top  identified training shortcomings of returning warriors from United States Central Command (USCENTCOM) based C/JTFs (cultural awareness training). C/JTF ‘battle staffs’ will be adequately trained, as individuals and the staffs collectively, based on SGST development and implementation throughout the joint training enterprise. JKO mobile courseware training device development facilitates the global distribution of web-based joint training content on portable, hand-held platforms for joint warriors.  The future learning environment will provide training and learning to promote adaptability and agility in the workforce with the capability to tailor and adapt instructional material to fit the learner's strengths and weaknesses, learning style, and level of proficiency.
      
USFK:  This program will develop a Jointly Accredited and Supported Modeling &amp; Simulation federation of constructive simulations capable of satisfying all joint exercise training requirements in the Korean Theater of Operations.  This simulation system is also interoperable with the Republic of Korea developed Korean Simulation System.  This solution will be capable of interoperating in a common battle space that realistically represents the operating environment to all levels of training audiences, tactical to strategic, in Korean theater exercises.  While supporting USFK’s specific requirements, this solution will contain enhancements that will benefit all users of the JLVC.

Immersive Trainer:  This program supports a broader national effort to advance and integrate emerging technologies to increase the effectiveness of training in dismounted, small-unit operations in the contemporary operating environment.  Today’s dismounted forces when placed in a complex, culturally rich  environment require a training capability that challenges their mental agility as they are required to rapidly adapt in a dynamic environment which ranges from  conventional battles to irregular warfare (IW).  In close coordination with the Services, the Immersive Trainer imitative will create a realistic virtual environment to train small military units with the required level of complexity while creating sensory overload and decision-making under extreme stress.  Additionally, the Immersive Trainer will capture detailed data during complex scenarios to facilitate in-depth debrief and capture lessons learned for training audiences.  To date, this detailed debrief capability has been limited to operators of high-end platforms like fighter aircraft.  Now the infantry squad will be provided a comparable capability as aircraft crew to conduct mission rehearsals and after action reviews before and after critical missions. This capability for our dismounted general purpose and special operations forces is vital to saving lives and ensuring effective and ethical small unit operations in the future.  The immersive trainer also is a key component in development of small unit leaders by allowing them to train in a realistic environment which can be altered to stress different learning objectives.

                    <r2:SummaryExplanation>1.  As part of the SECDEFs efficiency cuts, the Joint Irregular Warfare training capability research and development was eliminated.  Research and development for Joint IW training is adequately addressed within the Services budgets.

2.  The Joint Simulation System increased funding provides minimal required enhancements to Joint simulations and tools. This critical enabler enables a relevant training environment for Joint training of Combatant Commands, Joint Task Forces, and Service Functional Components.  

3.  Increased funding for the JNTC is attributed to the rebalancing of priorities and focus of delivering Joint training enterprise enablers that support Joint training across the Services and Combatant Commands.  This increased funding also addresses the ability to create Joint training environments that must respond to emerging threats and emerging warfighter training requirements such as Cyber, Integrated Air and Missile Defense, and Cross Domain Information Sharing.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>DoD directed USJFCOM to establish the JNTC research and development program to develop future training concepts and capabilities.  The mission is to develop a robust Joint training environment that represents the complexities of the operational environment through the seamless integration of Live, Virtual, and Constructive (LVC) elements.  JNTC creates Joint warfighting conditions through a networked collection of interoperable training sites, ranges, and nodes that synthesize personnel, doctrine, and technology to deliver and achieve “Joint Context” for COCOM and Service training requirements.  JNTC provides RDT&amp;E within an LVC distributed test-bed supporting the advancement of training technologies in the context of a Joint integrated battle space.  The test bed operates as a continuous training RDT&amp;E environment, providing the foundation for a distributed and deployable Mission Rehearsal System, integrating live Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance feeding the Common Operational Picture.  These funds provide critical Joint/Coalition Service members and interagency partner’s enhanced training to allow requisite enhancements to existing training systems, capabilities, and technologies. These enhancements improve training efficiencies and provide an integrated LVC environment.  This capability precludes the necessity for conducting large-scale live exercises to achieve the SECDEF’s Combatant Commanders Exercise and Engagement Training and Transformation (CE2T2) vision.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>Initially established in 2003, JNTC continues to develop and integrate Advanced Training Technologies into a seamless Joint training environment.  JNTC establishes the overarching Joint framework and context necessary for COCOMs and Services to achieve a Joint training environment through an integrated network of training sites and nodes.  JNTC provides the common standards, architecture, and development processes required to link Joint training programs.  By leveraging existing training programs or initiating specific actions, JNTC is developing credible opposing force capabilities and expanded access to assets typically unavailable to the training audience by developing and integrating modeled and simulated representations of these capabilities. This furthers the integration of Joint training objectives into Service training events, while capturing the objective data necessary to provide a complete and accurate after action review.  This program develops and enhances current and future Joint training enterprise capabilities.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The JITMT effort focused on comparing current training capabilities with training requirements in order to identify gaps in our current Joint training capability, to identify alternatives for resolution and to assess the cost and effectiveness of these alternatives. Specifically, the JITMT focuses on: (1) developing and integrating enhancements to the existing and programmed constructive simulations, (2) pursuing selected alternative training methodologies, (3) developing an innovative acquisition prototype, (4) developing solutions to implement recommendations from the Joint Staff’s comprehensive study to re-engineer Joint training and (5) developing a clear management and oversight structure to meet future Joint training requirements.  These efforts provide solutions to the 35 gaps and seams in Joint and Service training requirements identified by the COCOM’s in the SECDEF 2004 JITMT study.  These efforts increase warfighter Joint training capabilities with improved constructive simulations and streamlined acquisition processes, leveraging industry training methodologies and technologies to provide on-demand Joint training tailorable to COCOM requirements for Joint Task Force headquarters staffs and individuals.</r2:Description>

Products and services are developed in response to JKDDC Joint Knowledge Online (JKO) Stakeholder (COCOMs, Services, and Combat Support Agencies) prioritized training requirements.  JKDDC JKO supports a career-long joint learning continuum, joint professional military education and tailored common training standards to Service members for tasks that are jointly executed, resulting in trained, capable, and interoperable joint forces.  This initiative supports advanced technology development and enhancement for the Joint Advanced Distributive Learning enabled training community.  JKDDC JKO advanced technology initiatives primarily include Virtual Cultural Awareness Training (VCAT) web-based gaming, the Small Group Scenario Trainer (SGST), and mobile courseware training devices.  These capabilities facilitate the training and preparation of tens of thousands of military and civilian personnel deploying to COCOM theaters of operation prior to serving in their assigned Combined/Joint Task Force (C/JTF) billets. Specifically, VCAT supports one of the top identified training shortcomings of returning warriors from United States Central Command (USCENTCOM) based C/JTFs (i.e. cultural awareness training). C/JTF ‘battle staffs’ are becoming more adequately trained, as individuals and the staffs collectively, based on SGST development and implementation throughout the joint training enterprise.

Version 4 will enhance joint warrior provided recommendations from versions 1 through 3, and target development of four additional SGST scenario use cases for representative JTF staffs, all designed to complement existing Combatant Command mission rehearsal exercises in preparation for deployment to their respective theaters of operation.  Thousands of joint, interagency, intergovernmental and multinational participants will be better trained as individuals and collectively as small teams prior to and during deployment in COCOM environments.   
•  Develop emerging Virtual Culture Awareness Trainer (VCAT) web-based game training requirements. Products will take advantage of joint warrior provided recommendations from  the five existent VCAT games, expand the number of training audience AOR environments (as prioritized by DoD senior leaders), integrate DLI approved language training content, while simultaneously demonstrating an improved capability to deliver training via an innovative training technique.
•  Develop a future learning ecosystem that will provide training and learning environments (software agents) with the capability to tailor and adapt instructional material to fit the individual's cognitive strengths and weaknesses, learning style, level of proficiency, and the learner's present state of being and understanding across a broad range of content.</r2:Text>

Joint Staff J-7, in collaboration with USFK and appropriate Republic of Korea agencies, integrate Warfighters’ Simulation (WARSIM) into the JLVC Training Federation in order to field a functioning JLVC federation to USFK.  This new training environment will support the extensive ground order of battle required to accurately simulate operations on the Korean Peninsula.  It also maximizes existing JLVC training standards and investments, and fully leverages Service training capabilities and roadmaps.  This solution will provide the initial effort to link coalition training architectures into the JLVC as well.  It will also promotes the Joint Training Environment vision and goals and implement selected pieces of recommendations identified in the LVC report, the Flagship Study.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The board’s responsibilities encompass merging and prioritizing technical training requirements.  It apportions work to the RDT&amp;E elements based on an assessment of where the work is best accomplished.  The boards evaluate the efficacy of development efforts based on performance metrics and will vote on whether or not to continue the effort.  This process will ensure the Joint Force Trainer capabilities development effort synchronizes with warfighter requirements.  Performance metrics include, but are not limited to; time, money, realism, and fidelity as defined below:

•  Time – Will the effort enable the Joint Force Trainer to prepare and execute training more timely than current capabilities allow?
•  Cost – Will the effort enable the Joint Force Trainer to prepare and execute training at a more effective and efficient cost than current capabilities allow?
•  Realism – Will the effort enable the Joint Force Trainer to create a training environment that is closer to the real world environment than current capabilities allow?
•  Fidelity – Will the effort enable the Joint Force Trainer to create more detailed capabilities in the training environment than current capabilities allow?

The Performance Improvement and Information Management Board is the strategic forum where the outcomes of performance relative to our external customers, stakeholders, and strategic stewardship of resources are the focus of discussion.  Performance against the targets will be assessed and reported monthly, briefed quarterly to the FMB/CAMB, and rolled up into the JCW Joint Training End-of-Fiscal Year Performance Report to ensure transparency and accountability.

                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Joint Coalition Warfare (JCW) Financial Management Board (FMB) and Contract Acquisition Management Board (CAMB) review planned Research Development Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) equities. The JWFC FMB/CAMB consists of senior technical, operational, program manager, and stakeholder representatives within the Joint Force Trainer Community. The board’s responsibilities encompass merging and prioritizing technical training requirements. It apportions work to the RDT&amp;E elements based on an assessment of where the work is best accomplished. The boards evaluate the efficacy of development efforts based on performance metrics and will vote on whether or not to continue the effort.  This process will ensure the Joint Force Trainer capabilities development effort synchronizes with war-fighter requirements.

Specific performance metrics for FY 2012 include, but are not limited to:

•  Navy will produce one JSAF software release to include documentation; will design and implement upgrades to JSAF consistent with approved requirements and CRs and document the effects of JSAF capabilities (robustness) and stability.  Will design, implement, test, and integrate JSAF enhancements in accordance with requirements.

•  Navy will produce one Navy Training Federation Object Model (FOM) (NTF) release to include applicable documentation updates for the Guidance, Rational, and Interoperability Manual (GRIM) and Federation Agreement document (FAD). Will implement JSAF capability enhancements to support evolving joint and Coalition training requirements.

•  Navy will deliver a JSAF/JNTC-JLVC FOM interoperability Guide.

•  Navy will facilitate integration by providing dedicated support to the effort, improving the quality of participation and documentation of Navy efforts in the JNTC.  Refine and mature the Navy Training Federation Object Model (NTF), it is improving interoperability and integration with other services and the Joint community.  Provides a standardized FOM for integration across the Navy training simulations.

•  Navy’s current Joint Live-Virtual-Constructive (JLVC) and other federation simulation distribution is accomplished by tying simulation data to multicast groups. This is neither a scalable solution nor is it an effective one as federates are not able to publish and subscribe with fine enough precision. The Simulation Aware Software Router will address this shortcoming, and additionally provide a flexible solution for federating heterogeneous networks and on-the-wire protocols without forcing all federates onto a single, uniform, lowest common denominator solution for each training event.  Ultimately, a simulation aware router will allow simulation users to optimize the network for both simulation scalable traffic and for voice and Command, Control, Communications, (Computers), Intelligence (C4I) traffic.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Joint Integration &amp; Interoperability (JI&amp;I) Program Element underwrites the Department’s core joint Command and Control (C2) efforts for military needs development and validation, for development of associated Doctrine, Organization, Training, Material, Leadership, Personnel, Facilities (DOTMLPF), and for operational assessment of materiel solutions proposed and delivered by the Defense acquisition enterprise.  Funds from the JI&amp;I Program are used to address joint capabilities including, but not limited to operational through tactical level joint integration of the following capabilities: Common Operational and Tactical Pictures; Combat Identification; Situational Awareness; Adaptive Mission Planning and Rehearsal; Interoperability among Service/ Agency intelligence systems; Interoperable Joint Fires, Maneuver, and Intelligence; and Integrated Joint Battle Management Command and Control.  Activities funded by the JI&amp;I Program aim to:

- Identify, and/or develop mission capable solutions for COCOM interoperability and integration capability shortfalls with emphasis on non-materiel elements;
- Assess operational suitability and sufficiency of materiel solutions identified by the Defense acquisition enterprise in response to validated joint C2 needs;
- Provide Combatant Commanders with interoperable combat identification and situational awareness capabilities among United States Interagencies, and Allied and Coalition Forces in support of Overseas Contingency Operations;
- Develop joint requirements supporting C2-intensive joint missions such as Joint Close Air Support and Joint Fires;
- Develop joint integrated architectures that guide service capability mapping to achieve joint interoperability; 
- Establish fundamental joint data standards and cross domain solutions to facilitate future system interoperability and integration; and,
- Undertake other activities to resolve emergent operational and tactical needs associated with joint C2.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Joint Integration and Interoperability Program (JI&amp;I) funds efforts to identify critical characteristics of joint military capabilities and synchronize Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership and Education, Personnel and Facilities (DOTMLPF) capability elements into a coherent package for employment by joint commanders.

The JI&amp;I Program provide resources for a wide range of efforts to define, refine, and deploy integrated joint capabilities.  JI&amp;I-funded endeavors aim to improve US and coalition capabilities to conduct coordinated operations.  Necessarily, JI&amp;I-funded projects most frequently address Command &amp; Control (C2) and Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) - the capstone capabilities for integrating disparate elements of military force for joint and coalition operations.  The JI&amp;I Program supports tasks and projects associated with integration and interoperability of the C2 Portfolio including coordination of C2 operational architectures, standards, and policies. Likewise, JI&amp;I partially funds integration and decision support activities associated with DOD executive level C4 management and oversight.  

The JI&amp;I Program deliver outcomes conforming to joint integration missions:
- In concert with the separately funded Joint Systems Integration Command (JSIC) and Joint Fires Integration Interoperability Team (JFIIT), JI&amp;I resources investigate joint C2/C4ISR shortfalls and ascertain characteristics of DOTMLPF remedies to meet mission requirements. The remedies are then pursued through partnerships with Component force development authorities and acquisition sponsors. 
- Consistent with the role as operational sponsor for joint C2, JI&amp;I underwrites Joint Combat Capability Developer (JCCD) activities compiling operational requirements for C2/C4ISR capability development and integrated testing. 
- Delivers assessment and recommendations for improvement of interoperable Combat Identification (CID) and Situational Awareness (SA) capabilities among United States forces, interagency organizations, and allied/coalition forces;
- Establishes joint data standards and cross domain solutions to facilitate future system interoperability and integration. Joint Integration and Interoperability Program (JI&amp;I) funds efforts to identify critical characteristics of joint military capabilities and synchronize Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership and Education, Personnel and Facilities (DOTMLPF) capability elements into a coherent package for employment by joint commanders.

                                    <r2:Title>Joint C2 Capability Development and Integration</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>Primary objective is development, oversight, and execution of the DoD C2 Strategic and Implementation Plan objectives.  Incremental delivery of "born joint" capabilities are integrated and synchronized across the Department’s requirements, resources and acquisition processes, enhancing the joint war fighting capabilities of the combatant commanders. The JI&amp;I program, in coordination with the Defense acquisition enterprise, assesses the effectiveness of C2 capabilities, identifies emerging capability gaps, and formulates recommendations to address those gaps via the Joint Staff. 

To hasten delivery of C2 capabilities across the full spectrum of warfare, Joint Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) requirements were assessed to formulate a Net Enabled Universal Joint Task (NE-UJT) Working Group, which is refining the quantitative aspects of the Net Ready Key Performance Parameters (NR-KPP); C2 attributes measurable through T&amp;E.  JI&amp;I personnel participated in exercises including Joint Task Force Exercises (JTFEX), Empire Challenge, and Bold Quest to identify and collect C2 attributes suitable to support joint C2 operational assessments. These T&amp;E support efforts spawned the C4I Partnership (C4IP) for evaluation of operational and tactical C2 capabilities both fielded and under development.

The primary outputs and efficiencies pursued through Joint C2 Capability Development and Integration efforts funded by the JI&amp;I program element include: 
1) Improved, integrated, interoperable, and networked joint force; 
2) Reduction in duplicative C2 systems/programs across the DoD portfolio; 
3) Improved decisions and recommendations regarding investment strategies and development efforts; and,
4) Associated benefits to warfighter efficiency and effectiveness.

Specific tasks undertaken in support of these results include:
- Documenting and validating  needs  for Cooperative Target Identification to enhance combat effectiveness, reduce fratricide, increase availability of close air support for troops under fire, provide more effective coordination of air assets, increase weapon accuracy and support time sensitive targeting;
- Documenting Authoritative Data Sources (ADS) with “secure transparency” timelines to provide a common data reference set for C2 interoperability;
- Developing Data Standards with breadth of application through Integrating architectures;
- Coordinating strategies to transition from legacy, platform-centric systems to a net-enabled environment focused on plug-and play interoperability and application-independent data flow.

                                    <r2:Description>The primary objective for this effort is to meet joint warfighter command and control (C2) needs through a flexible and responsive capability-needs development and oversight process across the full spectrum of C2 development; strategic-to-tactical.  The CCD identifies joint C2 requirements/capability needs and essential Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership, Personnel, Facilities – Policy (DOTMLPF-P) attributes to support development and fielding of agile C2 solutions in response to validated warfighter needs.  The CCD serves as DoD’s operational sponsor and Warfighter advocate for Global Command and Control System-Joint (GCCS-J) capabilities and Joint C2 capabilities, and as joint functional sponsor to develop requirements for the Global Theater Security Cooperation Management Information System (G-TSCMIS).  It also serves as DoD’s operational sponsor for Multi-National and Mission Partner (MNMP) requirements development, including Unclassified Information Sharing capabilities.  The CCD employs a formalized C2 governance and management process codified in CJCSI/M 3265.01, CJCSI 6285.01B, and the JROC-approved Charter for Joint C2 Capability Requirements Governance to collect, collate, validate, prioritize, and sequence the many C2 stakeholder requirements and capability needs, and ensure Service and agency development efforts are synchronized.  As a key leader of C2 governance and management processes, the CCD co-chairs two C2 working groups with OSD, Joint Staff, Services, Combatant Command, and Agency participation to evaluate the health of current C2 capabilities.  Further, it co-leads an O6-level CCD Council of Colonels to identify and address C2 issues, and recommend solutions to senior level C2 forums up through the Vice Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff.  To synchronize C2 development efforts, the CCD leads semi-annual Plan Build conferences composed of Service and Agency materiel developers to prioritize and coordinate C2 development efforts by fiscal year.  To support requirements management and capability development/integration, the CCD conducts C2 mission capability analysis through C/S/A engagement to inform and recommend resource allocation and acquisition decisions for senior portfolio management.  Additionally, the CCD oversees maintenance and development of innovative tools and techniques to support analysis of C2 capabilities based on technical, operational, and programmatic criteria.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Primary objective for this effort is the Joint warfighter ability to access, share and fuse critical C2 information using common standards.  Currently, operators do not have visibility of what data exists for their use and/or may experience difficulty in accessing that data due to a lack of system or software interoperability.  If they are able to access the data, they may not be able to understand the data or determine if it is applicable, current, or trusted.  Data producers struggle with standards for sharing, describing, and tagging data so that operational consumers and their supporting systems may use it.

As the military lead for C2 data strategy, we work with the Combatant Commands, Services, and Agencies COCOM/Service/Agency (C/S/A) to achieve the primary outcome and efficiencies associated with making C2 data assets visible, accessible, understandable and interoperable by (1) Leading an effective C2 Data Strategy management construct to include guidance and policy recommendations; (2) Developing and refining C2 Data Standards and Best Practices; (3) Compiling Authoritative Data Source (ADS) inventories, generating exposure metrics and synchronizing ADS exposure with C2 Capability development; and (4) Supporting C2 Data Pilots, Joint Capability Technology Demonstrations (JCTDs), and other Data Strategy implementation activities in order to increase the Joint warfighter's access to C2 information.</r2:Description>

                                            <r2:Text>Collaborative Staffing: This capability has enabled the Joint Staff, Joint Force Providers, force providers and supported Combatant Commanders(CCDRs) to collaboratively develop the most effective and efficient sourcing solutions to competing and dynamic force requirements in time to allow predictable deployment schedules for the deploying service men and women throughout DoD.

Capabilities Module Development: JCRM force requirements and force provider modules are the tools that enable execution of overseas contingency operations by matching force requests with sourcing solutions.  The JCRM Capabilities Module allows CCDRs to draft potential future force requirements by generating off-the-shelf capability packages to support planning.  These capability packages can then be re-used by other planners.

Force Deployment Development: The Force Deployment Module imports the Joint Operation Planning and Execution System (JOPES) and Time-Phased Force Deployment Data (TPFDD) and compares it with the supported CCDRs force requirement and the Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) ordered deployment. This validation check ensures the right forces are deploying to the right place at the right time.

Joint Individual Augmentee Model: This capability improves the data sharing interface between electronic Joint Manpower and Personnel System (eJMAPS) and JCRM while providing functionality to manage Joint Manning Document for individual augmentation currently nonexistent in JCRM.  The capability will enable follow-on analysis, GFMAP orders generation and management as well as change management.  This capability will automate the Global Force Management Allocation Plan (GFMAP) Annex D order that currently numbers 16,284 lines in the FY 2010 GFMAP Annex D spreadsheet.

                                    <r2:Description>Primary objective for this effort is to integrate and assess U.S. and Allied combat identification capabilities in order to inform U.S. and Allied investment in both materiel and non-materiel solutions to the needs of coalition warfighters in current and future operations.  During 2003 through 2007 the Coalition Combat Identification Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (CCID ACTD) assessed the military utility of emerging combat identification technologies in a series of operational demonstrations that became more commonly known as the Bold Quest series.  The technologies assessed provided both cooperative and non-cooperative target identification capabilities, enabling coalition ground forces and aircrew to identify friendly, enemy and neutral ground entities, thereby improving their Situational Awareness and “shoot/don’t shoot” decision-making.  International participation, reflected in the commitment of both technologies and forces, has grown from an original six nation partnership to a coalition of fourteen nations providing technologies, forces and analytical resources.  Since 2007 the Bold Quest participants have increasingly incorporated the development of Tactics, Techniques and Procedures with technical development and testing; most notably in the area of Digitally Aided Close Air Support (DACAS) and Joint Fires Threads.</r2:Description>

Reflecting a growing international consensus in the Family of Systems approach, fostered in previous BOLD QUEST events, the fourteen BOLD QUEST 2011 participating nations are sponsoring a range of Cooperative Target Identification (Query/Response), Situational Awareness and Digitally Aided Fires initiatives that will exploit current and emerging Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance (ISTAR) capabilities. The assessment strategy established a robust environment, representative of coalition operations, in which to test varied methods of identifying friends, neutrals and enemy enabling effective engagement. Air and Ground elements from the participating nations will collectively demonstrate the ability to produce timely and accurate Position Location Information (PLI) and share that information across coalition and security domains. The BOLD QUEST 2011 footprint included 700 personnel, 25 fixed wing aircraft and 50 ground vehicles engaged in three weeks of day/night scenarios reflecting current operations.</r2:Text>

                                    <r2:Description>Primary objective is to transition capabilities that solve Joint Warfighting requirements for both material and non-material solutions.  The capabilities developed and transitioned provide workable solutions identified by Combatant Command Commanders, Services and Agency inputs.  These inputs are validated through coordinated WarFighter Challenge and Experimentation process (J9), Joint Training exercises (J7), Lessons Learned and Forward Support Element inputs (JCOA), Coalition Warrior Interoperability Demonstration (CWID) interoperability trial assessments (J8/JSIC), Irregular Warfare forums (JIWC) and Regional COCOM Joint Urgent Operations Need Statements (J8).  Additionally, transition activities are focused on the development and processing of acquisition documentation to include; JCIDS requirements, Certification and Accreditation documentation, CONOPS, Technology Transition Agreements, and Test and Evaluation results.  The objective for a material transition is to successfully transfer responsibility and ownership of developed and mature capabilities to formal acquisition programs.  The objective for non-material transition is to ensure that the DOTMLP-FP Change Request (DCR) is institutionalized in a COCOM, Service or Agency and implemented across DoD.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Primary objective of this effort is to improve overall management, oversight and operational support to DoD acquisition entities seeking the capabilities of new, commercial technology that can fill existing gaps in the DoD C2ISR infrastructure while expanding coalition team building with NATO and Five Eyes nations, other Coalition Partners, and US Military/Defense Agencies.  

The primary outputs and efficiencies to be realized are increased support to the DoD Acquisition community identifying and assessing commercial capabilities that have potential to meet existing, but unresolved DoD C2 requirements, i.e. improve coalition command, control and coordination for both conventional and irregular warfare operations in the following areas: 

-  Capabilities that improve leader centric, net-enabled operations; 
-  Capabilities that enhance coalition battle space situational awareness;
-  Capabilities that enhance coalition logistics planning and nation building capabilities;
-  Capabilities that enhance coalition, military, government agency, international organization and non-governmental organization partnership 
-  Capabilities that improve secure information sharing between disparate security domains and communities of interest in an operational environment; 
-  Capabilities that improve centralized command, decentralized control for irregular / hybrid warfare units.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Critical Infrastructure Program (DCIP) is a Department of Defense (DoD) risk management program that seeks to ensure the availability of networked assets critical to DoD missions, to include DoD and non-DoD, domestic and foreign infrastructures essential to planning, mobilizing, deploying, executing, and sustaining United States military operations on a global basis.  Through identifying Defense Critical Assets, assessing them to determine vulnerabilities, incorporating specific threat and hazard information and analysis, and visually displaying relevant infrastructure data and analysis, DoD will be positioned to make risk management decisions to ensure the appropriate infrastructure is available, when needed, to support DoD missions.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Defense Critical Infrastructure Program (DCIP) is a Department of Defense (DoD) risk management program that seeks to ensure the availability of networked assets critical to DoD missions, to include DoD and non-DoD, domestic and foreign infrastructures essential to planning, mobilizing, deploying, executing, and sustaining United States military operations on a global basis.  Through identifying Defense Critical Assets, assessing them to determine vulnerabilities, incorporating specific threat and hazard information and analysis, and visually displaying relevant infrastructure data and analysis, DoD will be positioned to make risk management decisions to ensure the appropriate infrastructure is available, when needed, to support DoD missions.

Specifically, Combatant Commands (COCOMs) are responsible for identifying the mission capability requirements and coordinating with the Military Departments, Defense Agencies, DoD Field Activities, and Defense Sector Lead Agents to identify and assess Defense Critical Assets. As asset owners and capability providers, the Secretaries of the Military Departments and the Directors of Defense Agencies and DoD Field Activities, coordinate with the COCOMs to identify and prioritize the assets required to support mission-essential functions. Asset owners will also assess identified Defense Critical Assets to identify vulnerabilities and apply appropriate remediation and mitigation measures. The Defense Sector Lead Agents are responsible for identifying the specific functions, systems, assets (DoD and non-DoD owned), and interdependencies within the Defense Sector infrastructure networks supporting the identified critical missions.

Each Defense Sector Lead Agent, as identified in DoDD 3020.40, represents one of ten (10) functional areas that provide support to the Combatant Commanders and asset owners. These functional areas are as follows:  defense industrial base (DIB); financial services; global information grid (GIG); health affairs; intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR); logistics; personnel; public works; space; and transportation.  

In addition, DCIP manages specific analytic efforts in the identification and maintenance of specific inter- and intra-dependencies DpD has on the foundational commercial infrastructure networks supporting the identified critical missions.  Specific analytic efforts are focused within six (6) commercial infrastructure areas:  energy (electric power, natural gas); chemicals; transportation; telecommunications; water; and petroleum, oil, lubricants (POL).

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element provides systems engineering and technical analysis of the DoD Information Technology (IT) portfolio containing over 600 programs valued at over $180 billion.  The Principal Staff Assistant (PSA) advises OSD leadership on end to end warfighter communication capabilities to include portfolio management, developmental support responsibilities on numerous programs, synchronization, and interoperability efforts and issues.  Emphasis is placed on the information transport, information assurance, net and spectrum management, command and control (C2), space, and enterprise services activities focused on the development, integration, testing and technical assessment of capabilities and applications in joint and coalition warfighter support environments.  Resources support collaborative efforts to demonstrate the interoperability and performance requirements of acquisition programs.  The PSA develops portfolio-wide guidance and provides technical analysis to enable the warfighter, intelligence, and business communities to meet their respective mission requirements.  This program is funded under Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, and it supports system definition, development, testing, and program analysis of major acquisition programs engineering development and synchronization activities.  

This project provides the resources necessary to implement net centric processes and authoritative analytic methods that provide the capability to synchronize interdependent capabilities across all layers (ground, air, space) of the net-centric architecture, to forecast and achieve a balance in supply and demand for network capacity, and field net centric capabilities more rapidly as an enabler for C2 capabilities and applications.  Resources are required to transform current networks into an operationally unified and architecturally diverse joint network that will provide end-to-end communications transport layer capabilities that are optimized and integrated with all other joint capability areas with a focus on the tactical edge faced with disconnected, intermittent, and latency (DIL) environments.  There will be technical assessments, modeling and simulation, and analysis of the Joint space communications layer, Joint aerial network layer, and contested communications on the move capabilities.  These funds develop the capability for the warfighter to manage and deconflict radio frequencies through ground, air, and space communication networks.  The funds will be used to develop and synchronize information assurance capabilities with other net centric capabilities to provide secure access to information and services (e.g. Cryptographic Modernization Management plan).  
In addition, funding will continue to be used to support the Defense Information System's Agency's (DISA) and Services' interoperable improvement efforts and processes in the development of common standards and protocols.  This effort includes initiating the Joint Interoperability Enhancement Process (IEP) that allows operators, engineers, and program managers to verify capabilities and identify issues in a design with Joint /Allied units prior to system fielding, or with fielded systems to identify required systems changes for systems upgrade planning.  DISA and the Joint Forces Combatant Command lead the effort to transform the current standards and interoperability management tools to a common set of Joint network-enabled standards to ensure adherence to the Global Information Grid (GIG) enterprise-wide technical baseline and for implementation of future TDES capabilities. These joint standards, protocols, and processes will be used for implementation and testing to ensure the TDES capabilities are synchronized with the development and integration timelines of other planned network-enabled Global Information Grid (GIG) initiatives.  The threats to the networking waveforms and the Joint NC migration will also be looked at in cooperation with the Intelligence agencies.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program element provides systems engineering and technical analysis of the DoD Information Technology (IT) portfolio containing over 600 programs valued at over $180 billion.  The Primary Staff Assistant advises OSD leadership on end to end warfighter communication capabilities to include portfolio management, developmental support responsibilities on numerous programs, synchronization, and interoperability efforts and issues.  Emphasis is placed on the information transport, information assurance, net and spectrum management, command and control (C2), space, and enterprise services activities focused on the development, integration, testing and technical assessment of capabilities and applications in joint and coalition warfighter support environments.  Resources support collaborative efforts to demonstrate the interoperability and performance requirements of acquisition programs.  The PSA develops portfolio-wide guidance and provides technical analysis to enable the warfighter, intelligence, and business communities to meet their respective mission requirements.  This program is funded under Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, and it supports system definition, development, testing, and program analysis of major acquisition programs engineering development and synchronization activities.  

This project provides the resources necessary for the Deputy of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Communication, C2, Space, and Spectrum to implement net centric processes and authoritative analytical methods that provide the capability to synchronize interdependent capabilities across all layers (ground, air, space) of the net-centric architecture, to forecast and achieve a balance in supply and demand for network capacity, and field net centric capabilities more rapidly as an enabler for C2 capabilities and applications.  Resources are required to transform current networks into an operationally unified and architecturally diverse joint network that will provide end-to-end communications transport layer capabilities that are optimized and integrated with all other joint capability areas with a focus on the tactical edge faced with disconnected, intermittent, and latency (DIL) environments.  There will be technical assessments, modeling and simulation, and analysis of the Joint space communications layer, Joint aerial network layer, and contested communications on the move capabilities.  These funds develop the capability for the warfighter to manage and deconflict radio frequencies through ground, air, and space communication networks.  The funds will be used to develop and synchronize information assurance capabilities with other net centric capabilities to provide secure access to information and services (e.g. Cryptographic Modernization Management plan).  

Note that FY 2010/2011 funding disconnect resulted from duplicate cuts to a program titled Horizontal Fusion (HF) formerly part of this PE to support priority net centric transformation.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Performance will be monitored on a monthly basis via Program Reviews, Current Expenditures, Estimated Future Expenditures, and Cost/Schedule Adherence.   Research and Development will provide increased intelligence information sharing capabilities in support of US and coalition forces utilizing the US BICES and NATO virtual networks within the Afghanistan theater and provide increased database information via Distributed Common Ground System - Army (DCGS-A).  Provides an increase in intelligence disciplines (Imagery Intelligence (IMINT), Signal Intelligence (SIGINT), and potential Human Intelligence (HUMINT)) in support of US and Allied/Coalition forces that currently is very limited to the warfighter.  Increased intelligence advanced analytics  tools will be migrated from Joint Intelligence Operations Center (JIOC)-IT and DI2E developments and will significantly increase the timeliness of intelligence and bring US BICES/NATO Special Operations Forces Coordination Center (NSCC)/Intelligence Fusion Center (IFC) capabilities into the current technology baselines.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Assessment  and Analysis -  Can easily be adapted or adjusted to meet the current or projected capabilities gap for Allied or Coalition Intelligence Information Sharing.  
Realism – Allows exploration of new environments and capabilities.
Advancement -  Increases the current capabilities for the sharing of intelligence information and determine if it actually adds functionality in support of Combatant Commanders requirements. 
Utility -  Can be integrated into the existing national or multinational architectures in a timely and cost effective manner and does it increase the discovery and dissemination of intelligence information to the Allies or Coalition forces.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>(U) This project is the U.S. share of the cost for NATO to acquire a ground surveillance capability based on the U.S. Global Hawk Block 40 Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS).
(U)  The North Atlantic Council (NAC) validated the requirement in 1995 for a NATO-owned and operated core air-to-ground surveillance capability supplemented by interoperable national assets.  Since then, the Major NATO Commanders have consistently made Alliance Ground Surveillance (AGS) their number one equipment acquisition priority.
-  October 1997, NATO Conference of National Armaments Directors (CNAD) approved AGS NATO Staff Requirement (NSR)
-  April 1999, NATO Washington Summit Defense Capabilities Initiatives (DCI) included need for a NATO-owned and operated core system for ground surveillance.
-  September 2001, Reinforced NAC (RNAC) re-affirmed need for a NATO-owned and operated AGS capability by 2010 and to move forward with the program.
-  November 2002, NATO Prague Summit approved Prague Capabilities Commitment (PCC) that includes an airborne ground surveillance capability.
-  December 2003, AGS Steering Committee approved, in principle, the merger of NATO AGS and the Trans-Atlantic Cooperative AGS Radar (TCAR) sensor projects.
-  May 2004, Following a competitive Project Definition Study, CNAD endorsed the Trans-Atlantic Industrial Proposed Solution (TIPS) consortium's selection as the program of record to enter the Design and Development Phase and directed that the TCAR sensor development project be integrated into the AGS program.
-  November 2005, Risk Reduction Study (RRS) was completed, providing  the Nations a higher degree of confidence in six areas of concern:  program management; harmonization with other pending NATO aircraft programs; interoperability with existing national systems; compatibility with the NATO intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance architecture; integration of the TCAR sensor; and affordability.
-  April 2006,  CNAD approved release of a Request for Proposal (RFP) to industry for the Design and Development (D&amp;D) phase, including a mixed fleet (manned and unmanned) and development of at least one radar for either, with a total procurement Not to Exceed of €3.3B (Base Year Euros equivalent to $5.4B Then Year dollars).
-  October 2006, AGS Industries (AGSI, former TIPS consortium) formally submitted a proposal compliant with the RFP.  CNAD agreed that the proposal, as submitted by AGSI, would form the basis for negotiations of the D&amp;D contract and tasked the AGS Support Staff (AGS3) to begin negotiations with AGSI.
-  May 2007, Contract negotiations with AGSI were completed.  Total value of the D&amp;D contract was €545M (Then Year Euros equivalent to $763M Then Year dollars) for the system design activity (to be funded by all participating nations) plus €385M (Then Year Euros equivalent to $539M Then Year dollars) for the radar development activity (to be funded by six nations, including the U.S.).  The period of performance was 31 months after award and the contract prices were valid until December 1, 2007.
-  June 2007, The AGS Funding Documents (Program Memorandum of Understanding (PMOU), Design &amp; Development Supplement, and the TCAR Implementing Arrangement (IA)) were released to nations for final staffing, leading to their approval and signature.
-  July 2007, At an Extra-ordinary CSC meeting, Canada, France, Germany, and The Netherlands indicated they could not support the Program of Record due to affordability. The CSC recommended ceasing work on the Program of Record in favor of a UAV only capability based on an Off-The-Shelf Global Hawk (OTS-GH) equipped with the U.S. Multi-Platform Radar Insertion Program (MP-RTIP) sensor.  This capability was previously endorsed by the user, Supreme Headquarters Allied Command Europe (SHAPE).
-  September 2007, CSC directed AGS3 to revise the procurement strategy and update the funding documents and the NATO Management Organization Charter for the re-structured program.
-  June 2008, NATO AGS Programme Memorandum of Understanding released for national staffing.
-  October 2008, Request for Proposal for NATO AGS prime development contract released to industry. 
-  September 3, 2009, PMOU in effect; Charter for NATO AGS Management Organization (NAGSMO) in effect.
-  October 2009 through September 2010 discussions with industry on prime contract scope and deliverables</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>
