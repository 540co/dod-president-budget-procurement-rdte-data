                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Research Sciences Program Element is budgeted in the Basic Research Budget Activity because it provides the technical foundation for long-term National Security enhancement through the discovery of new phenomena and the exploration of the potential of such phenomena for Defense applications.  It supports the scientific study and experimentation that is the basis for more advanced knowledge and understanding in information, electronic, mathematical, computer, biological and materials sciences.

     The Bio/Info/Micro Sciences project will explore and develop potential technological breakthroughs that exist at the intersection of biology, information technology and micro/physical systems to exploit advances and leverage fundamental discoveries for the development of new technologies, techniques and systems of interest to the DoD.  Programs in this project will draw upon information and physical sciences to discover properties of biological systems that cross multiple scales of biological architecture and function, from the molecular and genetic level through cellular, tissue, organ, and whole organism levels. 

     The Math and Computer Sciences project supports long term national security requirements through scientific research and experimentation in new computational models and mechanisms for reasoning and communication in complex, interconnected systems. The project is exploring novel means of leveraging computer capabilities, including: practical, logical, heuristic, and automated reasoning by machines; development of enhanced human-to-computer and computer-to-computer interaction technologies; innovative approaches to the composition of software; innovative computer architectures; mathematical programs and their potential for defense applications; and new learning mechanisms for systematically upgrading and improving these capabilities.

      The Cyber Sciences project supports long term national security requirements through scientific research and experimentation in cybersecurity.  Networked computing systems control virtually everything, from power plants and energy distribution, transportation systems, food and water distribution, financial systems, to defense systems.  Protecting the infrastructure on which these systems rely is a national security issue.   The Cyber Sciences project will ensure DoD cyber-capabilities survive adversary attempts to degrade, disrupt, or deny military computing, communications, and networking systems.  Basic research in cyber security is required to provide a basis for continuing progress in this area. Promising research results will transition to both technology development and system-level projects.

     The Electronic Sciences project explores and demonstrates electronic and optoelectronic devices, circuits and processing concepts that will provide: 1) new technical options for meeting the information gathering, transmission and processing required to maintain near-real time knowledge of the enemy and the ability to communicate decisions based on that knowledge to all forces in near-real time; and 2) provide new means for achieving substantial increases in performance and cost reduction of military systems providing these capabilities.

     The Materials Sciences project provides the fundamental research that underpins the development and assembly of advanced nanoscale and bio-molecular materials, devices, and electronics for DoD applications that greatly enhance soldier awareness, capability, security, and survivability, such as materials with increased strength-to-weight ratio and ultra-low size, devices with ultra-low energy dissipation and power, novel spectroscopic sources, and electronics with persistent intelligence and improved surveillance capabilities.

     The Transformative Sciences project supports research and analysis that leverages converging technological forces and transformational trends in computing and the computing-reliant subareas of the social sciences, life sciences, manufacturing, and commerce.  The project integrates these diverse disciplines to improve military adaptation to sudden changes in requirements, threats, and emerging/converging trends, especially trends that have the potential to disrupt military operations.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>The Quantitative Models of the Brain program will establish a functional mathematical basis on which to build future advances in cognitive neuroscience, computing capability, and signal processing across the DoD.  An important focus of this program will be determining how information is stored and recalled in the brain and other DoD-relevant signals, developing predictive, quantitative models of learning, memory, and measurement.  Using this understanding, the program will develop powerful new symbolic computational capabilities for the DoD in a mathematical system that will provide the ability to understand complex and evolving signals and tasks while decreasing software and hardware requirements and other measurement resources.  This includes a comprehensive mathematical theory to extract and leverage information in signals at multiple acquisition levels, that would fundamentally generalize compressive sensing for multi-dimensional sources beyond domains typically used.  New insights related to signal priors, task priors, and adaptation will enable these advances.  This program will further exploit advances in the understanding and modeling of brain activity and organization to improve training of individuals and teams as well as identify new therapies for cognitive rehabilitation (e.g., TBI, PTSD).  Critical to success will be the ability to detect cellular and network-level changes produced in the brain during the formation of new, hierarchically organized memories and memory classes, and to correlate those changes with memory function of animals during performance of behavioral tasks.</r2:Description>

The Physics in Biology thrust explored the role and impact of quantum effects in biological processes and systems.  This included exploiting manifestly quantum mechanical effects that exist in biological systems at room temperature to develop a revolutionary new class of robust, compact, high sensitivity and high selectivity sensors.  The quantum phenomena uncovered was demonstrated to control the attraction of insects to humans with the potential to significantly reduce insect bites and thus the transmission of parasitic, bacterial or viral pathogens.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Big Mechanism program will create new approaches to automated computational intelligence applicable to diverse domains such as biology, cyber, economics, social science, and intelligence.  Mastering these domains requires the capability to create abstract yet predictive - ideally causal - models from massive volumes of diverse data generated by human actors, physical sensors, and networked devices.  Current modeling approaches are heavily reliant on human insight and expertise, but the complexity of these models is growing exponentially and has now, or will soon, exceed the capacity for human comprehension.  Big Mechanism will create technologies to extract and normalize information for incorporation in flexible knowledge bases readily adapted to novel problem scenarios; powerful reasoning engines that can infer general rules from a collection of observations, apply general rules to specific instances, and generate (and compute the likelihood of) the most plausible explanations for a sequence of events; and knowledge synthesis techniques to derive abstract principles and/or create models of extreme complexity consistent with huge volumes of data.  Big Mechanism applications will accommodate an operator-in-the-loop by accepting questions posed in human natural language; providing drill-down to reveal the basis for an answer; taking user inputs to improve/correct derived associations, weightings, and conclusions; and querying the operator to clarify ambiguities and reconcile detected inconsistencies.  Big Mechanism techniques will integrate burgeoning data into causal models and explore these models for precise interventions in critical areas such as cancer modeling, systems biology, epidemiology, cyber attribution, open-source intelligence, and economic indications and warning.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Title>Unconventional Processing of Signals for Intelligent Data Exploitation (UPSIDE)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The Unconventional Processing of Signals for Intelligent Data Exploitation (UPSIDE) program will address the open problems facing real-time Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) systems and other power-constrained data-intensive applications.  The objective of the UPSIDE program is to create a high-level, non-Boolean computational model and map it directly to the unique functional properties of new emerging devices to achieve significant increases in power efficiency and performance.  The UPSIDE program will create a new generation of computing structures that will, in turn, enable revolutionary advances in ISR processing, particularly for DoD applications of embedded, real-time sensor data analysis.  Boolean data representations are inherently power-inefficient for many datasets, particularly those produced by noisy analog real-time sensors.  The UPSIDE program will establish an unconventional, non-Boolean, computing paradigm to enable new and needed capabilities in the area of sensor data analysis.

UPSIDE intends to implement this new computing paradigm in the form of a specialized hardware component termed the inference module (IM).  An IM is a computational abstraction, which performs a sophisticated pattern match that maps very efficiently to analog complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) circuits and emerging devices.  An IM can leverage the physics of an emerging device to compute a pattern match directly. The IM will be first developed through simulation, and then implemented using mixed-signal CMOS technology, as well as using state of the art emerging (non-CMOS) devices.  Throughout the program, the inference module will be benchmarked using a DoD-relevant image processing pipeline, to verify gains in both computing throughput and power efficiency.  The result will be computing infrastructures and functional implementations that demonstrate three orders of magnitude improvement in processing speed and four orders of magnitude improvement in power efficiency.  These gains will constitute a disruptive new level of embedded computational efficiency for future real-time sensor systems.</r2:Description>

In this approach, developers will use the power of a modern (probabilistic) programming language to quickly build a generative model of the phenomenon of interest as well as queries of interest, which a compiler will convert into an efficient application.  PPAML technologies will be designed for application to a wide range of military domains including ISR exploitation, robotic and autonomous system navigation and control, and medical diagnostics.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>While the DoD has been extremely effective in deploying rigorous analytical and predictive methods for problems involving continuously valued variables (tracking, signals processing), analytical methods for discrete data such as graphs and networks have not kept pace.  Recent evidence has shown that network analysis can provide critical insight when used in DoD-relevant scenarios.  In this paradigm, nodes represent items of interest and their relationships or interactions are edges; the result forms a network or graph.  Current analysis of large networks, however, is just in its infancy:  the composition of real-world networks is understood only at the most coarse and basic details (diameter, degree distribution).  In order to implement network techniques efficiently and usefully, a better understanding of the finer mathematical structure of these networks is needed.  This includes the development of a comprehensive and minimal mathematical set that characterizes networks of DoD interest and a description of how these quantities vary in both space and time.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>*Formerly Human and Computer Symbiosis (HCS)

The Communicating With Computers (CWC) program will advance the state-of-the-art in human-computer interaction by enabling computers to comprehend language, gesture, facial expression and other communicative modalities in context.  Human communication is the process by which an idea in one person's mind becomes an idea in another's.  Human language is inherently ambiguous and so humans depend strongly on perception of the physical world and context to make language comprehensible.  CWC aims to provide computers with analogous capabilities to sense the physical world; encode the physical world in a perceptual structure; link language to this perceptual encoding; and learn the skills of communication.  To accomplish this, CWC will apply and extend research in language, vision, gesture recognition and interpretation, dialog management, cognitive linguistics, and the psychology of visual encoding: these are essential for human communication in the physical world.  CWC will also work to extend the communication techniques developed for physical contexts to nonphysical contexts such as virtual constructs in the cyber domain; program evaluations will include tests of this sort of transfer.  CWC advances will impact military application areas such as robotics and command and control.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Building Resource-Adaptive Software from Specifications (BRASS) program seeks to build an automated framework that permits software systems to seamlessly adapt to changing resource conditions in an evolving operational environment.  Effective adaptation is realized through rigorously defined specifications that capture application resource assumptions and resource guarantees made by the environment. Currently, the processes by which applications adapt to environment change via corrective patches is time-consuming, error-prone, and expensive.  Predicting the myriad of possible environment changes that an application may encounter in its lifetime is problematic, and existing reactive approaches are brittle and often incorrect.  The use of specification-based adaptation will allow BRASS applications to be correctly restructured in real time whenever stated assumptions or guarantees break.  This restructuring is optimized to trade off execution fidelity and functionality for continued operation. BRASS will create tools to automatically discover and monitor resource changes, build new analyses to infer deep resource-based specifications, and implement compiler and runtime transformations that can efficiently adapt to resource changes.  BRASS will expand on research encountered in the Mining and Understanding Software Enclaves program.</r2:Description>

The battlefield of the future will certainly have more data generators and sensors that define the information required to execute appropriately.  With networked sensors, the variety and complexity of the information streams will be even further extended.  This project will explore silicon designs which help alleviate the complexity inherent in next generation systems.  These systems will have increasingly large data sets generated by their own multidomain sensors (such as RF and Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR) payloads) as well as new inputs from external sensors that may or may not have been planned for initially.  With current programming approaches, there are laborious coding requirements which need to account for new data streams. However, the context provided by these data sets is ever changing, and it is imperative for the integrated electronics to adapt to new information without a prolonged programming cycle.  Providing contextual cues for processing of data streams will alleviate the fusion challenges that are currently faced, and which stress networked battlefield systems.  As opposed to the intuition and future-proofing that is required at the programming stage of a current system, the silicon circuit of the future will be able to use contextual cues to adapt accordingly to new information as it is provided.

The fundamental aspects of this program will look at various algorithms to explore the ability to use context to adapt to new information.  This will start with exploration of the ability to automatically recognize information within streams of data, and then to extract context from the dataset.  This will extend to exploiting that context to further refine the processing of an orthogonal data set.  Applied research for the program is budgeted in PE 0602303E, Project IT-02.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Strategic Social Interaction Modules (SSIM) program improved military training to include the social interaction skills and abilities warfighters need for successful engagement with local populations.  In the current and likely future operational environment, it is imperative to develop rapport with local leaders and civilians as their cooperation and consent will be necessary for successful operations.  SSIM emphasized the foundational social skills necessary to achieve cultural understanding in any social setting and the skills necessary for successful interactions across different social groups.  These core skills do not require soldiers to have knowledge of a specific culture prior to contact but emphasizes skills for orienting toward and discovering patterns of meaningful social behavior.  SSIM developed the requisite training technology, including advanced gaming/simulation techniques, that incorporate new methods for practicing social agility in social encounters, as well as how to discover and adapt to unfamiliar culturally-specific conduct, manners, and practices.  SSIM enhanced military effectiveness by enabling close collaborative relationships with local peoples and leaders.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Mathematics of Sensing, Exploitation and Evaluation (MSEE) program sought to create a comprehensive mathematical theory of information processing, strategy formulation and decision determination.  Such a theory  incorporates techniques from diverse mathematical disciplines such as Stochastic Process Theory, Harmonic Analysis, Formal Languages and Theoretical Computer Science to construct a common framework wherein the quantitative value of data acquisition may be assessed relative to dynamically-varying context.  In addition, the structure accommodates the notion that data acquisition and information processing are coupled, requiring some degree of feedback and control, while simultaneously admitting the possibility of different logics, such as those that allow for incomplete and time-varying states of knowledge.  The result of this effort produced advances in fundamental domains of mathematics with the potential to reshape current DoD approaches to managing the battlespace and supervisory controls.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The SafeWare program will develop new code obfuscation techniques for protecting software from reverse engineering.  At present, adversaries can extract sensitive information from stolen software, which can include cryptographic private keys, special inputs/failsafe modes, proprietary algorithms and even the software architecture itself.  Today's state of the art in software obfuscation adds junk code (loops that do nothing, renaming of variables, redundant conditions, etc.) which unfortunately does little more than inconvenience the aggressor.  Recent breakthroughs in theoretical cryptography have the potential to make software obfuscation into a mathematically rigorous science, very much like what the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) algorithm did for the encryption of messages in the 1970's.  The SafeWare program aims to take this very early-stage theory, which in its present form incurs too much runtime overhead to be practical, and re-tool its mathematical foundations such that one day it will be practical and efficient.  As with RSA, SafeWare methods will require the solution of a computationally hard mathematical problem as a necessary condition for a successful de-obfuscation attack.  SafeWare is addressing basic research issues encountered in Safer Warfighter Computing (SAFER) in PE 0602303E, Project IT-03.</r2:Description>

Historically, adversaries have exploited software implementation flaws through buffer and heap overflow attacks.  Advances in operating systems have largely mitigated such attacks, so now cyber adversaries must find new ways of compromising software.  Algorithmic complexity and side channel attacks are emerging as the next generation of attacks since they depend on intrinsic properties of the algorithms themselves rather than flaws in their implementations.  Recent news reports have highlighted the first wave of these attacks (CRIME, BREACH, Hash DoS).  The STAC program seeks to develop new analysis tools and techniques to detect vulnerabilities to these attacks in the software upon which the U.S. government, military, and economy depend. STAC extends work initiated under the Automated Program Analysis for Cybersecurity (APAC) program to address algorithmic complexity and side channel attacks.</r2:Description>

The Transparent Computing program will develop technologies to enable the implementation of more effective security policies across distributed systems.  The scale and complexity of modern information systems obscures linkages between security-related events, the result being that detection of attacks and anomalies must rely on narrow contextual information rather than complete knowledge of the event's provenance.  This shortcoming facilitates attacks such as advanced persistent threats.  The Transparent Computing program will address these problems by creating the capability to propagate security-relevant information and ensure component interactions are consistent with established behavior profiles and policies.  Transparent Computing technologies are particularly important for large integrated systems with diverse components such as distributed surveillance systems, autonomous systems, and enterprise information systems.</r2:Description>

Research areas include new electronic and optoelectronic device and circuit concepts, operation of devices at higher frequency and lower power, extension of diode laser operation to new wavelength ranges relevant to military missions, development of uncooled and novel infrared detector materials for night vision and other sensor applications, development of innovative optical and electronic technologies for interconnecting modules in high performance systems, research to realize field portable electronics with reduced power requirements, and system and component level improvements to provide greater affordability and reliability.  Additionally, electronically controlled microinstruments offer the possibility of nanometer-scale probing, sensing and manipulation for ultra-high density information storage "on-a-chip," for nanometer-scale patterning, and for molecular level analysis and synthesis.  These microinstruments may also offer new approaches to integration, testing, controlling, manipulating and manufacturing nanometer-scale structures, molecules and devices.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>Phased arrays are critical military subsystems with widespread applications in communications, electronic warfare and radar.  The DoD relies heavily on phased arrays to maintain technological superiority in nearly every theater of conflict.  The DoD cannot update these high cost specialized arrays at the pace necessary to effectively counter adversarial threats under development using commercial-of-the-shelf components that can undergo technology refresh far more frequently.  The Arrays at Commercial Timescales (ACT) program will develop adaptive and standardized digital-at-every-element arrays.  New advances in digital circuits at every element in an array panel will allow for ubiquitous phased array technology with heretofore unrealized spectral coverage and capabilities.  This program will take a fundamental look at the role of digital arrays and how commonality and aggregation can be affected by emerging capabilities.  Simultaneously, this effort will focus on the development of arrays which can quickly create different unique RF personalities/capabilities on top of common digital hardware.  The project will demonstrate levels of diversity in the use of the electromagnetic spectrum which are severely limited by the current approach of hand-designing the array with heavily specialized RF beamformers that are unique to each system.  This program also has related applied research efforts funded under PE 0602716E, Project ELT-01.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Semiconductor Technology Advanced Research Network (STARNet) program is a government-industry partnership combining the expertise and resources from select defense, semiconductor, and information companies with those of DARPA to sponsor an external set of academic research teams that are focused on specific technology needs set by experts in industry and government.  Efforts under this program will remove the roadblocks to achieving performance needed for future sensing, communication, computing, and memory applications.  The program involves close collaboration between these experts and the academic base with industry providing 60% of program funding matched by 40% from DARPA.  For both industrial and government participants, leveraging shared research funding for high risk, pre-competitive technology explorations for shared technical hurdles is very attractive.

Research in STARNet is divided into a discovery thrust (ACCEL) and an integration thrust (NEXT) executed by virtual academic centers and focused on combining current or emerging technologies to provide new capabilities.  ACCEL seeks to discover new material systems, devices, and novel computing/sensing architectures.  NEXT involves projects on advanced analog and mixed signal circuitry, complex system design tools, and alternative computing architectures.  As the projects in ACCEL mature, it is expected that they will replace the efforts in NEXT that are based on current standard technologies for integrated circuits.

The STARNet program is unique.  It creates a community where industry and government participate as co-sponsors to guide and learn from a large academic research base (including approximately 41 universities, 170 faculty researchers, 605 students, and more than 111 industry associate personnel), with DoD shaping the goals to have direct impact on important long-range DoD needs.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Title>Direct On-Chip Digital Optical Synthesis (DODOS)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The development of techniques for precise frequency control of RF and microwave radiation in the 1940's revolutionized modern warfare.  Frequency control is the enabling technology for RADAR, satellite and terrestrial communications, and positioning and navigation technology, among many other core DoD capabilities.  By comparison, frequency control at optical frequencies is relatively immature, comparable to the state-of-the-art of microwave control in the 1930's.  The first practical demonstration of optical frequency synthesis, utilizing a self-referenced optical comb, was performed in 1999 and, since that time, the precision and accuracy of optical measurements has improved by four orders of magnitude, including the demonstration of atomic clocks utilizing optical-frequency atomic transitions that far outperform existing technology based on microwave transitions.  To date, however, optical frequency control has been constrained to laboratory experiments due to the large size, relative fragility, and high cost of optical comb-based synthesizers.  Recent developments in self-referenced optical frequency combs in microscale resonators enable the development of a fully-integrated chip-scale optical frequency synthesizer.  Ubiquitous low-cost robust optical frequency synthesis is expected to create a similar disruptive capability in optical technology as microwave frequency synthesis did in the 1940's, enabling high-bandwidth coherent optical communications, coherent synthesized-aperture LiDAR, portable high-accuracy atomic clocks, high-resolution standoff gas/toxin detection, and intrusion detection, among other foreseen applications.

The Direct On-chip Digital Optical Synthesis (DODOS) program will investigate high-performance photonic components for creating a microscale high-accuracy optical frequency synthesizer in a compact robust package, suitable for deployment in a wide variety of mission-critical DoD applications.  Significant challenges in the program include reducing the power threshold and stabilizing microresonator optical combs, developing efficient devices for on-chip second harmonic generation, and characterizing the frequency stability and phase noise of a slave laser locked to the stabilized comb.  Applied research for this program is funded within PE 0602716E, Project ELT-01.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Atomic clock technology provides the high-performance backbone of timing and synchronization for DoD navigation, communications, Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), and Electronic Warfare (EW) systems.  Prior DARPA investment in Chip-Scale Atomic Clock (CSAC) technology has led to recent demonstrations of enhanced DoD capabilities, enabled by the wide availability of atomic-quality timing in portable battery-powered applications.  The Next-Generation Atomic Clock (NGAC) program will develop a next-generation chip-scale atomic clock, with 100X-1000X improvement in key performance parameters, by employing alternative approaches to atomic confinement and interrogation, with particular focus on developing the component technologies necessary to enable low-cost manufacturing and robust deployment in harsh DoD environments.
The NGAC program will develop a Chip-Scale Atomic Clock achieving temperature coefficient of frequency of &lt;10^-15/degrees Celsius and frequency drift &lt; 10^-12/month.  This will enable precise timing on low-CSWaP platforms with extended mission duration.  In order to achieve these performance metrics, novel approaches to atomic confinement and interrogation will be explored and new enabling components will be developed.

                                    <r2:Description>The DoD has an unfilled need for a persistent, event driven sensing capability, where physical, electromagnetic and other sensors can be pre-placed and remain dormant until awoken by an external trigger or stimulus.  State-of-the-art (SOA) sensors use active electronics to monitor the environment for the external trigger.  The power consumed by these electronic circuits limits the sensor lifetime to durations of weeks to months.  The Near Zero Power RF and Sensor Operations (N-ZERO) program will extend the lifetime of remotely deployed sensors from months to years. N-ZERO will develop the underlying technologies and demonstrate the capability to continuously and passively monitor the environment and wake-up an electronic circuit upon detection of a specific signature or trigger. Thereafter, sensor lifetime will be limited only by processing and communications of confirmed events or ultimately by the battery self-discharge.

This program will investigate emerging materials and devices and quantify their impact on system performance.  In particular, a fundamental understanding of the trade space that simultaneously minimizes power consumption, the minimum detectable signal, and the probability of false detection will be explored.  This program also has related applied research efforts funded under PE 0602716E, Project ELT-01.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Approximately 66% of all installed semiconductor wafer capacity is in Asia.  This creates a significant risk as off-shore manufacturing of microelectronic components could introduce various vulnerabilities to DoD systems that utilize these non-U.S. fabricated electronic components.  As the DoD is faced with this globalization reality, it is essential to prevent potential consequences such as reverse engineering, theft of U.S. intellectual property, and non-authorized use of these electronic components in adversary defense systems.
The Electronic Globalization program will examine various approaches for trusting circuits in an untrusted environment.  It will develop the abilities to design circuits with functionality that is benign in an untrusted environment.  Basic Research activity will focus on the characterization of materials and structures which enable the trust of circuitry.  This trust will be provided by the ability to create back end of line processing, or other similar mechanisms, to complete or personalize a circuit after it has been through the majority of the traditional supply chain.

                                    <r2:Description>The goal of the Microscale Plasma Devices (MPD) program is to design, develop, and characterize MPD technologies, circuits, and substrates.  The MPD program will focus on development of fast, small, reliable, high carrier-density, micro-plasma switches capable of operating in extreme conditions, such as high-radiation and high-temperature environments.  Specific focus will be given to methods that provide efficient generation of ions that can perform robust signal processing of radio frequency (RF) through light electromagnetic energy over a range of gas pressures.  Applications for such devices are far reaching, including the construction of complete high-frequency plasma-based circuits, and microsystems with superior resistance to radiation and extreme temperature environments.  It is envisaged that both two- and multi-terminal devices consisting of various architectures will be developed and optimized under the scope of this program.  MPDs will be developed in various circuits and substrates to demonstrate the efficacy of different approaches.  MPD-based microsystems are demonstrated in DoD applications where electronic systems must survive in extreme environments.

The Basic Research part of this effort is focused on fundamental MPD research and will advance scientific knowledge based on the study of several key MPD design parameters.  These parameters include ultra-high pressure and high carrier density regimes.  MPD will focus on expanding the design space for plasma devices enabling revolutionary advances in micro-plasma device performance.  It is expected that MPD will develop innovative concepts and technologies that are clearly disruptive with respect to the current state of the art in terms of switching speed (less than 100 picoseconds), carrier density (exceeding 1E18 per cubic centimeter), and capable of operation and robustness in extreme high-radiation or high-temperature (600degC) environments.  Fundamental scientific knowledge derived from MPD is also expected to drive developments in commercialization of MPD technology developed and funded in PE 0602716E, Project ELT-01.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Title>Micro-coolers for Focal Plane Arrays (MC-FPA)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The Micro-coolers for Focal Plane Arrays (MC-FPA) program will develop low size, weight, power, and cost (SWaP-C) cryogenic coolers for application in high-performance infrared (IR) cameras.  It is well known that the sensitivity of an IR focal-plane array (FPA) is improved by cooling its detectors to cryogenic temperatures.  The disadvantages of state-of-the-art cryo-coolers are their large size, high power and high cost.  On the other hand, thermoelectric (TE) coolers used in low performance IR cameras are relatively small, but are inefficient, and it is difficult to achieve temperatures below 200 Kelvin (K).

To reduce IR camera SWaP-C, innovations in cooler technology are needed.  This program will exploit the Joule-Thomson (J-T) cooling principle, in a silicon-based Micro Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) technology, to develop and demonstrate wafer-scale integrated micro-cryogenic IR FPA coolers with very low SWaP-C.  MEMS microfluidics, piezoelectric MEMS, and complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) electronics will be used to demonstrate an integrated cold head and compressor, all in a semiconductor chip.  This program has related applied research efforts funded under PE 0602716E, Project ELT-01.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Prior DARPA efforts have demonstrated the ability to monolithically integrate a limited set of different semiconductor types to achieve near-ideal "mix-and-match" capability for DoD circuit designers.  Specifically, one such program was the Compound Semiconductor Materials On Silicon (COSMOS) program, in which transistors of Indium Phosphide (InP) could be freely mixed with silicon Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) circuits to obtain the benefits of both technologies (very high speed and very high circuit complexity/density, respectively).  The Diverse &amp; Accessible Heterogeneous Integration (DAHI) program took this capability to the next level, ultimately offering the seamless co-integration of a variety of semiconductor devices (for example, Gallium Nitride, Indium Phosphide, Gallium Arsenide, Antimonide-Based Compound Semiconductors), micro-electromechanical (MEMS) sensors and actuators, photonic devices (e.g., lasers, photo-detectors) and thermal management structures.  This capability revolutionized our ability to build true "systems on a chip" (SoCs) and allowed dramatic size, weight and volume reductions for a wide array of system applications.

The Basic Research part of this program focused on the development of new hetero-integration processes and capabilities that were demonstrated in application-specific circuits and transferred into the manufacturing flow.  This program has applied research efforts funded in PE 0602716E, Project ELT-01, and advanced technology development efforts funded in PE 0603739E, Project MT-15.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Fundamentals of Nanoscale and Emergent Effects and Engineered Devices program seeks to understand and exploit a broad range of physical properties and new physics that emerge as a result of material and/or device structure and organization at nano-scale dimensions and/or at extreme temperature and pressure.  There are a wide variety of material properties that currently exist only at the nanoscale including quantized current-voltage behavior, very low melting points, high specific heats, large surface to volume ratio, high efficiency catalysis, enhanced radiative heat transfer, and correlated electron effects that arise in low dimensional systems.  In addition, extreme high pressure conditions can lead to new material polymorphs or phases with dramatically enhanced physical, mechanical and functional properties.  The focus of this thrust is to further characterize these emergent properties and to identify new synthesis approaches to enable access to these properties in stable, bulk material systems suitable for a wide range of DoD applications.  The insights gained from research performed under this thrust will enable new, more efficient, and powerful material and device architectures that will benefit many DoD applications including controllable photonic devices that operate over multiple wavelengths, ultra-high sensitivity magnetic sensors, high-throughput biochemical sensors for known and unknown (engineered) molecules, advanced armor, ultra-precision air and water purification systems, and advanced armor protection.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Basic Photon Science thrust is examining the fundamental science of photons, and their interactions in integrated devices, from their inherent information-carrying capability (both quantum mechanically and classically), to novel modulation techniques using not only amplitude and phase, but also orbital angular momentum.  The new capabilities driven by this science will impact DoD through novel approaches to communications, signal processing, spectroscopic sensing, and imaging applications.  For example, fully exploiting the computational imaging paradigm and associated emerging technologies will ultimately yield ultra-low size, weight, and power persistent/multi-functional intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance systems that greatly enhance soldier awareness, capability, security, and survivability.  One focus of this thrust is to explore approaches for optical frequency division and harmonic generation for applications such as time distribution from ultrastable optical clocks, ultra-low phase noise microwaves, frequency references, and table-top sources of coherent X-rays, isolated attosecond pulses, and intense neutron sources for medical and non-medical applications.  In addition, this thrust will pursue novel, chip-scale optical frequency comb sources and associated technologies throughout the electromagnetic spectrum for spectroscopic sensing and demonstrate their performance with proof-of-concept studies in targeted applications.  These sources will enable and spawn entirely new fields in simultaneous remote sensing, identification, and quantification of multiple trace materials in spectrally cluttered backgrounds.</r2:Description>

In each of these thrusts, performers focused on demonstrating specific technologies that have significant impact on DoD capabilities.  Technologies included high-performance frequency sources, transistors operating at 100 times lower power than current state-of-the-art, a hand-held biotoxin detector, and attojoule optical switches.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Title>Living Foundries</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The goal of the Living Foundries program is to create a revolutionary, biologically-based manufacturing platform to provide new materials, capabilities, and manufacturing paradigms for the DoD and the Nation.  With its ability to perform complex chemistries, be flexibly programmed through DNA code, scale, adapt to changing environments and self-repair, biology represents one of the most powerful manufacturing platforms known.  However, the DoD's ability to harness this platform is rudimentary.  Living Foundries seeks to develop the foundational technological infrastructure to transform biology into an engineering practice, speeding the biological design-build-test-learn cycle and expanding the complexity of systems that can be engineered.  The program will enable the rapid and scalable development of previously unattainable technologies and products (i.e., those that cannot be accessed using known, synthetic mechanisms) leveraging biology to solve challenges associated with production of new materials (e.g., fluoropolymers, enzymes, lubricants, coatings and materials for harsh environments), novel functions (e.g., self-repairing and self-regenerating systems), biological reporting systems, and therapeutics to facilitate new solutions and enhancements to military needs and capabilities.  Ultimately, Living Foundries aims to provide game-changing manufacturing paradigms for the DoD, enabling distributed, adaptable, on-demand production of critical and high-value materials, devices and capabilities in the field or on base.  Such a capability will decrease the DoD's dependence on tenuous material supply chains that are vulnerable to political change, targeted attack, or environmental accident.

If successful, Living Foundries will do for biology what very-large-scale integration (VLSI) did for the semiconductor device industry: enable the design and engineering of increasingly complex systems to address and enhance military needs and capabilities.  Living Foundries will develop and apply an engineering framework to biology that decouples biological design from fabrication, develops and yields design rules and tools, and manages biological complexity through simplification, abstraction, and standardization of both processes and components.  The result will be rapid design, construction, implementation and testing of complex, higher-order genetic networks with programmable functionality and DoD applicability.  Research thrusts include developing the fundamental tools, capabilities and methodologies to accelerate the biological design-build-test cycle, thereby reducing the extensive cost and time it takes to engineer new systems and expanding the complexity and accuracy of designs that can be built.  Specific tools and capabilities include: interoperable tools for design and modeling; automated, modular and standardized fabrication and genome-scale engineering processes; modular regulatory elements, devices and circuits for hierarchical and scalable engineering; standardized test platforms and chassis; and novel approaches to process measurement, validation, and debugging.  Applied research for this program is budgeted in PE 0602715E, Project MBT-02.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>*Formerly ACE (Advanced Capabilities in Engineering Biology)

The Biological Robustness in Complex Settings (BRICS) program will leverage newly developed technologies for engineering biology towards enabling radical new approaches to solving National Security challenges.  Engineering biology is emerging as a new field focused on developing the tools to harness the powerful synthetic and functional capabilities of biology.  These tools will facilitate design and biological production of new chemicals and materials, sensing capabilities, therapeutics, and numerous other applications.  This rapidly developing technological capability opens the door to new national security applications that have heretofore been out of reach, and offers substantial potential advantages in terms of cost and novel functionality. 
 
Fundamental work in this area will focus on understanding the underlying principles of engineering robust and safe microbes and microbial communities that perform as designed over the long-term.  This program has applied research efforts funded in PE 0602715E, Project MBT-02.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Applying Biological Complexity at Scale will pursue new insights derived from biological complexity and living-system dynamics to develop applications to enhance global-scale stability, transform hostile environments, and ensure human well-being.  Biological systems operate over an enormous range of spatial, physical, and temporal scales and span individual cells to multi-organism systems.  Enhanced understanding of the basic processes associated with biological network interactions and communication will enable novel approaches and technology development to enhance national security, ranging from infectious disease mitigation or prevention, to predicting and leveraging behavior of microbial populations or even distributed human networks.  Key advances expected from this research will include the identification of stable, scalable features and mechanisms of biological networks.  Such information will allow the determination of a bio-system's state and enable the prediction of state, as well as where there are inflection points that can either be exploited, or that must be preserved in order to maintain equilibrium (e.g., microbial community dynamics and their applications).</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Title>Vanishing Programmable Resources (VAPR)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The Vanishing Programmable Resources (VAPR) program will create microelectronic systems capable of physically disappearing (either in whole or in part) in a controlled, triggerable manner.  The program will develop and establish an initial set of materials and components along with integration and manufacturing capabilities to undergird a fundamentally new class of electronics defined by their performance and transience.  These transient electronics ideally should perform in a manner comparable to Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) systems, but with limited device persistence that can be programmed, adjusted in real-time, triggered, and/or sensitive to the deployment environment.  Applications include sensors for conventional indoor/outdoor environments (buildings, transportation, and materiel), environmental monitoring over large areas, and simplified diagnosis, treatment, and health monitoring in the field.  VAPR will explore transience characteristics of electronic devices and materials as well as build out an initial capability to make transient electronics a deployable technology for the DoD and Nation.  The technological capability developed through VAPR will be demonstrated through a final test vehicle of a transient sensor with RF link.

A basis set of transient materials and electronic components with sufficient electronic and transience performance is needed to realize transient electronic systems for environmental sensing and biomedical applications.  Research and development of novel materials for implementing basic transient electronic components (actives and passives), power supply strategies, substrates and encapsulants as well as development of modes and triggers for transience will form the core of fundamental research activities.  Transient components and devices developed in this technical area will form the basis for advanced functional circuit blocks and test systems to be developed in PE 0602716E, Project ELT-01.</r2:Description>

Programs in this project address the Department's identified medical gaps in warfighter care related to blast-induced traumatic brain injury as well as health monitoring and the prevention of the spread of infectious disease.  Efforts will draw upon the information, computational modeling and physical sciences to discover properties of biological systems that cross multiple scales of biological architecture and function, from the molecular and genetic level through cellular, tissue, organ, and whole organism levels.  For traumatic brain injury, this project will establish a fundamental understanding of brain function, short-term memory and the mechanism(s) of injury induced by exposure to blast.  To enable in-theater, continuous analysis and treatment of warfighters, this project will also explore diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, such as the use of bacterial predators as therapeutics against infections caused by antibiotic-resistant pathogens.  Advances in this area may be used as a preventative measure to mitigate widespread disease.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>The Autonomous Diagnostics to Enable Prevention and Therapeutics (ADEPT) program will develop the underlying technologies to rapidly respond to a disease or threat and improve individual readiness and total force health protection by providing capabilities which are currently available only in centralized laboratories in the U.S. to non-tertiary care and individual settings.  ADEPT will develop and exploit synthetic biology for the in vivo creation of nucleic acid circuits that continuously and autonomously sense and respond to changes in physiologic state and for novel methods to target delivery, enhance immunogenicity, or control activity of vaccines, potentially eliminating the time to manufacture a vaccine ex vivo.  ADEPT advancements to control cellular machinery include research to optimize orthogonality and modularity of genetic control elements; identify methods to increase sensitivity and specificity; and demonstrate methods to control cellular machinery in response to changes in physiological status.  ADEPT will develop methodologies for measuring health-specific biomarkers from a collected biospecimen to enable diagnostics at the point-of-need or resource limited clinical facilities (point-of-care), in-garrison or deployed.  Additionally, ADEPT will develop techniques that will enable the rapid establishment of transient immunity through stimulation of the production of components of the immune system to impart effective but temporary protection.  This transient immunity would bridge the time gap between the delivery of a vaccine and the development of a long term protective immune response.  Applied research efforts are budgeted in PE 0602115E, Project BT-01.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Harnessing Biological Systems program will explore fundamental approaches to applying the advantages of nature's building blocks and principles in the design of biological technologies and systems.  Rather than creating biomimetic designs that imitate naturally evolved capabilities this program seeks to transition to a biocentric design approach, developing tools and understanding mechanisms to leverage evolutionary advances from the start.  Key advances expected from this research include identifying the underlying mechanisms by which predatory bacteria prey upon and consume other antibiotic-resistant bacteria that are pathogenic to humans.  This approach represents a significant departure from conventional antibacterial therapies that rely on small molecule antibiotics.  This thrust will also investigate the adaptability of microorganisms as well as the process for microbial community evolution.  Advances in these areas may be applied in a range of biological technologies including the development of novel therapeutics and biocentric sensors.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Analytics and Adaptation of Human Resilience program will explore new methods to maintain and optimize warfighter health in response to environmental insults such as new and emerging infectious diseases.  Projects in this area will apply recent advances in comparative biology, genetic sequencing, omics technologies, and bioinformatics to develop new tools for modulating health to ensure warfighter readiness.  One approach to achieve this goal is identifying the fundamental mechanisms that enable certain species to be tolerant to various environmental insults.  Genomic and physiological analyses of a wide array of resilient animal species may be combined with sophisticated algorithms to identify important patterns of survival.  By analyzing patterns in the underlying variability of host responses for resilient animals, one may formulate a survival blueprint to restore and maintain warfighter homeostasis in response to infection.  This approach is orthogonal to traditional infectious disease research, which primarily relies on reducing the pathogen load through drug intervention.  Projects within this program may enable discovery of novel methods to optimize human health against infectious disease such as multi-drug resistant pathogens.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Human Assisted Neural Devices program developed the scientific foundation for understanding the language of the brain for application to a variety of emerging DoD challenges, including improving performance on the battlefield and returning active duty military to their units after injury.  This required an understanding of neuroscience, significant computational efforts, and new material design and implementation.  Key advances from this research include determining the nature and means through which the brain utilizes sensory inputs to plan and execute behavioral outputs, and discovering the mechanisms and dynamics underlying neural computation and reorganization.  These advances enabled restoration of sensorimotor function through the use of devices programmed to bridge gaps in the injured brain.  Further, modeling of the brain progressed to an unprecedented level with this novel approach.  A key aspect of this effort was to develop non-destructive neuronal imaging and control techniques that are capable of rapid analysis and interpretation of brain tissue alterations at the cellular scale.  Additional research under this effort generated new methodologies to understand the structural and functional relationships between individual neurons through direct, high-resolution, optical imaging of neuron populations of interest as well as the entire brain.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Program Element is budgeted in the applied research budget activity because it focuses on medical related technology, information, processes, materials, systems, and devices encompassing a broad spectrum of DoD challenges.  Bio-warfare defense includes the capability to predict and deflect evolution of natural and engineered emerging pathogen threats, and therapeutics that increase survivability within days of receipt of an unknown pathogen.  Continued understanding of infection biomarkers will lead to development of detection devices that can be self-administered and provide a faster ability to diagnose and prevent widespread infection in-theater.  Other battlefield technologies include a soldier-portable hemostatic wound treatment system, capability to manufacture field-relevant pharmaceuticals in theater, and a rapid after-action review of field events as a diagnostic tool for improving the delivery of medical care and medical personnel protection.  Improved medical imaging will be approached through new physical properties of cellular metabolic activities.  New neural interface technologies will reliably extract information from the nervous system to enable control of the best robotic prosthetic-limb technology.  To allow medical practitioners the capability to visualize and comprehend the complex relationships across patient data in the electronic medical record systems, technologies will be developed to assimilate and analyze large amounts of data and provide tools to make better-informed decisions for patient care.  In the area of medical training, new simulation-based tools will rapidly teach increased competency in an open and scalable architecture to be used by all levels of medical personnel for basic and advanced training.  Advanced information-based techniques will be developed to supplement warfighter healthcare and the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI).  This project will also pursue applied research efforts for dialysis-like therapeutics. FY 2015 Biomedical Technology program funding includes 114.8 million of base funding and 45.0 million of Ebola emergency funding.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>This program will speed the development of Ebola antibodies, vaccines, and diagnostics to enable a more rapid response to this outbreak and increase preparedness for response to future epidemics. Planned research builds on earlier investments by DARPA exploring technologies to discover, optimize, and deliver antibodies as a means to provide fast-acting protection against infectious diseases. A key component of this program is not only identifying effective antibodies to treat and prevent disease, but also defining and developing the antibody gene blueprint for transfer and production of vaccines. The Ebola Response and Preparedness Congressional Add is non-OCO emergency funding.

                                    <r2:Description>The overarching goal of the Autonomous Diagnostics to Enable Prevention and Therapeutics (ADEPT) program is to increase our ability to rapidly respond to a disease or threat and improve individual readiness and total force health protection by providing centralized laboratory capabilities at non-tertiary care settings.  ADEPT will focus on the development of Ribonucleic Acid (RNA)-based vaccines, potentially eliminating the time and labor required for traditional manufacture of a vaccine while at the same time improving efficacy.  Additionally, ADEPT will develop methods to transiently deliver nucleic acids for vaccines and therapeutics, and kinetically control the timing and levels of gene expression so that these drugs will be safe and effective for use in healthy subjects.  ADEPT will also focus on advanced development of key elements for simple-to-operate diagnostic devices.  A companion basic research effort is budgeted in PE 0601117E, Project MED-01.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Sepsis, a bacterial infection of the blood stream, is a significant cause of injury and death among combat-injured soldiers.  The goal of this program is to develop a portable device capable of controlling relevant components in the blood volume on clinically relevant time scales.  Reaching this goal is expected to require significant advances in sensing in complex biologic fluids, complex fluid manipulation, separation of components from these fluids, and mathematical descriptions capable of providing predictive control over the closed loop process.  The envisioned device would save the lives of thousands of military patients each year by effectively treating sepsis and associated complications.  Additionally, the device may be effective as a medical countermeasure against various chemical and biological (chem-bio) threat agents, such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, and toxins.

Applied research under this program further develops and applies existing component technologies and then integrates these to create a complete blood purification system for use in the treatment of sepsis.  Included in this effort will be development, integration and demonstration of non-fouling, continuous sensors for complex biological fluids; implementation of high-flow microfluidic structures that do not require the use of anticoagulation; application of intrinsic separation technologies that do not require pathogen specific molecular labels or binding chemistries; and refinement of predictive modeling and control (mathematical formalism) with sufficient fidelity to enable agile adaptive closed-loop therapy.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Musculoskeletal injury and fatigue to the warfighter caused by dynamic events on the battlefield not only impact immediate mission readiness, but also can have a deleterious effect on the warfighter throughout his/her life.  The Warrior Web program will mitigate that impact by developing an adaptive, quasi-active, joint support sub-system that can be integrated into current soldier systems.  Because this sub-system will be compliant and transparent to the user, it will reduce the injuries sustained by warfighters while allowing them to maintain performance.  Success in this program will require the integration of component technologies in areas such as regenerative kinetic energy harvesting to offset power/energy demands; human performance, system, and component modeling; novel materials and dynamic stiffness; actuation; controls and human interface; and power distribution/energy storage.  The final system is planned to weigh no more than 9kg and require no more than 100W of external power.  Allowing the warfighter to perform missions with reduced risk of injuries will have immediate effects on mission readiness, soldier survivability, mission performance, and the long-term health of our veterans.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Restoration of Brain Function Following Trauma program will exploit recent advances in the understanding and modeling of brain activity and organization to develop approaches to treat traumatic brain injury (TBI).  Critical to success will be the ability to detect and quantify functional and/or structural changes that occur in the human brain during the formation of distinct new memories, and to correlate those changes with subsequent recall of those memories during performance of behavioral tasks.  This program will also develop neural interface hardware for monitoring and modulating neural activity responsible for successful memory formation in a human clinical population.  The ultimate goal is identification of efficacious therapeutics or other therapies that can bypass and/or recover the neural functions underlying memory, which are often disrupted as a consequence of TBI.  This program is leveraging research conducted under the Human Assisted Neural Devices effort in Program Element 0601117E, Project MED-01.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Building upon technologies developed under the Military Medical Imaging program budgeted in this project, the Neuro-Adaptive Technology program will explore and develop advanced technologies for real-time detection and monitoring of neural activity.  One shortcoming of today's brain functional mapping technologies is the inability to obtain real-time correlation data that links neural function to human activity and behavior.  Understanding the structure-function relationship as well as the underlying mechanisms that link brain and behavior is a critical step in providing real-time, closed-loop therapies for military personnel suffering from a variety of brain disorders.  Efforts under this program will specifically examine the networks of neurons involved in Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), depression, and anxiety as well as determine how to best ameliorate these disorders.  The objective for this program is to develop new hardware and modeling tools to better discriminate the relationship between human behavioral expression and neural function and to provide relief through novel devices.  These tools will allow for an improved understanding of how the brain regulates behavior and will enable new, disorder-specific, dynamic neuro-therapies for treating neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders in military personnel.  Technologies of interest under this thrust include devices for real-time detection of brain activity during operational tasks, time synchronized acquisition of brain activity and behavior, and statistical models that correlate neural activity with human behavioral expression.</r2:Description>

Device technology has advanced to the point where human beings can be instrumented with and connected to a broad range of unobtrusive, always-on physiological, cognitive, and contextual sensors and information systems.  At the same time, body-area networks, wearable displays, haptics, and other novel forms of human-computer interfaces have advanced enough that convenient real-time multifactor analysis for neurofeedback and biofeedback are within reach.  The Performance Optimization in Complex Environments program will focus on developing the necessary models, analytical tools, interfaces, and input-output modalities necessary to integrate these two advancing areas to enable optimal performance in a wide variety of activities from learning and training to specialized tasking, and to mitigate the effects of age, mental impairment, and physical injury, among others.  Research will also focus on understanding various forms of sensing and actuation to improve outcomes and how biofeedback over time can alter human physiology.

                                    <r2:Description>The Tactical Biomedical Technologies thrust will develop new approaches to deliver life-saving medical care on the battlefield.  Uncontrolled blood loss is the leading cause of preventable death for soldiers on the battlefield.  While immediate control of hemorrhage is the most effective strategy for treating combat casualties and saving lives, currently no method, other than surgical intervention, can effectively treat intracavitary bleeding.  A focus in this thrust is the co-development of a materials-based agent(s) and delivery mechanism capable of hemostasis and wound control for non-compressible hemorrhage in the abdominal space, regardless of wound geometry or location within that space.  This thrust will also investigate non-invasive techniques and equipment to use laser energy to treat intracranial hemorrhage through the skull and tissues in a pre-surgical environment.  Finally, in order to address logistical delays associated with delivering necessary therapeutics to the battlefield, this thrust will also develop a pharmacy on demand that will provide a rapid response capability to enable far-forward medical providers the ability to manufacture and produce small molecule drugs and biologics.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Military Medical Imaging thrust developed medical imaging capabilities to support military missions and operations.  The emergence of advanced medical imaging includes newly recognized physical properties of biological tissue, metabolic pathways, or physiological function in order to produce an image of diagnostic utility and performance.  The goal of this thrust was to develop new, portable spectroscopic techniques that can provide information for military medical use (e.g., analysis of traumatic brain injury) that is superior to that provided by an MRI.  This need is ever increasing as researchers and scientists seek to better understand anatomical, functional, and cellular-level interactions.  Finally, this thrust allowed safe, non-invasive to minimally invasive detection of microscopic and functional alterations within tissues and organs of a living organism at early stages of injury.  The advanced development of these tools has provided a formidable arsenal of diagnostic tools for warfighter performance and care.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The goal of this thrust was to radically improve the state of the art for upper limb prosthetics, moving them from crude devices with minimal capabilities to fully integrated and functional limb replacements.  Current prosthetic technology generally provides only gross motor functions, with very crude approaches to control.  This makes it difficult for wounded soldiers to re-acquire full functionality and return to military service if so desired.  The advances required to provide fully functional limb replacements were achieved by an aggressive, milestone-driven program combining the talents of scientists from diverse areas including: medicine, neuroscience, orthopedics, engineering, materials science, control and information theory, mathematics, power, manufacturing, rehabilitation, psychology, and training.  The results of this program radically improved the ability of combat amputees to return to normal function.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Information and Communications Technology program element is budgeted in the applied research budget activity because it is directed toward the application of advanced, innovative computing systems and communications technologies.  

     The High Productivity, High-Performance Responsive Architectures project is developing the necessary computing hardware and the associated software technology base required to support future critical national security needs for computationally-intensive and data-intensive applications.  These technologies will lead to new multi-generation product lines of commercially viable, sustainable computing systems for a broad spectrum of scientific and engineering applications; it will include supercomputer, embedded computing systems, and novel design tools for manufacturing of defense systems.

     The Information Assurance and Survivability project is developing the core computing and networking technologies required to protect DoD's information, information infrastructure, and mission-critical information systems.  The technologies will provide cost-effective security and survivability solutions that enable DoD information systems to operate correctly and continuously even under attack.  

     The Language Technology project will develop human language technologies to provide critical capabilities for a wide range of national security needs ranging from knowledge management to low-resource language understanding.  This project develops technologies to automatically translate, collate, filter, synthesize, summarize, and present relevant information in timely and relevant forms.  The Language Technology project is addressing these diverse requirements by developing core language processing technologies and integrating these technologies into operational prototypes suitable for use in the field.

     The Cyber Technology project develops technology to increase the security of military information systems and the effectiveness of cyber operations.  Over the past decade the DoD has embraced net-centric warfare by integrating people, platforms, weapons, sensors, and decision aids.  Adversaries seek to limit this force multiplier through cyber attacks intended to degrade, disrupt, or deny military computing, communications, and networking systems.  Technologies developed under the Cyber Technology project will ensure DoD net-centric capabilities survive adversary cyber attacks and will enable new cyber-warfighting capabilities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The warfighting problem this program will solve is the inability to process future real time data streams within real-world embedded system power constraints.  This is a challenge for embedded applications, from Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) systems on unmanned air vehicles through combat and control systems on submarines.  The PERFECT program will overcome processing power efficiency limitations by developing approaches including near threshold voltage operation, massive and heterogeneous processing concurrency, new architecture concepts, and hardware and software approaches to address system resiliency, combined with software approaches to effectively utilize resulting system concurrency and data placement to provide the required embedded system processing power efficiency.</r2:Description>

The battlefield of the future will have more data generators and sensors to provide information required for successful combat operations.  With networked sensors, the variety and complexity of the information streams will be even further extended.  In this project, we will develop silicon designs which help alleviate the complexity inherent in next generation systems.  These systems will have increasingly large data sets generated by their own multidomain sensors (such as RF and Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR) payloads) as well as potentially new inputs from external sensors.  With current programming approaches, there are laborious coding requirements needed to accommodate new data streams.  Additionally, the context provided by these data sets is ever changing, and it is imperative for the integrated electronics to adapt to new information without a prolonged programming cycle.  Providing contextual cues for processing of data streams will alleviate the fusion challenges that are currently faced, and which stress networked battlefield systems.  As opposed to the intuition and future-proofing that is required at the programming stage of a current system, the silicon circuit of the future will be able to use contextual cues to adapt accordingly to new information as it is provided.

The applied research aspects of this program will look at the circuit design which can exploit the algorithms showing benefit for complexity management.  This will entail various sparse versus dense data manipulations with hardware implementations catered to both types of data.  The program will show hardware implementations that gracefully handle multiple data streams and limit the programming burden for a complex scenario.  Basic research for the program is budgeted in PE 0601101E, Project CCS-02.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Graph analytics on large data sets is currently performed on leadership-class supercomputers that are designed for other purposes.  These machines are required because they have the memory capacity required for large graph problems, but the demand on the processors is low, resulting in extremely low compute efficiency.  Computationally, graph analysis is characterized by many short, random accesses to memory which is inefficient on current systems that are optimized for regular, predictable access.  The SONNET program will build a silicon photonics-based graph processor that will perform graph analysis on Terabytes (TBs) of data with performance comparable to peta-scale supercomputers in a significantly smaller size, weight, and power (SWAP) envelope.  SONNET will optimize the design of the graph processor by co-designing processor and photonic hardware, and the computer and network architectures to exploit the high bandwidth provided by silicon photonics.  SONNET will demonstrate a scalable, power efficient prototype of such a graph processor and quantify performance for DoD-relevant applications.  The performance, efficiency, and size will be transformational for big data analytics and enable real-time analysis on dynamic graphs in the fields of cyber security, threat detection, and numerous others.  This program will explore the efficient processing of local information using stacked memory and integrated circuits specially made for specific tasks, as well as the efficient transfer of data between local information processors.  

The SONNET program will optimize the design of a graph processor and design and demonstrate high performance processor cores to accelerate graph primitives and photonic hardware required for high bandwidth, low diameter photonic networks.  The program will design and evaluate a Graph processor capable of analyzing large data sets relevant to future DoD requirements.  This program has advanced technology development efforts funded in PE 0603760E, CCC-02.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Approximately 66% of all installed semiconductor wafer capacity is in Asia.  This creates a significant risk for the DoD as off-shore manufacturing of microelectronic components could introduce various vulnerabilities to DoD systems that utilize these non-U.S. fabricated electronic components.  As the DoD is faced with this globalization reality, it is essential to prevent potential consequences such as reverse engineering, theft of U.S. intellectual property, and non-authorized use of these electronic components in adversary defense systems.

New applied research technology enablement will be developed in the Electronics Globalization program to provide the desired responses such as special chip packaging, on-board infrastructures, process modifications, and the use of Supply Chain Hardware Intercepts for Electronics Defense (SHIELD)-monitor dielet.  Applied research will focus on the engineering of unique devices and circuit technologies. Concepts and design flows which enable trust in an untrusted environment will be developed and applied.

                                    <r2:Description>Instant Foundry Adaptive Through Bits (iFAB), provided the groundwork for the development of a foundry-style manufacturing capability--taking as input a verified system design--capable of rapid reconfiguration to accommodate a wide range of design variability and specifically targeted at the fabrication of military ground vehicles.  The iFAB vision was to move away from wrapping a capital-intensive manufacturing facility around a single defense product, and toward the creation of a flexible, programmable, potentially distributed production capability able to accommodate a wide range of systems and system variants with extremely rapid reconfiguration timescales.  The specific goals of the iFAB program were to rapidly design and configure manufacturing capabilities to support the fabrication of a wide array of infantry fighting vehicle models and variants.

Once a given design was developed and verified, iFAB took the formal design representation and automatically configured a digitally-programmable manufacturing facility, including the selection of participating manufacturing facilities and equipment, the sequencing of the product flow and production steps, and the generation of computer-numerically-controlled (CNC) machine instruction sets as well as human instructions and training modules.  iFAB was mostly an information architecture.  Only the final assembly capability needed to be co-located under a single roof in anything resembling a conventional fabrication facility; the rest of iFAB could be geographically distributed and can extend across corporate and industrial boundaries, united only by a common model architecture and certain rules of behavior and business practices.  The final assembly node of the iFAB Foundry was the Joint Manufacturing and Technology Center (JMTC) at the Rock Island Arsenal (RIA).</r2:Description>

Such a "fab-less" design approach was complemented by a foundry-style manufacturing capability, consisting of a factory capable of rapid reconfiguration between a large number of products and product variants through bitstream re-programmability, with minimal or no resultant learning curve effects. Together, the fab-less design and foundry-style manufacturing capability was anticipated to yield substantial---by a factor of five ---compression in the time to develop and field complex defense and aerospace systems.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The High Assurance Cyber Military Systems program will develop and demonstrate technologies to secure mission-critical embedded computing systems.  The DoD is making increasing use of networked computing in systems such as military vehicles, weapon systems, ground sensors, smartphones, personal digital assistants, and other communication devices.  This dependence makes it critically important that the embedded operating system provides high levels of inherent assurance.  This operating system must also integrate the computational, physical, and networking elements of the system while running on a processor with very limited size, weight, and power.  Consequently, it can only devote a limited share of its computational resources to security while satisfying hard real-time constraints.  Recent advances in program synthesis, formal verification techniques, low-level and domain-specific programming languages, and operating systems mean that fully verified operating systems for embedded devices may be within reach at reasonable costs.  The program will develop, mature, and integrate these technologies to produce an embedded computing platform that provides a high level of assurance for mission-critical military applications.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Title>Supply Chain Hardware Intercepts for Electronics Defense (SHIELD)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>Counterfeit electronic parts are becoming ubiquitous, and pose a threat to the integrity and reliability of DoD systems. Detection of counterfeit components by current means is expensive, time-consuming, and of limited effectiveness. Maintaining complete control of the supply chain using administrative controls incurs substantial costs and has limitations. Current methods of detection involve a wide variety of techniques ranging from functional testing to physical inspections which may still miss certain classes of counterfeits.  There have also been attempts by the semiconductor market to protect electronic components through the use of technology embedded in the component or its packaging.  However, most methods are specific to a manufacturer's component and as such address only those issues deemed critical to that manufacturer. Some methods can be circumvented, or require slow, expensive, off-site forensic analysis to verify authenticity.

The Supply Chain Hardware Intercepts for Electronics Defense (SHIELD) program, leveraging and expanding on previous activities in the IRIS program, will develop a technology capable of confirming, at any time, the authenticity of once-trusted parts, even after they have transited a complex global supply chain.  SHIELD will prevent counterfeit component substitution by incorporating a small, inexpensive additional silicon chip ("dielet") within the Integrated Circuit (IC) package. The dielet will provide a unique and encrypted ID as well as anti-tamper features.  The microscopic-size dielet embedded in the electronic component packaging will be inductively powered and scanned by an authentication induction coil brought into very close proximity to the packaged chip, thus allowing for verification of chip identity.</r2:Description>

Through these active engagements, DoD cyber defenders will be able to more readily disrupt, counter, and neutralize adversary cyber tradecraft in real time.  Moreover, ACD-facilitated operations should cause adversaries to be more cautious and increase their work factor by limiting success from their efforts.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Mission-oriented Resilient Clouds (MRC) program will create technologies to enable cloud computing systems to survive and operate through cyber attacks.  Vulnerabilities found in current standalone and networked systems can be amplified in cloud computing environments.  MRC will address this risk by creating advanced network protocols and new approaches to computing in potentially compromised distributed environments.  Particular attention will be focused on adapting defenses and allocating resources dynamically in response to attacks and compromises.  MRC will create new approaches to measuring trust, reaching consensus in compromised environments, and allocating resources in response to current threats and computational requirements.  MRC will develop new verification and control techniques for networks embedded in clouds that must function reliably in complex adversarial environments.</r2:Description>

The Edge-Directed Cyber Technologies for Reliable Mission Communication (EdgeCT) program will enable reliable communications for military forces that operate in disrupted/disadvantaged, intermittent, high-latency environments.  The program will create algorithms and software prototypes for use exclusively at the network edge, specifically, on end hosts and/or on proxy servers (middleboxes) fronting groups of such end hosts within a user enclave.  EdgeCT systems will sense and respond rapidly to network failures and attacks by dynamically adapting protocols utilized to exchange packets among these hosts, thereby implementing work-arounds (fight-through strategies) that restore networked communication.  This will enable highly reliable networked communication for the military in the face of a wide variety of common network failure modes as well as cyber attacks against network infrastructure.  EdgeCT technologies will be developed in collaboration with and transitioned to operational commands.</r2:Description>

Current approaches to handling cyber-induced faults in mission-critical systems are inadequate, as perimeter defenses wrapped around vulnerable monocultures do not scale, while zero-day exploits evade signature-based defenses.  The proliferation of processing cores in multi-core central processing units provides the opportunity to adapt fault-tolerant architectures proven in aerospace applications to mission-critical, embedded, and real-time computing systems.  The CFAR program will combine techniques for detecting differences across functionally replicated systems with novel variants that guarantee differences in behavior under attack.  The resulting CFAR-enabled computing systems will quickly detect deviations in processing elements at attack onset and rapidly reboot to restore affected services.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Adaptable Information Access and Control (AIAC) program will create the capability to dynamically, flexibly, and securely share highly selective information across enterprise boundaries.  In the civilian sphere, there is a recognized need for technologies that limit the sharing of information between commercial entities and U.S. government agencies to the greatest extent possible consistent with national security requirements.  Similarly, the U.S. military is increasingly involved in humanitarian operations that require highly selective sharing of data with a heterogeneous mix of allies, coalition partners, and other stakeholders.  AIAC will create confidentiality, privacy, multi-level security, discretionary access control, and policy engine technologies to allow tailored access to specific data and analytic results but not an entire database/file system/corpus.  AIAC is timely due to recent progress on cryptographic techniques such as homomorphic encryption, secure multiparty computation, and differential privacy.  Additional technologies that will be developed and incorporated include automated policy-driven releasability assessment and redaction, tactical obfuscation, and time-limited-access controls. The program will address the diverse and stringent legal and ethical requirements related to security, privacy, authentication, authorization, auditing, monitoring, access, and control encountered in both civilian and military environments.  To facilitate deployment, AIAC technologies will be designed to work with the virtualization, cloud computing, and software-defined networking technologies now widely used in both civilian and military environments.</r2:Description>

The Protecting Cyber Physical Infrastructure (PCPI) program will create new technologies for ensuring the availability and integrity of critical U.S. cyber-physical infrastructure.  The near-ubiquitous use of computers to monitor and control U.S. civilian and military critical infrastructure and the dependence of our society on electric power, clean water, waste processing, petroleum refining, chemical production, and other utilities/industries make this a national security issue.  PCPI will develop technologies to monitor heterogeneous distributed control system networks, detect anomalies that require rapid assessment, and mitigate sensor spoofing and denial of service attacks.  Hardware-in-the-loop simulation techniques will be developed to enable the discovery of emergent vulnerabilities and the development and optimization of mitigation strategies.  This will include understanding the potential role of electric power markets in propagating or damping power grid anomalies.

CGC technology will monitor defended software and networks during operations, reason about flawed software, formulate effective defenses, and deploy defenses automatically.  Technologies to be developed and integrated may include anomaly detection, Monte Carlo input generation, case-based reasoning, heuristics, game theory, and stochastic optimization.  The CGC capability is needed because highly-scripted, distributed cyber attacks exhibit speed, complexity, and scale that exceed the capability of human cyber defenders to respond in a timely manner.  DARPA will incentivize competition through a Grand Challenge in which CGC technologies compete head-to-head.  Principal funding for this effort is provided in Project IT-05. Additional funding is being provided in IT-03 to enable the creation of the more robust competition infrastructure necessary to accommodate the large number of competitors.</r2:Description>

Higher level organisms have two distinct immune systems: the innate system is fast and deadly but is only effective against a fixed set of pathogens; the adaptive system is slower, but can learn to recognize novel pathogens.  Similarly, CRASH will develop mechanisms at the hardware and operating system level that eliminate known vulnerabilities exploited by attackers.  However, because novel attacks will be developed, CRASH will also develop software techniques that allow a computer system to defend itself, to maintain its capabilities, and even heal itself.  Finally, biological systems show that diversity is an effective population defense; CRASH will develop techniques that make each computer system appear unique to the attacker and allow each system to change over time.</r2:Description>

SAFER creates automated processes and technologies to enable military users to send and receive content on the Internet, utilizing commercially available hardware and software, in ways that avoid efforts to deny, locate, or corrupt communications.  SAFER is also developing technology for performing computations on encrypted data without decrypting it first through fully homomorphic encryption and interactive, secure multi-party computation schemes.  This will enable, for example, the capability to encrypt queries and compute an encrypted search result without decrypting the query.  This technology will advance the capability to run programs on untrusted hardware while keeping programs, data, and results encrypted and confidential.

                                    <r2:Title>Integrity and Reliability of Integrated CircuitS (IRIS)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>Integrated circuits (ICs) are core components of most electronic systems developed for the Department of Defense.  However, the DoD consumes a very small percentage of the total IC production in the world.  As a result of the globalization of the IC marketplace, much of the advanced IC production has moved to offshore foundries, and these parts make up the majority of ICs used in today's military systems.
Without the ability to influence and regulate the off-shore fabrication of ICs, there is a risk that parts acquired for DoD systems may not meet stated specifications for performance and reliability.  This risk increases considerably with the proliferation of counterfeit ICs in the marketplace, as well as the potential for the introduction of malicious circuits into a design.

The Integrity and Reliability of Integrated CircuitS (IRIS) program developed techniques that will provide electronic system developers the ability to validate the function of digital, analog and mixed-signal ICs non-destructively, given limited data about the chip's detailed design  specifications.  These techniques included advanced imaging for identification of functional elements in deep sub-micrometer Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) circuits, as well as computational methods to deal with the extremely difficult problem of determining device connectivity.

Finally, the IRIS program developed innovative methods to determine the reliability of an IC by testing a limited number of samples.  The current understanding of IC aging mechanisms, including negative bias temperature instability (NBTI), hot carrier injection (HCI), time-dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) and electromigration (EM) was leveraged to develop unique diagnostic test techniques.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Language Technology project will develop human language technologies to provide critical capabilities for a wide range of national security needs ranging from knowledge management to low-resource language understanding.  Foreign-language news broadcasts, web-posted content, and foreign-language hard-copy documents could provide insights regarding regional and local events, attitudes and activities, if there was a system that could automatically process large volumes of speech and text in multiple languages obtained through a variety of means.  The project develops technologies to automatically translate, collate, filter, synthesize, summarize, and present relevant information in timely and relevant forms.  In addition, current U.S. military operations often require warfighters on the ground to understand speech and text in foreign languages for which there may be no available linguists.  The Language Technology project is addressing these diverse requirements by developing core language processing technologies and integrating these technologies into operational prototypes suitable for use in the field.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>The Deep Exploration and Filtering of Text (DEFT) program will enable automated extraction, processing, and inference of information from text in operationally relevant application domains.  A key DEFT emphasis is to determine explicit and implicit meaning in text through probabilistic inference, anomaly detection, and other techniques.  To accomplish this, DEFT will develop and apply formal representations for basic facts, spatial, temporal, and associative relationships, causal and process knowledge, textually entailed information, and derived relationships and correlated actions/events.  DEFT inputs may be in English or in a foreign language and sources may be completely free-text or semi-structured reports, messages, documents, or databases.  DEFT will extract knowledge at scale for open source intelligence and threat analysis.  Planned transition partners include the intelligence community and operational commands.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>*Formerly Foreign Language Rapid Response (FLRR)

The Low Resource Languages for Emergent Incidents (LORELEI) program will develop the capability to rapidly construct machine translation and other human language technologies for low-resource foreign languages.  The United States military operates globally and frequently encounters low-resource languages, i.e., languages for which few linguists are available and no automated human language technology capability exists.  Historically, exploiting foreign language materials required protracted effort, and as a result systems exist only for languages in widespread use and in high demand.  The goal of the LORELEI program is to dramatically advance the state of computational linguistics and human language technology to enable rapid, low-cost development of language processing capabilities for low-resource languages.  To achieve this LORELEI will eliminate reliance on huge, manually-translated, manually-transcribed, or manually-annotated corpora and instead will leverage language-universal resources, project from related-language resources, and fully exploit a broad range of language-specific resources. These capabilities will be exercised to provide situational awareness based on information from any language, in support of emergent missions such as humanitarian assistance/disaster relief, terrorist attack response, peacekeeping, and infectious disease response.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Broad Operational Language Translation (BOLT) program enabled language processing of informal and dialectal genres.  Historically, foreign language translation technology was geared toward formal content, like broadcast media and newswire, but did not address informal or dialectal genres.  BOLT developed new approaches to automated language translation, human-machine multimodal dialogue, and language generation and applied these to informal genres such as online discussion groups, messaging, and telephone conversation.  While Chinese and dialectal Arabic were the two languages addressed directly in BOLT, techniques developed for these two languages have wide applicability to other languages and dialects.</r2:Description>

-  Used methods developed for Egyptian dialectal Arabic to create databases, tools, and algorithms for additional Arabic dialects.
-  Developed dialogue management techniques such as computer-moderated turn-taking to avoid divergence as an approach for improving the performance of bi-directional Arabic-English dialogue systems.
-  Completed the annotated corpora of Arabic and Chinese informal genre data by adding new dialects and enhanced their utility by incorporating additional annotations.
-  Formalized government purpose rights and transitioned software for translating informal genres of Arabic and Chinese to a Combatant Command and the Intelligence Community.</r2:Text>

This technology is crucial to the warfighter, as documents such as notebooks, letters, ledgers, annotated maps, newspapers, newsletters, leaflets, pictures of graffiti, and document images captured in the field may contain extremely important time-sensitive information.  The MADCAT program addressed this need by producing devices to convert such captured documents from Arabic into readable English in the field.  MADCAT substantially improved applicable technologies, in particular document analysis and optical character recognition/optical handwriting recognition.  MADCAT integrated these improved technologies with translation technology and created prototypes for field trials.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Cyber Technology project develops technology to increase the security of military information systems and the effectiveness of cyber operations.  Over the past decade the DoD has embraced net-centric warfare by integrating people, platforms, weapons, sensors, and decision aids.  Adversaries seek to limit this force multiplier through cyber attacks intended to degrade, disrupt, or deny military computing, communications, and networking systems.  Technologies developed under the Cyber Technology project will ensure DoD net-centric capabilities survive adversary cyber attacks and will enable new cyber-warfighting capabilities.  Promising technologies will transition to system-level projects.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>The Cyber Grand Challenge (CGC) program will create automated defenses that can identify and respond to cyber attacks more rapidly than human operators.  CGC technology will monitor defended software and networks during operations, reason about flawed software, formulate effective defenses, and deploy defenses automatically.  Technologies to be developed and integrated may include anomaly detection, Monte Carlo input generation, case-based reasoning, heuristics, game theory, and stochastic optimization.  The CGC capability is needed because highly-scripted, distributed cyber attacks exhibit speed, complexity, and scale that exceed the capability of human cyber defenders to respond in a timely manner.  DARPA will incentivize competition through a Grand Challenge in which CGC technologies compete head-to-head.  Additional funding for this effort is provided in Project IT-03.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Cognitive Computing Systems program element was budgeted in the Applied Research budget activity because it developed the next revolution in computing and information processing technology that enabled computational systems to have reasoning and learning capabilities and levels of autonomy far beyond those of today's systems.  The ability to reason, learn and adapt raised computing to new levels of capability and powerful new applications. 

The Cognitive Computing project developed core technologies that enabled computing and autonomy systems to learn and apply knowledge gained through experience.  These technologies led to systems with increased self-reliance and the capacity to operate with reduced programmer and operator intervention.  In resource-limited settings, these capabilities made the difference between mission success and mission degradation or failure, increased safety by allowing warfighters to operate systems from greater standoff distances, and reduced staffing requirements by providing greater autonomy.

The Collective Cognitive Systems and Interfaces project dramatically improved warfighter and commander effectiveness and productivity using advanced cognitive approaches that enabled faster, better informed, and more highly coordinated actions than those of our enemies.  This was accomplished by developing revolutionary methods that increased our information processing capabilities, enhanced our situational awareness, and enabled more cohesive group action by our forces.  Critical technical areas addressed in this project included automated decision support, information sharing, ensured communications, and advanced informatics.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Cognitive Computing project developed core technologies that enabled computing and autonomy systems to learn and apply knowledge gained through experience.  These technologies led to systems with increased self-reliance and the capacity to operate with reduced programmer and operator intervention.  In resource-limited settings, these capabilities made the difference between mission success and mission degradation or failure, increased safety by allowing warfighters to operate systems from greater standoff distances, and reduced staffing requirements by providing greater autonomy.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Title>Autonomous Robotic Manipulation (ARM)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The Autonomous Robotic Manipulation (ARM) program developed advanced robotic technologies that enabled autonomous (unmanned) mobile platforms to manipulate objects without human control or intervention.  A key objective was intelligent control of manipulators to independently perform subtasks over a broad range of domains of interest to the warfighter, thereby reducing operator workload, time on target, training time, bandwidth, and hardware complexity.  Former manipulation systems had many limitations.  For example, while they performed well in certain mission environments, they had yet to demonstrate proficiency and flexibility across multiple mission environments; they required burdensome human interaction and the full attention of the operator; and the time required to complete tasks generally exceeded military users' desires.  ARM created manipulators with a high degree of autonomy capable of serving multiple military purposes across a wide variety of application domains to include, but not limited to, counter-improvised explosive devices, countermine, search and rescue, weapons support, checkpoint and access control, explosive ordnance disposal, and combat casualty care (including battlefield extraction).  ARM enabled autonomous manipulation systems to surpass the performance level of remote manipulation systems that are controlled directly by a human operator.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Transformative Apps created the information infrastructure required to enable mission support and tactical applications (apps) to meet the efficiency, security, and availability requirements for use on mobile military networks.  Particularly noteworthy was the development of a new data synchronization architecture between handheld devices and backend computing/storage nodes.  Additionally, appropriate middleware services and libraries were developed to facilitate shared capabilities such as map viewing, apps management, and collection of logs, usage statistics, and user feedback.  Apps, together with handhelds and networks, were tested in different training environments as well as in deployed environments.  Performance and usage were carefully tracked and user feedback collected to guide rapid enhancement of apps.  The effort created a military apps development community by reaching out to non-traditional performers and explored new models for software acquisition based on end-user empowerment.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Biological Warfare Defense project is budgeted in the Applied Research Budget Activity because its focus is on the underlying technologies associated with the detection, prevention, treatment and remediation of biological, chemical, and radionuclide threats.

Efforts to counter existing and emerging biological, chemical and radiological threats include countermeasures to stop the pathophysiologic processes that occur as a consequence of an attack, host immune response enhancers, medical diagnostics for the most virulent pathogens and their molecular mechanisms, collection of environmental trace constituents to support chemical mapping, tactical and strategic biological, chemical, and radiological sensors, and integrated defense systems.  This program also includes development of a unique set of platform technologies and medical countermeasures synthesis that will dramatically decrease the timeline from military threat detection to countermeasure availability.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

These technologies will also be focused on reduction of time, risk, and cost associated with new therapeutic development.  For example, this program will develop in vitro tissue constructs (IVTC) that will emulate human response to therapeutic compounds, thereby significantly reducing the cost and time for evaluating safety and efficacy of therapeutics.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element is budgeted in the Applied Research Budget Activity because it supports the advancement of concepts and technologies to enhance the next generation of tactical systems.  The Tactical Technology program element funds a number of projects in the areas of Naval Warfare, Advanced Land Systems, Advanced Tactical Technology, Aeronautics Technology and Network Centric Enabling Technology.

The Naval Warfare Technology project develops advanced technologies for application to a broad range of naval requirements.  Enabling and novel technologies include concepts for expanding the envelope of operational naval capabilities such as improved situational awareness over large maritime environments, ship self-defense techniques, novel underwater propulsion modalities, high speed underwater vessels, improved techniques for underwater object detection and discrimination, long endurance unmanned surface vehicles, and high bandwidth communications.

The Advanced Land Systems project is developing technologies for enhancing U.S. military effectiveness and survivability in operations ranging from traditional threats to military operations against irregular forces that can employ disruptive or catastrophic capabilities, or disrupt stabilization operations.  The emphasis is on developing affordable technologies that will enhance the military's effectiveness while decreasing the exposure of U.S. or allied forces to enemy fire.  This project will also explore novel design technologies for the manufacture of ground vehicles and new tools for systems assessments of emerging DARPA technologies.

The Advanced Tactical Technology project focuses on broad technology areas including: a) compact, efficient, frequency-agile, diode-pumped, solid-state lasers for infrared countermeasures, laser radar, holographic laser sensors, communications, and high-power laser applications; and b) new tactical systems for enhanced air vehicle survivability, precision optics, electronic warfare, and advanced air breathing weapons. 

Aeronautics Technology efforts will address high payoff opportunities that dramatically reduce costs associated with advanced aeronautical systems and/or provide revolutionary new system capabilities for satisfying current and projected military mission requirements.  This includes advanced technology studies of revolutionary propulsion and vehicle concepts, sophisticated fabrication methods, and examination of novel materials for aeronautic system applications.

The Network Centric Enabling Technology project develops network-centric mission applications that integrate information arising from: 1) intelligence networks; 2) open and other external sources; 3) sensors and signal/image processors; and 4) collection platforms and weapon systems.  Technical challenges include the need to process huge volumes of diverse, incomplete, and uncertain data streams in tactically-relevant timeframes.  The data processing efforts include: conditioning of unstructured data, content analysis, behavioral modeling, pattern-of-life characterization, economic activity analysis, social network analysis, anomaly detection, and visualization.  Operational benefits include deeper understanding of the evolving operational environment tailored to the needs of commanders at every echelon.  Promising technologies are evaluated in the laboratory and demonstrated in the field to facilitate transition.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>The Anti-Submarine Warfare  (ASW) Continuous Trail Unmanned Vessel (ACTUV) program has three primary goals: (1) to build and demonstrate an experimental unmanned vessel with beyond state-of-the-art platform performance based on clean sheet design for unmanned operation, (2) demonstrate the technical viability of operating autonomous unmanned craft at theater or global ranges, from forward operating bases, under a sparse remote supervisory control model, and (3) leverage unique ACTUV characteristics to transition a game changing ASW capability to the Navy.  By establishing the premise that a human is never intended to step on board at any point in the operational cycle, ACTUV concepts can take advantage of an unexplored design space that eliminates or modifies conventional manned ship design constraints in order to achieve disproportionate speed, endurance, and payload fraction.  The resulting unmanned naval vessels must possess sufficient situational awareness and autonomous behavior capability to operate in full compliance with the rules of the road and maritime law to support safe navigation for operational deployments spanning thousands of miles and months of time.  When coupled with innovative sensor technologies, the ACTUV system provides a low cost unmanned system with a fundamentally different operational risk calculus that enables game changing capability to detect and track even the quietest diesel electric submarine threats.  Key technical areas include unmanned naval vessel design methodologies, ship system reliability, high fidelity sensor fusion to provide an accurate world model for autonomous operation, novel application of sensors for ASW tracking, and holistic system integration due to unique optimization opportunities of the ACTUV system.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Upward Falling Payloads (UFP) program will develop forward-deployed unmanned distributed systems that can provide non-lethal effects or situational awareness over large maritime environments.  Building upon and complimenting concepts for maritime situational awareness and ISR developed under the DASH program, budgeted in Project PE 0603766E/NET-02, the UFP approach centers on pre-deploying deep-ocean nodes years in advance in forward operating areas which can be commanded from standoff to launch to the surface.  

Advances in miniaturized sensors and processors, growth in the variety of unmanned systems, and advances in autonomy and networking all point toward highly capable, yet affordable, distributed systems.  However, power and logistics to deliver these systems in a timely manner in forward operating areas limit their utility.  The UFP program will remove this barrier to accelerate large-scale unmanned distributed missions.  The presumption is that a wider range of technology options and system solutions will emerge when the barriers to deployment are removed.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The goal of the Strategic Mobility program is to analyze and perform risk reduction on technology solutions which can enable rapid deployment of brigade-- or even division-- sized forces globally in a matter of just days.  Initially, the activity will focus on identifying high payoff logistics and deployment technologies, and understanding the deployment and sustainment architectures required to support these technologies.  The program will examine increased automation in logistics and distribution operations, new platform technologies for sea-based transportation and prepositioning, and technologies which could enable aerial delivery of forces to the vicinity of an objective area.  The Strategic Mobility program will then shift to a focused technology risk reduction activity designed to systematically address the principal risks for the highest payoff technology set.  The technologies developed by the program could enable a rapid strategic response capability, with rapid deployment and sustainment of substantial ground combat forces, even to very remote or austere locations.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>*Previously Medium Caliber Precision Weapons, budgeted under Project TT-04.

The Multi-Azimuth Defense Fast Intercept Round Engagement (MAD-FIRES) program will validate the premise that high precision extended range (1-10 km) direct fire medium caliber cannons can trade accuracy for size to provide equal or greater lethality compared to traditional larger and more expensive weapon systems.  While MAD-FIRES does focus on the most stressing case; ship self defense against the newest and next generation maneuverable and high speed aerial threats, extending the technology could enable smaller combat fighting vehicles and platforms augmented survivability and lethality against larger,  more valuable targets.  Lethal direct fire overmatch traditionally required larger cannons and larger vehicles to overcome threat armor systems and defenses.  MAD-FIRES will change this paradigm and enable smaller platforms by changing the requirement for maintaining lethality overmatch through accuracy rather than size.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Arctic Operations initiative is focused on developing technology to assure U.S. capability to achieve situational awareness in the Arctic.  Due to retreating Arctic ice in the coming decades there is an expectation for increased shipping traffic during the summer months, and increased interest in exploiting natural resources along the Arctic continental shelf.  This growth in activity will increase the strategic significance of the region, and will drive the need to ensure stability through effective regional monitoring.  The extreme environmental conditions of the Arctic may challenge the effectiveness of conventional technology to provide such monitoring.  As such, this program seeks to exploit unique physical attributes and emergent environmental trends in the Arctic to create surprising new capabilities, and will develop technologies for persistent and affordable sensing and communication both above and below the ice to ensure responsive operations and domain awareness.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The goal of the Ground Experimental Vehicle (GXV) program is to investigate ground vehicle technologies that enable crew/vehicle survivability through means other than traditional heavy passive armor solutions.  This will be accomplished through research and development of novel ground combat and tactical vehicle technology solutions that demonstrate significantly advanced platform mobility, agility, and survivability.  The focus of the GXV program will be on technology development across multiple areas to simultaneously improve military ground vehicle survivability and mobility.  Traditionally, survivability and mobility have to be traded against each other due to the reliance on heavy armor.  The GXV program seeks to break this trend.  Coupled with the development of technologies, the GXV program will define concept vehicles which showcase these developmental technologies.  A modeling and simulation effort will also be undertaken to understand the vehicle design trade space for the concept vehicles using the developmental technologies and to illustrate how these vehicles might be used operationally in combat scenarios.  Technology development areas are likely to include increasing vehicle tactical mobility, survivability through agility, crew augmentation, and signature management, though other relevant technologies may also be pursued.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>*Formerly Infantry Squad Systems (IS2)

The U.S. military achieves overmatch against its adversaries via vehicles in all regimes - land, sea and air; however, this level of overmatch is not enjoyed at the squad to individual dismounted warfighter level.  The goal of the Squad X program is to leverage advances in real-time situational awareness and mission command; organic three-dimensional dismount mobility; extended range tracking, targeting, and response; and unmanned mobility and perception in order to create a squad with substantial combat overmatch.  The concept of overmatch at the squad level includes increased human stand-off, a smaller force density, and adaptive sensing to allow for responses at multiple scales. Squad X will explore advanced wearable force protection, advanced organic squad level direct and indirect trajectory precision weaponry, and non-kinetic precision capabilities.  The end result of the Squad X program is an individual dismount unit outfitted with sensors, weaponry, and supporting technology to achieve one-on-one overmatch as well as the overall integration of unmanned assets alongside the dismounts to create a new Hybrid Squad unit.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Mobile Infantry (MI) program will explore  the development of a system-based, mixed team of mounted/dismounted warfighters and semi-autonomous variants of current or planned small off-road platforms  (equivalent to high-mobility platforms currently used by special forces operators single rider, two-rider, or four-rider variants).  The MI mixed teams will be able to execute an expanded mission set from those currently employed.  The MI system concept will allow for a combined set of mounted and dismounted operations and for a larger area of operations over more aggressive timelines than standard infantry units.  To improve operational effectiveness of the warfighter teams when dismounted, the semi-autonomous platforms,  when unmanned, act as multipliers to the squad, such as extended and mobile fire support platforms and allow the MI mixed teams to perform higher risk exposure and access missions. The MI system scale, enabled by smaller off-road platforms, is intended to maintain dismounted warfighter scales for operational deployment.  Platforms are planned for internal transportation within CH-47, CH-53, and V-22 aircraft and are intended to be adaptations of existing/expected platforms to eliminate the schedule and cost of new platform development.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>To be dominant in robotics of the future, the DoD will need to embrace programs designed to create disruptive advances in robotics capabilities that are measured in months rather than years, and whose individual costs may largely be measured in thousands of dollars rather than millions.  The Robotics Fast Track program seeks to revolutionize robotics technologies by promoting non-traditional technical opportunities.  The program will create low-cost, high-utility robotic component solutions by engaging a novel performer community in research efforts that result in prototype systems and proofs of concept in months, at a fraction of the cost of traditional design processes.  The Robotics Fast Track program will engage numerous robotics related efforts across the spectrum of robotics professionals and enthusiasts, extending the existing performer base to include non-standard, cutting edge organizations and individuals throughout the robotics community.  The program will demonstrate the ability for robotics projects to be performed at an asymmetric advantage in time, cost, and contribution of the efforts in comparison to more traditional applied research areas.  This will apply to both performance of individual efforts and to the contracting required to engage performers in said efforts.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The goals of the Fast, Adaptable, Next-Generation Ground Combat Vehicle (FANG) program were to employ a novel, model-based design and verification capability, a highly-adaptable foundry-style manufacturing capability, and collaborative design methods to demonstrate up to 5X compression in the timeline necessary to build an infantry fighting vehicle (IFV).  The program sought to create an open-source development infrastructure for the aggregation of designer inputs applicable to complex electromechanical systems as well as software, and to exercise this infrastructure with a series of design events, leading to the building of designs in a foundry-style, rapidly configurable manufacturing facility.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Laser UV Sources for Tactical Efficient Raman (LUSTER) program is developing a compact semiconductor laser that emits in the deep UV (i.e. wavelength &lt;250 nanometers) and is capable of an output power of 1 Watt with high efficiency and spectral purity suitable for a wide array of spectroscopy applications.  Such an achievement will represent a significant advance over the state of the art, as existing lasers in this wavelength range are bulky, highly inefficient, and expensive, as there are no available semiconductor lasers that can emit in the UV range &lt;250nm. LUSTER will leverage lessons learned in growing high quality light emitting material from the Compact Mid-Ultraviolet Technology (CMUVT) program.  The compact size of semiconductor lasers along with the LUSTER performance goals will enable many applications including but not limited to standoff Raman spectroscopy which is of interest for DoD applications such as chemical agent sensing.</r2:Description>

InSPIRE enhances the ability to rapidly mature and insert new technologies into national security space assets.  The InSPIRE program expands on the capabilities matured through SPHERES by developing, building and launching new hardware and software elements that expand the baseline capabilities.

                                    <r2:Description>The Aircrew Labor In-cockpit Automation System (ALIAS) program will design, develop, and demonstrate a kit enabling affordable, rapid automation of selected aircrew functions across a broad range of aircraft.  ALIAS intends to enable reduction of aircrew workload and/or the number of onboard aircrew, to improve performance. The program will develop hardware and software to automate select aircrew functions and will employ novel, low impact approaches to interfacing with existing aircraft monitoring and control systems. The program will also develop tractable approaches to rapidly capture crew-station specific skills and aircraft unique behaviors. To accomplish this, ALIAS will leverage recent advances in perception, manipulation, machine learning, reusable software architectures, autonomous systems architecture, and verification and validation.  ALIAS will culminate in a demonstration of the ability to rapidly adapt a single system to multiple aircraft and execute simple missions. This reliability enhancement capability will enable new operational concepts for reuse of existing air assets and allow a reduction in the number of aircrew required.</r2:Description>

Additionally, the demonstrator will be designed to have a useful load of no less than 40% of the gross weight.  A strong emphasis will be placed on the development of elegant, multi-functional subsystem technologies that demonstrate net improvements in aircraft efficiencies to enable new and vastly improved operational capabilities.  In FY 2016, VTOL Technology Demonstrator will be funded in PE 0603286E, Project AIR-01.</r2:Description>

Petrel will fill the niche between conventional airlift and sealift through development of a new transportation mode capable of high speed operation across the surface/air interface over water as well as terrain.  Technical approaches for rapid transport across the ocean and movement from the ship to the tactical battlefield will consider traditional and non-traditional aerodynamic and hydrodynamic concepts as well as innovative uses of existing technologies. Primary technical goals for Petrel are to reduce or eliminate intermodal delays and to achieve a transport efficiency better than $0.1/ton-mi.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Network Defense program will develop technologies to detect network attacks using network summary data. U.S. computer networks are continually under attack, and these attacks are typically handled by individual organizations as they occur.  Analyzing network summary data across a wide array of networks will make it possible to identify trends and patterns visible only when the data is viewed as a whole and to detect recurring threats, patterns of activity, and persistent vulnerabilities.  Network Defense will develop novel algorithms and analysis tools that enable a big picture approach for identifying illicit behavior in networks.  This analysis and subsequent feedback to system administrators, security engineers, and decision makers will enhance information security in both the government and commercial sectors.</r2:Description>

Current search technologies have limitations in search query format, retrieved content organization, and infrastructure support and the iterative search process they enable is time-consuming and inefficient, typically finding only a fraction of the available information.  Memex will create a new domain-specific search paradigm to discover relevant content and organize it in ways that are more immediately useful to specific missions and tasks.  In addition, Memex domain-specific search engines will extend the reach of current search capabilities to the deep web and non-traditional content.  Memex technologies will enable the military, government, and commercial enterprises to find and organize mission-critical information on the Internet and in large intelligence repositories.  Anticipated mission areas include counter-terrorism, counter-drug, anti-money-laundering, and anti-human-trafficking, with transition partners from DoD and other U.S. government activities.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Distributed Battle Management (DBM) program will develop mission-driven architectures, protocols, and algorithms for battle management (BM) in the contested environment.  The military is turning to networked weapons and sensors on-board a heterogeneous mix of multi-purpose manned and unmanned systems.  In contested environments, it is a challenge for BM networks to communicate with subordinate platforms due to extensive adversarial cyber and electronic warfare operations, anti-satellite attacks, and the need for emissions control in the face of a formidable integrated air defense system.  The Distributed Battle Management program will seek to develop a distributed command architecture with decentralized control of mission-focused asset teams.  The architecture will enable rapid reaction to ephemeral engagement opportunities and maintain a reliable BM structure, despite limited communications and platform attrition in continuously evolving threat environments.  The program will incorporate highly automated decision making capability while maintaining vital human-on-the-loop operator approval.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Quantitative Methods for Rapid Response (QMRR) program develops and applies big data analysis and visualization methodologies for rapidly emergent U.S. national security priorities.  As was shown by the Nexus 7 experience in Afghanistan, big data presents an opportunity to better understand the true nature of non-traditional threats, track the effectiveness of remedial measures, and develop/optimize alternative strategies; QMRR extends that work. Recently we have seen the rise of extremely challenging non-traditional threats such as ISIL and Ebola.  In the case of ISIL, in addition to countering their military actions on the battlefield, it is important to limit the effectiveness of their recruitment efforts.  Since ISIL recruiting is largely web-based, this implies the need to monitor ISIL public messaging in social media and private messaging on the dark web.  Ebola presents related, but somewhat different challenges, specifically, finding patterns in the spread of the disease and factors that favor/mitigate its development.  There is also interest in quantitative methods for countering proliferation of weapons of mass terrorism.  The work conducted under the program will be coordinated with and transitioned to multiple national security agencies.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Understanding Machine Intelligence (UMI) program will develop techniques that enable artificial intelligence (AI) systems to better support users through transparent operation.  In the future, the U.S. military will encounter adversary systems that are AI-enabled.  Maintaining "AI-superiority" will require AI-enabled systems capable of performing increasingly complex functions with high degrees of reliability and safety.  Significantly, in order for developers and users to feel confident enough to deploy and use AI-enabled systems, these systems must operate with a high degree of transparency.  UMI will develop AI technologies that support transparency by providing supporting rationale and logic sequences to clarify the basis for and reliability of outputs.  In addition, efforts will be made to develop a mathematically rigorous virtual stability theory for AI-enabled systems analogous to the (conventional) stability theory developed for dynamical systems (solutions to systems of differential equations).  Such a virtual stability theory will enable the creation of feedback mechanisms that flag and interrupt anomalous outputs and behaviors.  UMI implementations will be developed and demonstrated in next-generation systems.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Visual Media Reasoning (VMR) program is creating technologies to automate the analysis of enemy-recorded photos and videos and identify, within minutes, key information related to the content.  This includes the identification of individuals within the image (who), the enumeration of the objects within the image and their attributes (what), and the image's geospatial location and time frame (where and when).  Large data stores of enemy photos and video are available but cannot be easily leveraged by a warfighter or analyst attempting to understand a specific new image in a timely fashion.  The VMR program will enable users to gain insights rapidly through application of highly parallelized image analysis techniques that can process the imagery in massive distributed image stores.  VMR technology will serve as a force-multiplier by rapidly and automatically extracting tactically relevant information and alerting the analyst to scenes that warrant the analyst's expert attention.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Nexus 7 program applied forecasting, data extraction, and analysis methodologies to develop tools, techniques, and frameworks for the automated interpretation, quantitative analysis, and visualization of social networks.  Social network theory has emerged in recent years as a promising approach for understanding groups of individuals connected through a variety of shared interests and collaborative activities.  For the military, social networks provide a promising model for understanding terrorist cells, insurgent groups, and other stateless actors whose connectedness is established not on the basis of shared geography but rather through the correlation of their participation in coordinated activities such as planning meetings, training/mission rehearsal sessions, sharing of materiel/funds transfers, etc.  Nexus 7 supported emerging military missions using both traditional and non-traditional data sources for those areas of the world and mission sets with limited conventional Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance.  Examples of additional data sources included foreign news, media, and social network data.  These non-traditional sources were integrated with a wide variety of military structured and unstructured data.  Nexus 7 developed quantitative techniques and tools for processing and analyzing these large data sources as a means for understanding relationships between hostile, neutral, and friendly foreign organizations with the United States.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element is budgeted in the Applied Research Budget Activity because its objective is to develop material, biological and energy technologies that make possible a wide range of new military capabilities.

The major goal of the Materials Processing Technology project is to develop novel materials, materials processing techniques, mathematical models and fabrication strategies for advanced materials, devices and components that will lower the cost, increase the performance, and/or enable new missions for military platforms and systems.  Included in this project are efforts across a wide range of materials including structural materials and devices, functional materials and devices, energetic materials and devices, low distortion optical lenses, and materials that enable new propulsion concepts for land, sea, and space vehicles.

The Biologically Based Materials and Devices project acknowledges the growing and pervasive influence of the biological sciences on the development of new DoD capabilities.  This influence extends throughout the development of new materials, devices, and processes and relies on the integration of biological breakthroughs with those in engineering and the physical sciences.  Contained in this project are thrusts in the application of biomimetic materials and devices for Defense, the use of biology's unique fabrication capabilities to produce structures that cannot be made any other way, the application of materials in biological applications, and the development of manufacturing tools that use biological components and processes for materials synthesis.  This project also includes major efforts aimed at integrating biological and digital sensing methodologies and maintaining human combat performance despite the extraordinary stressors of combat.  Finally, this thrust will develop new cognitive therapeutics, investigate the role of complexity in biological systems, and explore neuroscience technologies.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>The Materials Processing and Manufacturing thrust is exploring new manufacturing and processing approaches that will dramatically lower the cost and decrease the time required to fabricate DoD systems.  It will also develop approaches that yield new materials and materials capabilities that cannot be made through conventional processing approaches as well as address efficient, low-volume manufacturing.  As a result of recent advances in manufacturing techniques (3D printing, manufacture on demand, etc.) and the push towards programmable hardware in embedded systems, the development cycle from design to production of both hardware and software is severely bottlenecked at the design phase.  Further research within this thrust, will create methods to translate natural inputs into software code and mechanical design.  This process will complete underspecified designs when possible and initiate an iterative dialog with a human to specify details as needed and actively suggest changes to designers when the intended design cannot operate within the required specifications.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Multifunctional Materials and Structures thrust is developing materials, materials processing, and structures that are explicitly tailored for multiple functions and/or unique mechanical properties.  One goal of this research is the ability to design, develop and demonstrate materials with combinations of properties that are normally orthogonal (e.g. damage tolerance and biocompatibility).  This capability will ultimately lead to enhanced lethality, survivability and performance in future DoD platforms.  This thrust will also include the exploration and development of dynamic models of complex systems across scale and develop new methodologies for understanding, architecting and engineering complex systems.  These computational tools will link material properties to physics across multiple length scales (from molecule to part) and provide the ability to model and exploit complexity, such as hierarchy and strongly correlated effects, in structural and functional materials.  Development efforts under this thrust include reactive structures that can serve as both structure and explosive for lightweight munitions, novel materials and surfaces that are designed to adapt structural or functional properties to environmental and/or tactical threat conditions, and new thin film material deposition processes to improve the performance of surface dominated properties (friction, wear, and membrane permeability).  In addition, this thrust will also explore new cost effective processes for ensuring DoD accessibility to future advanced materials.  Examples of DoD applications that will benefit from these material developments include lower weight and higher performance aircraft, turbines with enhanced efficiency, erosion-resistant rotor blades, and high-temperature materials for operation in hypersonic environments.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Manufacturable Gradient Index Optics (M-GRIN) program seeks to advance the development of GRIN lenses from a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 3 to a Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL) 6.  The program will expand the application of gradient index optics (GRIN) by providing compact, lightweight, and cost-effective optical systems with controlled dispersion and aberrations that will replace large assemblies of conventional lenses.  The ability to create entirely new optical materials and surfaces creates the potential for new or significantly improved military optical applications, such as solar concentrators, portable designators, highly efficient fiber optics, and imaging systems.  The program also seeks to extend GRIN manufacturing technologies to glass, ceramic, and other inorganic materials in order to allow for small, lightweight, customized optical elements for mid-wave and long-wave infrared (MWIR and LWIR) applications.  A key component of the program is to develop new design tools that enable optics designers to incorporate dynamic material properties, fabrication methods, and manufacturing tolerances.  The integration of new materials, design tools, and manufacturing processes will enable previously unattainable 3D optical designs to be manufactured.  This new manufacturing paradigm will enable flexible production of GRIN optics in quantities of one unit to thousands of units.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Advanced Technology Heat to Electricity Nuclear Alternatives (ATHENA) program is an experimental program to determine if it is possible to provide electrical power for military missions with very high energy density and power density, at a scale where nuclear reactors are unworkable, where combustion is infeasible, and where solar power is impractical, for space, maritime, and ground applications.  The program pursues advancements in radioisotope technology, which has essentially stagnated for fifty years.  Specifically, the program seeks to identify and develop radioisotopes that better capture DoD requirements by providing improved power density and allow safer, more convenient handling, explore better and more efficient electricity conversion technology than thermocouples, and to develop an operations framework leading to a solution that is capable of deployment.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Structural Materials and Coatings thrust explored and developed new materials to provide enhanced structural and/or surface properties for DoD applications.  Included were approaches that avoid corrosion through engineered material, provide superior strength at greatly reduced material density, provide the basis for a new generation of structural composite and submarine propeller materials, and enable prolonged lifetimes for DoD systems and components.

The Hybrid Multi Material Rotor Full-Scale Demonstration (HyDem) program, an outgrowth of the Structural Materials and Coatings effort's Hybrid Multi Material Rotor (HMMR) program, dramatically improved U.S. Navy submarine superiority.  The HyDem program designed, manufactured, and supplied the Navy with a novel component for integration into a new construction Virginia Class Submarine.  The Navy is evaluating this component in sea trials.  If successful, it is envisioned that the Navy will integrate this design change into the future development of the Virginia Class and Ohio Replacement Submarines, and possibly back-fit previously constructed Virginia Class Submarines.  Beginning in FY 15 this program will be funded from PE 0603766E, Project NET-02, Maritime Systems.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Title>Living Foundries</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The goal of the Living Foundries program is to create a revolutionary, biologically-based manufacturing platform to provide new materials, capabilities, and manufacturing paradigms for the DoD and the Nation.  With its ability to perform complex chemistries, be flexibly programmed through DNA code, scale, adapt to changing environments and self-repair, biology represents one of the most powerful manufacturing platforms known.  However, the DoD's ability to harness this platform is rudimentary.  Living Foundries seeks to develop the foundational technological infrastructure to transform biology into an engineering practice, speeding the biological design-build-test-learn cycle and expanding the complexity of systems that can be engineered.  The program will enable the rapid and scalable development of previously unattainable technologies and products (i.e., those that cannot be accessed using known, synthetic mechanisms), leveraging biology to solve challenges associated with production of new materials (e.g., fluoropolymers, enzymes, lubricants, coatings and materials for harsh environments), novel functions (e.g., self-repairing and self-regenerating systems), biological reporting systems, and therapeutics to enable new solutions and enhancements to military needs and capabilities.  Ultimately, Living Foundries aims to provide game-changing manufacturing paradigms for the DoD, enabling distributed, adaptable, on-demand production of critical and high-value materials, devices, and capabilities in the field or on base.  Such a capability will decrease the DoD's dependence on tenuous material supply chains vulnerable to political change, targeted attack, or environmental accident.

Research thrusts will focus on the development and demonstration of open technology platforms, or bioproduction pipelines, that integrate the tools and capabilities developed in PE 0601101E, TRS-01 to prove out capabilities for rapid (months vs. years) design and construction of new bio-production systems for novel materials.  The result will be an integrated, modular infrastructure across the areas of design, fabrication, debugging, analysis, optimization, and validation -- spanning the entire development life-cycle and enabling the ability to rapidly assess and improve designs.  Integrated processes developed in this program will translate into significant performance improvements and cost savings for the production of advanced materials, biological reporting systems, and therapeutics.  These technologies will ultimately result in on-demand, customizable, and distributed production of strategic materials and systems.  Key to success will be tight coupling of computational design, fabrication of systems, debugging using multiple characterization data types, analysis, and further development such that iterative design and experimentation will be accurate, efficient and controlled.  Demonstration platforms will be challenged to build a variety of DoD-relevant, novel molecules and chemical building blocks with complex functionalities, such as synthesis of advanced, functional chemicals, materials precursors, and polymers (e.g., those tolerant of harsh environments).</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Adaptive Immunomodulation-Based Therapeutics program will develop platform technologies that can interrogate and define the biological pathways leading to an immune response with the goal of developing and demonstrating new therapeutic interventions.  One approach to achieve this capability will require the development of new tools to stimulate and measure responses of the nervous system in order to map the bioelectric code that controls the immune response as well as other critical organ functions.  This program will also develop capabilities for serial measurements of metabolic state to identify correlates for health and early detection of disease.  An additional approach involves characterizing the host response in patients with severe infections, and translating this response into a quantitative framework that can be used to guide modulation of the immune response.  Algorithms will be developed to evaluate and predict various physiological conditions within an individual and could later be expanded to track the health of various communities.  Advances made under the Adaptive Immunomodulation-Based Therapeutics program will improve our response capability against severe infectious diseases and biological threats and offer new avenues for treating disease with no available drugs, such as multiple drug resistant organisms.  The ultimate goals for the Adaptive Immunomodulation-Based Therapeutics program are to enable an autonomous and continuous sense and response capability to regulate the human immune response and to develop decision support tools that help manage general health such as tracking and combatting infectious diseases in a community.  It is anticipated that these capabilities will ultimately provide enhanced protection against injury, enable life-saving rescue from hyper-immune activity, and stimulate advances in regenerative medicine.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Neuroscience Technologies thrust leverages recent advances in neurophysiology, neuro-imaging, cognitive science, molecular biology, and modeling of complex systems to sustain and protect the cognitive functioning of the warfighter faced with challenging operational conditions.  Warfighters experience a wide variety of operational stressors, both mental and physical, that degrade critical cognitive functions such as memory, learning, and decision making.  These stressors also degrade the warfighter's ability to multitask, leading to decreased ability to respond quickly and effectively.  Currently, the long-term impact of these stressors on the brain is unknown, both at the molecular and behavioral level.  This thrust area will create modern neuroscientific techniques to develop quantitative models of this impact and explore mechanisms to protect, maintain, complement, or restore physical and cognitive functioning during and after exposure to operational stressors.  In addition, new approaches for using physiological and neural signals to make human-machine systems more time efficient and less workload intense will be identified, developed, and evaluated.  This thrust area will have far-reaching implications for both current and future military operations, with the potential to protect and improve physical and cognitive performance at the individual and group level both prior to and during deployment.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program element is budgeted in the Applied Research budget activity because its objective is to develop electronics that make a wide range of military applications possible.

Advances in microelectronic device technologies, including digital, analog, photonic and MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS) devices, continue to have significant impact in support of defense technologies for improved weapons effectiveness, improved intelligence capabilities and enhanced information superiority.  The Electronics Technology program element supports the continued advancement of these technologies through the development of performance driven advanced capabilities, exceeding that available through commercial sources, in electronic, optoelectronic and MEMS devices, semiconductor device design and fabrication techniques, and new materials and material structures for device applications.  A particular focus for this work is the exploitation of chip-scale heterogeneous integration technologies that permit the optimization of device and integrated module performance.

The phenomenal progress in current electronics and computer chips will face the fundamental limits of silicon technology in the early 21st century, a barrier that must be overcome in order for progress to continue.  Another thrust of the program element will explore alternatives to silicon-based electronics in the areas of new electronic devices, new architectures to use them, new software to program the systems, and new methods to fabricate the chips.  Approaches include nanotechnology, nanoelectronics, molecular electronics, spin-based electronics, quantum-computing, new circuit architectures optimizing these new devices, and new computer and electronic systems architectures.  Projects will investigate the feasibility, design, and development of powerful information technology devices and systems using approaches for electronic device designs that extend beyond traditional Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) scaling, including non-silicon-based materials technologies to achieve low cost, reliable, fast and secure computing, communication, and storage systems.  This investigation is aimed at developing new capabilities from promising directions in the design of information processing components using both inorganic and organic substrates, designs of components and systems leveraging quantum effects and chaos, and innovative approaches to computing designs incorporating these components for such applications as low cost seamless pervasive computing, ultra-fast computing, and sensing and actuation devices.  

This project has five major thrusts: Electronics, Photonics, MicroElectroMechanical Systems, Architectures, Algorithms, and other Electronic Technology research.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Title>Adaptive Radio Frequency Technology (ART)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>There is a critical ongoing military need for flexible, affordable, and small size, weight and power (SWaP) real-time-adaptable military electromagnetic interfaces.  The Adaptive Radio Frequency Technology (ART) program will provide the warfighter with a new, fully adaptive radio platform capable of sensing the electromagnetic and waveform environment in which it operates, making decisions on how to best communicate in that environment, and rapidly adapting its hardware to meet ever-changing requirements, while simultaneously significantly reducing the SWaP of such radio nodes.  ART technology will also provide each warfighter, as well as small-scale unmanned platforms, with compact and efficient signal identification capabilities for next-generation cognitive communications, and sensing and electronic warfare applications.  ART technology will also enable rapid radio platform deployment for new waveforms and changing operational requirements.  The project will remove the separate design tasks needed for each unique Radio Frequency (RF) system, which will dramatically reduce the procurement and sustainment cost of military systems.  ART aggregates the Feedback Linearized Microwave Amplifiers program, the Analog Spectral Processing program, and Chip Scale Spectrum Analyzers (CSSA) program, and initiates new thrusts in Cognitive Low-energy Signal Analysis and Sensing Integrated Circuits (CLASIC), and Radio-Frequency Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (RF-FPGA).</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Title>Diverse &amp; Accessible Heterogeneous Integration (DAHI)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>Prior DARPA efforts have demonstrated the ability to monolithically integrate different semiconductor types to achieve near-ideal "mix-and-match" capability for DoD circuit designers.  Specifically, the Compound Semiconductor Materials On Silicon (COSMOS) program enabled transistors of Indium Phosphide (InP) to be freely mixed with silicon complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) circuits to obtain the benefits of both technologies (very high speed and very high circuit complexity/density, respectively).  The Diverse &amp; Accessible Heterogeneous Integration (DAHI) effort will take this capability to the next level, ultimately offering the seamless co-integration of a variety of semiconductor devices (for example, Gallium Nitride, Indium Phosphide, Gallium Arsenide, Antimonide Based Compound Semiconductors), microelectromechanical (MEMS) sensors and actuators, photonic devices (e.g., lasers, photo-detectors) and thermal management structures.  This capability will revolutionize our ability to build true "systems on a chip" (SoCs) and allow dramatic size, weight and volume reductions for a wide array of system applications.

In the Applied Research part of this program, high performance RF/optoelectronic/mixed-signal systems-on-a-chip (SoC) for specific DoD transition applications will be developed as a demonstration of the DAHI technology.  To provide maximum benefit to the DoD, these processes will be transferred to a manufacturing flow and made available (with appropriate computer aided design support) to a wide variety of DoD laboratory, Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC), academic and industrial designers.  Manufacturing yield and reliability of the DAHI technologies will be characterized and enhanced.  This program has basic research efforts funded in PE 0601101E, Project ES-01, and advanced technology development efforts funded in PE 0603739E, Project MT-15.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The IntraChip Enhanced Cooling (ICECool) program is exploring disruptive technologies that will remove thermal barriers to the operation of military electronic systems, while significantly reducing size, weight, and power consumption.  These thermal barriers will be removed by integrating thermal management into the chip, substrate, or package technology.  Successful completion of this program will raise chip heat removal rates to above 1 kilowatt/cm^2 and chip package heat removal density to above 1kilowatt/cm^3 in RF arrays and embedded computers.

Specific areas of focus in this program include overcoming limiting evaporative and diffusive thermal transport mechanisms at the micro/nano scale to provide an order-of-magnitude increase in on-chip heat flux and heat removal density, determining the feasibility of exploiting these mechanisms for intrachip thermal management, characterizing the performance limits and physics-of-failure of high heat density, intrachip cooling technologies, and integrating chip-level thermal management techniques into prototype high power electronics in RF arrays and embedded computing systems.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The In vivo Nanoplatforms (IVN) program seeks to develop the nanoscale systems necessary for in vivo sensing and physiologic monitoring and delivery vehicles for targeted biological therapeutics against chemical and biological (chem-bio) threat agents.  The nanoscale components to be developed will enable continuous in vivo monitoring of both small (e.g., glucose, nucleic acids, biomarkers) and large molecules (e.g., biological threat agents).  A reprogrammable therapeutic platform that targets gene regulatory sequences will enable tailored therapeutic delivery to specific areas of the body (e.g., cells, tissue, compartments) in response to traditional, emergent, and engineered threats.  The key challenges to developing these systems include safety, toxicity, biocompatibility, sensitivity, response, and targeted delivery.  The IVN program will have diagnostic and therapeutic goals that enable a versatile, rapidly adaptable system to provide operational support to the warfighter in any location.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Title>Pixel Network (PIXNET) for Dynamic Visualization</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The PIXNET program addresses the squad level capability gap for target detection, recognition and identification in all-weather and day/night missions through real-time fusion of visible and thermal infrared (IR) imagery.  The vision of the program is to offer the warfighter a small and versatile camera that would be affordable for individual soldiers and provide multiple band imagery with fusion capability to take full advantage of different wavelength-band phenomenology in a compact single unit.  In the future, the availability of the PIXNET camera would enable a peer-to-peer networked system for image sharing within a squad, thereby providing a better common operating picture of the battlefield and significantly enhancing the warfighter's situational understanding.  The program aims to develop a low size, weight and power (SWaP), low cost, soldier-portable multiband infrared camera that will provide real-time single and multiple band imagery using thermal and reflected-illumination bands.  The camera will also provide fused reflective and thermal band imagery on demand.  The use of fused imagery in the PIXNET design will allow the soldier to detect camouflaged targets and distinguish targets from decoys.  The PIXNET camera will eliminate limitations posed by current capability, allowing detection, recognition and identification of targets from a single camera whether in daylight or no-light conditions.

The PIXNET program will focus on a significant reduction in SWaP and cost of infrared sensor components to enable portability and ability to deploy widely to all participants in the theater.  The emphasis on a small form will naturally enable new opportunities such as surveillance with small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), rifle sights with multiple bands, and vehicle-mounted, helmet-mounted and handheld surveillance systems.  The phenomenology of different infrared wavelengths will be exploited.  The combination of a smart phone and PIXNET camera at the soldier level will enable more effective tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP) over the current capability.  The PIXNET program takes advantage of the computing capability of smart phones to process and fuse multicolor images and send them as videos or still images to the warfighter's helmet-mounted display via a wireless or wired connection.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Phased arrays are critical system components for high performance military electronics with widespread applications in communications, electronic warfare and radar.  The DoD relies heavily on phased arrays to maintain technological superiority in nearly every theater of conflict.  The DoD cannot update these high cost specialized arrays at the pace necessary to effectively counter adversarial threats under development using commercial-of-the-shelf components that can undergo technology refresh far more frequently.  The Arrays at Commercial Timescales (ACT) program will develop adaptive and standardized digital-at-every-element arrays.  The hand designed, static analog beamformers will be replaced with cost effective digital array systems capable of a yearly technology refresh.  By doing so, phased arrays will become ubiquitous throughout the DoD, moving onto many platforms for which phased arrays had been previously prohibitively expensive to develop or maintain.  The basic research component of this program is budgeted under PE 0601101E, Project ES-01.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Title>Vanishing Programmable Resources (VAPR)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The Vanishing Programmable Resources (VAPR) program will create microelectronic systems capable of physically disappearing (either in whole or in part) in a controlled, triggerable manner.  The program will develop and establish an initial set of materials and components along with integration and manufacturing capabilities to undergird a fundamentally new class of electronics defined by their performance and transience.  These transient electronics ideally should perform in a manner comparable to Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) systems, but with limited device persistence that can be programmed, adjusted in real-time, triggered, and/or sensitive to the deployment environment.  Applications include sensors for conventional indoor/outdoor environments (buildings, transportation, and materiel), environmental monitoring over large areas, and simplified diagnosis, treatment, and health monitoring in the field.  VAPR will explore transience characteristics of electronic devices and materials as well as build out an initial capability to make transient electronics a deployable technology for the DoD and Nation.  The technological capability developed through VAPR will be demonstrated through a final test vehicle of a transient beacon.  The beacon will serve as an application vehicle showing the manufacturability of the research and process developed in the VAPR program being performed in PE 0601101E, Project TRS-01.  The beacon is meant to be functional on its own, but also a leading indicator of the types of circuits possible under the VAPR program.

To manufacture transient systems at scale will require significant research and development into: higher levels of circuit integration and complexity to realize advanced circuit functionalities; integrated system designs to achieve required function (in modes that offer programmed or triggered transience); integration of novel materials into circuit fabrication processes; and development of new packaging strategies.  The efficacy of the technological capability developed through VAPR will be demonstrated through a final test vehicle of a transient sensor system.  The goal is to develop a suite of design principles, develop strategies and pathways, process flows, tools and basic components that are readily generalizable and can be leveraged towards the development of many other transient electronics devices.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Title>Direct SAMpling Digital ReceivER (DISARMER)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The goal of the Direct SAMpling Digital ReceivER (DISARMER) program is to produce a hybrid photonic-electronic analog-to-digital converter (ADC) capable of coherently sampling the entire X-band (8-12 GigaHertz (GHz)).  Conventional electronic wideband receivers are limited in dynamic range by both the electronic mixer and the back-end digitizers.  By employing an ultra-stable optical clock, the DISARMER program will allow for mixer-less digitization and thereby improve the dynamic range 100x over the state of the art.  Such a wide bandwidth, high fidelity receiver will have applications in electronic warfare and signals intelligence systems while dramatically reducing the cost, size and weight of these systems.

The DISARMER program will develop a low jitter mode-locked laser to be used as the sampling source.  The program will also develop a novel photonic processor chip on a silicon platform capable of hybrid electronic-photonic track-and-hold functionality and coherent photo-detection.

Modern weapons systems are dependent on radio frequency (RF) links for communications, command and control of unmanned vehicles, GPS signals and battle management.  This dependence will only grow with the move to disaggregated systems in the battlefield.  Spectral allocations for these critical RF links confine operations to narrow bands that can be disrupted with commercial hardware. 

To create assured RF links in the congested battlefield, HERMES will study the architectures and develop the technologies to enable links with 10 GHz of instantaneous bandwidth >40 dB of processing gain.  This program will explore the limits of processing gain and the potential for tunable filtering within the band to remove narrow-band jammers. HERMES addresses two technical areas covering electronic and hybrid electronic-photonic solutions.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Title>Fast and Big Mixed-Signal Designs (FAB)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>Developing capabilities to intermix and tightly integrate silicon processes which are currently supported at different scaling nodes and by different vendors is critical to increasing the capabilities of high-performance military microelectronics.  For example, silicon-germanium (SiGe) Bipolar Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (BiCMOS) processes allow CMOS logic to be integrated with radio frequency (RF) heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBTs), which enables mixed-signal circuits having RF analog capabilities tightly coupled to digital processing.  However, the SiGe process flow was developed to integrate to a single CMOS technology node and significant design and engineering effort is required to retarget the flow for a new node.  Thus, BiCMOS processes tend to lag behind commercial CMOS by several generations.  This program will investigate the potential for a truly process-agnostic integration technology that is inclusive of any current or future circuit fabrication technology such as GaAs, GaN and SiGe with a standardized interconnect topology.  Such a technology platform will enable the design of individual circuit IP blocks, such as low-noise amplifiers and analog-to-digital converters, with a goal of re-use of the intellectual property (IP) across applications.  Re-use will allow the DoD to amortize the upfront design cost of these blocks over several designs instead of leveling the burden on a single program.  Furthermore, the IP can be designed in the fabrication process best suited for the performance goals and evolve more quickly than larger, more expensive single chip systems-on-a-chip.  Through standardization of the interface, FAB will enable the DoD to leverage the advancements driven by the global semiconductor market rather than relying on a single on-shore foundry provider or on proprietary circuit designs owned by a handful of traditional prime performers.

In the Applied Research part of this program, focus will be placed on the rapid development and insertion of microsystems utilizing SiGe technology with 14nm Si CMOS.  The development of a SiGe fabrication process integrated with 14 nanometer Silicon CMOS will be explored.

                                    <r2:Title>Direct On-Chip Digital Optical Synthesis (DODOS)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The development of techniques for precise frequency control of RF and microwave radiation in the 1940's revolutionized modern warfare.  Frequency control is the enabling technology for RADAR, satellite and terrestrial communications, and positioning and navigation technology, among many other core DoD capabilities.  By comparison, frequency control at optical frequencies is relatively immature, comparable to the state-of-the-art of microwave control in the 1930's.  The first practical demonstration of optical frequency synthesis, utilizing a self-referenced optical comb, was performed in 1999 and, since that time, the precision and accuracy of optical measurements has improved by four orders of magnitude, including the demonstration of atomic clocks utilizing optical-frequency atomic transitions that far outperform existing technology based on microwave transitions.  To date, however, optical frequency control has been constrained to laboratory experiments due to the large size, relative fragility, and high cost of optical comb-based synthesizers.  Recent developments in self-referenced optical frequency combs in microscale resonators enable the development of a fully-integrated chip-scale optical frequency synthesizer.  Ubiquitous low-cost robust optical frequency synthesis is expected to create a similar disruptive capability in optical technology as microwave frequency synthesis did in the 1940's, enabling high-bandwidth coherent optical communications, coherent synthesized-aperture LiDAR, portable high-accuracy atomic clocks, high-resolution standoff gas/toxin detection, and intrusion detection, among other foreseen applications.

The Direct On-chip Digital Optical Synthesis (DODOS) program will integrate a diverse range of photonic and electronic components to create a microscale, high-accuracy optical frequency synthesizer, in a compact, robust package, suitable for deployment in a wide variety of mission-critical DoD applications.  Significant challenges in the program include the integration of heterogeneous devices and materials that are incompatible with conventional high-volume manufacturing of integrated circuits, optimizing efficient on-chip pump lasers and high-bandwidth detectors, and developing high-precision microwave control electronics with low power consumption.

                                    <r2:Description>The effectiveness of combat operations across all domains increasingly depends on our ability to control, exploit, and deny our adversaries use of the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum.  The future ability to control the spectrum and deliver non-kinetic effects requires the development of advanced electronic components.  HAVOC seeks to strengthen and maintain our dominance of the EM spectrum and overmatch rapidly emerging threats by providing unprecedented electronic attack capabilities by developing a wideband and agile waveform high-power vacuum amplifier.  The size, weight, and power (SWaP) will be consistent with reusable airborne and mobile platforms enabling an increased offset range and the ability to engage multiple targets at the speed of light with minimal collateral damage.  Realization of high power vacuum-electronic amplifier technology will require significant advancements in high current-density, long-life cathodes, wide band interaction circuits, high-power drivers, low-loss RF windows, and advanced power supplies.

                                    <r2:Description>Atomic clock technology provides the high-performance backbone of timing and synchronization for DoD navigation, communications, Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), and Electronic Warfare (EW) systems.  Prior DARPA investment in Chip-Scale Atomic Clock (CSAC) technology has led to recent demonstrations of enhanced DoD capabilities, enabled by the wide availability of atomic-quality timing in portable battery-powered applications.  The Next-Generation Atomic Clock (NGAC) program will develop a next-generation chip-scale atomic clock, with 100X-1000X improvement in key performance parameters, by employing alternative approaches to atomic confinement and interrogation, with particular focus on developing the component technologies necessary to enable low-cost manufacturing and robust deployment in harsh DoD environments.
NGAC will develop chip-scale atomic clocks achieving temperature coefficient of frequency of 10^-15/degrees Celsius and drift &lt; 10^-12/month.  This will enable precise timing on low cost, size, weight, and power (CSWaP) platforms with extended mission duration.  In order to achieve these performance metrics, new enabling technology and interrogation techniques will be integrated into systems and proven to operate on a moving platform.

                                    <r2:Title>Precise Robust Inertial Guidance for Munitions (PRIGM)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The Precise Robust Inertial Guidance for Munitions (PRIGM) program will develop low-Cost, Size, Weight, and Power (CSWaP) inertial sensor technology for GPS-free munitions guidance.  PRIGM comprises two focus areas: 1) Development of a Navigation-Grade Inertial Measurement Unit (NGIMU) that transitions state-of-the-art MEMS to DoD platforms by 2020; and 2) Research and development of Advanced Inertial MEMS Sensors (AIMS) to achieve gun-hard, high-bandwidth, high dynamic range navigation requirements with the objective of complete autonomy in 2030.  PRIGM will advance state-of-the-art MEMS gyros from TRL-3 devices to a TRL-6 transition platform (complete IMU) that enables Service Labs to perform TRL-7 field demonstrations.  PRIGM will exploit recent advances in heterogeneous integration of photonics and CMOS and advanced MEMS technology to realize novel inertial sensors for application in extreme dynamic environments and beyond navigation-grade performance. 

High-dynamics navigation applications, such as smart munitions, require low-CSWaP inertial sensors demonstrating high bandwidth, high precision, and high shock tolerance. Conventional MEMS inertial sensors rely on capacitive sensing to measure position, which suffers from large parasitics, temperature sensitivity, and gas damping from narrow gaps. While various methods have been used to overcome challenges with capacitive readout, optical sensing has demonstrated potential for high sensitivity, low noise, and robust inertial sensing.  Recent advances in heterogeneous integration, on-chip optical waveguides, and quantum-assisted sensing and readout demonstrate potential for optically interrogated MEMS enabled gyros/accelerometers (OMEGA), interferometric and resonant photonic waveguide optical gyros (iWOG/rWOG), and whole angle gyros (WAG) that reach fundamental measurement limits.  Fully integrated opto-MEMS inertial sensors may comprise stiffer mechanical structures that are thus capable of higher shock, vibration, and temperature tolerance along with improved navigation performance.  Advanced research for the program is budgeted in PE 0603739E, Project MT-15.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The DoD has an unfilled need for a persistent, event driven sensing capability, where physical, electromagnetic and other sensors can be pre-placed and remain dormant until awoken by an external trigger or stimulus.  State-of-the-art (SOA) sensors use active electronics to monitor the environment for the external trigger.  The power consumed by these electronic circuits limits the sensor lifetime to durations of weeks to months.  The Near Zero Power RF and Sensor Operations (N-ZERO) program will extend the lifetime of remotely deployed sensors from months to years.  N-ZERO will develop the underlying technologies and demonstrate the capability to continuously and passively monitor the environment and wake-up an electronic circuit upon detection of a specific signature or trigger. Thereafter, sensor lifetime will be limited only by processing and communications of confirmed events or ultimately by the battery self-discharge.

The Near Zero Energy RF and Sensor Operations (N-ZERO) program will replace the power consuming electronic circuits used for processing and detection of information in current systems with passive or extremely low energy devices.  The N-ZERO program will develop RF communications and physical sensor systems that collect, process, and detect the presence of useful information, while rejecting spurious signals and noise, using only the energy in the collected information to perform these functions.  This will eliminate or significantly reduce the standby power consumption from the battery.  By doing so, the N-ZERO program will provide the warfighter with wireless communications and sensors systems with massively reduced size and drastically increased mission life.  The basic research component of this program is budgeted under PE 0601101E, Project ES-01.</r2:Description>

However, the rate of development and level of integration in microwave and mm-wave magnetic components have severely lagged the corresponding advancements and monolithic integration of semiconductor, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), and optical active devices.  In some cases the magnetic technologies have changed little in the past 20 to 30 years.
The Microwaves and Magnetics program will leverage advanced magnetic components leading to disruptive improvements in system performance and novel functionality; and it will drive advances in materials science, materials processing, and in component design, modeling, integration, and fabrication leading to disruptive technologies that will ensure control of the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum.  This targeted program in advanced and integrated RF/microwave magnetic components will enable the improvements needed for the next generation of DoD electronic systems.

                                    <r2:Description>Dominance of the electromagnetic spectrum is a central pillar of modern warfare.  As carrier frequencies of signals continue to increase, our traditional RF systems encounter difficulties with capturing and processing them.  Capturing wide swaths of the spectrum simultaneously using traditional electronic technology is too large and too power hungry for virtually any DoD platform.  Photonic technology has reached a maturity where it can offer a solution by providing low-loss, chip-scale components with the necessary linearity and noise figure that RF systems demand.  MultiPLEX will deliver a chip-scale channelized receiver covering 20 - 50 GHz in 200 MHz-wide channels with 12 effective bits of resolution.  The program will focus on the design and build of a hybrid electronic-photonic system that encompasses the entire receiver, from the low noise amplifier to the analog-to-digital converter.  The program will develop high-Q optical filters and on-chip photonic mixing with high spur free dynamic range.  The fully integrated channelized receiver will impact signals intelligence and electronic warfare systems and demonstrate the feasibility and utility of integrated photonics for RF applications.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Diamond Enhanced Devices (DiamEnD) will further unlock the potential of Gallium Nitride (GaN) High-electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs) in defense electronics by removing the thermal limitation on performance through replacement of the original substrate with high conductivity (optical quality) diamond.  Today, state-of-the-art (SoA) GaN HEMTs used in monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMICs) reside on moderate thermal conductivity Silicon Carbide (SiC) substrates, which thermally limit the linear power density to between 5 W/mm and 7 W/mm, well below the ultimate limits achieved in pulsed power RF experiments.  Through the incorporation of diamond as the substrate and subsequent increase in transistor drain voltage, this linear power density can be boosted to 15-25 W/mm in devices with existing SoA GaN epitaxy layer and as high as 40-60 W/mm with further epitaxial material and transistor development.  These DiamEnD devices can then be used to substantially increase output power or reduce system Size, Weight, and Power (SWAP).  This increased power density will be the heart of future long range RF engagements, either for smaller systems using the increased power density in a small aperture, or by larger systems which will be able to engage at even longer ranges or faster search speeds.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Micro-Technology for Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (Micro-PNT) program is developing low-Cost, Size, Weight, and Power (CSWaP) inertial sensors and timing sources for navigation in GPS degraded environments, primarily focusing on the development of miniature solid state and atomic gyroscopes and clocks.  Both classes of sensors are currently unsuitable for small platform or dismount soldier applications. Micro Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) sensors have limited performance but excellent CSWaP, while atomic sensors are capable of excellent performance but are limited to laboratory experiments due to complexity and high CSWaP.  Micro-PNT is advancing both technology approaches by improving the performance of MEMS inertial sensors and by miniaturizing atomic devices.  Ultimately, low-CSWaP inertial sensors and clocks will enable ubiquitous guidance and navigation on all platforms, including guided munitions, unmanned aerial vehicles (micro-UAVs), and mounted and dismounted soldiers.

The successful realization of Micro-PNT depends on the development of new microfabrication processes and novel material systems for fundamentally different sensing modalities, as well as understanding the error sources at the microscale and the scaling relationships for size reduction of sensors based on atomic physics techniques.  The Micro-PNT program includes research into novel techniques for fabrication and integration of three-dimensional MEMS devices as well as theoretical and experimental studies of new architectures and geometries for MEMS inertial sensing.  Atomic physics research includes the development of new architectures for atomic inertial sensing and investigation of miniature enabling technologies, whose conventional counterparts are currently large, power hungry, and temperature sensitive, limiting high performance sensors to laboratory demonstrations.

                                    <r2:Description>To realize high performance analog, Radio Frequency (RF) and mixed-signal electronics, a next-generation transistor technology with high cutoff frequency and high breakdown voltage is under development.  This technology will enable large voltage swing circuits for military applications that the current state-of-the-art silicon transistor technology cannot support.  The objective of the NEXT program is to develop a revolutionary, wide band gap, nitride transistor technology that simultaneously provides extremely high-speed and high-voltage swing [Johnson Figure of Merit (JFoM) larger than 5 Terahertz (THz)-V] in a process consistent with large scale integration of enhancement/depletion (E/D) mode logic circuits of 1,000 or more transistors.  In addition, this fabrication process will be reproducible, high-yield, high-uniformity, and highly reliable.  The accomplishment of this goal will be validated through the demonstration of specific program Process Control Monitor (PCM) Test Circuits such as 5, 51 and 501-stage ring oscillators in each program phase.  The impact of this next-generation nitride electronic technology will be the speed, linearity, and power efficiency improvement of RF and mixed-signal electronic circuits used in military communications, electronic warfare and sensing.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The goal of the Microscale Plasma Devices (MPD) program is to design, develop, and characterize MPD technologies, circuits, and substrates.  The MPD program will focus on development of fast, small, reliable, high-carrier-density, micro-plasma switches capable of operating in extreme conditions, such as high-radiation and high-temperature environments.  Specific focus will be given to methods that provide efficient generation of ions that can perform robust signal processing of radio frequency (RF) through light electromagnetic energy over a range of gas pressures.  Applications for such devices are far reaching, including the construction of complete high-frequency plasma-based circuits, and microsystems with superior resistance to radiation and extreme temperature environments.  It is envisaged that both two and multi-terminal devices consisting of various architectures will be developed and optimized under the scope of this program.  MPDs will be developed in various circuits and substrates to demonstrate the efficacy of different approaches.  MPD-based microsystems are demonstrated in DoD applications where electronic systems must survive in extreme environments.

The MPD applied research program is focused on transferring the fundamental scientific advances funded by PE 0601101E, Project ES-01 to produce complex circuit designs that may be integrated with commercial electronic devices.  It is expected that the MPD program will result in the design and modeling tools, as well as the fabrication capabilities necessary to commercially manufacture high-performance microscale-plasma-device-based electronic systems for advanced DoD applications.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Title>Micro-coolers for Focal Plane Arrays (MC-FPA)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The Micro-coolers for Focal Plane Arrays (MC-FPA) program will develop low Size, Weight, Power, and Cost (SWaP-C) cryogenic coolers for application in high performance IR cameras.  The sensitivity of an IR focal-plane array (FPA) is improved by cooling its detectors to cryogenic temperatures.  The disadvantages of state-of-the-art Stirling cryo-coolers used for high performance IR FPAs are large size, high power and high cost.  On the other hand, thermoelectric (TE) coolers used in low performance IR cameras are relatively small, but are inefficient, and it is difficult to achieve temperatures below 200 Kelvin (K).  To reduce IR camera SWaP-C, innovations in cooler technology are needed.  This program will exploit the Joule-Thomson (J-T) cooling principle, in a silicon-based MEMS technology, for making IR FPA coolers with very low SWaP-C.  MEMS microfluidics, piezoelectric MEMS, and complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) electronics will be used to demonstrate an integrated cold head and compressor, all in a semiconductor chip.  Since a J-T cooler works by cooling from gas expansion, the coefficient of performance is expected to be much higher than state-of-the-art TE coolers, while being significantly smaller than Stirling coolers.  The chip-scale J-T cooler will be designed for pressure ratios of four or five to one with high compressor frequency in a small volume.  The goal of the MC-FPA program will be to demonstrate cooling down to 150 K.  The chip-scale micro-coolers will cost less and will be significantly smaller than current Stirling coolers.  Once the proof-of-principle is demonstrated, the subsequent program effort will focus on transitioning to chip-scale manufacture on eight to twelve inch wafers, resulting in cooler costs decreasing to as low as $50.  An extended wavelength-range short-wave IR detector will be integrated with a micro-cooler for demonstration of the MC-FPA.  The basic research component of this program is budgeted under PE 0601101E, Project ES-01.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Today's power amplifiers utilize large, bulky, independently designed fixed voltage power supplies that fundamentally limit RF system output power, power efficiency and potential for integration.  The Microscale Power Conversion (MPC) program developed X-band RF transmitters as system-in-package modules, in which integrated circuit power amplifiers were integrated with dynamic, variable voltage power supplies using high-speed power switches.  Such an integrated microsystem supports military applications requiring several hundred Megahertz (MHz) of RF envelope bandwidth at large peak-to-average power ratios.  This integration approach realized RF systems with significantly higher overall power efficiency and waveform diversity by changing from fixed power supply architecture to dynamic power supply architecture.  The program was structured in two technical tracks.  The first track developed high-speed power switch technology to be used in the design of dynamic power supply and modulator circuits.  The second track developed the simultaneous co-design and integration of the RF power amplifier and dynamic power supply circuits to achieve maximum overall power efficiency for the desired waveforms of interest.  The program enabled increased deployment of MPC RF transmitter systems on DoD platforms due to their more compact size, high efficiency, lower lifecycle cost and enhanced RF performance enabling, for example, significantly communications rates.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Based upon current scaling trends, microprocessor performance is projected to fall far short of future military needs.  Microprocessor performance is saturating and leading to reduced computational efficiency because of the limitations of electrical communications.  The POEM program demonstrated chip-scale, silicon-photonic technologies that can be integrated within embedded microprocessors for seamless, energy-efficient, high-capacity communications within and between the processor chip and dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chip.  This technology propelled microprocessors onto a higher performance trajectory by overcoming this "memory wall".</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The goal of the Tactically Exploited Reconnaissance Node (TERN) program, a joint effort with the Office of Naval Research, is to develop a systems approach for, and perform technical demonstration of, a Medium-Altitude, Long-Endurance Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (MALE UAV) capability from smaller ships.  The program will demonstrate the technology for launch and recovery of large unmanned aircraft capable of providing persistent 24/7 Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) and strike capabilities at long radius orbits.  By extending the ISR/strike radius and simultaneously increasing time on station beyond current capabilities from smaller ships, TERN will enable novel operational concepts including maritime surveillance and responsive, persistent deep overland ISR and strike, without requirement for forward basing.  To achieve these goals, the program will create new concepts for aircraft launch and recovery, aircraft logistics and maintenance, and aircraft flight in regimes associated with maritime operating conditions.  The program will culminate in a launch and recovery demonstration.  Application of TERN technologies and operational concepts will enable a novel and cost efficient approach for multiple mission sets.  The transition partner is the Navy.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The goal of the Collaborative Operations in Denied Environment (CODE) program is to enhance mission performance, reduce cost, confound adversaries, and reduce reliance on space assets for navigation and communication by distributing mission functions such as sensing, communication, precision navigation, kinetic, and non-kinetic effects to small platforms and increasing their level of autonomy.  Collaboration of multiple assets offers new possibilities to conduct military missions using smaller air platforms to enhance survivability, reduce overall acquisition cost, create new effects, increase communications range and robustness in denied environments, increase search area, increase areas held at risk, reduce target prosecution reaction time, and provide multi-mission capabilities by combinations of assets.  This effort will specifically focus on developing and demonstrating approaches that will expand the mission capabilities of legacy air assets though autonomy and collaborative behaviors, within a standard based open architecture.  Potential transition partners include the Air Force, Army, and Navy.</r2:Description>

HAWC will pursue flight demonstration of the critical technologies for an effective and affordable air-launched hypersonic cruise missile.  These technologies include advanced air vehicle configurations capable of efficient hypersonic flight, hydrocarbon scramjet-powered propulsion to enable sustained hypersonic cruise, thermal management approaches designed for high-temperature cruise, and affordable system designs and manufacturing approaches.  HAWC technologies also extend to reusable hypersonic air platforms for applications such as global presence and space lift.  The HAWC program will leverage advances made by the previously funded Falcon, X-51, and HyFly programs.  This is a joint program with the Air Force, and HAWC technologies are planned for transition to the Air Force after flight testing is complete.</r2:Description>

The program will also consider traceability to, and ideally compatibility, with the Navy Vertical Launch System (VLS).  The metrics associated with this objective include total range, time of flight, payload, accuracy, and impact velocity.  The program will address the system and technology issues required to enable development of a hypersonic boost glide system considering (1) vehicle concepts possessing the required aerodynamic and aero-thermal performance, controllability and robustness for a wide operational envelope, (2) the system attributes and subsystems required to be effective in relevant operational environments, and (3) approaches to reducing cost and improving affordability for both the demonstration system and future operational systems.

The Aerial Reconfigurable Embedded System (ARES) program will develop a vertical take-off and landing (VTOL), modular unmanned air vehicle that can carry a 3,000 lb useful load at a range of 250 nautical miles on a single tank of fuel.  ARES will enable distributed operations and access to compact, high altitude landing zones to reduce warfighter exposure to hostile threats and bypass ground obstructions.  ARES  modular capability allows for mission modules to be quickly interchanged and deployed at the company level.  This enables the flexible employment of many different capabilities including: cargo resupply, casualty evacuation, reconnaissance, weapons platforms, and other types of operations.  ARES vehicles could be dispatched to resupply isolated small units.  ARES is well suited for enhanced company operations concepts that would provide the warfighter/team increased situational awareness for operations in an urban environment.  The enabling technologies of interest being developed under the ARES program include vertical and translational flight, conversion between powered lift and wing borne lift, ducted fan propulsion systems, lightweight materials, tailless configuration, modularity, and advanced flight controls for stable transition from vertical to horizontal flight.  Additionally, the program will explore opportunities for the design, development, and integration of new, key technologies and capabilities.  These include adaptable landing gear concepts to enable operations from irregular landing zones and moving launch/recovery platforms, and autonomous take off and landing.  The anticipated transition partners for this effort are the Army, Marine Corps, and Special Operations Forces.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Title>Technology for Enriching and Augmenting Manned - Unmanned Systems</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The Technology for Enriching and Augmenting Manned - Aircraft (TEAM-US) project seeks to increase lethality, survivability, payload, and reach of combat aircraft by: (i) teaming them (wingmen) with advanced Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), and (ii) enabling swarming employment and operations of manned and unmanned airborne systems.  The synergy between the mission tailored UAV wingmen and the less survivable, but decision making manned platforms will provide access to contested airspace and enhance force projection.  UAV wingmen will reduce air dominance lifecycle costs by dramatically reducing training costs.  Legacy manned platforms will train with virtual unmanned teammates saving operations, maintenance, and logistics costs associated with manned wingmen.  Unmanned wingmen can be developed for a wide variety of missions including penetrating intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), electronic attack (EA), and weapons delivery. Mixed operations of manned and unmanned systems in a swarming configuration can be developed to support missions against networked-integrated air defenses and to support operations in highly contested environments.  A common core will enable reduced development and integration costs.  Finally, leveraging existing platforms for command, control, and battle management recapitalizes existing investments, making these 4th and 5th generation platforms viable participants in future anti-access, area denial scenarios where they may have limited survivability.  Balancing in situ battle management with highly capable, mission specific unmanned teammates will offset new threat technologies, enabling more cost effective mission execution, and increasing the survivability of the manned platform team leader.</r2:Description>

The program will build and flight test an unmanned 10,000 - 12,000 lb aircraft capable of sustained speeds in excess of 300 kt, demonstrate system level hover efficiency within 25 percent of the ideal, and a lift-to-drag ratio no less than ten.  Additionally, the demonstrator will be designed to have a useful load of no less than 40 percent of the gross weight.  A strong emphasis will be placed on the development of elegant, multi-functional subsystem technologies that demonstrate net improvements in aircraft efficiencies to enable new and vastly improved operational capabilities.  Technologies developed under this program will be made available to all Services for application to future air systems development.

                                    <r2:Description>The Persistent Close Air Support (PCAS) program will significantly increase close air support (CAS) capabilities by developing a system to allow continuous CAS availability and lethality to the supported ground commander.  The enabling technologies are: manned/unmanned attack platforms, next generation graphical user interfaces, data links, digital guidance and control, and advanced munitions.  PCAS will demonstrate the ability to digitally task a CAS platform from the ground to attack multiple/simultaneous targets.  PCAS will allow the Joint Tactical Air Controller (JTAC) the ability to rapidly engage multiple moving targets simultaneously within the area of operation.  PCAS's ability to digitally task a CAS platform to attack multiple/simultaneous targets would improve U.S. ground forces operations and speed of attack.  The system will be designed to reduce collateral damage and potential fratricide to friendly forces.  The anticipated transition partners are the Air Force, Special Operations Command, and the United States Marine Corps.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Title>Distributed Fires (DFires)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The goal of the Distributed Fires (DFires) program is to create a capability which would allow for precision fires from extended ranges (>500 km) to be rapidly accessed by lower echelon units.  The DFires system would be a stand-alone system that would be transported by light trucks, rotorcraft, or small boats and delivered to supporting locations on the battlefield.  Small units would use tactical radios to call for support fire which would greatly shorten the time required to receive artillery fire or to call in close air support.  The modular base unit would provide the communications link and pass along targeting commands to the onboard stores.  The onboard stores would consist of multiple tube launched munitions.  As envisioned, different stores could be developed that would enable the small unit to rapidly access different capabilities.  For example, in a direct fire mission, target information would be fed to a fast missile which would engage the target at that location.  Alternatively, an Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) request could be quickly accomplished by launching a loitering munition which would rapidly fly to the requested area and loiter while feeding ISR data to the warfighters.  A loitering attack munition could also be called which would loiter in an area while searching for a target or waiting for final targeting commands.  Technology areas to be developed include the overall system architecture, the communications requirements and protocols, and specific stores.</r2:Description>

The Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM) program invested in advanced component and integrated system technologies capable of providing a dramatic leap ahead in U.S. surface warfare capability focusing on organic wide area target discrimination in a network denied environment, innovative terminal survivability in the face of advanced defensive systems, and high assurance target lethality approaches.  Specific technology development areas included: robust precision guidance, navigation and control with GPS denial, multi-modal sensors for high probability target identification in dense shipping environments, and precision aimpoint targeting for maximum lethality.  Component technologies were developed, demonstrated, and integrated into a complete weapon system.  The program resulted in a high fidelity demonstration to support military utility assessment.  LRASM is a joint DARPA/Navy effort that has transitioned to a program of record.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Next Generation Air Dominance study defined the projected threat domains and capability gaps for the 2020-2050 timeframe.  DARPA conducted a study of current air dominance efforts in coordination with the United States Air Force and Navy and explored potential technology developmental areas to ensure the air superiority of the United States in the future.  The study considered roles of manned and unmanned platforms; the relative performance of alternative integrated systems concepts that combine various mixes of capabilities networked together; and the cost effectiveness of alternative balances of platforms and systems that provide surveillance, command and control, electronic warfare, and weapons functions.  Innovative concepts for platform, propulsion, sensors, weapons integration, avionics, and active and passive survivability features were explored as part of the concept definition effort.  This effort explored the expanded development and use of automated and advanced aerospace engineering design tools, modeling, and simulation in areas that can increase the likelihood of producing more capable products with improved efficiency.  Following the initial multi-agency study, DARPA presented technical challenges to industry to allow them to explore and present potential solutions as part of the technical feasibility and system integration studies.  Enabling technologies are advanced networking capabilities, reliable navigation, passive and active defense, electronic attack, area denial, advanced sensors, and cyber technologies.  After the study, it is envisioned that high-potential prototype programs will emerge to develop technologies for future air dominance.  Early planning for future technologies will also help to define the funding baselines for DoD research and development and acquisition programs.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Space Programs and Technology program element is budgeted in the Advanced Technology Development budget activity because it addresses high payoff opportunities to dramatically reduce costs associated with advanced space systems and provides revolutionary new system capabilities for satisfying current and projected military missions.

A space force structure that is robust against attack represents a stabilizing deterrent against adversary attacks on space assets.  The keys to a secure space environment are situational awareness to detect and characterize potential threats, a proliferation of assets to provide robustness against attack, ready access to space, and a flexible infrastructure for maintaining the capabilities of on-orbit assets.  Ready access to space requires the delivery of capabilities, replenishment of supplies into orbit, and rapid manufacturing of affordable space capabilities.  Developing space access and spacecraft servicing technologies will lead to reduced ownership costs of space systems and new opportunities for introducing technologies for the exploitation of space.

Systems development is also required to increase the interactivity of space systems, space-derived information and services with terrestrial users. Studies under this project include technologies and systems that will enable satellites and microsatellites to operate more effectively by increasing maneuverability, survivability, and situational awareness; enabling concepts include novel propulsion/propellants, unique manufacturing or assembly processes; precision control of multi-payload systems, and payload isolation and pointing systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Title>Airborne Launch Assist Space Access (ALASA)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The ALASA program has four major goals.  The first of these is to make access to space more affordable by reducing the cost per launch to under one million dollars per flight.  ALASA accomplishes this by using a simple design, with minimal infrastructure, touch labor, and range support. Secondly, the program seeks to improve the responsiveness of space access by reducing the interval from call-up to launch to a single day.  This enables rapid delivery of spacecraft in response to evolving situations, such as a humanitarian crisis or unexpected conflict, and is accomplished by developing rapid mission planning tools which streamline existing range processes, and automated flight safety systems which reduce reliance on expensive and fragile range infrastructure.  These tools enable the program's third goal: to escape the limitations of fixed launch sites by achieving a greater flexibility in the direction and location of launch.  Finally, ALASA will demonstrate the ability to move its operations from one airfield to another in twelve hours to show resilience in the presence of the initial operating airfield being unavailable, even from factors as relatively innocuous as the weather.  The system uses the Air Force's F-15 fleet, getting as much energy as possible from the reusable part of the system, but without costly modifications to the aircraft.  Challenges include, but are not limited to: in-air separation of aircraft and orbit-insertion launch stages, development of alternatives to current range processes, and achieving a cost per flight of one million dollars, including range support costs, to deploy satellites on the order of one hundred pounds.  The anticipated transition partner is the Air Force.</r2:Description>

Past efforts have identified and demonstrated critical enabling technologies including composite or light weight structures, propellant tanks, thermal protection systems, rocket propulsion and advanced avionics/software.  A critically important technology gap is integration into a flight demonstration able to deliver aircraft-like operability.  The program will validate key technologies on the ground, and then fabricate an X-Plane to demonstrate: 1) 10 flights in 10 days,  2) Mach 10+ flight, and 3) 10X lower cost space access for cargoes from 3,000-5,000 lbs to low earth orbit.

                                    <r2:Description>To date, servicing operations have never been conducted on spacecraft beyond low earth orbit (LEO).  A large number of national security and commercial space systems operate at geosynchronous earth orbit (GEO) altitudes; furthermore, many end-of-life or failed spacecraft drift without control through portions of the GEO belt, creating a growing hazard to operational spacecraft.  Technologies for servicing of spacecraft with the expectation that such servicing would involve a mix of highly autonomous and remotely (i.e., ground-based) tele-operated robotic systems have been previously pursued.  The Phoenix servicing program will build upon these legacy technologies, tackling the more complex GEO environment and expanding beyond pure traditional servicing functions.  The program seeks to validate robotics operations in GEO suitable for a variety of potential servicing tasks, in full collaboration and cooperation with existing satellite owners.  The program will examine utilization of a new commercial ride-along capability to GEO called Payload Orbital Delivery (POD) to support hardware delivery for upgrading, repairing, assembling, and reconfiguring satellites.  The program will include an early LEO flight experiment focused on satlets as a path of risk reduction for modular assembly on orbit.  Key challenges include robotic tool/end effector requirements, efficient orbital maneuvering of a servicing vehicle, robotic arm systems, and integration and efficient and low cost transportation of robotic tools. The anticipated transition partners are the Air Force and the commercial spacecraft servicing providers.  Beginning in FY 2015, the GEO robotics portion of this effort will be funded under the Robotic Servicing of Geostationary Satellites program within this Project.</r2:Description>

Key challenges include; developing automated robot reflexes for safety of operations, robotic tools, efficient orbital maneuvering of the servicing vehicle, robotic arm systems, and mission simulation and validation.

                                    <r2:Title>Space Surveillance Telescope (SST)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The Space Surveillance Telescope (SST) program has developed and demonstrated an advanced ground-based optical system to enable detection and tracking of faint objects in space, while providing rapid, wide-area search capability.  A major goal of the SST program, to develop the technology for large curved focal surface array sensors to enable an innovative telescope design combining high detection sensitivity, short focal length, wide field of view, and rapid step-and-settle to provide orders of magnitude improvements in space surveillance has been achieved. This capability enables ground-based detection of un-cued objects in deep space for purposes such as asteroid detection and space defense missions.  The initial program is transitioning to Air Force Space Command.

The SST Australia effort will provide a further operational demonstration of the SST at the Naval Communication Station Harold E. Holt near Exmouth, Western Australia.  Such a location presents a more operationally relevant demonstration, with a richer and more interesting population of SSA targets in geosynchronous orbit.  A demonstration in Australia will investigate telescope performance and observe objects and orbits not visible from the current site in New Mexico.  In addition, the demonstration will generate data for analysis and fusion efforts, which will be used to further refine and evaluate data processing techniques, such as those developed under the data fusion effort.  This program will address technical challenges which may arise from an Australian site, including adaptations to a different telescope environment, and the logistical and communications challenges presented by a site significantly more remote than the current SST location.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Title>Space Domain Awareness (SDA)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The goal of the Space Domain Awareness (SDA) program is to develop and demonstrate an operational framework and responsive defense application to enhance the availability of vulnerable space-based resources.  Current space surveillance sensors cannot detect, track, or determine the future location and threat potential of small advanced technology spacecraft in deep space orbits, where a majority of DoD spacecraft are located. Additionally, servicing missions to geosynchronous (GEO) orbits will require exquisite situational awareness, from ultra-high-accuracy debris tracking for mission assurance at GEO orbits to high resolution imaging of GEO spacecraft for service mission planning.  The SDA program will develop a space management system that allows cognitive reasoning and decision support to execute space operations with current and proposed assets within real and synthetic environments.

SDA will investigate revolutionary technologies in two areas: 1) advanced space surveillance sensors to better detect, track, and characterize space objects, with an emphasis on deep space objects, and 2) space surveillance data collection, data archival, and data processing/fusion to provide automated data synergy.  The resulting increase in space domain awareness will enhance overall space safety of flight, and allow space operators to make informed, timely decisions.  The SDA program will leverage data fusion and advanced algorithms developed under the Space Surveillance Telescope (SST) program, as well as seek to exploit new ground-breaking technologies across the electromagnetic spectrum and utilize already existing sensor technology in nontraditional or exotic ways, to bring advanced capabilities to the space domain.  SDA will correlate a wide range of operational support and space system user data to rapidly identify threat activities, propose mitigating countermeasures, and verify the effectiveness of selected responses.  Critical technologies include accessing disparate sources of relevant data in a common scalable database, model-based situational awareness, and candidate response generation and evaluation.  Particular emphasis will be placed on the ability to continuously adapt to changes in defended system components and usage patterns as well as validation of system integrity.  SDA will demonstrate new approaches to collection of data utilizing a variety of collection modalities, ranging from fusion of observations from non-traditional sources, such as amateur astronomers, to evaluation of sparse aperture imaging techniques.

Also funded within this program is the Galileo effort, which will develop technology to image a Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO) satellite from the ground.  Galileo will utilize fixed mobile telescopes, each with adaptive optics and a guide star, to create multiple baselines that can be used to reconstruct the image through an inverse Fourier transform.  The potential transition customer is the Air Force.</r2:Description>

Modular construction in space is intrinsically more challenging than ground-based assembly in that there is not necessarily any measurement and support infrastructure and equipment available, such as interferometer test towers.  Therefore, the modular pieces and system design must include self-contained measurement and alignment capabilities to be employed after or during assembly.  The OASIS program will demonstrate the feasibility of assembling complex and highly precise structures in space which, in assembled form, are larger than the capacity of any existing or planned space launch vehicle.  This capability could enable a number of surveillance and communications instruments in orbit that are not possible today or in the near future under the current paradigm.  The anticipated transition partners are the Air Force, Navy and commercial sector.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The System F6 program sought to demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of satellite architecture technologies which facilitate a fractionated architecture wherein the functionality of a traditional "monolithic" spacecraft is replaced by a cluster of wirelessly-interconnected spacecraft modules.  Each such "fractionated" module could contribute a unique capability, for example, computation and data handling, communications relay, guidance and navigation, payload sensing, or it would replicate the capability of another module.  The cluster would deliver a comparable mission capability to a monolithic spacecraft.  The fractionated modules would fly in a loose, proximate cluster orbit capable of semi-autonomous reconfiguration or a rapid defensive scatter/re-gather maneuver.  The program developed key technologies to facilitate fractionated and disaggregated architectures. The F6 Technology Package (F6TP), a suite of technologies, components, and algorithms that enables semi-autonomous multi-body cluster flight and secure, distributed, real-time sharing of various spacecraft resources at the cluster level was also developed.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Advanced Electronics Technologies program element is budgeted in the Advanced Technology Development Budget Activity because it seeks to design and demonstrate state-of-the-art manufacturing and processing technologies for the production of various electronics and microelectronic devices, sensor systems, actuators and gear drives that have military applications and potential commercial utility.  Introduction of advanced product design capability and flexible, scalable manufacturing techniques will enable the commercial sector to rapidly and cost-effectively satisfy military requirements.

The MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS) and Integrated Microsystems Technology project is a broad, cross-disciplinary initiative to merge computation and power generation with sensing and actuation to realize a new technology for both perceiving and controlling weapons systems and battlefield environments.  MEMS applies the advantages of miniaturization, multiple components and integrated microelectronics to the design and construction of integrated electromechanical and electro-chemical-mechanical systems to address issues ranging from the scaling of devices and physical forces to new organization and control strategies for distributed, high-density arrays of sensor and actuator elements.  The project will also address thermal management, navigation and positioning technology challenges.

The Mixed Technology Integration project funds advanced development and demonstrations of selected basic and applied electronics research programs.  Examples of activities funded in this project include, but are not limited to:  (1) component programs that integrate mixed signal (analog and digital; photonic and electronic) or mixed substrate (Gallium Nitride, Gallium Arsenide, Indium Phosphide, or Silicon Germanium with CMOS) technology that will substantially improve the capability of existing components and/or reduce size, weight and power requirements to a level compatible with future warfighter requirements; (2) development and demonstration of brassboard system applications in such areas as laser weaponry or precision navigation and timing to address mid-term battlefield enhancements; and (3) novel technological combinations (i.e. photonics, magnetics, frequency attenuators) that could yield substantial improvement over current systems.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS) and Integrated Microsystems Technology program is a broad, cross-disciplinary initiative to merge computation and power generation with sensing and actuation to realize a new technology for both perceiving and controlling weapons systems and battlefield environments.  Using fabrication processes and materials similar to those used to make microelectronic devices, MEMS applies the advantages of miniaturization, multiple components and integrated microelectronics to the design and construction of integrated electromechanical and electro-chemical-mechanical systems.  The MEMS program addresses issues ranging from the scaling of devices and physical forces to new organization and control strategies for distributed, high-density arrays of sensor and actuator elements.  These issues include microscale power and actuation systems as well as microscale components that survive harsh environments.  Thermal management technologies will develop heat resistant thermal layers to provide efficient operation for cooling electronic devices.  The current focus in micro technologies is to improve navigation, position and timing capabilities for uncompromised navigation and positioning in today's dynamic military field of operations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>The Micro-Technology for Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (Micro-PNT) program is developing low-Cost, Size, Weight, and Power (CSWaP) inertial sensors and timing sources for navigation in GPS degraded environments, primarily focusing on the development of miniature solid state and atomic gyroscopes and clocks.  Both classes of sensors are currently unsuitable for small platform or dismount soldier applications.   Micro Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) sensors have limited performance but excellent CSWaP, while atomic sensors are capable of excellent performance but are limited to laboratory experiments due to complexity and high CSWaP.  Micro-PNT is advancing both technology approaches by improving the performance of MEMS inertial sensors and by miniaturizing atomic devices.  Ultimately, low-CSWaP inertial sensors and clocks will enable ubiquitous guidance and navigation on all platforms, including guided munitions, unmanned aerial vehicles (micro-UAVs), and mounted and dismounted soldiers.  Successful realization of Micro-PNT requires the development of new microfabrication processes and novel material systems for fundamentally different sensing modalities, understanding of the error sources at the micro-scale, and development of miniature inertial sensors based on atomic physics.  Innovative microfabrication techniques under development will allow co-fabrication of dissimilar devices on a single chip, such that clocks, gyroscopes, accelerometers, and calibration stages can be integrated into a small, low power architecture.  The program is developing miniature inertial sensors based on atomic interferometry and nuclear magnetic resonance.  Ancillary research efforts for this program are funded within PE 0602716E, Project ELT-01.</r2:Description>

During a blast event, the Blast Gauge device captures environmental data and available operational information in order to develop a 3D recreation of the event.  The BEAST program provided additional tools for the military community, conducted cognitive testing in high risk service members, and expanded the current knowledge base of the impact of blast exposure by correlating physiological and behavioral changes with direct measures of blast-exposure.  Ultimately, these results contributed to the TBI and PTSD knowledge base for improved treatment, developed enhanced understanding of blast events to mitigate exposure and improved training procedures, and aided in completing the transition of the Blast Gauge device to military service sustainment.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Title>Diverse &amp; Accessible Heterogeneous Integration (DAHI)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>Prior DARPA efforts have demonstrated the ability to monolithically integrate different semiconductor types to achieve near-ideal "mix-and-match" capability for DoD circuit designers.  Specifically, one such program was the Compound Semiconductor Materials On Silicon (COSMOS) program, in which transistors of Indium Phosphide (InP) could be freely mixed with silicon complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) circuits to obtain the benefits of both technologies (very high speed and very high circuit complexity/density, respectively).  The Diverse &amp; Accessible Heterogeneous Integration (DAHI) effort will take this capability to the next level, ultimately offering the seamless co-integration of a variety of semiconductor devices (for example, Gallium Nitride (GaN), InP, Gallium Arsenide, Antimonide Based Compound Semiconductors), microelectromechanical (MEMS) sensors and actuators, photonic devices (e.g., lasers, photo-detectors) and thermal management structures.  This capability will revolutionize our ability to build true "systems on a chip" (SoC) and allow dramatic size, weight and volume reductions for a wide array of system applications.

This program has basic research efforts funded in PE 0601101E, Project ES-01 and applied research efforts funded in PE 0602716E, Project ELT-01.  The Advanced Technology Development part of this program will leverage these complementary efforts to focus on the establishment of an accessible, manufacturable technology for device-level heterogeneous integration of a wide array of materials and devices (including, for example, multiple electronics and MEMS technologies) with complex silicon-enabled (e.g. CMOS) architectures on a common silicon substrate platform.  This part of the program is expected to culminate in accessible foundry processes of DAHI technology and demonstrations of advanced microsystems with innovative architectures and designs that leverage heterogeneous integration.  By the end of the program, this effort seeks to establish a technologically mature, sustainable DAHI foundry service to be made available (with appropriate computer-aided design support) to a wide variety of DoD laboratory, Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC), academic and industrial designers.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The goal of the FLASH program is to demonstrate a transportable, packaged laser system whose output is derived from coherently combining the outputs of an array of ultra-lightweight, flight-worthy high power fiber lasers.  The packaged FLASH laser system will project a >30-kW-class beam with near perfect beam quality and very high electrical-to-optical efficiency.  The size, weight, and power (SWaP) will be consistent with weight and volume densities needed to support the integration of laser weapons on a broad range of Military platforms.  To accomplish these ends, FLASH will (1) greatly reduce the overall size and weight of packaged coherently-combinable high-power fiber laser amplifiers while greatly simplifying the demands they make on support systems such as cabling, cooling lines and support structures while increasing their efficiency and resistance to shock, vibration and acoustics and (2) fabricate an array of these ultralight fiber-laser amplifiers and integrate them with advanced battery power, thermal management and coherent-beam combination sub-systems into a transportable, fully packaged laser system.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Title>Direct SAMpling Digital ReceivER (DISARMER)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The goal of the Direct SAMpling Digital ReceivER (DISARMER) program is to produce a hybrid photonic-electronic analog-to-digital converter (ADC) capable of coherently sampling the entire X-band (8-12 GigaHertz (GHz)).  Conventional electronic wideband receivers are limited in dynamic range by both the electronic mixer and the back-end digitizers.  By employing an ultra-stable optical clock, the DISARMER program will allow for mixer-less digitization and thereby improve the dynamic range 100x over the state of the art.  Such a wide-bandwidth, high-fidelity receiver will have applications in electronic warfare and signals intelligence systems with the potential to drastically reduce the cost, size and weight of these systems.

The DISARMER program will design, fabricate, and test a hybrid photonic-electronic ADC packaged in a standard form factor.  This involves the integration of electronic and photonic circuits, packaging of a mode-locked laser with ultralow jitter, and delivering a field programmable gate array with the necessary firmware to process the sampled data.

                                    <r2:Description>The rapid pace of wireless technology development has created a commercial technology base with accessible components that span the radio spectrum up to 100 GHz.  When faced with agile or unknown threats across decades of bandwidth, conventional radio frequency (RF) systems perform poorly.  Massively channelized receivers spanning just tens of GHz also have unacceptable size and power envelopes for very large defense platforms.  Recent developments in integrated photonics have demonstrated the potential to channelize, filter and down-convert RF signals in the photonic domain with significantly improved performance and greatly reduced size.  The Photonic Radio program will build on this foundation to deliver a chip-scale photonic channelized receiver spanning 20 to 50 GHz in 200 MHz-wide channels.  The program will design and build a complete and compact solution with intimate integration of electronics with high performance photonic devices, such as very high Q filters and on-chip high-power lasers.  The program will also package the prototype system and conduct field tests for insertion into advanced weapons systems.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Title>Fast and Big Mixed-Signal Designs (FAB)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>Developing capabilities to intermix and tightly integrate silicon processes which are currently supported at different scaling nodes and by different vendors is critical to increasing the capabilities of high-performance military microelectronics.  For example, Silicon-Germanium (SiGe) Bipolar Complementary Metal-oxide Semiconductor (BiCMOS) processes allow CMOS logic to be integrated with radio frequency (RF) heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBTs), which enables mixed-signal circuits having RF analog capabilities tightly coupled to digital processing.  However, the SiGe process flow was developed to integrate to a single CMOS technology node and significant design and engineering effort is required to retarget the flow for a new node.  Thus, BiCMOS processes tend to lag behind commercial CMOS by several generations.  This program will investigate the potential for a truly process-agnostic integration technology, i.e. one that is inclusive of any current or future circuit fabrication technology such as Gallium Arsenide (GaAs), Gallium Nitride (GaN) and SiGe with a standardized interconnect topology.  Such a technology platform will enable the design of individual circuit Intellectual Property (IP) blocks, such as low-noise amplifiers and analog-to-digital converters, with a goal of re-use of the IP across applications.  Re-use will allow the DoD to amortize the upfront design cost of these blocks over several designs instead of leveling the burden on a single program.  Furthermore, the IP can be designed in the fabrication process best suited for the performance goals and evolve more quickly than larger, more expensive single chip systems-on-a-chip.  Through standardization of the interface, FAB will enable the DoD to leverage the advancements driven by the global semiconductor market rather than relying on a single on-shore foundry provider or on proprietary circuit designs owned by a handful of traditional prime performers.

In the Advanced Technology Development part of this program, focus will be placed on the development of rapid development and insertion of microsystems utilizing III-V semiconductors and other microelectronic technologies with advanced Si CMOS.

                                    <r2:Title>Precise Robust Inertial Guidance for Munitions (PRIGM)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The Precise Robust Inertial Guidance for Munitions (PRIGM) program will develop low-Cost, Size, Weight, and Power (CSWaP) inertial sensor technology for GPS-free munitions guidance.  PRIGM comprises two focus areas: 1) Development of a Navigation-Grade Inertial Measurement Unit (NGIMU) that transitions state-of-the-art MEMS to DoD platforms by 2020; and 2) Research and development of Advanced Inertial MEMS Sensors (AIMS) to achieve gun-hard, high-bandwidth, high dynamic range navigation requirements with the objective of complete autonomy in 2030. 

At present, DoD suffers a trade-space dichotomy between low-CSWaP tactical-grade IMUs, based on MEMS inertial sensors, and relatively high-CSWaP navigation-grade IMUs, based on ring-laser or interferometric fiber-optic gyroscopes (RLG/iFOG). RLG/iFOG is the technology of choice for high-value platforms.  However, for the vast majority of platforms (munitions, dismounts, UAVs), CSWaP necessitates the use of lower-performance MEMS-based IMUs.  Under the micro-PNT program, DARPA has developed MEMS gyroscopes with performance rivaling that of navigation-grade interferometric fiber optic gyros (IFOGs), thus exposing a new tradespace for low-CSWaP navigation grade IMUs.  The PRIGM program will advance the technology readiness level (TRL) of state-of-the-art  MEMS inertial sensors from TRL-3 to TRL-6.  The ultimate goal of the program is to develop a complete MEMS-based navigation-grade IMU with an identical mechanical/electronic interface to existing DoD-standard tactical-grade MEMS IMUs, thereby providing a drop-in replacement for existing DoD systems and rapid transition to TRL-7.

                                    <r2:Description>Passive magnetic components such as frequency selective limiters (FSL), isolators, circulators, phase shifters and filters are integral to numerous military electronic systems in applications including radar, imaging, communications, and electronic warfare.  However, the rate of development and level of integration in microwave and mm-wave magnetic components have severely lagged the corresponding advancements and monolithic integration of semiconductor, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), and optical active devices.  In some cases the magnetic technologies have changed little in the past 20 to 30 years.  The Microwaves and Magnetics program will leverage advanced magnetic components leading to disruptive improvements in system performance and novel functionality.

A particularly attractive magnetic component for front-end receivers is FSL. An FSL is a device that automatically attenuates high power signals above a certain threshold while allowing low power signals at different frequencies to pass.  Use of FSLs will enable receivers to operate in the presence of strong interferers providing wideband protection, enable operation in congested RF environments, and increase effective dynamic range.  Corresponding advances in other magnetic components and technologies will dramatically improve the performance, and increase the integration level of transmitters and receivers for Department of Defense (DoD) applications.

                                    <r2:Description>The Low Cost Thermal Imager - Manufacturing (LCTI-M) effort built upon previous manufacturing and imaging work and developed a pocket-sized and smartphone-integrated, manufacturable, and practical thermal imager at a price point that allows it to be provided to large numbers of warfighters.  Availability of very low cost and small form-factor infrared (IR) cameras facilitates new techniques and applications that could provide the decisive edge needed in modern battlefields.  These cameras allow a soldier to have practical thermal imaging capability for locating warm objects (e.g., enemy combatants) in darkness.  The small size, weight and power (SWaP) thermal camera can be integrated with a handheld device such as a cell phone with network capability for tactical intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance.  The imager chips were fully integrated with a low-cost processor and optics.  The camera has wireless connectivity to integrate video display with cell phones or PDAs.  U.S. Army PEO Soldier Sensors and Lasers (SSL), PM Optics USMC, USSOCOM and industry are the transition partners.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Command, Control and Communications Systems program element is budgeted in the Advanced Technology Development Budget Activity because its purpose is to demonstrate and evaluate advanced information systems research and development concepts.

The goal of the Information Integration Systems project is to develop and demonstrate technologies that will provide effective communications to U.S. forces.  The success of military operations depends on timely, reliable, secure, and synchronized dissemination of command and control and relevant situational awareness information to every military echelon.  While wired communications and networks are fairly well developed, providing assured high-bandwidth mobile wireless capabilities that match or exceed commercial wired infrastructure is needed to meet the demands of military users.  Approaches to this goal include developing technologies in these areas:
-  High-Capacity Links technologies - enables greater back-haul capability.
-  Advanced Networking technologies - supports resilience, adaptability, and scalability.
-  Low Probability of Detection and Anti-Jam (LPD/AJ) technologies - provides assured communications in a very high-threat environments.
-  Novel Radio Frequency and Spectral Sensing (RF/SS) - supports efficient spectrum management in congested environments and detection of electromagnetic threats.

The Secure Information and Network Systems project will develop and demonstrate computer and network technologies and systems suitable for use in military networks, U.S. government enterprise networks, critical infrastructure, and embedded computing systems.  The project will develop, integrate, and test technologies for re-using software components.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>The proliferation of video, voice, chat, and other important data-streams on the battlefield is driving a need for higher capacity, reliable, assured, and all-weather communications that are deployable on a wide range of air, ground, and maritime platforms.  The goal of this High-Capacity Links technologies program is to demonstrate a 100 Gigabit-per-second (Gb/s) radio frequency (RF) backbone that will meet the anticipated mid-term (within 3-10 years) wireless networking requirements of deployed military forces.  DARPA's hybrid Free Space Optical RF Communications Adjunct (ORCA) system has broken the 10 Gb/s wireless network boundary using free-space optical links, but all-weather Ku band components are currently limited to much less than 1Gb/s capacity.  Furthermore, the hybrid optical/RF system exhibits size, weight, and power (SWaP) consumption characteristics that preclude deployment on many SWaP-limited platforms.  Moving to a millimeter-wave (mmW) solution will provide high capacity and all-weather resiliency, but presents technical challenges that include the generation of higher-order waveforms (beyond common data link), efficient power transmission, high-speed routing, and low-noise receivers.  This program seeks to develop the constituent subsystems (waveform generation, efficient power amplifiers, and receivers) and spatial multiplexing architectures to construct an all-weather mmW 100 Gb/s backbone at half the SWaP consumption of the current ORCA system.  The 100 Gb/s RF Backbone program is intended for transition to multiple Services.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>A highly networked and enabled force increases efficiency, effectiveness, and safety by making relevant information available when it is needed and at the appropriate location (person/platform/system).  Accomplishing this depends on providing reliable wireless communications to all U.S. forces, platforms, and devices in all phases of conflict.  Based on initial work under this effort, the Spectrum Efficiency and Access program in this PE/Project was created to enable reliable operation of military and commercial communications and radar systems when occupying the same spectrum bands.  As part of the Advanced Networks technologies effort, the Wireless Network Defense program increases wireless network capacity and reliability for tactical users, with the ultimate vision of making high quality data services pervasive throughout the DoD.  The primary focus is mitigation of advanced threats particular to the security of wireless networks.  The program intends to leverage the capabilities of the dynamic network to identify sources of misinformation, whether malicious or due to poor configuration, across the functional components of the complex system, and mitigate the corresponding effects.

                                    <r2:Description>Current Presidential Initiatives, FCC Broadband Task Force, and Congressional legislation are working to transition large swaths of spectrum (up to 500 MHz) from Federal (DoD is the primary contributor) to civilian use for broadband telecommunications.  The DoD will need more highly integrated and networked data/sensor capacity over the next decades and will therefore need new technology that requires less spectrum to operate.  The objective of the Spectrum Efficiency and Access program is to investigate improvements in spectral reuse, such as spectrum sharing of sensor/radar bands.  The program will leverage technical trends in cooperative sharing to exploit radar anti-jam and interference mitigation technologies that could enable spectrum sharing by allowing overlay of communications within the same spectral footprint.  The approach will include exploring real-time control data links between radars and communications systems, and developing the advanced waveforms and components to enable radars and communication networks to operate in close proximity.  The ultimate goal is to turn the DoD spectrum loss into a net gain of up to hundreds of MHz in capacity.  Technology from this program will be made available to the DoD.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>One of the key advantages on the battlefield is the ability to actively sense and manipulate the radio frequency (RF) environment, enabling reliable and assured communications, as well as effectively mapping and manipulating the adversary's communications in ways that defy their situational awareness, understanding, or response.  Current approaches are emitter-based, with the signal processing techniques focused on array and time-based processing for each emitter.  As the RF environment becomes more complex and cluttered, the number of collection assets and the required level of signal processing inhibits our capability to pervasively sense and manipulate at the precision (time, frequency, and space) required for effective action.  To address these Radio Frequency and Spectral Sensing (RF/SS) challenges, the Advanced RF Mapping program will develop and demonstrate new concepts for sensing and manipulating the RF environment based on distributed rather than centralized collection.  This approach will take advantage of the proliferation of RF devices, such as radios and cell phones, on the battlefield.  To leverage these existing devices effectively, the program will develop new algorithms that can map the RF environment with minimal communication load between devices.  It will also develop approaches to exploit our precise knowledge of the RF environment and the distributed proximity of RF devices to provide reliable and assured communications for our warfighter as well as to infiltrate or negate our adversaries' communications networks.  Building upon technologies investigated within other programs within this project, the Advanced RF Mapping program will enable both offensive and defensive operations in complex RF environments.  Advanced RF Mapping technology is planned to transition to the Services.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Commercial Test and Measurement equipment has advanced greatly with the emergence of sophisticated cellular and wireless local area network technology and can be used to intercept, analyze, and exploit our military communications signals.  The Computational Leverage Against Surveillance Systems (CLASS) program, working to expand Low Probability of Detection/Anti-Jam (LPD)/(AJ) technologies, seeks new ways to protect our signals from exploitation by increasingly sophisticated adversaries, in ways that can be maintained as commercial technology advances.  Three different techniques are in development: 1) Waveform Complexity uses advanced communications waveforms that are difficult to recover without knowledge and understanding of the signals itself; 2) Spatial Diversity uses distributed communications devices and the communication environment to disguise and dynamically vary the apparent location of the signal; and 3) Interference Exploitation makes use of the clutter in the signal environment to make it difficult for an adversary to isolate a particular signal.  The program's objective is to make modular communications technology that is inexpensive to incorporate in existing and emerging radio systems (&lt;$100 incremental cost) but pushes adversaries to need more than 1,000x our processing power - supercomputer-level processing power.  Another track of the program will extend the CLASS technology to provide LPD communications.  These techniques will drastically reduce the detectability of communications signals beyond current capabilities.  Scalable performance will allow LPD techniques to better trade information rate for communications capacity.  Technologies from this program are planned to transition to the Services.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Building upon the technologies explored and developed under the Computational Leverage Against Surveillance Systems (CLASS) program budgeted in this PE/Project, the Communication in Contested Environments program will seek to address communications problems anticipated in networked airborne systems in the mid-21st century.

Expected growth in sensor systems, unmanned systems, and internetworked weapons systems will strain the size of networks that our current communications technology can support in the contested environment.  As adversary capabilities advance, the DoD will need new techniques to quickly and efficiently accommodate better networking and improved communications capabilities, specifically communications systems with higher capacity, lower latency, greater jamming resistance, and reduced detectability.  As part of Advanced Networks technologies efforts, the Communication in Contested Environments (C2E) program addresses these needs with a three-pronged approach: first, to develop heterogeneous networking capabilities and advanced communication technology for airborne systems.  Low Probability of Detection (LPD), Anti-Jam (AJ), low latency, and high capacity communication protocols will be developed.  Second, to create a government controlled and maintained reference architecture for communications systems that draws from commercial communication architectures.  The defense contractor community can build specific communications systems based upon this reference architecture.  Finally, C2E will create a government controlled development environment to allow rapid refresh of communications technology and allow third party native application and waveform developers to contribute their own communications technologies.  Technologies from this program are planned to transition to the Services.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Title>Scalable Optical Nodes for Networked Edge Traversal (SONNET)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>Graph analytics on large data sets is currently performed on leadership-class supercomputers that are designed for other purposes.  These machines are required because they have the memory capacity required for large graph problems, but the demand on the processors is low, resulting in extremely low compute efficiency.  Computationally, graph analysis is characterized by many short, random accesses to memory which is inefficient on current systems, which are optimized for regular predictable access.  The SONNET program will build a silicon photonics-based graph processor that will perform graph analysis on terabytes (TBs) of data with performance comparable to peta-scale supercomputers in a significantly smaller size, weight and power (SWaP) envelope.  SONNET will optimize the design of the graph processor by co-designing processor and photonic hardware, and the computer and network architectures to exploit the high bandwidth provided by silicon photonics.  SONNET will demonstrate a scalable, power efficient prototype of such a graph processor and quantify performance for DoD-relevant applications.  The performance, efficiency, and size will be transformational for big data analytics and enable real-time analysis on dynamic graphs in the fields of cyber security, threat detection, and numerous others.  This program will explore the efficient processing of local information using stacked memory and integrated circuits specially made for specific tasks, as well as the efficient transfer of data between local information processors.  

The SONNET program will optimize silicon photonic links and improve their power efficiency while also developing packaging techniques for high bandwidth silicon photonic transceivers.  SONNET will integrate high capacity memory cards with photonic transceivers to enable high bandwidth access to high capacity memory.  The program will build a four node prototype system with a silicon photonic switch connecting the nodes.  The program will demonstrate the scalability of the prototype to petascale computational capability.  This will also explore the use of processing very close to a stacked memory to investigate the benefits of local processing within the islands connected by the photonic links.  This program has applied research efforts funded in PE 0602303E, Project IT-02. Technologies developed under this program will transition to the Services.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Communications Module - Millimeter-wave (COMMO-MMW) program will develop a compact, scalable, millimeter wave (mm-wave) active electronically scanned array (AESA) module to enable high-performance communications links.  The module will focus on low cost connectivity of weapons platforms and systems.  The cost will be reduced through exploitation of mass manufacturing techniques at the chip scale and a reduction in size of the system which will aid in retrofitting into existing platforms.  The COMMO-MMW module will operate in the high frequency portion of the electromagnetic spectrum to take advantage of reduced competition for bandwidth compared to the increasingly congested bands at lower frequencies.  By leveraging mass manufacturing processes to reduce module cost, and new advances in compound semiconductors to enhance system performance, the COMMO-MMW program will realize affordable mm-wave communications that can be made ubiquitous across the domains of modern warfare.  Additionally, mm-wave operation offers the potential for extremely high data rate communications links that are intrinsically jam resistant and low probability of detection due to narrow beamwidths and atmospheric propagation characteristics at these frequencies.  The lack of commercial component technology in the mm-wave band will further increase the military advantage gained by this capability.  This program will develop the critical compound semiconductor devices and circuits for high performance, high power efficiency mm-wave front end electronics, and will apply 3-D and/or heterogeneous integration approaches to build a compact, scalable, mm-wave AESA module.  COMMO-MMW not only will revolutionize Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) capability but also make it possible and affordable to retrofit existing military systems and extend high performance communications link capability to smaller platforms.  Technologies developed under this program will transition to the Services.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Wireless networks have evolved into complex systems having many configurable parameters/features, including link data rates, power settings, inter-network gateways, and security associations.  The optimal settings for these features vary greatly depending on the mission for which the network is deployed and the environment in which it is operating.  Currently, the majority of these features are optimized off-line for specific scenarios and assumptions and are pre-set before use in a mission.  There is no capability for the settings to adapt if the actual mission or environment differs from the original assumptions used to configure the network.  The problem is exacerbated in scenarios in which intelligent adversaries can affect the topology and operation of the network unpredictably and on short timescales.  Furthermore, future operations will include multiple, different radios interconnected on the same platform, which requires adaptation of the interaction between different networks.  Building upon concepts explored under the Wireless Network Defense program, which is budgeted in this PE/Project, the Self-Optimizing Networks program will develop new approaches to configuring and controlling networks and networks of networks for operation in dynamic and contested environments.  The program will address optimization within military networks, interactions between networks, and availability of necessary network services to support mission success.  Technologies developed under this program will transition to the Services.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Unlike commercial wireless communications, the military cannot count on a set of secure, fixed cell towers to establish wireless networks capable of receiving and distributing large amounts of data from distributed sources.  Rather, such communication must rely on approaches such as balloons and temporary communication towers that have a high logistical burden and are extremely vulnerable.  Building upon technologies investigated under other High-Capacity Links technologies programs within this project, the Fixed Wireless at a Distance program is overcoming these limitations by developing a re-locatable, long-range (10-100s of km) communication infrastructure that provides high-capacity (10s of megabits per second) data links from within a protected space.  The key innovation in this program is the use of a large number of rapidly deployable, distributed, ground-based antenna arrays that can form a coherent aperture for directional transmission and reception of information to/from tactical wireless networks.  Program challenges include the fundamental limits (power and extent) of transmitter gain as well as the rapid and practical deployment of the ground-based arrays.  When completed, the Fixed Wireless at a Distance program will significantly extend the reach of tactical communication systems without the need for vulnerable and costly infrastructure.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Communications requirements are growing exponentially due to the proliferation of high-data rate sensors (full motion video), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), and the emergence of the Soldier/Marine as both an operator and a sensor within military networks.  However, limited spectrum availability results in a large disparity between capacity requirement and availability.  Supporting the development of Advanced Networks technologies, Mobile Hotspots will develop an airborne high capacity data distribution network to interconnect groups of tactical users in a manner that is conceptually similar to the commercial tiered approach of interconnecting cell towers and wireless hotspots.  Mobile Hotspots will exploit advances in millimeter-wave technology and airborne networking to develop a self-organizing, 1 Gb/s mobility tactical airborne network formed from highly-directional communications links to interconnect mounted and dismounted warfighters, dispersed tactical operations centers, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) assets.  Low size, weight, and power (SWaP) designs will be integrated with commercial and military communications equipment and mounted on tactical UAVs and ground vehicles to provide network access to mobile users via infrastructureless hotspots that are compatible with existing radios.  The Mobile Hotspots program is targeted to transition to the Army and Marine Corps Expeditionary Forces.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Scalable Millimeter-wave (MMW) Architectures for Reconfigurable Transceivers (SMART) program developed a new technology for producing very thin millimeter-wave array apertures and transceivers.  The technology development culminated in the demonstration of a large-sized coherent, active electronically scanned array (AESA) with an output power density of 5W per square centimeter and a total layer thickness of less than one centimeter.  As part of the High-Capacity Links efforts in this Project, the SMART technology approach resulted in a breakthrough in performance over conventional millimeter-wave approaches.  The 3-D multi-layer assemblies developed will greatly reduce AESA packaging complexity and enable very compact, low-cost, millimeter-wave, and radio frequency circuit "building blocks" to combine to form arbitrarily large arrays.  New capabilities, such as the ability to construct reconfigurable and/or multi-band AESAs and other MMW circuits, will be enabled by this architectural approach.  The SMART program transitioned to industrial producers of MMW radar and communication system components for DoD applications.</r2:Description>

This content can include images, video, maps, situational awareness, and command and control information.  Advances in communications technologies are enabling high-capacity communications in remote environments.  However, the current centralized or regional storage and dissemination of information presents reliability and capacity challenges with distributing relevant information to users at the edge.  Commercial industry has developed approaches to the autonomous dissemination of high demand information by using distributed servers and advanced networking and information database technologies, combined with highly reliable fixed networking infrastructure that have embedded complex information exploitation tools.  Unfortunately, the commercial system is enabled by infrastructure that is not available to the warfighter.  This Advanced Networks technologies program leveraged commercial technologies to develop, prototype, and demonstrate the networking technologies and information dissemination techniques needed to enable efficient and robust content distribution using dynamic, mobile, and ad hoc military networks.  CBMEN was installed and demonstrated on existing radios.  Capabilities from this effort transitioned to the DoD.</r2:Description>

WNaN/AWNS networks managed node configurations and the topology of the network to reduce the demands on the physical and link layers of the network.  The technology created by the WNaN/AWNS effort provided reliable and available battlefield communications at low system cost.  AWNS also investigated the integration of Multi-User Detection (MUD) and Multiple-Input Multiple Output (MIMO) technology into the WNaN radio platform to position these technologies for transition into the WNaN radio node, as well as the Soldier Radio waveform (SRW) Anti-Jam (AJ) mode waveform.  In addition, this effort investigated Wireless Distributive Computing (WDC), Content Based Access (CBA), and smart antenna technologies to enhance the network and node ability to understand the operating environment, mission concept of operations, and node responsibilities to assist in data processing, information dissemination, and accomplishment of military mission objectives.  Further, this program developed a low-cost handheld/body wearable wireless node that can be used to form high-density ad hoc networks and gateways to the Global Information Grid.  This program also developed robust networking architecture(s) and network technologies/processes that exploit high-density node configurations.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Title>Communications Under Extreme RF Spectrum Conditions (CommEx)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The Communications Under Extreme RF Spectrum Conditions (CommEx) program developed signal detection and reasoning technology that allows radios to recognize interference and jamming attacks and then adapt to maintain communications, even in the presence of cognitive jammer attacks and dynamic interference of multiple cognitive network interactions.  As part of Low Probability of Detection/Anti-Jam (LPD/AJ) technologies efforts in the Project, the program developed models of adversary, commercial, and friendly cognitive radios and implemented those models to assess, in real time, the current and future dynamics of the communications network.  Core technologies for operation in highly dynamic and/or high jamming to signal environments were developed to include: automated jamming waveform forensics; local environment assessment (time, space, frequency, polarization); technologies for addressing known attack strategies and interference properties; and antenna, signal processing, modulation, and network optimization technologies.  Based on predictions of the level of communication success compared to mission communication requirements, the cognitive radio chooses waveform selections/configurations that best achieve mission objectives.  The cognitive radio includes the capability to analyze and select optimum frequency, waveform, and network configurations during all aspects of a mission.  The design effort led to new radio communication architectures, more robust radio communication networking, and better understanding of optimization amongst interference avoidance and interference suppression strategies.  This program also sought to enable communication between dispersed and distributed emitters and receivers to provide a multiplier in capacity for both locating emitters and assessing effectiveness of an electronic attack.  Technologies developed in this program transitioned to the Navy and Air Force.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Network-Centric Warfare Technology program element is budgeted in the Advanced Technology Development budget activity because it addresses high payoff opportunities to develop and rapidly mature advanced technologies and systems required for today's network-centric warfare concepts.  It is imperative for the future of the U.S. forces to operate flawlessly with each other, regardless of which services and systems are involved in any particular mission.  The overarching goal of this program element is to enable technologies at all levels, regardless of service component, to operate as one system.

The objective of the Joint Warfare Systems project is to create enabling technologies for seamless joint operations, from strategic planning to tactical and urban operations.  Joint Warfare Systems leverage current and emerging network, robotic, and information technology and provide next generation U.S. forces with greatly expanded capability, lethality, and rapid responsiveness.  Critical issues facing this project are:  (1) U.S. opponents utilizing systems that are flexible, robust, and difficult to neutralize; and (2) U.S. doctrine that limits the use of firepower to lessen the impact of operations on noncombatants.  These problems are magnified in urban and semi-urban areas where combatants and civilians are often collocated, and in peacekeeping operations where combatants and civilians are often indistinguishable.  Meeting these challenges places a heavy burden on joint war planning.  Understanding opponent networks is essential so that creative options can be developed to counter their strategies.  Synchronization of air and ground operations to apply force only where needed and with specific effects is required.  

The Maritime Systems project will identify, develop and rapidly mature critical advanced technologies and system concepts for the naval forces' role in today's network centric warfare concept.  Improvements in communications between and among submarines, surface ships and naval aircraft have allowed these forces to operate seamlessly with each other and with other Service's network centric systems.  Naval forces will play an ever-increasing role in network centric warfare because of their forward deployed nature, their unique capability to operate simultaneously in the air, on the sea and under the sea and their versatile ability to provide both rapid strike and project-sustained force.  The technologies developed under this project will capitalize on these attributes, improve them and enable them to operate with other network centric forces.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The objective of the Joint Warfare Systems project is to create enabling technologies for seamless joint operations, from strategic planning to tactical and urban operations.  Joint Warfare Systems leverage current and emerging network, robotic, and information technology and provide next generation U.S. forces with greatly increased capability, lethality, and rapid responsiveness.  Critical issues facing this project are: (1) U.S. opponents using systems that are flexible, robust, and difficult to neutralize; and (2) U.S. doctrine that limits the use of firepower to lessen the impact of operations on noncombatants.  These problems are magnified in urban and semi-urban areas where combatants and civilians are often co-located and in peacekeeping operations where combatants and civilians are often indistinguishable.  Meeting these challenges places a heavy burden on joint war planning.  Understanding opponent networks is essential so that creative options can be developed to counter their strategies.  Synchronization of air and ground operations to apply force only where needed and with specific effects is required.  This project supports all levels of the force structure including: (1) the strategic/operational level by generating targeting options against opponents' centers of gravity that have complex networked relationships; (2) the tactical/operational level by managing highly automated forces with tight coupling between air and ground platforms; and (3) the focused tactical level by developing platforms and tools, which acquire targets of opportunity and cue network-based analysis of likely enemy operations thus maximizing the effectiveness of ground forces in stability and support operations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>The System of Systems Architecture, Technology Development, and Demonstration program seeks to implement an architecture framework capable of assessing and demonstrating potential operational benefits of integrating various system capabilities to improve mission success in contested environments.  Such assessments would optimize system-level trades of requirements and architectures to properly leverage an integrated set of system characteristics and capabilities.  The demonstration assessment metrics will measure individual and combined system performance to further streamline resource allocation to maximize operational impact.  In addition, providing a modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) environment to assess complex systems will enable greater utility of emerging system technologies, since they can be assessed in near-real-world simulations without the real-world costs of testing fully integrated systems.  The program will also develop system synthesis and integration technologies that enable rapid assimilation of new and off-the-shelf technologies into the system of systems architecture.  These technologies will break down current barriers to entry that new technologies face in system of systems using formal methods, compositional reasoning, and automated design space exploration.  Technologies from this program will be transitioned to the Services.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>*Formerly Integrated Planning for Strike, ISR, and Spectrum (IPSIS)

Currently, Command and Control (C2) of air platforms is a highly centralized process operating largely independently across planning domains (intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), strike, and spectrum management) and is optimized for a permissive environment.  To address the challenges faced in today's increasingly contested environments, the Resilient Synchronized Planning and Assessment for the Contested Environment (RSPACE) program will develop tools to enable distribution of planning functions across the C2 hierarchy for resilience (e.g. loss of communications) while synchronizing strike, ISR, and spectrum planning to maximize the contribution of all assets through increased utilization and exploitation of synergies.  The program will develop tools supporting a mixed initiative planning approach, maximizing automation according to operator's choice, and enabling human-in-the-loop intervention and modification.  During execution, the tools will provide lifecycle tracking of targeting and information needs and support assessment of progress towards achieving the commander's intent.  The tools will dynamically respond as directed to ad hoc requests and significant plan deviations via a real-time dynamic replanning capability, and easily adapt to technology refreshes.  The RSPACE tools will transition to the Air Force and the Navy.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Title>Retrodirective Arrays for Coherent Transmission (ReACT)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>Worldwide advancements in signal processing and electronics have decreased the effectiveness of single-platform, power-based Electronic Warfare (EW) as a viable technique in the future.  The goal of the Retrodirective Arrays for Coherent Transmission (ReACT) program is to develop and to demonstrate the capability to combine distributed mobile transmitters to provide high-power spatially resolved EW beams at frequencies utilized by adversary communications and radars.  ReACT will achieve this capability by synchronizing multiple distributed transmitters to form a much larger effective array than a single platform could support.  The key technical challenge is to synchronize distributed and moving transmitters while compensating for platform motion and vibration.  Further, the ReACT system must sense the target's emissions and then optimally configure the ReACT transmitters to focus on the area to be jammed, as well as the minimum power required to sufficiently jam the target.  The ReACT program builds upon technology developed under the Arrays at Commercial Timescales (ACT) program, which is budgeted in PE 0602716E, Project ELT-01, and will culminate with a flight demonstration of distributed EW beamforming.  The ReACT technology is planned to transition to the Air Force and Navy.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The goal of the HELLADS program is to develop a high-energy laser weapon system that will provide an order of magnitude reduction in weight compared to existing laser systems.  HELLADS will enable high-energy lasers (HELs) to be integrated onto tactical aircraft and will significantly increase engagement ranges compared to ground-based systems, in addition to enabling high precision/low collateral damage and rapid engagement of fleeting targets for both offensive and defensive missions.  Advancements in beam control and other subsystems that are required for the practical integration of a laser weapon into existing tactical platforms will be explored.  With the assistance of the Services, the HELLADS program will pursue the necessary analysis, coordination, and design activity for a prototype laser weapon system incorporating the HELLADS laser system and the ABC turret into air-, ground-, or sea-based tactical vehicles.  While the prototype laser weapon system module is in design and development, the HELLADS 150 kilowatt (kW) laser will be made available for demonstration opportunities and transition to the Army, Navy, or Air Force.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Advancements are being made in land-capable, high degree-of-freedom unmanned platforms to enable mobility over complex terrain.  Many current prototypes are inspired by biological systems and while proof-of-principle systems have or are demonstrating unprecedented mobility, limitations have emerged.  Advanced capabilities in perception, control, and physical capability/coordination are needed to work autonomously in human environments.  These are critical enablers for performing mission-relevant tasks in austere and remote regions, partially-destroyed roads, high-threat anti-access/area denied environments, rubble-filled areas, and providing greater range/endurance for soldiers, platforms, and personnel.

The Robotics Challenge program will boost innovation in autonomous systems and expand platform utility through enhanced actuation, energy density, perception, locomotion, agile reconfiguration, and design efficiency.  Program thrusts are centered on a progressive regimen of physical problem solving, real-time team oriented tasks, and dynamic adaptation designed to build "machine trust", especially when integrated with humans in a variety of operational environments.  The Robotics Challenge program consists of a series of obstacle course style challenge events that will focus on technology solutions to demonstrate and test robot capabilities for disaster response.  Robotics Challenge events will drive advances in power systems, agility and speed, precision in perception tied to platform coordination, dexterity, and impulsive power.  Program objectives focus on technologies to expand mobility and extend endurance of unmanned platforms, advanced tactile and manipulation capabilities, and tools for cost effective design, validation, and construction of autonomous technology, and human-robot interaction.  The 6.2 portion of this program is budgeted in PE 0602702E Project TT-04.  Anticipated Service users include the Army, Marines, and Special Forces.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Legged Squad Support System (LS3) program explored the development of a mission-relevant quadruped platform scaled to unburden the infantry squad and hence unburden the soldier.  In current operations, soldiers carry upwards of 50lbs of equipment, in some cases over 100lbs, over long distances in terrain not always accessible by wheeled platforms that support infantry.  As a result, the soldier's combat effectiveness can be compromised.  The LS3 program designed and developed technology demonstrators capable of carrying 400lbs of payload for 20 miles in 24 hours, negotiating terrain at endurance levels expected of typical squad maneuvers.  LS3 leveraged technical breakthroughs of prior biologically inspired legged platform development efforts.  It developed system designs to the scale and performance adequate for infantry squad mission applications, focusing on platform, control, and human-machine interaction capabilities, as well as secondary design considerations, such as acoustic signature.  Anticipated Service users include the Army, Marines, and Special Forces.</r2:Description>

Improvements in communications between and among submarines, surface ships and naval aircraft have allowed these forces to operate seamlessly with each other and with other Service's network centric systems.  Naval forces will play an ever-increasing role in network centric warfare because of their forward deployed nature, their unique capability to operate simultaneously in the air, on the sea and under the sea and their versatile ability to provide both rapid strike and project sustained force.  The technologies developed under this project will capitalize on these attributes, improve them and enable them to operate with other network centric forces.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Title>Distributed Agile Submarine Hunting (DASH)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The diesel-electric submarine is an asymmetric threat in terms of its cost and consequential growth in numbers relative to our legacy maritime platforms.  In addition, these submarines have trended toward lower acoustic signature levels, and have grown in lethality.  The Distributed Agile Submarine Hunting (DASH) program intends to reverse the asymmetric advantage of this threat through the development of advanced standoff sensing from unmanned systems.  Deep-ocean sonar nodes will be developed to operate at significant depths in open ocean areas to achieve large fields of view to detect submarines overhead.  Each deep node is the maritime equivalent of a satellite, and is referred to as a subullite.  The significant field of view, along with the advantage of low-noise phenomena at extreme depths will permit a scalable number of collaborative sensor platforms to detect and track submarines over large areas.  At-sea demonstrations have shown that the detection capability is achievable.  The program will continue to develop prototype systems that will evolve through additional at-sea testing.  These tests will demonstrate the ability to integrate into the Navy's undersea systems responsible for anti-submarine warfare (ASW).  The program seeks to achieve breakthrough technology for long-range detection and classification, communications, energy management, sensor and platform integration, and robust semiautonomous processing and control for distributed sensing platforms.  This program will transition to the Navy.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The goal of the Hybrid Multi Material Rotor Full-Scale Demonstration (HyDem) program is to dramatically improve U.S. Navy submarine superiority.  HyDem will apply breakthroughs in materials and material system technologies developed under the Hybrid Multi Material Rotor (HMMR) program budgeted in PE 0602715E, Project MBT-01, and multi-disciplinary design methods to a Virginia Class Submarine propulsor, a critical component in submarine performance.  The U.S. Navy's ability to operate their submarine fleet with improved capability allows for the creation of strategic surprise.  Submarines could exploit expanded areas which were previously unattainable for the purpose of submarine warfare, including antisubmarine warfare (ASW), antisurface warfare (ASuW), intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) gathering, strike, Special Forces operations, and strategic deterrence missions.  The HyDem program will design, manufacture, and supply the Navy with a novel component for integration into a new construction Virginia Class Submarine.  The Navy will evaluate this component in sea trials.  It is envisioned that the Navy will integrate this design change into the future development of the Virginia Class and Ohio Replacement Submarines, and back-fit previously constructed Virginia Class Submarines.  This program will transition to the Navy.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Title>Tactical Undersea Network Architecture*</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>*Formerly Undersea Architecture: Adaptive Infrastructure

Systems fighting as a network are vulnerable to a loss of connectivity in a contested environment.  This connectivity is important for synchronizing forces, establishing and maintaining situation awareness and control of remotely operated vehicles and systems.  Additionally, undersea systems are challenged to maintain connectivity and must carry their own energy and operate over their design lifetime with little to no maintenance and repair.  These factors inhibit their use in collaborative networks and prevent the full exploitation of the potential of undersea systems.  By leveraging techniques explored under the Distributed Agile Submarine Hunting (DASH) program within Project NET-02, the Tactical Undersea Network Architecture program will overcome these limitations by developing the technologies necessary for autonomous, reliable, and secure undersea energy and data transfers; true plug, play, and operating standards; and rapid, cost effective deployment and sustainment technologies. The program will develop and demonstrate novel technology options and designs to temporarily restore connectivity for existing tactical data networks in contested environments using small diameter optical fiber and buoy relay nodes.  The program will focus on innovative system architecture designs, lightweight optical fiber technologies, and rapidly deployable buoy node designs and component technologies.  The Tactical Undersea Network Architecture program will emphasize early risk reduction with future scaled at-sea integrated demonstrations of increasing complexity.  Program technologies will transition to the Navy.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Title>Blue Wolf</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>Undersea platforms have inherent operational and tactical advantages such as stealth and surprise. Platform drag due to fluid viscosity and platform powering requirements varies with the speed through the water.  Platform energy and power density limitations create two distinct operational usage profiles: one for unmanned undersea vehicles (low speed, long endurance) and another for undersea weapons (high speed, short endurance).  Designers have historically solved this with hybrid systems such as the Navy's Vertical Launch Anti-Submarine Rocket, or by increasing the size of undersea systems.  However, hybrid systems can be vulnerable to air and undersea defensive systems and larger undersea systems can result in significant launch platform modifications.

The Blue Wolf program seeks to provide a radically different solution by leveraging the powering and performance results from the previously funded Super-Fast Submerged Transport program, PE 0602702E, Project TT-03, to develop and demonstrate an undersea demonstrator vehicle with endurance and speed capabilities beyond conventional undersea systems within the weight and volume envelopes of current Navy undersea systems.  Significant technical challenges to be addressed include: integration of reliable undersea connectivity, autonomy, guidance, and navigation; obstacle avoidance; and propulsion and energy systems compatible with existing manned platform safety requirements.  The program will culminate in a series of at-sea demonstrations and will transition to the Navy.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Long-Range Undersea Navigation program will provide continuous, GPS-level positioning accuracy to submarines and autonomous undersea vehicles (AUVs) in long-range ocean basins over extended periods of time.  Undersea navigation cannot use GPS because the water blocks its signals.  At shallower depths, masts can be raised to receive GPS signals, but masts present a detection risk.  Typically, the alternative to GPS for undersea navigation has been inertial navigation systems (INS), but INS accuracy can degrade unacceptably over time.  Building upon concepts explored under the Distributed Agile Submarine Hunting (DASH) program within Project NET-02 and the Upward Falling Payloads program, PE 0602702E, Project TT-03 the Long-Range Undersea Navigation program will distribute a small number of acoustic sources, analogous to GPS satellites, around the ocean basin.  A submarine or AUV will be equipped with an acoustic receiver and appropriate software in order to obtain, maintain, and re-acquire, if lost, an initial location.  By transmitting specific acoustic waveforms and developing accurate acoustic propagation models to predict and interpret the complex arrival structure of the acoustic sources, the submarine or AUV can determine its range from each source and thus triangulate its position.  Technologies developed under this program will transition to the Navy.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The anti-ship cruise missile (ASCM) is a growing asymmetric threat to U.S. naval combatants, force projection, and defense of the sea lanes of communications missions.  Threat ASCM capabilities and lethality are rapidly improving with extended range, higher speeds, and advancing sophistication in navigation and targeting subsystems.  In addition, these weapon systems are being proliferated in greater numbers to adversarial nations with options for submarine deployment.  Submarine-launched ASCMs pose an even greater challenge to our Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) systems as they expand search area requirement proportional to the square of the cruise missile range.  The Multi-Axis Protection of Surface Ships program intends to reverse the asymmetric advantage of these threats through the development of advanced offboard sensing from unmanned systems.  These multi-spectral mobile and autonomous sensor systems will operate at significant offboard ranges from maritime battle groups to provide tactically significant early warning of cruise missile attacks.  The effort is focused on achieving new detection modalities with sufficient low power, weight, and size (SWaP), to enable unmanned vessel implementations.  Initial efforts will focus on identifying the best detection methods and sensor modalities leveraged from state-of-the-art sensors and new physical and operational insights.  Provided compelling detection capability is achievable, prototype systems will evolve through at-sea testing and sensor integration.  The program seeks to further explore ASW and networked maritime system concepts explored within PE 0603766E, Project NET-02, and PE 0602702E, Project TT-03, to develop breakthrough technology for long-range detection and classification, communications, energy management, sensor and platform integration, and robust autonomous processing and control for distributed sensing platforms.  This program will transition to the Navy.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Structural Logic program developed platform structures and frames that can adapt to varying loads and simultaneously exhibit both high stiffness and high damping.  This program demonstrated the utility of negative stiffness structural elements developed under the Multifunctional Materials and Structures program, budgeted in PE 0602715E, Project MBT-01, in the ridged support frames of real world DoD platforms.  As the demands on military platforms increase, so does the need for structures to mitigate the shock and vibrations applied by dynamic environments.  Today's structures exhibit limited adaptability and typically achieve either extreme stiffness or damping.  In military platforms, extremely stiff structures provide high strength, but readily transfer loads to passengers often resulting in serious injury.  Conversely, existing damping structures can reduce the load transferred to passengers, but only at the expense of structural strength and integrity.  By demonstrating the ability to combine stiffness, damping, and dynamic range in a single structure, the Structural Logic program enabled the design of military platforms with the ability to continually adapt their properties to match the demands of a dynamic environment.  Technology from this program transitioned to the Navy.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Sensor Technology program element is budgeted in the Advanced Technology Development Budget Activity because it funds sensor efforts that will improve the accuracy and timeliness of our surveillance and targeting systems for improved battlefield awareness, strike capability and battle damage assessment.  

The Surveillance and Countermeasures Technology project will improve the accuracy and timeliness of our surveillance and targeting systems for improved battlefield awareness, strike capability, and battle damage assessment.  Timely surveillance of enemy territory under all weather conditions is critical to providing our forces with the tactical information needed to succeed in future wars.  This operational surveillance capability must continue to perform during enemy efforts to deny and deceive the sensor systems, and operate, at times, in a clandestine manner.  This project will exploit recent advances in multispectral target phenomenology, signal processing, low-power high-performance computing, and low-cost microelectronics to develop advanced surveillance and targeting systems.  In addition, this project encompasses several advanced technologies related to the development of techniques to counter advanced battlefield threats.

The Sensors and Processing Systems project develops and demonstrates the advanced sensor processing technologies and systems necessary for intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) missions.  The project is primarily driven by four needs:   1) providing day-night ISR capabilities against the entire range of potential targets; 2) countering camouflage, concealment, and deception of mobile ground targets; 3) detecting and identifying objects of interest/targets across wide geographic areas in near-real-time; and 4) enabling reliable identification, precision fire control tracking, timely engagement, and accurate battle damage assessment of ground targets.

The Exploitation Systems project develops algorithms, software, and information processing systems to extract information from massive intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) datasets.  In particular, it develops new technologies for detection and discrimination of targets from clutter, classification and fingerprinting of high value targets, localization and tracking over wide areas, and threat network identification and analysis.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Timely surveillance of enemy territory under all weather conditions is critical to providing our forces with the tactical information needed to succeed in future wars.  This operational surveillance capability must continue to perform during enemy efforts to deny and deceive the sensor systems, and operate, at times, in a clandestine manner.  This project will exploit recent advances in multispectral target phenomenology, signal processing, low-power high-performance computing, and low-cost microelectronics to develop advanced surveillance and targeting systems.

                                    <r2:Description>The proliferation of radio frequency (RF)-based countermeasures, such as digital radio frequency memory (DRFM), has presented challenges to the effectiveness of data sensors.  The Multi-Function Optical Sensing (MOS) program will enable an alternative approach to detecting, tracking, and performing non-cooperative target identification, as well as providing fire control for fighter class and long-range strike aircraft.  This program leverages emerging high-sensitivity focal plane array (FPA) and compact, multiband laser systems technology in the near/mid/long-wave infrared bands to enable the development of a multi-function optical system.  Technical challenges include the demonstration of inexpensive, multiband, large-format, photon-counting, high-bandwidth receivers and their integration into a multi-optical sensor suite compatible with airborne assets.  The MOS program seeks to advance the state of the art of components and technology to support an all-optical airborne system that can detect, geolocate, and identify targets at standoff ranges.  Technologies from this program will transition to the Services.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Adaptable Navigation Systems (ANS) program will provide the U.S. warfighter with the ability to effectively navigate all environments including when Global Positioning System (GPS) is unavailable due to hostile action (jamming) or blockage by structures, foliage, or other environmental obstacles.  The ANS approach relies on three major technology innovations.  The first is development of a new type of inertial measurement unit (IMU) that requires fewer GPS position fixes.  Using cold atom technology, this IMU exceeds the performance of strategic-grade IMUs, with comparable size, weight, and power (SWaP).  The second innovation uses Signals of Opportunity (SoOp) from a variety of ground-, air-, and space-based sources, as well as natural SoOps to reduce dependency on GPS position fixes.  These will be received on the Services' forthcoming software-defined radios and will use specially tailored algorithms to determine position.  The third technology innovation allows SoOp-based position information to be combined with inertial and other sensors to enable flexible navigation systems that can be reconfigured in the field to support any platform or environment.  This capability will enhance new advanced component technology for positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) emerging from other programs in the form of Micro Electro-Mechanical System devices, clocks, and new aiding sensors.  Recent advances in mathematics, data abstraction, and network architectures will build upon these capabilities by enabling "plug-and-play" integration of both existing and future navigation components and processing to allow real-time reconfiguration of navigation systems.  If successful, major improvements in navigation accuracy and system cost could also be realized.  Early transition partners would include all Services, with emphasis on platforms and users that must operate in multiple environments, such as Naval forces.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The objective of the Adaptable, Low Cost Sensors (ADAPT) program is to leverage commercial technology and manufacturing techniques to improve the development time and significantly reduce the cost of sensors and sensor systems.  Currently, military sensors are designed and developed with unique, mission-specific hardware and software capability requirements in a single, fully integrated device.  This approach significantly increases both the cost and difficulty of meeting continuously changing requirements and upgrades.  Commercial processes, such as those used in the smart phone industry, create reference designs for common system functions and features to accelerate system development time.  This makes changing requirements and completing upgrades far simpler.  Adopting these commercial processes enables a mission-independent, designed-to-cost "commercial smart core" that can be combined with an appliqué of mission-specific hardware to provide low cost, independently upgradable, and previously infeasible sensor system distribution capabilities.  The Smart Munitions effort plans to use ADAPT's sensing, processing, communications, and location capabilities to provide positive identification and man-in-the-loop control of distributed, unattended ground sensor systems.  It also seeks to develop a reference design to demonstrate capability and develop tactics for unattended sensors.  This program will transition to the Services.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Sensors and Processing Systems project develops and demonstrates the advanced sensor and processing technologies and systems necessary for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions.  Future battlefields will continue to be populated with targets that use mobility and concealment as key survival tactics, and high-value targets will range from specific individual insurgents and vehicles to groups of individuals and large platforms such as mobile missile launchers and artillery.  The Sensors and Processing Systems Project is primarily driven by four needs: (a) providing day-night ISR capabilities against the entire range of potential targets; (b) countering camouflage, concealment, and deception of mobile ground targets; (c) detecting and identifying objects of interest/targets across wide geographic areas in near-real-time; and (d) enabling reliable identification, precision fire control tracking, timely engagement, and accurate battle damage assessment of ground targets.  The Sensors and Processing Systems Project develops and demonstrates technologies and system concepts that combine novel approaches to sensing with emerging sensor technologies and advanced sensor and image processing algorithms, software, and hardware to enable comprehensive knowledge of the battlespace and detection, identification, tracking, engagement, and battle damage assessment for high-value targets in all weather conditions and combat environments.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>The goal of the Adaptive Radar Countermeasures (ARC) program is to provide effective electronic countermeasure (ECM) techniques against new or unknown threat radars.  Current airborne electronic warfare (EW) systems rely on the ability to uniquely identify a threat radar system to apply an appropriate preprogrammed countermeasure technique which can take many months to develop.  Countering radar systems is increasingly challenging as digitally programmed radars exhibit novel behaviors and agile waveform characteristics.  ARC will develop new processing techniques and algorithms that adapt in real-time to generate suitable countermeasures.  Using techniques such as state modeling, machine learning, and system probing, ARC will learn the behavior of the threat system, then choose and implement an appropriate countermeasure strategy.  The program is planned for transition to the Joint Program Office.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Multifunction RF (MFRF) program goal is to enable U.S. rotary wing aircraft forces to fight effectively in all forms of severely Degraded Visual Environments (DVE) when our adversaries cannot.  The program goes beyond landing aids in DVE to address all elements of combat to include landing, takeoff, hover/taxi, enroute, navigation, lethality, and survivability.  Building on previous RF sensors advancements, the program will seek to eliminate many redundant RF elements of current independently developed situational and combat support systems to provide multifunction capability with flexibility of adding new mission functions.  This will reduce the overall size, weight, power, and cost (SWaP-C) of subsystems and protrusive exterior antennas on military aircraft, enabling greater mission capability with reduced vehicle system integration burden.  The program approach includes; 1) Development of synthetic vision for pilots that fuses sensor data with high-resolution terrain databases, 2) Development of Advanced Rotary Multifunction Sensor (ARMS), utilizing silicon-based tile arrays, for agile electronically scanning technology at low SWAP-C, 3) Implementation of software development kit to re-define modes as required by mission or platform needs; ease of adding new modes via software without hardware modifications.  The program is planned for transition to the Army and Marines.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Recent conflicts have demonstrated the need for close air support by precision attack platforms such as the AC-130J aircraft in support of ground forces.  Under clear conditions, targets are easily identified and engaged quite effectively, but in degraded environments the atmosphere can inhibit traditional optical sensors.  The AC-130J must fly above cloud decks in order to avoid anti-aircraft fire, negating optical targeting sensors.  Similarly, rotary/wing blades in urban operations generate copious amounts of dust that prevent circling assets from supplying cover fire for ground forces.  The Video-rate Synthetic Aperture Radar (ViSAR) program seeks to develop a real-time spotlight synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging sensor that will provide imagery of a region to allow high-resolution fire direction in conditions where optical sensors do not function.  Technology from this program is planned to transition to Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC).</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Military Imaging and Surveillance Technology (MIST) program is developing a fundamentally new optical Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) capability that can provide high-resolution 3-D images to locate and identify a target at much longer ranges than is possible with existing optical systems.  Several prototype optical surveillance and observation systems are being developed that: (1) demonstrate probabilities of recognition and identification at distances sufficient to allow stand-off engagement; (2) overcome atmospheric turbulence, which now limits the ability of high-resolution optics; and (3) increase target identification confidence to reduce fratricide and/or collateral damage.  The program will develop and integrate the necessary component technologies including high-energy pulsed lasers, receiver telescopes that have a field of view and depth of field that obviates the need for steering or focusing the optical system, computational imaging algorithms to improve system resolution, and data exploitation and analysis tools.  Advances in laser systems, digital imagers, and novel image processing algorithms will be leveraged to reduce the overall size, weight, and power (SWaP) of imaging systems to allow for soldier portable and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) platform integration. The MIST program will transition the optical ISR technology to the Air Force and SOCOM.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>*Formerly Precision Timing Enabling Cooperative Effects

Building on technologies developed in the Adaptable Navigation Systems program, budgeted in PE 0603767E, Project SEN-01, the Spatial, Temporal and Orientation Information for Contested Environments (STOIC) program will enable precision cooperative effects by developing global time transfer and synchronization systems independent of GPS.  As a corollary to time synchronization, this program will also enable GPS independent positioning to maintain precise time synchronization between collaborating mobile users.  Key attributes of this program are global availability; minimal and low cost infrastructure; anti-jamming capability; and performance equal to or better than GPS through recent advances in cold atom-based clocks and optical time transfer.  Other recent advances show that navigation systems using non-traditional sensors can be rapidly configured to provide accurate positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) capabilities.  This program will build on these and other PNT technologies, and extend this level of performance to include the underwater environment in addition to surface, indoor, and airborne environments.  Demonstrations on relevant platforms in relevant environments will be used to validate the technology.  This program will transition to the Services, emphasizing platforms that operate in GPS-denied environments.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Title>Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) Technology</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>Automatic target recognition (ATR) systems provide the capability to detect, identify, and track high value targets from collected sensor data.  Current ATRs are typically designed for specific sensors and static due to pre-programmed target lists and operating mode, limiting mission execution capabilities.  Extending ATR technology to accommodate sensor upgrades or include new emerging targets can be costly and time consuming.  The objective of the ATR Technology program is to develop technologies that reduce operation limitations while also providing significant performance improvements, dramatically reduced development times, and reduced life cycle maintenance costs.  Recent breakthroughs in deep learning, sparse representations, manifold learning, and embedded systems offer promise for dramatic improvements in ATR.  Three core areas the program will focus on are: development of on-line adaptive algorithms that enable performance-driven sensing and ATR; recognition technology that enables rapid incorporation of new targets; and technologies that dramatically reduce required data rates, processing times, and the overall hardware and software footprint of ATR systems.  ATR technology developed under the program is planned for transition to the Services.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Advanced Scanning Technology for Imaging Radars (ASTIR) program will provide immediate benefit to applications that are constrained by power, weight, and the complexity limits of production.  The goal of this program, building on technologies developed under the Multifunction RF (MFRF) program which is budgeted in this PE/project, is to demonstrate a new imaging radar architecture using an electronically scanned sub-reflector to produce a more readily available, cost-effective sensor solution that does not require platform or target motion.  Key system attributes will: 1) provide high-resolution 3D imaging for enhanced identification and targeting, independent of platform or target motion; 2) produce video frame rates to provide well-focused images even when there is platform or target motion; 3) beam steer with a single transmit/receive chain to reduce system complexity resulting in lower cost, power, and weight; 4) integrate millimeter-wave (mmW)/terahertz (THz) electronic component advancements from other DARPA programs for transmit and receive functions.  The completion of this program will result in a more readily available, cost-effective imaging radar technology that will work in concert with a wide area surveillance system to provide target identification at video frame rates in all conditions where existing sensors will not work.  Applications evaluated to date have identified transition opportunities with Special Operations Command and the Navy in force protection.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Building upon low cost and small form factor sensor research conducted under DARPA's ADAPT and Multi-Function Optical Sensing programs (budgeted in PE 0603767E, Project SEN-01), the Small Satellite Sensors program will develop and space-qualify electro-optical and infrared (EO/IR) sensor and inter-satellite communications technologies, and establish feasibility that new DoD tactical capabilities can be implemented on small (&lt;100 lb) satellites.  Experimental payloads will be flown on small satellites, and data will be collected to validate new operational concepts.  Small satellites provide a low-cost and quick-turnaround capability for testing new technologies and experimental payloads.  Operationally, small and low-cost satellites enable the deployment of larger constellations which can provide greater coverage, persistence, and survivability compared to a small number of more expensive satellites, as well as the possibility for launch-on-demand.  This program seeks to leverage rapid progress being made by the commercial sector on small satellite bus technology, as well as investments being made by DoD and industry on low-cost launch and launch-on-demand capabilities for small satellites.  The program will focus on developing, demonstrating, and validating key payload technologies needed by DoD that are not currently being developed for commercial space applications.  Technologies developed under this program will transition to the Air Force.</r2:Description>

The development objectives are technologies and systems with small size, weight and power (SWaP), low recurring cost, applicability to a wide range of weapons and missions such as small unit operations, suppression of enemy air defenses, precision strike, and time-sensitive targets.  The technical approach for the sensing/processing hardware is to use passive EO/IR sensors, which have evolved into very small and inexpensive devices in the commercial market, and the reconfigurable processing architecture developed in DARPA's ADAPT program (budgeted in PE 0603767E, Project SEN-01).  The technical approach to target identification will start from "deep learning"  algorithms pioneered for facial recognition and the identification of critical image features.

                                    <r2:Description>The Behavioral Learning for Adaptive Electronic Warfare (BLADE) program will develop the capability to jam adaptive and rapidly evolving radio frequency (RF) threats in tactical environments and at tactically-relevant timescales.  This will change the paradigm for responding to evolving threats from lab-based manual development to an adaptive in-the-field systems approach.  When an unknown or advanced RF threat appears, BLADE networked nodes will dynamically characterize the emitter, synthesize an effective countering technique, and evaluate jamming effectiveness by iteratively probing, learning, and adapting to the threat.  An optimization process will tailor real-time responses to specific threats, producing a countermeasure waveform that maximizes jam effectiveness while minimizing the required jamming resources.  Thus BLADE will enable the rapid defeat of new RF threats and provide the warfighter with real-time feedback on jam effectiveness.  The program is transitioning to the U.S. Army Communications-Electronic RDT&amp;E Center, Intelligence and Information Warfighter Directorate for further maturation and hardening.</r2:Description>

The Media Forensics program will create technologies for analyzing diverse types of content and media to determine their trustworthiness for military and intelligence purposes.  Current approaches to media forensics for authentication and verification are manpower intensive and require analysts and investigators to undertake painstaking analyses to establish context and provenance.  Media Forensics will develop, integrate, and extend image and video analytics to provide forensic information that can be used by analysts and automated systems.  Technologies will transition to operational commands and the intelligence community.</r2:Description>
