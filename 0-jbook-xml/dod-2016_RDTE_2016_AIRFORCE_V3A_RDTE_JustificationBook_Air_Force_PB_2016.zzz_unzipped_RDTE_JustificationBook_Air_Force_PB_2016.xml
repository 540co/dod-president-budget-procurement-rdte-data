                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a space based positioning, navigation and timing distribution system, which operates through all weather. GPS supports both civil and military users in air, space, sea and land operations.  GPS is a satellite-based radio navigation system that serves military and civil users worldwide.  GPS users process satellite signals to determine accurate position, velocity and time.  GPS must comply with 10 United States Code (USC) sec 2281 which requires that the Secretary of Defense ensures the continued sustainment and operation of GPS for military and civilian purposes and 51 USC sec 50112, which requires that GPS complies with certain standards and facilitates international cooperation.

This Program Element (PE) funds the Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) for the GPS next generation operational control system (OCX) and the GPS Enterprise Integrator (EI).  This includes advanced concept development, systems analysis, modernized control segment development, mission planning development, training simulators, integrated logistics support products, test resources, systems engineering required to meet the government's obligations to the international, military and civil communities, and system requirements verification.  OCX acquisition was established to 1) provide command and control of legacy and GPS III satellites, 2) incorporate situational awareness to support Navigation Warfare (NAVWAR) and signal monitoring, 3) enable mission capability upgrades to support warfighter effects-based approach to operations and 4) integrate DoD information assurance and cyber security controls and capabilities.  GPS Enterprise Integrator is responsible for architecture and system definition (the analysis and definition, management, maintenance, and evolution of the GPS Enterprise requirements and interface technical documents) as well as for the planning, execution, and fielding of the GPS Enterprise.

OCX funds will support efforts such as engineering studies and analyses, architectural engineering studies, trade studies, technology needs forecasting, modernization initiatives, systems engineering, system development, test and evaluation efforts and mission operations. These activities support upgrades and product improvements for military and civil applications necessary to enable efforts to protect U.S. military and allies' use of GPS.  Additionally, funds will ensure OCX efforts meet current and future Joint Requirements Oversight Council approved required capabilities.

GPS benefits both military and civil users in air, space, sea and land operations. The GPS Enterprise consists of Space, Ground Control, Nuclear Detonation (NUDET) Detection System (NDS) and User Equipment Segments.  The government is responsible for the integration of the GPS Segments such that they provide worldwide GPS capability to support the warfighter and over a billion national security, civil, allied, and commercial GPS users. 
 
The GPS Enterprise Integrator project includes the efforts associated with the Government's prime contract tasks necessary to accomplish this critical integrating function with the entire GPS user community.  The Enterprise Integrator maintains the GPS current architecture and system definition, controls and validates interfaces, ensures compatibility of Generation II and III systems, and develops/manages plans for execution and fielding of the GPS Enterprise.  Further, the Enterprise Integrator provides modeling, simulation and technical analyses of impacts for Government-directed enterprise-level trades among the GPS segments leading to definition, management, maintenance, and evolution of the GPS Enterprise requirements and interface technical documents to build and ensure the integrity of the enterprise technical baseline, and perform system requirements verification.

In addition, the GPS Enterprise Integrator project funds the technical evolution, risk reduction, enterprise-level testing and delivery of all GPS Enterprise capabilities.  Examples for Generation II include electronic protection and additional civil signals; for Generation III, additional anti-jamming protection.  To accomplish this, the GPS Enterprise Integrator delivers Test and Verification capabilities, Requirements and Interface Management, and Systems Integration support across the Space, Control, and User Segments.  In this capacity, the Enterprise Integrator is responsible for managing this cross-program work to provide these and other capabilities.  GPS Enterprise Integrator's analyses guide government decisions to ensure efficient and effective synchronization and execution across all Generation II and III GPS programs.  For Enterprise-wide integration to be successful, the Integrator: works with the GPS and NDS prime contractor teams to develop plans for early risk reduction System Integration Demonstrations to ensure system interfaces and functionality meet user and system requirements; ensures all equipment and documentation is ready when needed; integrates and analyzes enterprise schedules, conducts formal test and verification, including Requirement Verification Plans, and System Test Plans and Procedures.  GPS Enterprise Integrator performs all these efforts across all GPS programs in all acquisition phases.  The government owns the Enterprise system requirements and integration, and highly leverages the Enterprise Integrator team to eliminate the need to fund a development prime contractor to perform these functions.  This enhances government control, oversight and program accountability.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that were fielded or received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a space based positioning, navigation and timing distribution system, which operates through all weather.  This project funds the research and development for the GPS next generation operational control system (OCX).  This includes, but is not limited to, advanced concept development, systems engineering and analysis, modernized control segment and mission planning, development, training simulators, integrated logistics support products, and test resources.

OCX acquisition was established to 1) provide command and control of legacy and GPS III satellites, 2) incorporate situational awareness to support Navigation Warfare (NAVWAR) and signal monitoring, 3) enable mission capability upgrades to support warfighter effects-based approach to operations and 4) integrate DoD information assurance and cyber security controls and capabilities.  OCX funds will support efforts such as engineering studies and analyses, architectural engineering studies, trade studies, technology needs forecasting, technology development, systems engineering, system development, test and evaluation efforts and mission operations in support of upgrades and product improvements for military and civil applications necessary to support efforts to protect U.S. military and allies' use of GPS.  Additionally, funds will ensure efforts to meet current and future Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) approved required capabilities. 

OCX Block 0 (Iterations 1.4 and 1.5) is the Launch and Control System (LCS) intended to conduct Launch and Early Orbit (LEO) operations and the on-orbit checkout of all GPS III satellites.  OCX Block 0 is a subset of OCX Block 1.  

OCX Block 1 (adds Iterations 1.6, 1.7 and 2.1 to Block 0) fields the operational capability to control all legacy satellites and civil signals (L1C/A), military signals (L1P(Y), L2P(Y)) as well as the GPS III satellites and the modernized civil signal (L2C) and the aviation safety-of-flight signal (L5).  In addition, Block 1 will field the basic operational capability to control the modernized signals (L1M and L2M (M-Code)), and the globally compatible signal (L1C).  It also fully meets information assurance/cyber defense requirements.

OCX Block 2 (adds Iteration 2.2 to Block 1) fields the advanced operational capability to control the modernized signals (L1M and L2M (M-Code)).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Air Force is pursuing a "Block" approach to the next generation GPS control segment (OCX) to rapidly respond to warfighter capability requirements. The Block acquisition strategy approach follows the "Back to Basics" space program acquisition philosophy which focuses on mission success and on-time delivery. Additionally, the strategy calls for capability (e.g., better signal maintainability, Unified S-Band (USB), Search and Rescue (SAR) GPS, and near-real time C2) on-ramps for the follow-on contract for GPS III SVs (starting no earlier than SV11) which will require updates to the OCX ground segment. Enterprise studies will ensure GPS Enterprise synchronization across space and ground segments.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Global Positioning System (GPS) Enterprise Integrator (EI) integrates, synchronizes, tests and verifies the four ACAT I Defense Acquisition Programs that constitute the GPS Enterprise to deliver reliable Positioning, Navigation, and Timing signal capability to military operators, the civil user community, and international partners.  The Government Program Office owns and approves the technical baseline and is responsible for the successful fielding of all the GPS Segments.  To successfully execute its responsibilities, the Government relies upon the specific expertise of the GPS Enterprise Integrator to integrate segment products and verify that system requirements are met.

The GPS Enterprise Integrator project is responsible for the development and management of the Enterprise technical baseline.  The technical baseline consists of more than 6400 specifications and 330 interface documents.  The technical baseline reflects the requirements of multiple stakeholder groups such as the Department of Defense (DoD), foreign governments and allies, industry, the general public (through four Interface specifications), and ensures GPS capabilities meet the needs of warfighters, civil agencies, commercial entities, international treaties, and over 4B global GPS users.  The Enterprise Integrator manages the process through which the JROC requirements are matured and flowed down to the segments of the system and that interfaces are clearly defined.  This enables the GPS system to meet Title 10 of the U.S. Code, Section 2281, mandated GPS capabilities as well as obligations to the international community and allied nations, to provide, inter-operable PNT signals.  The Enterprise Integrator is also responsible for all aspects of schedule and technical alignment across the segments.  The Enterprise Integrator creates and manages plans that provide for early exercise of the products under development, compatibility analysis, and intersegment testing thereby reducing risk.  The intersegment tests are required to prove the interoperability of OCX, GPS III, and modernized user equipment.  The Enterprise Integrator's test efforts also extend to validating that GPS can be used for civil aircraft navigation.

The Enterprise Integrator activity supports the Government Program Office's GPS spectrum protection at international forums such as the International Telecommunications Union, assisting the United States when negotiating with foreign partners. In addition, the Enterprise Integrator provides technical expertise and continuity for maintaining relationships with other U.S. government agencies to include the FAA, NGA, NASA, as well as the Departments of State, Transportation, Homeland Security, and Commerce. Spectrum expertise from the Enterprise Integrator ensures GPS priority over eight essential spectrum signals such as the safety of life signal, L5, which is required for civil air navigation. Spectrum Protection prevents encroachment from commercial or foreign entities, which preserves reliable signals to warfighters and civil users, ensuring military operations and the integrity of the global economic infrastructure. The Enterprise Integrator is the GPS enterprise expert for Information Assurance (IA), Cyber Security, System Safety, and System Security, ultimately ensuring a protected GPS Signal for both the military and civil users from emerging cyber threats. The Enterprise Integrator is accountable for the development, execution, and analysis of OCX cyber security and IA test cases, which are necessary to deliver a secure, operational system, protected against adversarial cyber-attacks intended to deny, disrupt, or degrade GPS operations.

The Enterprise Integrator supports the Government development and implementation of various Systems engineering documents, defines the methods of verification, conducts the analyses or tests, and assists the government in leading Integrated System Tests.  The Enterprise Integrator validates the system performance in various mission threat scenarios during its development.  The Enterprise Integrator provides deep, technical, highly specific expertise.  The GPS EI functions enhance government control, oversight and program accountability.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>In accordance with a "back to basics" acquisition approach and exercise of strong oversight of development contractors, the Air Force is required to exercise complete ownership of the architecture, system definition, and integration of the GPS space, ground, and user segments.  This complex inter-segment integration is traditionally performed by a prime contractor under a systems development contract.  To eliminate the need to fund a development prime contractor to perform these functions, the government leverages systems engineering and integration expertise from both Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) contractors and a Systems Engineering &amp; Integration (SE&amp;I) contractor.  GPS Enterprise Integrator function of the SE&amp;I contractor is currently funded within this Program Element (PE).  The SE&amp;I effort was originally procured in 2007 through a full and open competition.  It was subsequently extended to support the timing and competitive award of a new SE&amp;I contract which is currently in a full and open competition source selection.  The SE&amp;I follow-on strategy builds in year over year cost reductions as requirements stabilize.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY2016 PE 0604233F Specialized Undergraduate Flight Training, Project 654102 JPATS was transferred to Budget Activity 7 as it no longer met the criteria for Budget Activity 5.

In FY2016 Project 674101 Undergraduate Remotely Piloted Aircraft Training includes a new start effort for Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) Predator Reaper Integrated Mission Environment (PRIME) Desktop Training System (DTS). 

In FY2016 Project 676034 Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) was completed.

In FY2016 Project 676035 T-6 Operational System Development includes new start efforts for studies &amp; development efforts to support future ACAT III Engineering Change Proposals(ECPs) to the T-6 Aircraft.  This includes development for the FAA mandated ACAT III program for ADS-B Out and associated upgrades.

In FY2016 Project 676037 T-38 Operational Systems Development includes a new start effort for Block upgrades to incorporate software and/or hardware improvements to comply with new requirements mandated by Department of Defense, Federal Aviation Administration or National Airspace System (DoD/FAA/NAS) and to address flight safety issues.  The block upgrades support the T-38C aircraft and Aircrew Training Devices (ATD).</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Supports Air Education and Training Command's (AETC) implementation of Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training (SUPT) and the Department of Defense initiative for joint pilot training.
   Undergraduate Remotely Piloted Aircraft Training supports Air Education and Training Command's (AETC) implementation of Undergraduate Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) Training (URT).  This program provides and maintains the currency of Predator Reaper Integrated Mission Environment (PRIME) Desktop Training System (DTS)
   The Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) is a joint USAF/USN venture to replace the Services' fleets of primary trainer aircraft (T-37 and T-34 respectively) and their associated Ground Based Training Systems (GBTS) with the T-6 and its GBTS.  The Air Force is the Executive Service. 
  T-6 Operational System Development continues follow on development activities to JPATS including studies &amp; development efforts to support future ACAT III Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) to the T-6 Aircraft, instructional courseware, and logistics support to include Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS) and development activities related to DMSMS. Included is development for the FAA mandated ACAT III program for ADS-B Out and associated upgrades. Also included is development of the aircraft Mission Planning System (MPS) support to obtain Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS) currency and certification for T-6 flight operations.  The JMPS requirements are levied from outside the T-6 JPATS program office and may or may not correlate with block upgrade requirements.  
    T-38 Operational System Development continues follow on development activities  for the T-38 including studies &amp; development efforts to support future ACAT III Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) to address obsolescence issues and the regular block upgrades are required to keep the system current. Block upgrades incorporate software and/or hardware improvements to comply with new requirements mandated by Department of Defense, Federal Aviation Administration or National Airspace System (DoD/FAA/NAS) and to address flight safety issues.  The block upgrades support the T-38C aircraft and Aircrew Training Devices (ATD).

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>In FY 2016 Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) Predator Reaper Integrated Mission Environment (PRIME) Desktop Training System (DTS) includes new Start efforts for PRIME.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Supports Air Education and Training Command's (AETC) implementation of Undergraduate Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) Training (URT).  URT produces RPA pilots and Sensor Operators from accession sources to man RPA squadrons.   Success of the program is heavily dependent on Predator Reaper Integrated Mission Environment (PRIME) Desktop Training System (DTS) to prepare undergraduate students for entry in RPA Formal Training Units (FTU).  PRIME has completed 6 Phases of development and is now at baseline functionality.  PRIME evolved from a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) A-10 Warthog desktop trainer into a desktop similar to the Reaper training system now in use to train undergraduate RPA pilots and sensor operators.  PRIME currently emulates the MQ-9 Reaper and needs to keep pace with that baseline system and expand to other RPAs in order to keep training relevant.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

In FY2016 Project 676034 Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) was completed.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) is a joint USAF/USN venture to replace the Services' fleets of primary trainer aircraft (T-37 and T-34, respectively) and associated Ground Based Training Systems (GBTS).  Additionally the US Army will be purchasing four T-6 Army Variant aircraft to replace the T-34 aircraft for the Army Test and Evaluation Command.  The T-6 aircraft and GBTS are used to train entry-level student aviators in the fundamentals of flying so they can transition into advanced training tracks leading to qualification as military pilots, combat systems officers, and naval flight officers.  The program includes the purchase of aircraft, simulators, and other associated ground-based training devices, Training Integration Management System (TIMS), instructional courseware, and logistics support to include Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS) and development activities related to DMSMS.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>JPATS was competitively awarded with the intent of maximizing the use of commercially available equipment and best commercial practices.  Initially, the JPATS Program competitively awarded two contracts:  a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) Operations and Maintenance funded contract and a Fixed Price Incentive Firm Target (FPIF) manufacturing development (MD)/production contract with seven options.  The follow-on contract production for both the air vehicle and GBTS was awarded as a FAR Part 15 action. The  FFP CLS Operations and Maintenance funded contract is a FAR Part 15 action.

FY16 is the final year of development funded efforts under the JPATS ACAT IC program.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>In FY2016 Project 676037 T-38 Operational Systems Development includes a new start effort for Block upgrades to incorporate software and/or hardware improvements to comply with new requirements mandated by Department of Defense, Federal Aviation Administration or National Airspace System (DoD/FAA/NAS) and to address flight safety issues.  The block upgrades support the T-38C aircraft and Aircrew Training Devices (ATD).

Due to T-38's advanced age, many parts are either obsolete or will become obsolete.  Research is necessary to determine how, and with what to address the issues.  When solutions are identified, source funding may either be acquisition or sustainment, whichever is appropriate.</r2:ProjectNote>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The T-38 Operations System Development acquisition strategy for satisfying emerging software and hardware requirements is designed to enable competition and cost control.  Developmental requirements resulting from Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages will be evaluated and implemented incrementally to efficiently deliver required capabilities to AETC.  System Block upgrades will utilize technical data rights to enable support the T-38C's federated systems architecture.
    The Avionics Component Integration (AvCI) contract is currently in the source selection process.  The current contract strategy is projected to be a Type D IDIQ contract competitively awarded to address T-38C avionics system obsolescence issues and provide CLS follow-on support.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Stateside Affordable Radar System (STARS) is an ARMY effort managed by the Joint Integrated Air and Missile Defense Office (JIAMDO). For further details, please refer to PE 0604445J.

Beginning in FY14, PE 0604445F funds the development and installation of STARS Engineering Developmental Models (EDMs). The EDMs will be part of a demonstration to evaluate further development and fielding of STARS as a means to improve the existing air surveillance capabilities for homeland defense. 

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded, or have received approval for full rate production, and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The 5000 lb demonstration is an integration of BLU-113 warhead with a Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) tail kit, scaled if necessary from smaller or larger warhead control design, to provide accurate, precision, reliable, hard target penetration capability.  The required accuracy shall be "JDAM like" as defined by the operational requirements community.  The greater overall system performance will tighten dispersion capability where multiple weapons are released from the same aircraft on the same pass, and hit the same impact crater.  The BLU-113 is an objective requirement of the 2002 JDAM Operational Requirements Document (ORD).  Weapon system will have an identical Concept of Operations (CONOPS) as existing USAF inventory for Global Positioning System-aided Inertial Navigation System (GPS-aided INS) weapons, and compatibility with aircraft Operational Flight Profile (OFP).

                                    <r2:Description>The 5000 lb demonstration is an integration of the BLU-113 warhead with a guidance kit that provides accurate, reliable, tight dispersion, hard target penetration capability.  JDAM accuracy expands the drill down CONOPS used by the GBU-31 (2000 lb class warhead) to a 5000 lb concept, holding harder and deeper targets at risk.  This is an objective requirement of the 2001 JDAM ORD.  The 5000 lb weapon expands USG capability using JDAM proven performance, identical CONOPS as existing JDAM inventory, and compatibility with aircraft Operational Flight Profile (OFP).

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Air Force Integrated Personnel and Pay System (AFIPPS) will be a web-enabled, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solution that will integrate many existing personnel and pay processes into one self-service system. The system represents the AF commitment to modernizing business practices and providing enhanced support for today's service members and their families. AFIPPS will align with DoD data standards for personnel, pay, and accounting, including the Common Human Resource Information Standards (CHRIS), which will ensure compliance with the Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA).  The AFIPPS program will be bound by using the BEA "Hire-to-Retire" (H2R) construct.  Eighty-four percent of the BEA's H2R activities are within the scope of AFIPPS.

The purpose of AFIPPS is to provide the AF with a sustainable, cost-effective, auditable, and regulatory-compliant method of effectively capturing and maintaining personnel information so that Service members are paid accurately and on-time without requiring repetitive action or onerous paperwork, while allowing commanders/managers to easily access pertinent information.

The goal of AFIPPS, as documented in the Capability Development Document (CDD) signed 05 Jul 11, is to fully integrate personnel and pay management for the AF's Total Force (Regular Air Force (RegAF), Air National Guard (ANG), and Air Force Reserve (AFRes)).  The future state will be characterized by streamlined, Total Force business processes; efficient and accurate management of pay entitlements; auditable financial statements with regard to military pay; improved access to accurate and timely personnel data for authorized users; and a modernized IT systems environment that is cost-effective and can adapt to future needs.

AFIPPS's customers include approximately 620,000 AF Service members across all components (RegAF, ANG, and AFRes) as well as thousands of military leaders of different ranks, specialties, and career fields who are responsible for the conduct of AF operations that rely on these services to ensure Service members with the appropriate skill sets are deployed where needed at home and on the battlefield.  Congress, the rest of the Department of Defense (DoD), and other federal agencies all rely on accurate AF Human Resources (HR) data to make key decisions that affect how the US military is organized, funded, deployed, and maintained.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>AFIPPS Acquisition Strategy consists of multiple capability releases that are developed and fielded in 2 separate contracts. The Government will conduct a Full and Open competition to award each of the two contracts which will deliver the integrated personnel and pay system for the military Total Force (i.e. RegAF, ANG, and AFRes). The Acquisition Strategy also specifies that Contract 2 awardee will act as system integrator."

AFIPPS will deliver severable and discrete capability releases under two contracts. Each capability release builds upon and incorporates the previous baseline. Contract 1 includes the effort to blueprint for all releases. The primary contract type is Fixed Price Incentive Firm (FPIF). Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF) and Firm Fixed Price (FFP) are used for the smaller portions of the contract, as appropriate.

Contract 1 will deliver blueprinting products for each capability release. Contract 2 will have a basic contract for the ARC-to-Mission Release, with options for subsequent Releases (Officers and Enlisted/Cadet Pay), each of which represents a fieldable capability for the Air Force human resources mission.  AFIPPS will provide a fully integrated personnel and pay service capability for the Total Force to fully use capabilities in the COTS software, minimize customization of the ERP and sustainment costs and maximize the life of the system. Contract 2 will be awarded through full and open competition with details to be determined via the Contract 2 acquisition strategy process.

Air Force Program Executive Officer (PEO) for Business and Enterprise Systems (AFPEO BES) is the PEO for AFIPPS.  Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) is the Contracting Authority for the AFIPPS Program and provides Contracts, Legal, and Comptroller support. The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics [OUSD(AT&amp;L)] is the program's Milestone Decision Authority (MDA).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Air Force is the DoD Anti-Tamper Executive Agent (ATEA).  The ATEA is responsible for developing and implementing Anti-Tamper (AT) policy, coordinating and providing financial support for AT technology development and evaluations, hardware/software vulnerability assessments, laboratory infrastructure, establishing and maintaining a data bank/library of Anti-Tamper technologies, providing proper security mechanisms, providing outreach and education to the AT Community, and conducting effective validation and evaluations of  AT implementations.  The purpose of AT is to protect critical program information (CPI) in U.S. weapon systems that may be sold to foreign governments or that could possibly fall into enemy hands.  AT protections will permit the U.S. to preserve its technological advantage of critical weapons systems while supporting the warfighters mission requirements.  Furthermore, AT will add longevity to DoD critical technologies by deterring efforts to reverse engineer or develop weapon countermeasures against the system or system component. 
  
The DoD ATEA will coordinate technology development and enhancement efforts among the DoD Services/Agencies, National Laboratories, and industry.  The DoD ATEA acquisition strategy is to fund development of new AT technology, as well as enhancing existing AT technology efforts to increase the technology readiness level (TRL).  The AT technology development and enhancement efforts will occur in multiple areas, including the following:  Advanced sensor hardware, secure processing, crypto-analysis, tamper penalties, and power solutions.  Emerging research in the areas of materials, cryptography and electronic circuits has the potential to bring new AT capabilities that have reduced power needs and smaller form factor.  The goal of the research is to mature promising technologies to the point that they can be transitioned to a program office or industry for implementation in our weapons systems.  Priorities will be given to those technologies that most benefit the DoD AT community.

All DoD acquisition programs, Foreign Military Sales, and Direct Commercial Sales with CPI and/or resident critical program information (RCPI) require a validated AT Plan. The AT program includes resources required for the subject matter experts (SMEs) to review AT Plans and conduct AT validation, and perform AT assessments of both commercial off the shelf and government of the shelf products.  To maintain its advantage, the AT program continues to improve its AT hardware/software assessment capabilities.   These capabilities include the acquisition of specialized equipment, maintenance and/or renovations to support the integration of this equipment, and modifications to new and/or existing laboratory facilities to meet equipment and security requirements.

This program is in Budget Activity 07, Operational System Development, because it includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding.

The FY2016 funding request was reduced by $3.000 million to account for the availability of prior execution balances.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY16, the HC-MC 130 RECAP RDT&amp;E efforts moved from BA 05 PE 0605278F / Project 655249 to BA 07 PE 0605278F / Project 675006.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>HC/MC-130 Recapitalization will replace and augment the aging USAF fleets of combat rescue HC-130P/N and special operations MC-130E/P aircraft which are experiencing airworthiness, maintainability and operational limitations.  The HC/MC-130 Recap Capabilities Production Document (CPD) defines a common baseline configuration for the weapon system and a FY 2012 Initial Operational Capability.  The Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) validated the CPD in Aug 2009. 

This program will develop and integrate changes from discrepancies found during EMD flight test, operational use, and common C-130J block upgrades during HC/MC production.  The C-130J program (PE 0401132F) developed Blocks 7.0 and 8.1 separately but all other platforms (including HC/MC) will have combined Block 7.0/8.1 trial kit install and modification programs and will be known simply as Block 8.1.

Block 8.1 primarily addresses mandated Communication, Navigation, and Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) requirements.  It also incorporates capabilities such as Link 16, a new Flight Managment System (FMS), Civil GPS Navigation, Identification Friend or FOE (IFF) transponder Mode-5, Civil Data-link,  and Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B).

This program has met the condtions of Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.  Starting with the FY16 PB, the HC-MC 130 RECAP 3600 efforts moved from BA 05 PE 0605278F / Project 655249 to BA 07 PE 0605278F / Project 675006.  The descriptions and funding for efforts FY15 and prior are included in the R-Docs under BA 05 PE 0605278F.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>In FY2016, HC/MC-130 Recap BA5 efforts were transferred from PE 0605278F, Project Number 655249, HC/MC-130 Recap, as the program achieved full rate production.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>HC/MC-130 Recapitalization will replace and augment the aging USAF fleets of combat rescue HC-130P/N and special operations MC-130E/P aircraft which are experiencing airworthiness, maintainability and operational limitations.  The HC/MC-130 Recap Capabilities Production Document (CPD) defines a common baseline configuration for the weapon system and a FY 2012 Initial Operational Capability.  The Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) validated the CPD in Aug 2009. 

This program will develop and integrate changes from discrepancies found during development and operational flight test, and common C-130J block upgrades during HC/MC production.  The HC/MC Block 8.1 program follows the same "Block Upgrade" strategy being used in the C-130J program (PE 0401132F).

The internationally developed Block 8.1 program addresses mandated Communication, Navigation, and Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) requirements.  It also incorporates capabilities such as Link 16, a new Flight Managment System (FMS), Civil GPS Navigation, Identification Friend or FOE (IFF) transponder Mode-5, Civil Data-link,  and Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B).

The HC/MC Block 8.1 RDT&amp;E effort integrates Block 8.1 into an HC-130J and a MC-130J via a trial kit install effort followed by a Development and Operational Test effort.  

Block 8.1 Production line cut-in is planned with the FY 2019 aircraft buys.  A fleet modification program will also begin in FY 2019.

Beginning in FY 2016, this program has met the condtions of Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full-rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

FY 2015 and prior this program was funded in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting valiadated requirements prior to full-rate production.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

In FY 2016, Project 675039, B-52 System Improvements, includes new start effort(s) for potential engineering studies &amp; analysis and test &amp; evaluation."</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>B-52 System Improvements is a comprehensive project to ensure B-52 viability to perform current and future wartime missions to include datalinks, navigation, sensors, weapons, electronic warfare (EW), and training capabilities. B-52 System Improvements integrates and adds both tactical and global datalink communications for real time command and control, targeting, and intelligence. It upgrades antiquated Air Traffic Management (ATM) systems with those supported by three key functions using satellite technology: Communications, Navigation and Surveillance (CNS). B-52 System Improvements upgrades training devices to support aircrew and maintenance training with the latest B-52 capability. In addition, it improves conventional warfare capability with additional MIL-STD-1760 smart weapons and improved weapons carriage and fully integrates advanced targeting pods with the offensive avionics system. It studies, analyzes, and tests aircraft systems' hardness to Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) weapons effects, such as Low Level Continuous Wave (LLCW) and High altitude Electromagnetic Pulse (HEMP) Survivability tests. It upgrades mission critical systems to survive in CBRN environments. B-52 System Improvements upgrades or replaces legacy defensive EW systems to include the radar warning receiver, jammers, chaff and flare dispensers and situational awareness displays as well as integration of offensive EW such as the Miniature Air-Launched Decoy (MALD) and MALD-Jammer (MALD-J).

Engineering Studies &amp; Analysis and Test &amp; Evaluation
B-52 System Improvements funds test activities at the Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC), engineering and planning studies for potential future weapon system enhancements (weapons, sensors, avionics, and EW) and emerging requirement on current projects, upgrades to the B-52 Systems Integration Laboratory (SIL), Avionics Integration Support Facility (AISF), and Weapon System Trainers (WSTs and other operations/maintenance trainers), and weapon system operational/safety, supportability, reliability, and Total Ownership Cost (TOC) improvements.

Additional Efforts
B-52 System Improvements funds additional efforts that stem from the operation and maintenance of a 50-plus-year-old aircraft, such as parts obsolescence, Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS), and emerging requirements to add to or maintain the existing capabilities. Examples include, but are not limited to upgrades to radar,outdated avionics computers, communications and security updates,mission planning interfaces to Joint Mission Planning Software (JMPS), Air Force Mission Support System (AFMSS), upgrades to the EW suite, and studies and analysis. All B-52 development projects support planned requirements for unique identification in their production phases.

B-52 COMBAT NETWORK COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY (CONECT) (BPAC 675050)
The B-52 CONECT acquisition project supports nuclear and conventional operations by upgrading the B-52 fleet with tactical datalink and voice communications capabilities along with improved threat and situational awareness to support participation in network centric operations. The CONECT upgrade includes new Multi-Functional Color Displays (MFCDs) and a digital interphone system, which will survive and function through the nuclear environment to enhance crew interaction and situational awareness. To enable net centric operations, the CONECT upgrade integrates: on-board client/server architecture supporting distributed processing with independent control functions; UHF Beyond Line-Of-Sight (BLOS) Joint Range Extension (JRE) capability via ARC-210 Warrior radio to exchange J-Series messaging within theater; Intelligence Broadcast Receiver (IBR); limited Internet Protocol (IP) based UHF BLOS link supporting voice, e-mail and file transfers; and Improved Data Modem (IDM)-based digital Variable Message Format (VMF) datalink to significantly enhance close air support (CAS) missions. This integrated suite will provide the B-52 fleet with a machine-to-machine data transfer capability supporting aircraft re-tasking and retargeting of Conventional Air Launched Cruise Missile (CALCM) and J-series weapons across the range of B-52 military operations and missions. This requirement's Capability Production Document (CPD) was validated by the Air Force Requirement's Oversight Council (AFROC) on 16 September 2008.

Trainers and Upgrades for CONECT
In order to maintain currency with the latest aircraft configuration, the CONECT project will update existing trainers or use computer-based training to add CONECT functionality to meet user-training requirements, and update/maintain the SIL for the WSTs.

B-52 1760 INTERNAL WEAPONS BAY UPGRADE (IWBU) (BPAC 675048)
The 1760 IWBU requires the integration of the 1760 weapons capability into the bomb bay on 78 B-52H aircraft, which includes two Ground Instructional Training Aircraft (GITA), utilizing 44 Common Strategic Rotary Launcher (CSRLs) converted into Conventional Rotary Launchers (CRLs), where three of the CRLs will be modified under Engineering Manufacturing and Development (EMD) for test purposes. This requirement's Capability Development Document (CDD) was validated by the AFROCC in June 2013. The 1760 IWBU project provides internal and external carriage for eight MIL STD 1760 weapons and consists of two sub increments: 1.1 and 1.2.

Increment 1.1 consists of internal carriage of eight Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM) and variants, to include Laser JDAM (L/JDAM), on a conventional rotary launcher. Additionally, this increment develops the capability for external carriage for 16 L/JDAM on Heavy Storage Adaptor Beam.

Increment 1.2 develops the capability for internal carriage of eight Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles (JASSM) and its variants, to include JASSM-Extended Range (JASSM-ER), and eight Miniature Air Launched Decoys (MALD) and its variants, to include MALD Jammer (MALD-J). This increment also develops the capability for external carriage for 12 JASSM-ER.

GPS-INTERFACE UNIT (GPS-IU)REPLACEMENT (BPAC 675055)
Global Positioning System (GPS) Interface Unit (IU) Upgrade will replace three circuit card assemblies in the GPS-IU, as well as the backplane (to integrate the new and old CCAs): the Central Processing Unit/1553, the power supply CCA, and the video graphics card.

These projects are in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>B-52 System Improvements is a comprehensive project to ensure B-52 viability to perform current and future wartime missions.  To facilitate future capabilities, scope of work may involve development of Analysis of Alternatives (AoA), Studies and Analysis, Capability Development Documents (CDD) or any other analysis or paper work necessary to establish a program of record.  Additionally, this project may lead to airborne integration experiments or demonstrations of emerging technologies. B-52 System Improvements will encompass the following major aircraft areas but is not limited to the examples given within each area.

Avionics - Offensive and Defensive; Electronic Warfare systems require upgrades to continue to protect the aircraft in the battle space. Radar Modernization is require to ensure the aircraft can perform the mission in today's environment and resolve current mean time between repair issues with legacy radar.  Global Positioning Satellite Interface Unit (GPS-IU) requires replacement due to throughput issues. 

Navigation - Communication, Navigation and Surveillance and Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) upgrades are required to comply with ever increasing FAA requirements. Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) upgrade FAA mandate for FY20. GPS guidance unit requires upgrade to new military M-Code standard.

Situational Awareness (SA) - upgrades to current SA systems is require to ensure the B-52 maintains battle space awareness of intelligence broadcasts, friendly force locations, enemy forces and any emerging threats within the Area of Responsibility (AOR).  Adaptation of new data links as well as addition of existing links is crucial to the B-52 remaining relevant to the integrated airborne battle space.

Weapons/Targeting Pod Integration - Improves conventional warfare capability with additional MIL-STD-1760 smart weapons and improved weapons carriage and fully integrates advanced targeting pods with the offensive avionics system. Integrate emerging targeting pods to include optical and radar targeting capabilities.  

Communications - current UHF communications systems require upgrades due to legacy radios and satellite systems rearing end of life.  Multiple User Objective System (MUOS) satellite deployments will require the B-52 to upgrade legacy UHF radios to remain relevant.  New technology Beyond line of Sight (BLOS) and Line of Sight (LOS) radios are emerging and required on the B-52 to ensure communications continue in the AOR.  Extreme High Frequency (EHF) program required to meet Nuclear Command Authority two way communications.

Flight Systems - current Jet A fuel used freezes at higher temperatures than previous fuel and therefore requires the addition of an internal fuel tank monitoring system to ensure the fuel does not gel and freeze while flying at altitude. In additiona, the B-52 requires a new Environmental Control System (ECS) upgrade to support any new major aircraft modifications. EHF studies have indicated this will be a needed modification for integration depending on the terminal selection.

Nuclear Systems - studies, analyzes, and tests aircraft systems' hardness to Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) weapons effects, such as Low Level Continuous Wave (LLCW) and High altitude Electromagnetic Pulse (HEMP) Survivability tests.  It upgrades mission critical systems to survive in CBRN environments.

Electronic Flight Bags - require a system for displaying aircrew checklists on a permanent display.  This supports current AF requirements to reduce carry on paper checklists.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>MIL-STD-1760 Internal Weapons Bay Upgrade (IWBU) requires the integration of the 1760 weapons capability into the bomb bay on 78 B-52H aircraft, which includes two Ground Instructional Training Aircraft (GITA), utilizing 44 Common Strategic Rotary Launcher (CSRLs) converted into Conventional Rotary Launchers (CRLs), where three of the CRLs will be modified under Engineering Manufacturing and Development (EMD) for test purposes. The 1760 IWBU project is segmented into increments.  Increment 1.0 provides internal and external carriage and consists of two sub increments: 1.1 and 1.2. This requirement's Capability Development Document (CDD) was validated by the Air Force Requirements Oversight Council (AFROC) in June 2013.  

Increment 1.1 

Increment 1.1 develops the capability for internal carriage of eight Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM) and variants, to include Laser JDAM (L/JDAM), on a rotary launcher. This increment also develops the capability for external carriage for 16 L/JDAM. The CRL Hardware modification consists of Group A (equipment racks and electrical wiring) and Group B (one Survivability/Vulnerability (SV) junction box and one Integrated Weapons Interface Unit (IWIU) per CRL). The IWIU Line Replaceable Unit (LRU) was previously developed under the Advanced Weapons Integration (AWI) project. No CSRL replacements will be required as a result of this project.  Increment 1.1 completed Preliminary Design Review in February 2013 and awarded an EMD contract in September 2013.  Critical Design Review (CDR) was conducted in October 2013.  An IBR was conducted in February 2014, validating cost and schedule baselines.     

Aircraft Hardware Development:  None

Software Development: Consists of modifying aircraft Operational Flight Program (OFP) software, JDAM Stores Management Overlays (SMO) and ground based Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS).

CRL Hardware Development: Consists of modifying USSTRATCOM provided CSRLs by replacing nuclear mission equipment with Group B hardware and wiring interfaces. Group A includes equipment racks and electrical wiring; Group B includes one Survivability/Vulnerability (SV) junction box and one IWIU per CRL. The IWIU LRU was previously developed under the AWI project and work was previously accomplished during a 2005 demonstration and developed using 2006 and 2007 Congressional Add funding.  Three CSRLs will be modified using RDT&amp;E funds.

Support Equipment:  Consists of developing software and 38 rotary launcher cable adapter sets on existing Multi-Use System Tester Armament Next Generation (MUSTANG) testers to interface with the CRL. 
Increment 1.2 

Increment 1.2 develops the capability for internal carriage of eight Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles (JASSM) and its variants, to include JASSM Extended Range (JASSM-ER), and eight Miniature Air Launched Decoys (MALD) and its variants, to include MALD Jammer (MALD-J).  This increment also develops the capability for external carriage for 12 JASSM-ER.

Upon completion of JASSM/ER software development, an interim capability providing for carriage and deployment of no less than 16 JASSM/ER (4 bay, 12 external) is planned.  A limited DT/OT will validate this capability in advance of hardware design completion and validation.   

Aircraft Hardware Development:  Development of Group A wiring and circuit breakers to supply additional power to the CRL per JASSM-ER requirements, for all 76 operational B-52H aircraft, and two Ground Instructional Training Aircraft. 

Software Development: Development of a modification to existing aircraft SMO and weapon (JASSM and MALD) OFP software to allow for internal and external carriage and modification to ground based JMPS.

CRL Hardware Development: Develops Group A associated interface hardware and two Group B LRUs (power supply and power distribution box).  Three CRLs will be modified using RDT&amp;E funds.

Support Equipment:  Consists of developing software updates to the existing MUSTANG to interface with the CRL and the development of additional ground handling support equipment.

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The 1760 Internal Weapons Bay Upgrade project will acquire software development and hardware design via a sole-source contract to Boeing Defense, Space &amp; Security (DSS), Oklahoma City, OK. Deliverables include an updated J-series weapon SMOs (software), three prototype modified CSRLs, six Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) assets, logistics support, ground and flight test support, and engineering drawings.  The project will competitively procure the CRL modification kits for full rate production, and installs of the kits will be completed via Contract Field Teams (CFTs).

Increment 1.1 consists of internal carriage of eight JDAM and variants, to include LJDAM, on a rotary launcher. This increment also develops the capability for external carriage for 16 LJDAM. The CRL Hardware modification consists of Group A (equipment racks and electrical wiring) and Group B (one SV junction box and one IWIU per CRL). 

Increment 1.2 develops the capability for internal carriage of eight JASSM and its variants, to include JASSM-ER, or eight MALD and its variants, to include MALD-J.  This increment also develops the capability for external carriage for 12 JASSM-ER.  Upon completion of JASSM/ER OFP and SMO software coding, an interim capability of no less than 16 JASSM/ER carriage will be vaildated thru DT/OT in FY17.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The B-52 Combat Network Communications Technology (CONECT) acquisition project supports nuclear and conventional operations by upgrading the B-52 fleet with tactical datalink and voice communications capabilities, along with improved threat and situational awareness to support participation in network centric operations. The CONECT upgrade includes new Multi-Functional Color Displays (MFCDs); a digital interphone system, on-board client/server architecture supporting distributed processing with independent control functions;  UHF Beyond Line-Of-Sight (BLOS) Joint Range Extension (JRE) capability Intelligence Broadcast Receiver (IBR); limited Internet Protocol (IP)-based UHF BLOS link supporting voice, e-mail and file transfers; and Improved Data Modem (IDM)-based digital Variable Message Format (VMF) datalink. As the CONECT upgrade brings additional capability to the B-52, emerging communication and security requirements (upgrades to IBR, JRE messages, crypto modernization, etc.) and aircraft upgrades (1760 Internal Weapons Bay Upgrade, Mode S/Mode 5 Identification, Friend or Foe (IFF),etc.) may require study for potential impacts to CONECT.
 
In order to maintain currency with the latest aircraft configuration, the CONECT project will update existing trainers or use computer-based training to add CONECT functionality to meet user-training requirements, and update/maintain the system integration laboratory (SIL) for the Weapon System Trainers (WST).

This project is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Incorporate changes required due to updates in GFE and crypto modernization requirements.  Incorporate/integrate CONECT with recurring updates of the B-52 software baseline. As the CONECT upgrade brings additional capability to the B-52, emerging communication and security requirements (upgrades to the IBR, JRE messages, crypto modernization, etc) and aircraft upgrades (1760 Internal Weapons Bay Upgrade, Mode S/Mode 5 IFF, etc) may require study for potential impacts to CONECT. CONECT will update the existing trainers or use computer-based training to add CONECT functionality to meet user-training requirements, and update/maintain the SIL for the WST.</r2:Text>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>In FY16, Project 675055, GPS-IU, includes new start effort for Global Positioning System (GPS)-Interface Unit(IU) Replacement.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Global Positioning System (GPS) Interface Unit (IU) Upgrade will replace three Circuit Card Assemblies (CCA) in the GPS-IU, as well as the backplane (to integrate the new and old CCAs):  the Central Processing Unit/1553, the power supply CCA, and the video graphics card.  The current inventory of GPS-IU (76 installed on B-52H, plus current inventory levels of 17, plus 1 in the System Integration Laboratory (SIL)) will be upgraded by Prime Contractor Boeing, and the upgraded LRUs replaced using blue-suit installation, using remove-and-replace processes on the flight line (the current maintenance process).  This is a new initiative upgrade to the B-52H platform.

GPS-IU acts as a controller and a communications path between onboard computer systems, ensuring data needed by one system is available in the correct format for the requesting system. Originally developed with a 33MHz processor with 4MB of Static Random Access Memory (SRAM), the GPS-IU has become overloaded as more software has been added to the B-52.  Currently operating at 86% throughput capacity and at 90% memory capacity, it is projected to exceed the designated safety threshold of 95% memory load by 2018.  The GPS-IU is also facing parts obsolescence issues.  Studies show that the current spares will be exhausted by 2018.  The upgrade will address obsolescence, as well as increase memory and throughput capacity to ensure future modernization efforts are successful.

GPS-IU requires upgrading to incorporate any other GPS dependent capabilities on the B-52 platform.  B-52 fleet will have the capability to carry additional GPS dependent weapons and targeting pods, and the increased capacity to incorporate future GPS-dependent capabilities beyond 2018.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The AGM-86B, Air Launched Cruise Missile (ALCM), is a subsonic, air-to-surface strategic nuclear missile, operational since 1982.  Armed with a W80 warhead, it is designed to evade air and ground-based defenses in order to strike targets at any location within any enemy's territory.  The ALCM is designed for B-52H internal and external carriage.  

The purpose of this program is to ensure ALCM sustainability through 2030 in support of Air Force strategic nuclear deterrence and global strike mission requirements.

An ALCM Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) was developed to support ALCM Service Life through 2030.  The results of SLEP studies identified system components and support equipment that will become non-supportable prior to 2030.  Service life extension of this critical weapon is essential to meet United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) deliberate planning commitments. Development funds are required to add capabilities to assist in identifying candidate components for future SLEP efforts.

The Aging and Surveillance program for ALCM continuously assesses critical components and subsystems.  The program identifies aging trends prior to failures in fielded components that would result in fleet-wide reliability and supportability problems.  Development funds are required to update software, test procedures, and test equipment.  FY16 funding will allow for the development of test capabilities for additional ALCM components.  

As part of the build phase of the sustaining engineering approach, the program has developed a plan for ALCM sustainment using a computer-aided decision making process called the ALCM Sustainment Enhancement Toolbox (ASET).  The first phase of ASET is the ALCM Report Recommendation Tool (ARRT) that will develop the software tools to sustain ALCM to 2030.  Funds will also be used to develop test procedures to implement the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS)-directed requirements for Electromagnetic (EM) survivability testing including, but not limited to, High-altitude Electromagnetic Pulse (HEMP), Hazards of EM Radiation to Ordnance (HERO) and High-Powered Microwave (HPM) testing for nuclear systems.

BA7- This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The B-1B Lancer is a swing-wing, supersonic, long-range, conventional bomber.  It carries the largest payload of both guided and unguided weapons in the United States Air Force inventory.  The multi-mission B-1B is the backbone of America's long-range conventional bomber force and can rapidly deliver massive quantities of precision and non-precision weapons against any adversary, anywhere in the world, at any time. The current service life extends beyond 2040.

This effort provides funding for B-1B modernization programs.  These modernization programs alleviate aircraft obsolescence issues due to Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) while at the same time providing improved capabilities to the B-1B weapon system that require significant hardware and software development and testing. 

B-1B training systems upgrades (both flight and maintenance simulators/trainers) provide required training assets for  the aircraft Central Integrated Test System (CITS), Fully Integrated Data Link (FIDL), and Vertical Situational Display Upgrade (VSDU) modernization programs.  These upgrades are required to bring the simulators up to the same configuration of the modernized aircraft.  The B-1B training system provides the war fighter with a fully integrated, cost effective, high fidelity training capability in flight operations, weapons employment, and maintenance of the B-1B weapon system.  

Aircraft RDT&amp;E efforts include development of a Self-Contained Standby Attitude Indicator (SCAI).  This development activity will replace three standby flight indicators (attitude, altimeter, and airspeed) with a more reliable/supportable commercial off-the-shelf display that combines all necessary flight information into one device.   If the primary flight instruments are lost, SCAI will continue to provide the flight information needed to fly the aircraft.  Standby instrumentation must be functional and reliable in the event of primary flight display failure, and is a Mission-Essential Subsystem List (MESL) item required for flight.  

Upgrades to the B-1B flight test aircraft are included in the modernization programs to keep the test flight systems current.  RDT&amp;E funded test jets are currently configured with Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Line Replaceable Units (LRUs) for CITS, FIDL and VSDU.  Replacement of the EMD LRUs is required to bring two flight test aircraft to fleet representative configuration.  Maintenance and logistic support from the manufacturer is required until the Air Force supply chain is established.  Replacement of the LRUs will ensure maximum supportability, maintainability, and reliability for continued and future flight tests.  

Additionally, program funds cover engineering/planning studies, related engineering efforts, and auxiliary equipment needed for development programs that have not yet fielded.  Cost includes Program Management Administrative (PMA) costs and initiatives for anticipated weapon system enhancements, including efforts to improve weapon system operational capabilities, safety, supportability, maintainability, reliability, and total ownership cost.  All B-1B development programs support planned requirements for unique identification in their production phases. 
	
This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development; budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipated production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

The FY2016 funding request was reduced by $1.780 million to account for the availability of prior year balances.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY 2016 Project 675345, B-2 Modernization, includes new start effort for B-2 strategic communication.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The B-2 Spirit is the world's most advanced long-range strike asset. The unique combination of range, precision, payload, and ability to penetrate and operate in anti-access/area denial environments allow the B-2 to identify, locate, target, and destroy the highest value enemy targets. The B-2 can, with necessary upgrades,
accomplish its mission regardless of location, return to base safely, and permit freedom of movement for follow-on forces, including other long range strike platforms. An array of planned RDT&amp;E projects are necessary to preserve a strategic advantage against 21st century threats as well as increase flexibility, lethality, and survivability
of this national asset tasked across a broad spectrum of tactical and national strategic objectives. B-2 will achieve these objectives by adapting mature technologies/ systems in the fleet to rapidly deliver relevant combat capability, leveraging other Department of Defense investments and programs, utilizing innovative acquisition strategies.

The B-2 has a projected service life through 2058. To ensure the fleet can accomplish its nuclear and conventional mission in highly defended and anti-access environments, periodic modernization efforts must be undertaken to upgrade combat capability as well as improve the viability, supportability, and survivability of the weapon system.

Recent and ongoing investments in avionics, structures, communications, and weapons keep the B-2 viable in the immediate future. Current system upgrades include Low Observable Signature and Supportability Modifications,  Defensive Management System Modernization, alternative communication solutions such as Common Very Low Frequency Receiver, Massive Ordnance Penetrator weapon integration and modernization of Global Positioning System hardware and signal enhancement, Flexible Strike Phase 1, Link-16 Center Instrument Display/In-Flight Replanner and Multifunctional Information Distribution System Low Volume Terminal modernization, Training System upgrades, Mission Planning System improvements, flight test aircraft upgrades and base of operations support, integration and testing of upgraded crypto components, and other weapons integration and engine improvements, as well as B-2 platform studies and acquisition planning.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development.  This budget activity includes developmental efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>In FY 2016 Project 675345, B-2 Modernization, includes new start effort for B-2 strategic communication.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The B-2 is currently undergoing modernization of avionics/communications systems, engines, armament systems, low observable components, core training system components, aircraft supportability improvements, support equipment development.

The Air Force will also study multiple structural, avionics, and engine modifications that could improve the performance of the aircraft and engines as well as reduce maintenance manhours and the logistics footprint of the fleet. Focus of the studies will be on non-mission capable (maintenance) drivers, safety issues, and obsolescence issues through modernization of key components in the airframe, avionics, and engines resulting in improved aircraft availability of a high demand/low density fleet.

Modern communications are key enablers for the B-2 in the anti-access/area denial battlespace, and directly enhance lethality and force multiplication. The Common Very Low Frequency (VLF) Receiver effort develops and integrates a receive-only, very low bandwidth VLF receiver and antenna subsystem to provide a secure, survivable strategic nuclear communication capability for the B-2. The receiver will be adaptable for use by other Department of Defense platforms. Secure, survivable, two-way communications in an anti-access/area denial environment remains a requirement for the B-2. The Air Force will assess B-2 strategic communications performance requirements for advanced extremely high frequency (AEHF) and other waveforms, conduct technology maturation, assess affordability impacts, and conduct other acquisition planning activities in anticipation of entering a near-term EMD phase. The Link 16 Multifunctional Information Distribution System block upgrade will provide enhanced security for Link 16 tactical networks and improve the reliability and maintainability of the system.

B-2 Armament upgrades integrate new and/or advanced weapons on the B-2 to attack a wider array of target sets, to include hardened, deeply buried targets, as well as destroy more targets per sortie. The B-2 is the only anti-access/area denial penetrating platform capable of carrying the Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP), a capability which meets Urgent Operational Need requirements. The MOP Quick Reaction Capability effort includes dual fuze control and single Smart Bomb Rack Controller per bay weapon control and monitor. The Flexible Strike Phase 1 program will rehost the current B-2 stores management software onto a new integrated processor; future efforts could update other software and hardware to enable simultaneous multiple weapons carriage capabilities, providing B-2 with maximum strategic nuclear and conventional strike flexibility. The B-2 Weapons System Tester and its associated Test Program Sets (TPS), to include but not limited to, the Common Organizational Level Tester (COLT), and B-2 Replacement Armament Tester, will be continually upgraded for increased reliability and performance to support current and new B-2 weapon suspension and release systems.  B-2 will also integrate the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile Extended Range (JASSM-ER) weapon as well as other Expanded Strike weapons to further enhance the B-2's ability to attack and destroy high value target sets, making this platform the most versatile long range strategic bomber in the Air Force arsenal.

Low Observable Signature and Supportability Modifications (LOSSM) directly address B-2 aircraft availability, the primary stated B-2 user requirement. Given the extremely small fleet size (20 aircraft), mission accomplishment is particularly sensitive to the availability of this high-demand strategic asset. LOSSM projects increase aircraft availability, decrease low observable (LO) maintenance, and maintain and improve the combat-ready LO signature for the B-2 fleet ensuring survivable combat operations. LOSSM projects improve materials, structures, and diagnostic tools necessary to evaluate LO materials and systems in the B-2 fleet. LOSSM structure improvement projects include, but are not limited to, advanced high frequency materials placement, windshield bounce patch and tape improvements, composite plies, advanced signature reduction, and radar radome and antennae improvements. Material improvements include, but are not limited to, tailpipe and inlet coatings, pre-cured gap fillers, and other advanced LO materials development. Diagnostic tool efforts include, but are not limited to, improved radar frequency diagnostics, Signature Diagnostic System database upgrades, Tier One Material Inspection System improvements, Portable Laser Removal Tool development, Next Generation Mapper, SCI-2K Radar, Mobile Diagnostics Laboratory, Ground Air Radar System development, and other low observable special test equipment and information systems upgrades.

Peculiar support equipment development activities include design, development, test, and procurement of new peculiar support equipment, to include but not limited to, special test equipment for newly emerging test and support requirements of legacy B-2 capabilities and/or functionality. Development of new peculiar support equipment will support test and sustainment activities at the B-2 Weapon System Support Center Ground Test Facility, Program Depot Maintenance facility, Test Range facilities, and AFGSC operating locations.

The B-2 Training System upgrades include updates to training device hardware and components, simulation software, courseware and academic materials, instructional system design architectures, engineering drawings, and system documentation that is not driven by a funded aircraft modification. Improvements include, but are not limited to, threat systems parametrics and order of battle information, radar display emulation improvements, improved aero fidelity of key pilot procedures, courseware improvements, and upgrades to display systems, subsystems, and simulation and computational processors. Other upgrades include, but are not limited to, conventional and nuclear guided weapons delivery training, expanded crypto keyfill capability in simulators, upgraded capability to train weapons as powered up upon completion of initial conditions, as well as upgrades to the electronic combat environment threat database tools to include threat laydown, threat parametrics, and Integrated Air Defense System. Upgrades also include the current Defensive Management System (DMS) simulation, improved DMS alternative/ emergency procedures courseware, and upgraded Mission Generation System, Suppressor tool, and simulation and computational processors as necessary. Enhancements are provided to the B-2 family of trainers to include the Weapon System Trainers, Mission Trainer, Cockpit Procedures Trainers, Computerized Maintenance Training System, Weapon System Training Aids, Weapons Load Trainer, Crew Escape System Maintenance Trainer, Flight Control System Trainer, instructor-operator station, and Training System Support Center.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development.  This budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Baseline Support maintains and upgrades the B-2 unique flight test aircraft as well as hardware/software and test equipment to support developmental systems integration, and flight test, reducing the need for additional operational aircraft and accelerating deployment of advanced operational capabilities to the warfighter. Baseline Support also ensures the Mission Planning System keeps pace with aircraft modifications and improves the mission planning core system. Baseline Support provides for other B-2 unique government costs and includes assorted studies of aircraft performance and cost trades as well as acquisition planning activities, up to and including proposal preparation, for future aircraft, engine, weapon, communication, navigation or other capabilities. This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY 2016, Project 672984, MM III Baseline Support, includes new start efforts for LGM-30G Cadmium Replacement Program (CaDRP) and LGM-30G Squadron Data Simulator (SDS). 

In FY 2016, Project 672985, MM Support Equip, the LGM-30G Payload Transporter Replacement (PTR) program was re-established and transferred from PE 0604851F, ICBM - EMD, Project 655037, Support Equipment, in order to consolidate ICBM efforts.  

In FY 2016, Project 672987, MM Ops Equipment, the two ongoing efforts will be transferred into PE 0605230F, Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD), Project 641025. The efforts being transferred are Guidance Modernization Program (GMP) and Solid Rocket Motor Modernization (SRMM).</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The MM III Ground and Comm Equipment program replaces obsolete/unsupportable ground-based weapon system equipment located at Launch Control Centers (LCCs) and Launch Facilities (LFs) necessary to continue MM III operations through 2030.  Current efforts include development, qualification, integration, and testing of replacement equipment such as the LGM-30G ALCS, LGM-30G Automatic Switching Unit (ASU), LGM-30G FRBP II, LGM-30G LCCB, LGM-30G Launch Control Center Block Upgrade (LCCBU), and LGM-30G RVA II. 

MM III Baseline Support program replaces or upgrades obsolete/unsupportable flight test unique equipment installed on the missile during flight test, used to test MM III systems on the ground, or located at test facilities to collect, process, and analyze test data.  Flight test equipment supports test and evaluation of newly developed or modified MM III capabilities and to conduct MM III Operational Test Launches (OTLs) determining ICBM force readiness, reliability and capability shortfalls.  Efforts include development, qualification, integration and testing of replacement equipment such as LGM-30G CaDRP, LGM-30G FT3, LGM-30G Ground Test Upgrade (GTU), and LGM-30G SDS.  As other similar equipment is identified for replacement, it will be added to this program.  MM III Baseline Support also provides for other MM III unique government costs, studies of system performance, contract closeout costs, cost trades and acquisition planning activities, up to and including proposal preparation, for future capabilities.  

MM Support Equipment program designs, develops, and tests replacement of obsolete/non-serviceable weapon system support equipment.  Current efforts include design, development, and testing of support equipment such as LGM-30G Code Systems Media (CSM), LGM-30G Performance Assessment Data System Communications Equipment Interface Unit (PADS CEIU), LGM-30G PTR, LGM-30G Reentry Field Support Equipment (RFSE), LGM-30G Reentry Support Equipment Replacement Program (RSERP), LGM-30G Strategic Targeting and Applications Computer System (STACS), and LGM-30G Transporter Erector Replacement Program (TERP). As other similar equipment is identified for replacement, it will be added to this program.

MM Crypto Mods executes USSTRATCOM, Air Force Global Strike Command, and Nuclear Weapon Safety Center requirements by implementing the KS-60 capabilities in the ICBM Crypto Unit II (ICU II) of remote key/code change and irreversible transformations mandated in the approved Capabilities Development Document (dated 4 Jan 05) and addresses Nuclear Weapon System Safety Group Operational Safety Review requirements 98-2, 00-1 and 02-2.  As other similar equipment is identified for replacement, it will be added to this program.

MM Operational Equipment program efforts will identify viable concepts and material solutions in support of the Air Force's Ground Based Strategic Deterrent.  Funding supports design, development, test, integration and replacement of weapon system equipment including flight systems; Nuclear Command, Control and Communications (NC3); launch and control facilities; and Security/Ground Equipment upgrades.  Efforts within the MM Operational Equipment program will ensure MM III operation through 2030 as well as support future Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) requirements. Guidance Modernization Program (GMP) and Solid Rocket Motor Modernization (SRMM) will be transferred into PE 0605230F, Ground Based Strategic Deterrent, Project 641025. As other similar equipment is identified for replacement, it will be added to this program. 

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes developmental efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal years.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>ALCS will replace the legacy nuclear command and control (NC2) system that provides the capability to launch MM III ICBMs from an airborne platform (E-6B).  The system consists of an Ultra High Frequency (UHF) radio programmer group at each Launch Facility (LF) and a suite of airborne equipment.  While not part of the Air Force's management, the current system does use/require the Navy's UHF C3 data path to transmit signals from the E-6B.  ALCS will be managed in two increments to provide a low risk approach to meeting GBSD alternate launch requirements while also addressing obsolescence/sustainability issues with the current ALCS MM III system.  Increment 1 will replace the existing ALCS equipment with a focus on existing MM III alternate launch capabilities and incorporate GBSD design considerations to reduce risk to Increment II.  Increment II will meet alternate launch capabilities required for the GBSD system and leverage the previously developed/fielded Increment I system as much as possible.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>In FY 2016, Project 672984, MM III Baseline Support, Instrument Wafer Replacement Program (IWRP), Flight Destruct System (FDS), and Launch Support System (LSS) were combined to form the LGM-30G Flight Test Telemetry and Termination (FT3) System.
  
In FY 2016, Project 672984, MM III Baseline Support, includes new start efforts for LGM-30G Squadron Data Simulator (SDS) and LGM-30G Cadmium Replacement Program (CaDRP).</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>MM III Baseline Support program replaces or upgrades obsolete/unsupportable flight test unique equipment. The equipment is installed on the missile during flight tests, used to test MM III systems on the ground, or located at test facilities to collect, process, and analyze test data.  Flight test equipment supports test and evaluation of newly developed or modified MM III capabilities and conducts MM III Operational Test Launches (OTLs) to determine ICBM force readiness, reliability and capability shortfalls.  Efforts include development, qualification, integration and testing of replacement equipment such as SDS, CaDRP, FT3, and Ground Test Upgrade (GTU).  Similar equipment identified for replacement, will be added to this program.  MM III Baseline Support also provides for other MM III unique government costs, studies of system performance, contract closeout costs, cost trades and acquisition planning activities, up to and including proposal preparation, for future capabilities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Title>LGM-30G Flight Test Telemetry and Termination System (FT3)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>FT3 designs, develops, fabricates and tests replacements for the Mod 7 Instrumentation Wafer, associated Signal Conditioner Monitor Group (SCMG), as well as the FDS and the LSS.  This will replace the unsupportable instrumentation wafer and FDS that do not meet current Range Safety Standards.  The Mod 7 instrumentation wafer transmits missile performance telemetry and position data and receives command destruct messages during MM III OTLs and developmental flight test evaluations. The SCMG and associated cabling capture Reentry System performance data during OTLs and developmental flight tests.  FT3 will replace the current MM III OTL flight destruct capability used in the event of a flight anomaly where it would be necessary to destroy the missile.  LSS replaces the current unique, specialized test system at Vandenberg AFB used to monitor and control test launch flights and ground support equipment. The current LSS is over 15-years old and experiencing major supportability issues. LSS failure trends are increasing due to hardware aging and obsolescence creating a need for workarounds, waivers and contractor intervention. A new Instrumentation Wafer and FDS are required to continue OTLs through 2030. A new LSS is required to field the Instrumentation Wafer and the FDS.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The CSM program supports the replacement of obsolete tape cartridges with more modern and available magnetic media.  Segment #1, responsible for providing software to accept National Security Agency (NSA) codes, Operations Plan (OPLAN) changes and software updates on compact disk (CD), has been completed. Segment #2 will provide software and hardware necessary to import all other data on CD and produce Wing Codes Processing System products on CD. Segment #2 will also replace the Cartridge Transfer Unit (CTU) with the Data Transfer Units (DTUs).  CSM effectively supports the replacement of aging media required to transport and handle mission essential codes and data throughout the ICBM weapon system.  The shelf life of the current stock of DC300 tape cartridges and 9-track tapes began to expire in 2015.  CSM delivers the capability to load codes/software on MM III ICBMs through 2030 and is critical to code change activities.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Title>LGM-30G Performance Assessment Data System Communications Equipment Interface Unit (PADS CEIU) - FY16 New Start</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>Updates the legacy CEIU to a more robust software language and changes the communication protocol from telephony to internet protocol to address security concerns.  PADS CEIU is an interface unit using an analog signal over the telephone line using a standard commercial off the shelf (COTS) Modem. This system is essential as it is the only way to identify high hour Pendulous Integrating Gyroscopic Accelerometers (PIGA) and provides data that eliminates unnecessary Missile Guidance Set (MGS) removals.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>MM Crypto Mods executes USSTRATCOM, Air Force Global Strike Command, and Nuclear Weapon Safety Center requirements by implementing the KS-60 capabilities in ICU II of remote key/code change and irreversible transformation as mandated in the approved Capabilities Development Document (dated 4 Jan 05) and addresses Nuclear Weapon System Safety Group Operational Safety Review requirements 98-2, 00-1 and 02-2.  It also incorporates continuous signal lockout capabilities to prevent the widespread loss of status monitoring.  These features will greatly increase security during code changes by reducing the frequency of open sites 75 days annually and will reduce associated resource costs for 450 Launch Facilities (LFs) and 45 Launch Control Centers (LCCs).  In FY15, ICU II was rebaselined to address emerging nuclear surety requirements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>In FY 2016, Project 672987, MM Ops Equipment, the two ongoing efforts will be transferred into PE 0605230F, Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD), Project 641025. The efforts being transferred are Solid Rocket Motor Modernization (SRMM) and Guidance Modernization Program (GMP).</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>MM Operational Equipment program efforts will identify viable concepts and material solutions in support of the Air Force's GBSD.  Funding supports design, development, test, integration and replacement of weapon system equipment including flight systems, Nuclear Command, Control and Communications (NC3), launch and control facilities, and Security/Ground Equipment upgrades.

Efforts within the MM Operational Equipment program will ensure MM III operation through 2030 as well as support future GBSD requirements.  MM Operational Equipment also provides for other unique government costs, studies, cost trades and acquisition planning activities for future GBSD requirements.

In support of the future flight systems, the GMP effort will further define requirements, explore available technologies and architectures, select the most promising technology and architecture for development, and prepare acquisition plans.  Efforts under the ICBM Demonstration and Validation Guidance Application Program (GAP), PE 0603851F, ICBM Dem/Val, will be leveraged to inform these efforts.

Also in support of the future flight systems, the SRMM effort will define operational requirements, investigate available technologies and prepare an acquisition strategy for SRMM development.  SRMM will design and replace the existing solid rocket motors with a qualified modern design. This effort, coupled with ICBM Demonstration and Validation Propulsion Application Program (PAP), PE 0603851F, ICBM Dem/Val, will support development of requirements and an implementation timeline for the SRMM program.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

In FY 2016, PE 0101313F, Strategic War Planning System, Project 675368, Global Sensor Integrated on Network, efforts were transferred to PE 0301017F, Global Sensor Integrated on Network, Project 675368, Global Sensor Integrated on Network, in order to provide improved transparency</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The mission of US Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) is to establish and provide full-spectrum global strike, coordinated space and information operations capabilities to meet both deterrent and decisive national security objectives, and to provide operational space support, integrated missile defense, Global Command Control Communications and Computers Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR), and specialized planning expertise to the joint warfighter.  This mission has been defined by the 2002 Unified Command Plan (UCP) changes 1 and 2.  To enable completion of these missions, USSTRATCOM is modernizing the Integrated Strategic Planning and Analysis Network (ISPAN) (formerly known as Strategic War Planning System [SWPS]) and establishing a unified national architecture integrating disparate Missile Warning/Missile Defense (MW/MD) data into a single Internet Protocol (IP)-based system known as the Global Sensor Integrated Network (GSIN) to provide redundant and unambiguous MW/MD data to national leadership.  When the ISPAN modernization is complete the system will support the warfighter in both deliberate and adaptive planning environments while allowing the National Command Authorities to employ the full spectrum of kinetic and non-kinetic weapons.  The ISPAN system will continue to evolve as weapon systems are matured, new systems are developed, and the threat changes, particularly in the area of worldwide proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD).   

The nation's strategic Command and Control (C2), sensors and other planning programs cannot rapidly exchange information across multiple missions, creating ambiguity that delays time critical national C2 decision making processes.  GSIN establishes a unified national architecture integrating disparate MW/MD systems into a single IP-based system that will provide redundant and unambiguous MW/MD data to national leadership.  GSIN nets together all sensors, from tactical to strategic (including the Nation's most modern and capable assets) taking advantage of their larger numbers, improved algorithms, mobility and forward deployment to provide earlier cross-cueing and expanded decision space when every second counts.  GSIN will permit an IP-based User Defined Operational Picture (UDOP) to augment voice conferencing and rapidly build a single, unambiguous missile event picture allowing real-time senior collaboration for nuclear C2 and improved senior leader situational awareness (SA) and decision-making. 

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Integrated Strategic Planning and Analysis Network (ISPAN) (formerly known as SWPS) is a STRATCOM system that must be capable of both deliberate and adaptive planning employing the full spectrum of kinetic and non-kinetic weapons. The planning system will continue to evolve as weapon systems are matured, new systems are developed, and the threat changes, particularly in the area of worldwide proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD).

The ISPAN modernization program includes initiation of Course of Action (COA) Development as a service to the DoD enterprise, workflow and decision support development, Combatant Commander (COCOM) Collaboration, User Defined Operational Picture (UDOP), conventional mission planning integration, and Mission Planning Analysis System (MPAS) maintenance and modernization. This includes software coding, integration of multiple internal and external planning applications, as well as developmental and early operational test activities. ISPAN also includes automated data processing equipment (ADPE), software, facilities support, manpower, and training to support the mission objectives of ISPAN, associated deployable and distributed data processing nodes, and subsidiary systems. Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.

ISPAN Increment 4 will modernize the Mission Planning and Analysis System (MPAS), that develops Joint Staff Level I through Level IV nuclear and conventional attack options for national and theater requirements.  Increment 4 will fulfill MPAS requirements by reducing Crisis Action Planning and Time Sensitive Planning timelines, integrating nuclear and conventional kinetic weapon capabilities with non-kinetic effects, providing the capability to integrate planning and analysis capabilities of future Global Strike weapons, updating the MPAS system to provide the ability to train users in significantly less time, and leveraging new technologies to lower sustainment costs.  ISPAN Inc 4 is an evolution of the Block 1 baseline system using proven technologies.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

- Initiated Spiral 1 development.  
  -- This includes initiating requirements analysis, design, coding, and test for development of new Mission Planning and Analysis System (MPAS) capabilities.  Potential capabilities include a new Plan Manager to orchestrate the crisis action planning processes.  
  -- It also includes development of a new Attack Structure Manager capability (which will optimize on-the-shelf plans in reaction to changes in weapons, weapon availability, targets, and environment), a new Strike Option Generator capability (which will automatically generate strike plan options given a set of constraints and priorities), and a new Data Services Layer/Data Layer which will provide access to common services and data external to MPAS.  
- Initiated activities for the reengineering of legacy components (e.g. Air Vehicle Planning System, Ballistic Missile Planning System, Aimpoint Construction System, and Plan Quality Review System).</r2:Text>

- Complete development, testing, and fielding activities for delivering ISPAN Increment 4 Spiral 1 capability.  
  -- Spiral 1 will deliver the ability to accomplish Time Sensitive Planning (TSP) faster than today's system can support.  
  -- It will provide a partial Plan Management capability for a more automated approach to planning missile missions (partial TSP Weaponeering).  
  -- It will also provide an Attack Structure Management capability for system-assisted deliberate plan management.  
  -- With this capability, courses of action (COAs) can be edited, deleted and added to existing plans in response to changes in the operational environment or shifts in priorities or guidance.  
  -- Spiral 1 will also initiate some of the foundational work necessary to orchestrate work assignments among MPAS subsystems.  
  -- It will also modernize a portion of the Air Vehicle Planning System to improve maintainability and simplify the addition of new capabilities.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>GSIN nets together selected systems and sensors, from tactical to strategic, including the Nation's most modern and capable assets, taking advantage of their larger numbers, improved algorithms, mobility and forward deployment to provide earlier cross-cueing and expanded decision space when every second counts.  GSIN will enable a User Defined Operating Picture (UDOP) to provide a single, unambiguous missile event picture allowing real-time senior collaboration for nuclear C2, improved senior leader situational awareness (SA), and decision-making.

The Nation's strategic C2, sensors and mission planning programs cannot rapidly exchange information across multiple missions, creating ambiguity that delays time critical national C2 decision making processes.  GSIN establishes a unified schema integrating disparate Missile Warning/Missile Defense (MW/MD) data into a single exposed data set providing redundant and unambiguous MW/MD data to national leadership.  GSIN enables existing sensors to provide data in net-centric formats consumable by other authorized systems and mission areas, thus reducing the need to acquire more sensors.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning, execution, and future program planning.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>In FY16, Project 671820, Strategic Automated Command and Control System (SACCS), includes a new start effort for SACCS Replacement.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>SACCS is a dedicated, high speed, multi-level secure, data transmission, processing, and display system.  It provides the primary non-survivable command and control capability for receiving and disseminating secure Emergency Action Messages (EAM), Force Direction Messages (FDM), and exchanging information type messages from USSTRATCOM.  SACCS provides messages for effective deployment of strategic bombers, reconnaissance aircraft, mobilization aircraft, tanker support aircraft, and the Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) force.  

The SACCS system has equipment that has reached its end of life and is no longer repairable due to diminished manufacturing sources and parts obsolescence.  This jeopardizes Air Force Global Strike Command's (AFGSC) ability to meet mission requirements as required by Chairman Joint Chief of Staff Nuclear Technical Performance Criteria and Operational Standards (CJCSI 6811.01).  In order to mitigate the risk of SACCS inability to operate once the current spares are completely diminished, the SACCS System Program Office will develop replacement equipment through a phased approach which includes studies, analysis and development.

This program, Strategic Automated Command and Control System, is a new start. 

This program is in Budget Activity 07, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal years.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Phase II: Design and develop replacement end user equipment to support the nuclear mission. 

New equipment will improve Mean Time Between Failure rates, cost savings, reliability, availability, improve user interface, address Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages and obsolecence challenges, and meet Chairman Joint Chief of Staff Nuclear Technical Performance Criteria and Operational Standards (CJCSI 6811.01).</r2:Description>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification
Battle Control System-Fixed (BCS-F) is the operational equipment replacement in the fixed air defense sites, Region/Sector Air Operations Center (R/SAOC), also known as Region Air Operations Center-Air Defense Sector (RAOC-ADS).  The BCS-F Program supports a battle management command and control system with capability to integrate data from civil and military defense surveillance systems into a comprehensive, recognized air picture.  This integrated air picture enhances the North American Aerospace Defense/Combatant Commander's (NORAD/CC's) capability to conduct peacetime air sovereignty, transition, and warfare.  The BCS-F system serves as the Air Force's Homeland Defense battle management, command, and control hub and integrates data from radar sensors, data links, and the supporting communications architecture.  It provides the tactical communications and data link capabilities that enable planning, directing, coordinating, and controlling forces for air surveillance, air defense, and control of sovereign US air space.  BCS-F is a bi-national program with Canada, ensuring air defense and surveillance capability, including Hawaii.  BCS-F achieved Initial Operational Capability in October 2006 and full deployment declaration in Nov 2012.  The National Capital Region - Integrated Air Defense System (NCR-IADS) is a post-September 11, 2001 rapidly fielded capability to improve low altitude detection capability in order to prosecute airborne threats to the NCR.  The Air Defense Sector (ADS) feeds the Air Picture and Targets of Interest (TOI) to the NCR-IADS.  NCR-IADS provides ground-based air defense of the NCR airspace, and provides an integrated air surveillance picture, fire control quality air picture, ground air defense weapons, enhanced regional situational awareness and forensic data collection capabilities for the warfighter.

This program is in Budget Activity 07, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY 2015, Projet 643833 Joint NavWar Center (JNWC) Space Activities, efforts were transferred to PE 0105921F Service Support to STRATCOM - Space Activities,  Project 672486 Joint NAVWAR Center in order to align efforts with Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development.

In FY 2016, Project 670373, Defense Critical Infrastructure Program, includes new start efforts.

In FY 2016, Project 67A011, Space Analysis and Application Development, includes new start efforts.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Joint Navigation Warfare Center (JNWC) was established per DepSecDef Memorandum titled, "Navigation Warfare (NAVWAR) Implementation Guidance", dated 17 November 2004. The memorandum directed CDR/USSTRATCOM to "Establish a joint center for NAVWAR that leverages on the expertise and infrastructure of the Joint GPS Combat Effectiveness Joint Test &amp; Evaluation program as part of the foundation to better integrate and coordinate NAVWAR Capabilities across the Department." JNWC's core RDT&amp;E mission is to conduct Positioning Navigation Timing (PNT) Operational Field Assessments (POFA) to provide the essential discovery and basic knowledge building blocks for all other JNWC missions. POFAs use Combatant Command assets employed against representative threats of specific OPLANs, CONPLANs and Defense Planning Scenarios to determine the impact of and/or mitigation measures required to operate in an Anti-Access/Area-Denial A2/AD) Contested PNT Environment. JNWC leverages the $3M/year POFAs to develop national-level NAVWAR guidance, develop joint Tactics Techniques and Procedures (TTPs), non-material solutions and to upgrade capabilities. The intent of POFAs is to provide timely information for near-term TTP development and realistic training in degraded space support environments. POFAs directly benefit and enhance US and coalition capabilities to operate in A2/AD contested PNT environments as those expected in the Air Sea Battle Concept.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Defense Critical Infrastructure Program (DCIP) is a Department of Defense (DoD) risk management program that seeks to ensure the availability of networked assets critical to DoD missions.  DCIP is directed by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Homeland Defense &amp; Americas' Security Affairs) [OASD (HD&amp;ASA)].  DoD Directive 3020.40, 1 July 2010, establishes policy and assigns responsibilities for the DCIP.  DCIP manages the identification, prioritization, assessment, and assurance of Defense Critical Infrastructure as a comprehensive program that includes the development of adaptive plans and procedures to mitigate risk, restore capability in the event of loss or degradation, support incident management, and protect Defense Critical Infrastructure related sensitive information.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>In 2015, Project 672486 Joint NAVWAR Center (JNWC) Space Activities, efforts were transferred from PE 0105921F Service Support to STRATCOM - Space Activities, Projet 643833 Joint NavWar Center in order to align efforts with Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Navigation Warfare (NAVWAR) is deliberate defensive and offensive action to assure and prevent positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) information through coordinated employment of space, cyberspace, and electronic warfare (EW) operations.  The term NAVWAR is sometimes equated with "PNT Superiority."  The Joint Navigation Warfare Center (JNWC) was established by DEPSECDEF Memo, 17 November 2004, as the DoD Center of Excellence, tasked to integrate and coordinate NAVWAR PNT capabilities across electronic spectrum, cyberspace, and space operations.  NAVWAR leverages various techniques and technologies from these mission areas to negate or prevent hostile use of PNT information and protect unimpeded use of PNT information by U.S., Allied, and Coalition Forces while not unduly disrupting peaceful use outside an area of operation.  The JNWC develops and maintains the Department's premier collection of NAVWAR knowledge, and provides subject matter expertise support to warfighters, Department decision makers, the Federal Interagency (the Department of Homeland Security and other civil agencies concerned with the Critical National Infrastructure), and the Coalition.  NAVWAR expertise is developed in part by execution of PNT Operational Field Assessments (POFAs), modeling and simulation, analysis, and exercise and training support. In recent years, the Global Positioning System (GPS) has become one of the most critical enablers of modern advanced technology warfare. In an era where everything from advanced weapons systems and networks to basic goods and services are tracked, guided or disciplined by PNT systems such as GPS, NAVWAR is an ever increasing capability of interest and concern, especially if PNT systems are interrupted or lost. Likewise, as Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) proliferate, it becomes necessary to consider not only denying adversary use of GPS but also negating adversary use of alternate GNSS systems for PNT.  Recent revisions to National Defense Strategy and Defense Planning Guidance require Combatant Commands to account for denied / degraded PNT environments in deliberate planning.  Projecting force in the Asia-Pacific Region and other theaters of operation requires an understanding  of how evolving global asymmetric anti-access / area denial (A2/AD) threats may affect joint warfighting functions.  JNWC-conducted POFAs are a key element in evaluating Coalition NAVWAR capabilities and vulnerabilities and adversary capabilities and vulnerabilities, both crucial to executing PNT superiority mission sets in potentially denied / degraded PNT environments.  JNWC helps develop defensive and offensive PNT capabilities by focusing on four Joint Mission Essential Tasks (JMETS):

1. Enable Defensive PNT Operations: enable operations that will protect blue force PNT capabilities.
2. Enable Offensive PNT Operations: enable PNT superiority capabilities that can take advantage of GNSS vulnerabilities. 
3. Establish and Maintain PNT Situational Awareness (SA): assess current and projected blue force and red force PNT related capabilities.
4. Develop and Execute NAVWAR Operational Assessments and Analysis for Future NAVWAR Operations and conduct field assessments to evaluate blue force and red force capabilities and vulnerabilities.

The JNWC executes its assigned mission responsibilities through three lines of operation (LOO):

1. Create Knowledge for PNT Superiority: PNT operational field assessments, studies and analysis, assessment and dissemination of PNT related intelligence, and managing the PNT Superiority data repository
2. Operationalize PNT Superiority: Joint Force and Contingency Operations support to Combatant Commands, Services, and other customers through outreach; creating and demonstrating operational capability for PNT Superiority in the near term
3. Institutionalize PNT Superiority: Acquisition, policy, doctrine, and coalition support; creating  the environment for robust PNT Superiority capability in the future

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production fudning in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>In FY 2016, Project 67A011, Space Analysis and Application Development, includes new start efforts.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Space Analysis and Application Development project develops modeling and simulation tools that Air Force Space Command's Space Analysis Center uses for operations research, military utility analyses, tradeoff studies, and other evaluations of space mission areas to guide planning, programming, requirements generation, analyses of alternatives, and other activities. Development activities incorporate changes in fielded and projected space operational capabilities, as well as technical improvements, into the group's software tools to ensure their data and technology remain current. Its innovation, education, and training activities foster solutions to operational deficiencies and enhance the integration of space systems into Air Force operations, thereby enabling service and joint warfighters to realize the full potential of existing and planned space capabilities.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The basic MQ-9 Reaper system consists of the aircraft, sensors, a ground control station (GCS), communications equipment, weapon kits, support equipment, simulator and training devices, Readiness Spares Packages (RSP), technical data/training, and personnel required to operate, maintain, and sustain the system.  The system is designed to be modular and open-ended.  Mission-specific equipment is employed in a 'plug-and-play' mission kit concept allowing specific aircraft and control station configurations to be tailored to fit mission needs.  

The MQ-9 Reaper aircraft is a single-engine, turbo-prop Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) designed to operate over-the-horizon at medium-to-high altitude for long endurance sorties.  The aircraft is designed primarily to prosecute critical, emerging Time-Sensitive-Targets (TSTs) as a radar, Electro-optical/Infrared (EO/IR), and laser designator-based attack asset with on-board hard-kill weapon capability (hunter-killer).  It also performs Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Target Acquisition (ISR TA).  In the hunter-killer role, the aircraft employs fused multi-spectral sensor information to find, fix, and track ground targets and assesses post-strike results using Automatic Target Cueing (ATC), high definition EO/IR, Synthetic Aperture Radar and other sensor capabilities.  The MQ-9 system is continuing to develop and field capabilities through incremental upgrades.  Future capability development activity includes airframe and airframe system improvements such as: increasing the maximum gross takeoff weight capability from 10,500 to 11,700lbs; increasing the operational range and endurance of the baseline MQ-9 aircraft (adding external fuel tanks and/or airframe modifications such as wing extensions); incorporating an anti-ice/de-ice capability to transit light icing conditions (involves wing/tail modifications as well as turbine inlet heating); propulsion system improvements; enhancing MQ-9 systems to include Automatic Takeoff and Landing Capability (ATLC); integrated redundant avionics; modifying the system to include provisions for a Foreign Military Sales (FMS) exportable version of the weapon system; Predator Primary Data Link (PPDL) communication system upgrades and communications upgrades to include data link encryption, Internet Protocol (IP) networking, secure voice and data communications, including SATCOM Beyond Line-of-Sight (BLOS) comm upgrades; navigation system upgrades; electrical system upgrades; incorporation of Elevated Temperature Wet (ETW) materials; sensor/stores management computer improvement; MIL-STD-1760 advanced weapons data bus; Universal Armament and Sensor Interface and Miniature Munitions/Store Interface; advanced sensor and weapon payloads; improved human-machine interface (HMI); integrating precision weapons (e.g. AGM-114 Hellfire missile variants, GBU-12/38/49/54 guided bombs, and Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) variants); hardware and software upgrades to the ground control station for MQ-9 operations; completing airworthiness certification; weapon system certification and accreditation; and producing applicable training devices that emulate weapon system functionality and capabilities.  The MQ-9 program will continue to support other payload and capability development activities funded in other program elements (e.g. SIGINT, communications, Wide Area Motion Imagery (WAMI) and Near Vertical Direction Finding (NVDF),  leveraging Gorgon Stare Quick Reaction Capability, advanced Counter-Improvised Explosive Device (C-IED), missile defense, hyperspectral, and other required sensors and weapons) and address reliability, maintainability, sustainability, and safety issues.  Activities also include trade studies, analyses, preliminary systems engineering, system and subsystem level testing in accordance with DoD and military standards, and specification development in support of both current program planning and execution, and studies supporting analysis and investment in future MQ-9 program planning.
   
The GCS, common with the MQ-1 Predator, functions as the aircraft cockpit and can control the aircraft either within Line-of-Sight (LOS) or Beyond Line-of-Sight (BLOS) via a combination of satellite relay and terrestrial communication architectures.  The GCS is either mobile to support forward operating locations or fixed at a facility to support reach back Remote Split Operations (RSO).  The GCS has the capability to perform mission planning; provides a means for manual control; enables personnel to launch, recover, and monitor aircraft, payloads, and system communications status; incorporates secure data links to send aircraft and payload commands and receive system telemetry and payload data; monitors threats to the aircraft; displays the common operational picture; and provides support functions.  Launch and Recovery GCS (LRGCS) allows for servicing, systems checks, maintenance, launch and recovery of aircraft under LOS control for hand-off to a mobile or fixed facility GCS, and conducting operations within line-of-sight range of the LRGCS.  GCS upgrades will be developed and fielded in coordination with improvements to MQ-9 system capabilities and in response to evolving operational and information assurance/certification and accreditation requirements.  Key efforts include GCS upgrades that add new LINUX processors, high definition monitors, ergonomic improvements, improved human-machine interfaces, open systems architecture, and improved crew habitability. In addition, the GCS development efforts also include upgrade of communciation nodes for data flow between GCSs and the rest of the MQ-9 system enterprise and development/integration of the Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Command and Control (C2) Initiative (UCI) government-owned standard to enable improved capabilities for situational awareness and multi-mission management monitoring and oversight in the GCS. This project will also increase interoperability among developed systems by developing common standards and tools.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Program funds Counter Radio-Controlled Improvised Explosive Device Electronic Warfare (CREW) Mounted, Dismounted, and Fixed systems.  CREW devices are self-protection systems critical to Mine Resistant, Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicle mounted, Explosive Ordinance Disposal dismounted and Entry Control Point operations. Includes integration of the devices into currently fielded systems.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The A-10 is a twin engine, single seat, close air support aircraft capable of delivering a full range of air-to-ground munitions as well as self-defense air-to-air missiles. The A-10 concept of operations requires a flexible, adaptable and survivable weapon system providing close-air support, combat search and rescue, and special operations capabilities. Current high operational tempo experienced by the Expeditionary Air Force requires the A-10 to perform effectively in a variety of operational roles. The A-10 must conduct around-the-clock air operations under various weather conditions against numerous enemy threats employing a full spectrum of air defense systems. 

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:Text>Continue the development and test of Suite 8. Other tasks associated with Suite 8 include flight test both DT and OT. A-10 Full Mission Trainer (FMT) simulator software integration and development must be updated to remain concurrent with the aircraft's OFP software.

Suite 8 OFP fielding was delayed from Sep 14 to Mar 15 due to unforeseen problems with the transition from contractor support to organic support. There have been further delays due to the decision to defer Suite 8 in Jan 14 and then the decision to restart Suite 8 in Feb 14. 

Efforts include the development of a SIL in support of the transition to organic software development.  A SIL that can support the Suite 8 baseline will be developed for organic use. This SIL will consist of one Integrated Test Stand (ITS). The unclassified portion of the SIL went operational on 1 Oct 14. Work continues to get the classified portion of the SIL operational and is expected to complete in FY15.  This SIL will have no Sub System Test (SST) stands. With no SST's, and only one ITS, this will not allow for development actions, only sustainment.</r2:Text>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Prior to FY 2009, A-10 OFP development efforts were conducted under the A-10 Prime Contract, awarded to Lockheed Martin Systems Integration in December 1997 through a full-and-open competition.  Suite 8 development efforts began in FY12, with System Integration Lab(SIL)development and stand-up beginning in FY11 as A-10 OFP suites development and sustainment efforts transitioned from contractual work by Lockheed Martin to organic work by 309th Software Maintenance Group (SMXG) at Hill AFB.  All additional suites beyond 8 will be performed by the 309th SMXG until directed otherwise.  The A-10 FMT simulator OFP is managed by the Simulator Division at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and is contractor developed and integrated.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The F-16 Fighting Falcon is the world's premier fixed-wing, high performance, single engine multi-mission fighter aircraft that comprises 50% of the AF fighter inventory.  Operational since 1980, the F-16 has proven itself in combat in a variety of air-to-air and air-to-surface missions, such as, offensive and defensive counter-air, close air support, forward air control, air interdiction (day/night and all-weather) and suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD)/destruction of enemy air defenses (DEAD).  The F-16 remains the USAF's primary SEAD/DEAD platform.  The aircraft has evolved its capabilities by capitalizing upon advancements made in computers, avionics systems, engines, and structures technologies to meet emerging warfighter requirements; and combat current and evolving enemy threats.  The F-16 has been selected by more than 20 air forces around the world and foreign military sales (FMS) production continues in the 21st century.  The F-16 System Program Office continues to develop, integrate, and qualify systems/subsystems to enhance the overall performance of the F-16 weapon system to meet new mission requirements.

Some of these include: Operational Flight Program (OFP) development on Block 40/42/50/52 OFPs are required to integrate new precision weapons, advanced targeting pods, improved avionics, hardware (HW) and software (SW) mods to meet DoD mandates and keep the F-16, the respective training simulators, and other hardware subsystems current; Legacy Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) is a two-phased RDT&amp;E effort which includes a Full Scale Durability Test (FSDT) and Engineering, Manufacturing and Development (EMD) to support structural modifications to Block 40/42/50/52 aircraft to increase Certified Service Life (CSL) from 8,000 Equivalent Flight Hours (EFH) to 10,000 EFH (Threshold), or 12,000 EFH (Objective); EMD Hardware/Advanced capability improvements provides funding to develop, test, and qualify, weapon systems, aircraft subsystems replaced or modified due to requirements changes, pre-planned product improvements (P3I), diminishing manufacturing sources (DMS) and parts obsolescence; Modular Mission Computer (MMC)/Display Generator Upgrade resolves short falls in mission computer memory and throughput brought on by the addition of incremental combat capability and includes non-recurring engineering (NRE), design, development, integration, and ground/flight test for fielding; F-16 Training Simulator updates enable the USAF to exercise/train using the most current F-16 OFP available to all block configurations, to include both aircrew and maintenance trainers; JASSM-ER (Extended Range) integrates this advanced weapon on F-16 Blk 40/42/50/52 aircraft, and includes NRE, test assets, SEEK EAGLE, integration, and flight test.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because it includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

The FY2016 funding request was reduced by $18.524 million to account for the availability of prior year balances.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>The MMC upgrade resolves short falls in mission computer memory and throughput. Funding includes NRE, design, development, integration, and ground/flight test for fielding with the M8+ OFP.  The addition of an Ethernet port facilitates future increments of combat capability with the OFP (e.g., digital targeting pod video).  Display Generator Upgrade allows a fully integrated Multifunction Display solution including Hands On Throttle and Stick (HOTAS) integration with Sensor of Interest (SOI), format swapping and high definition video on 4x4 displays; provides improved display formats during dynamic maneuvers; resolves symbol freezing issues due to throughput constraints; and provides a sustainable approach to address growing DMS concerns with the current Programmable Display Generator.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The F-16 Program acquisition strategy is to improve capability, maintenance and safety mods through OFP development/flight test, enhanced weapons integration, structural upgrades, and simulator concurrency.

OFP software will be continually updated on a 3-year cycle to bring new capabilities to the warfigter.  The current effort (M7+) is the first software tape to be completely developed at OO-ALC vs. LM-Aero to facilitate an organic software development capability.  Subsequent tapes will incorporate DoD approved mandates (Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B), MIDS, B61-12) and the MMC/PDG architecture.

The Legacy SLEP program is in FSDT to determine the engineering solutions necessary to resolve life-limiting structural issues, and to feed the EMD effort to develop the mod kits and airworthiness certification recommendation.

The EMD HW/Advanced capability improvements will develop, test, and qualify aircraft weapons systems, including subsystems, replaced/modified due to requirements changes, P3I and DMS/parts obsolescence.

Contract types are Time and Material, Cost Plus Incentive Fee, Cost Plus Fixed Fee and Firm Fixed Price.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY 2015,  PE 0207134F  Project 670131 Initial Operation Test and Evaluation, EPAWSS efforts were transferred to PE 0207171F Project 676038 EPAWSS to improve transparency for ACAT I program.

In FY 2016, EPAWSS efforts were transferred from Budget Activity 7, Operational Systems Development, PE 0207171F, Project Number 676038 to Budget Activity 5, Engineering and Manufacturing Development, PE 0207171F, Project Number 657108 per OSD direction.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The F-15 is the most versatile fighter in the world today.  The F-15C/D continues to provide air superiority with an undefeated and unmatched aerial combat record.  The F-15E retains this air superiority capability and adds systems, such as advanced imaging and targeting systems, to meet the requirement for all-weather, deep penetration, and night/under-the-weather, air-to-surface attack.  Configured with conformal fuel tanks (CFTs), the F-15E deploys worldwide with minimal tanker support and arrives combat-ready.  A mainstay in operations both domestic and abroad, upgrades to the F-15 (avionics, armament, airframe, and engines) are critical to maintaining combat viability (lethality, survivability, and supportability).  Projected to remain in service past 2035, avionics modernization is key to long-term weapon system viability.  This modernization is built on a foundation of technical and acquisition support studies (both internal to the Air Force and through outside contractors), forestalling obsolescence, exploiting proven technological advances, and leveraging new technology.  Major avionics upgrades center around radar modernization (both hardware and software upgrades) and the exploitation of enhanced capability via precision timing, data delivery and processing technology, precision registration systems, cockpit Head Up Display (HUD), instrumentation digitization and modernization, central computer processing power increases, digital mission event recording systems and an infrared (IR) based fire control system.  Funds are also used, as required, to resolve Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues. The proliferation of fourth generation enemy aircraft and sophisticated "double-digit" anti-aircraft missile systems pose a significant threat to F-15 survivability.  A fully integrated electronic warfare suite holds the promise of providing survivability as well as expanded electronic attack capability. Nearly all improvements are linked to an aircraft operational flight program update schedule that works to integrate new capabilities with the airframe.  These updates are a responsive way to increase the offensive and defensive capability and survivability of the F-15.  Incorporation of corresponding spiral and/or phased technology/equipment improvements that include support equipment, mission planning systems, and training device upgrades will improve performance, supportability, and aircrew training.


This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

The FY2016 funding request was reduced by $39.869 million to account for the availability of prior execution balances.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This includes development of the F-15C/D and F-15E Advanced Display Core Processor (ADCP) II and the F-15C/D and F-15E Eagle Passive/Active Warning Survivability System (EPAWSS) (EPAWSS funds for FY14 only are in PE 0207134F).

The ADCP II will develop a common mission computer for the F-15C/D and F-15E.  The current mission computers of both platforms have reached their limits of speed, memory and throughput.  Additionally, digital systems have changed the security requirements of both platforms and the older mission computers cannot be upgraded to meet these new requirements.  A common mission computer is expected to reduce overall development costs as well as long term maintenance costs.  The program will also develop a new F-15C/D cockpit display to replace an obsolete one.

EPAWSS will replace the obsolete Tactical Electronic Warfare System (TEWS), which will help the aircraft survive in high threat environments.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

The FY2016 funding request was reduced by $39.869 million to account for the availability of prior year balances.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>These development efforts include F-15 Radar Enhancements Electronic Protection (EP) capabilities, Operational Flight Program (OFP) upgrades, Flight Testing, Infrared Search and Track (IRST), and Multifunctional Information Distribution System-Joint Technical Radio System (MIDS-JTRS).

The Radar Enhancements (EP) will upgrade the digital Active Electronic
Scanned Array (AESA) radar capabilities to counter sophisticated electronic
threats.  Suite 7C introduces EP into the C-model fleet.  Initial EP
capability for APG-82(V)1 equipped E model aircraft will take place in Suite 8E.   Suite 9 will add additional EP capability to both the E- and C-model jets. 

For the F-15 to maintain operational effectiveness, the program must continuously provide the platforms with improved capabilities.  To accomplish this there is an on-going need to develop software upgrades and to flight test new capabilities and systems.   The OFP funding line allows the Air Force to release software upgrades approximately every 3 years.  At any one time there will normally be three OFP upgrades in work: one in requirements definition/pricing, one in code writing and test, and one in flight test and release preparation.  The Flight Test funding line allows the Air Force to fund the on-going test effort.  

Infrared Search and Track (IRST) system will provide air to air detection, tracking and ranging capability for F-15C/D in a radar-denied environment.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Manned Destructive Suppression (MDS) program element funds the development, procurement, and sustainment of the Air Force's Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) and Destruction of Enemy Air Defenses (DEAD) capabilities. The F-16 HARM Targeting System (HTS) is currently the only programmed reactive SEAD capability and enables targeting the HARM missile in its most lethal 'range known' mode. The program provides F-16 Block 50/52 and Block 40/42 aircraft with the ability to employ the AN/ASQ-213 Pod. With the introduction of HTS Revision 7 (HTS R7) in 2007, the AN/ASQ-213 Pod now has a precision geo-location capability to target Precision Guided Munitions (PGMs) to destroy fixed and mobile enemy air defense elements.  Additionally, by relocating the AN/ASQ-213 HTS R7 Pod to the aircraft's left inlet hard point, the F-16 can simultaneously carry the HTS R7 Pod and an Advanced Targeting Pod (ATP). HTS R7 fielding is complete and represents the Air Force's near-term solution for reactive time critical targeting for DEAD until this mission can be transferred to F-35 or a yet to be defined system. HTS R7 derived precision targeting data can be provided to all Joint Forces via Link-16. This effort continues preplanned product improvements (P3I) for the HTS and applies technologies similar to those demonstrated in the Advanced Tactical Targeting Technologies (AT3) program and HTS R7 development. 

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The F-22 Raptor represents the USAF's top priority for providing the Joint Force with air dominance, operational access, and homeland and cruise missile defense for the next 20+ years.  The F-22 is a first-of-a-kind multi-mission fighter aircraft that combines stealth, supercruise, advanced maneuverability and integrated avionics to make it the world's most capable combat aircraft.  The Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase of F-22 acquisition is complete.  The program is now continuing the pre-planned modernization effort through incremental development phases that enhance the F-22 Global Strike capability.  The development program enhances the air vehicle, engine, and training system to improve/enhance F-22 weapons, communications, and Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities.

BA7 - This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational Systems Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

The FY2016 funding request was reduced by $5.633 million to account for the availability of prior execution balances.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

U6 will develop, test and field new capabilities and capability enhancements including changes driven by real world evolving threats, emergency/safety of flight issues, and deficiency reports. U6 Interoperability provides cryptographic updates required by the National Security Agency (NSA) to IFDL, Link-16, and Tactical Secure Voice (TSV) and development to maintain interoperability with the enhancements to Link-16 and Secure Voice networks.   The U6 Interoperability program will absorb and build upon the development work already accomplished in the KOV-20 Cryptographic Modernization Program and integrate that development into a single Operational Flight Program (OFP) for fleet release.  In addition, U6 Interoperability will develop and deliver software fixes identified as critical to the operational community.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Raptor Enhancement Development &amp; Integration (REDI) contract is an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity Ordering contract that maximizes flexibility to start, stop, accelerate and decelerate projects as required. The REDI contract was established to be more responsive to evolving war fighter requirements. The REDI contract allows the issuance of orders for the highest priority war fighter capabilities in operationally meaningful capability increments, requirements analysis, contractor cost estimates and studies, development and demonstration of capability enhancements, and unanticipated future war fighter requirements. Each increment is broken into phases to initiate requirements analysis, the design phase and the development, integration and verification phase of a specific incremental development effort. The (REDI) II contract is a follow-on Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract to the initial REDI contract.  REDI II provides maximum flexibility to manage various modernization projects.  The REDI II contract allows for the issuance of orders for efforts associated with the planning, analysis, design, development, qualification, test and documentation of F-22 weapon system performance enhancements, life-cycle improvements, Operational Flight Program (OFP) upgrades, and associated efforts essential to accomplishing the F-22 mission.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>Totals include funding for PRCP Program Number, 265 F-22 Tactical Mandates 

In FY15, a separate Budget Program Activity Code (BPAC 674788) within PE 0207138F was created for F-22 Tactical Mandates, formerly known as F-22 Mandates. F-22 Tactical Mandates proposal activities were initiated in BPAC 674785 in FY14. This is not a new start of FY15.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The F-22 Tactical Mandates program is the follow-on modernization effort to Increment 3.2B.  This program includes Link 16 Transmit and Mode 5 Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) Transpond/Interrogate.  Integration will be accomplished using Open Systems Architecture, to enable future life cycle savings opportunities for the platform. The program will require hardware and software modifications to the Block 30/35 combat-coded F-22 fleet.  

Mode 5 IFF is a Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) mandated blue force identification capability that will directly improve the combat effectiveness of the Raptor as well as reducing fratricide risk DoD-wide.

Link 16 Transmit enables 5th-to-5th and 5th-to-4th tactical information exchange - a top Air Force priority. The Raptor's superior 5th Gen sensor suite will now aid the situational awareness of all participants, in any battle space, while further reducing fratricide risk.

BA07 - This program is in Budget Activity 07, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The mandate for Mode 5 is required by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC). Includes Mission Support of the F-22 Program Office: travel, computer costs, and other miscellaneous contract support.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The F-35 Lightning II Fighter program is developing a family of highly common, affordable, next generation, multi-role aircraft to meet the needs of the USMC, USN, USAF and international partners. The three variants are the F-35A Conventional Takeoff and Landing (CTOL); F-35B Short Takeoff and Vertical Landing (STOVL); and the F-35C Carrier Variant (CV). Maximum commonality among the variants, consistent with National Disclosure Policy, will minimize life cycle costs.

F-35 Follow-on Development (FoD) provides continuing incremental upgrades of the three F-35 variants and associated ground equipment. The FoD acquisition strategy is based upon incremental block development of capabilities with each increment consisting of two development cycles. FoD will provide capability enhancements, required systems upgrades and cost improvements through an incremental acquisition approach. FoD capability planning includes an efficient transition from F-35 System Development and Demonstration (SDD) to FoD. As SDD development activities ramp down, the FoD program will assume responsibility for new development and the maintenance of associated developmental infrastructure.  FoD capability planning includes Block 4A and 4B Engineering and Manufacturing Development efforts from FY16 through FY20 followed by DT and OT testing in 2020/2021 with IOC of capabilities in 2022.

Additionally, the F-35 JSF ORD calls for the F-35A (CTOL) Variant Air Vehicle to have the capabilities and provisions for Dual Capable Aircraft (DCA) operations in the first post SDD block upgrade.  DCA refers to the capability to carry and deliver conventional and non-conventional weapons.  DCA operation for the F-35A is internal carriage of two B-61s.  Due to extensive certification requirements, the DCA capability planning and design will begin in Block 4A and continue through testing and certification in Block 4B.

The United Kingdom, other International Partner nations, and Foreign Military Sales customers are also participants in the JSF program. The program shown here reflects USN, USMC, USAF, and International Partner funding.

Funding at the accomplishment/planned program level is reported as the total of all services and partners as these activities support all aircraft variants.

The FY2016 funding request was reduced by $1.65 million to account for the availability of prior execution balances.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

USN PE 0604810N Project Unit 2936
USMC PE 0604810M Project Unit 2935</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>F-35 FoD provides continuing incremental upgrades of the three F-35 variants and associated ground equipment.  The FoD acquisition strategy is based upon incremental block development of capabilities with each increment consisting of two development cycles.  FoD capability planning includes an efficient transition from F-35 SDD to Follow-on Development.  As SDD development activities ramp down, the FoD program will assume responsibility for new development and the maintenance of associated developmental infrastructure.    FoD capability planning includes Block 4A and 4B Engineering and Manufacturing Development efforts from FY16 through FY19 followed by DT and OT testing in 2020/2021 with IOC of capabilities in 2022.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>This is a joint program with no executive service.  Service Acquisition Executive (SAE) authority alternates between the Department of the Navy and the Department of the Air Force and currently resides with the Navy.  Program Element 0604800N/0604800M continues USN development efforts budgeted in 0603800N prior to FY2002.  The United Kingdom and other International countries are participants in the SDD phase of JSF.

Note:  The USAF/USN/USMC PROCUREMENT lines include Aircraft Procurement and Advanced Procurement only.  Initial Spares and Repair Parts for all Services are reflected in separate lines.  International Partner Funding includes funds provided under the Italy and Netherlands Bilateral agreements.  

RELATED RDT&amp;E:  Funding prior to F-35 SDD (FY94-FY01):  USN PE 0603800N $1,950,617; USAF PE 0603800F $1,907,352; DARPA PE 0603800E $118,056; and International Partner contributions of $253.921 for a total of $4,229,896.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>To enable the ability to adjust to potential discrepancies discovered during SDD Block 3 Test and Evaluation, the engineering and development planning support for FoD will be procured under a cost type contract.  A fee provision will be used to target and motivate contractor performance.  A separate Basic Ordering Agreement or Indefinite Quantity/Indefinite Delivery contract is planned to provide a long term approach to upgrading and maintaining laboratories and test aircraft.  Both Development Support and Management Services will primarily use CPFF Delivery Orders.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The F-35 Lightning II Fighter program is developing a family of highly common, affordable, next generation, multi-role aircraft to meet the needs of the USMC, USN, USAF and international partners.  The three variants are the F-35A Conventional Takeoff and Landing (CTOL); F-35B Short Takeoff and Vertical Landing (STOVL); and the F-35C Carrier Variant (CV).  Maximum commonality among the variants, consistent with National Disclosure Policy, will minimize life cycle costs.  FY2015 continues development and testing of the F-35.  As the initial capabilities are being delivered from the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) program, planning for Follow-on Development (FoD) continues.  Capability requirements are being matured and FoD planning continues based upon the approved Fifth Generation Fighter Modernization Initial Capabilities Document (ICD), an approved Electronic Warfare ICD, and the results of an OSD Tiger Team Review.   FY14 F-35 FoD activity includes drafting of Follow-on Development Increment 1 Capability Development Document (CDD) and further risk reduction.  Follow-on Development will provide capability enhancements, required systems upgrades and cost improvements through an incremental acquisition approach.  

Based on JROCM 091-03, the JSF ORD Change stated that F-35A design must incorporate dual-capability. Dual-Capable Aircraft (DCA) operations refers to the capability to carry and employ conventional and non-conventional weapons. Extensive Certification process, DCA certification tasks, integration planning, environmental testing, and design compatibility work began in FY15 and continue through testing and certification.  Initial Certification will be acheived on the earliest feasible increment.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>This effort provides for the assessment of Dual Capable Aircraft (DCA) weapon integration impacts on the Joint
Strike Fighter (JSF) aircraft, early in the weapon design phase. It identifies and avoids potential technical and cost risks, as well
as defining the integration and certification trade-space to field the DCA capability with the B61 weapon. This effort also supports
follow-on risk reduction efforts that will ensure future integration alignment with the first feasible post SDD block upgrade, and is
expected to include full integration efforts pending Service decisions.</r2:Description>

Based on initial nuclear certification timelines of legacy platforms, the process to achieve Nuclear Certification on F-35A must begin now in order to field capability in time to meet national/alliance nuclear posture commitments. Additionally, the environmental flight tests will help ensure F-35A environments are compatible with the B61-12 prior to the weapon completing its design phase.</r2:Text>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>Funding in FY11 and out is for the Block II program only.  The AIM-9X Block I program costs for FY11 and prior are $233.583M.  The AIM-9X Block II program costs for FY13 and prior are $54.914M.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The AIM-9X (Sidewinder) short-range air-to-air missile is a long-term evolution of the AIM-9 series of fielded missiles. The AIM-9X missile program provides a launch and leave, air combat munition that uses passive infrared (IR) energy for acquisition and tracking of enemy aircraft and complements the Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM). Air superiority in the short range air-to-air missile arena is essential and includes first-shot, first-kill opportunity against an enemy employing IR countermeasures.  The AIM-9X employs several components common with the AIM-9M (fuze, rocket motor, and warhead). Anti-Tamper features have been incorporated to protect improvements inherent in this design. AIM-9X is a Post Milestone III, Acquisition Category 1C (ACAT 1C) joint-service program with Navy lead.

The Block II program is in Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) and the LRIP-4 contract was awarded in June 2014. This budget line item continues to fund the development, test and integration of software updates to the missile, redesign of obsolete missile components, insensitive munitions improvements and aircraft platform integration to ensure these capabilities perform in accordance with established requirements as documented in the Capabilities Production Document. Beginning in FY 2016, Navy will join the US Air Force efforts already in progress to develop missile software improvements for the next incremental version 9.4 (v9.4) as well as hardware updates to improve Insensitive Munitions performance. 

AIM-9X Block I concluded in FY2011 and all funding/quantity data in the documents are associated with Block II activities.

BA7- This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

The FY2016 funding request was reduced by $2.484 million to account for the availability of prior execution balances.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This includes Systems Engineering/Program Management (SEPM), as well as associated governmental and contractor support required to ensure AIM-9X missile integration with threshhold aircraft platforms.  Also, includes efforts to redesign missile components in order to resolve Block II common component obsolescence, implement cost reduction initiatives, and to comply with the Insensitive Munitions (IM) requirements as established by Joint Requirements Oversight Council memo dated 11 February 2009.  The program will implement improvements to the warhead developed by Navy Research Laboratory, to incorporate into the AIM-9X Block II production missile.  Beginning in FY2016, the Navy will join in the Air Force efforts that began in FY2015 to develop software improvements for the next incremental version 9.4 (v9.4x) to incorporate into the FY2017 AIM-9X Block II production missile.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Air Force and Navy continue to develop improvements to the Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM) to counter existing and emerging air vehicle threats operating at high or low altitude, and having advanced Electronic Attack (EA) capabilities. The development program also enables AMRAAM compatibility with advanced fighters, enhances AMRAAM capability and operational flexibility against current and projected threats, incorporates high payoff technology development, performs risk reduction activities, and investigates new variants and/or alternate missions which may use AMRAAM attributes. The latest AMRAAM variant, the AIM-120D, delivers improved performance via Global Positioning System (GPS)-aided navigation, a two-way datalink capability for enhanced aircrew survivability and improved network compatibility, and incorporates new guidance software which improves kinematic performance and weapon effectiveness. The AIM-120D Operational Test Readiness Review was conducted in May 2012.  Operational Testing (OT) was completed in July 2014.  The aircraft integration program maintains compatibility/performance of the missile with changes occurring on threshold AMRAAM platforms per CPD (Capability Production Document).  To keep the existing inventory as effective as possible, the Air Force and Navy also develop, test, and field improvements that are implemented via software upgrades reprogrammed into fielded AMRAAMs, and/or hardware upgrades inserted into production units.  AMRAAM is a joint Air Force/Navy, Acquisition Category IC (ACAT IC) program with Air Force as lead service. 

This program is in Budget Activity 7-Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Post-OT missile improvements are underway as part of the AIM-120D upgrade program.  The SIP, Increment 1 (SIP-1) continues and is expected to field in early FY16.  Additional SIP increments are in the planning phase and will further improve the AIM-120D to meet emerging warfighter requirements.  SIP 2 EMD contract award is planned for 3rd Qtr FY15 to incorporate Basic EPIP into AIM-120D, with forecasted fielding in FY18.  SIP increment 3 EMD contract award is planned for FY17 with fielding in FY20.

The EPIP is also underway to keep AIM-120C missiles capable against the growing electronic attack threat environment.  EPIP Basic capability for the C-7 missile will field in early FY15.  EPIP Basic capability for the C-3 thru C-6 missiles will field later in FY15.  Additional capabilities (EPIP Advanced) are in the development stage with initial fielding projected for FY17 for tape 1 and FY18 for tape 2.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>In FY 2015, Project 676038 EPAWSS efforts were transferred from PE 0207134F, F-15 EPAWSS,  Project 670131, Initial Operation Test and Evaluation to improve transparency for ACAT I program.

In FY 2016,  PE 0207171F, F-15 EPAWSS, Project 676038 was transferred to PE 0207171F, F-15 EPAWSS, Project  657108 BA05 to align BA with stage of development.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The F-15 is the most versatile fighter in the world today. The F-15C continues to provide air superiority with an undefeated and unmatched aerial combat record. The F-15E retains this air superiority capability and adds systems, such as advanced imaging and targeting systems, to meet the requirement for all-weather, deep penetration, and night / under-the-weather, air-to-surface attack. A mainstay in operations both domestic and abroad, upgrades to the F-15 (avionics, armament, airframe and engines) are critical to maintaining combat viability (lethality, survivability and supportability). Projected to remain in service past 2040, avionics modernization is key to long-term weapon system viability. This modernization is built on a foundation of technical and acquisition support studies (both internal to the Air Force and through outside contractors). The proliferation of fourth generation enemy aircraft, sophisticated "double-digit" anti-aircraft missile systems and other enemy systems pose a significant threat to F-15 survivability. The F-15 Eagle Passive Active Warning and Survivability System (EPAWSS) will replace the F-15's functionally obsolete self-defense Tactical Electronic Warfare System (TEWS) to enhance weapon system situational awareness and survivability against enemy threats. F-15 EPAWSS will also improve reliability and sustainability. F-15 EPAWSS is linked to an aircraft operational flight program update schedule that works to integrate new capabilities with the airframe. Incorporation of corresponding spiral and / or phased technology / equipment improvements that include support equipment, mission planning systems, and training device upgrades will improve performance, supportability and aircrew training.

The F-15 EPAWSS upgrade will significantly improve the F-15's capability to autonomously and automatically detect, identify and locate radio frequency (RF) threats as well as provide the ability to deny, degrade, deceive, disrupt and defeat RF and electro-optical / infrared (EO / IR) threat systems in contested and unplanned operations within highly contested environments through 2040. The F-15 EPAWSS will provide indication, type and position of ground-based RF threats as well as the indication, type and bearing of airborne threats with the situational awareness needed to avoid, engage or negate the threat. The F-15 EPAWSS will prevent RF and IR threat systems from detecting or acquiring accurate targeting information prior to threat engagement to complicate and / or negate an enemy threat targeting solution--and effectively counter enemy missiles / weapons if adversary threat systems engage and employ weapons against friendly forces--through components such as chaff, flares, decoys / angle countermeasures and jamming.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Air Force Rotary Wing Avionics Development and Integration effort is a program to develop a fully integrated avionics upgrade that includes predictive terrain awareness.   This program focuses on developing and integrating technologies that will increase the situational awareness of helicopter crews in a degraded visibility environment.  A severable portion of this program is Brown Out Symbology Software &amp; Landing Guidance (BOSS-LG), which provides precision approach cues to command navigation to a landing point in adverse weather and/or reduced visibility conditions.  This total effort was initiated by the Defense Safety Oversight Council. 

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current and subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Guardian Angel (GA) is an Air Force non-aircraft weapon system within the overarching Battlefield Airmen Modernization program.  GA is a Family of Systems (FoS) based in both human and equipment capabilities formulated to execute Air Force Personnel Recovery (PR) across the full spectrum of military operations.  Established by the Air Force Chief of Staff in 2003 and officially captured in AFPD 10-9, the GA FoS is employed by three distinct Air Force specialties: Pararescuemen (PJ), Combat Rescue Officer (CRO), and Survival, Evasion, Resistance, Escape (SERE).  The GA FoS is comprised of nine critical mission areas:  Precision Aerial Insertion, Information Management, Force Application, Visual Augmentation, Maritime Recovery, Ground Mobility, Technical Rescue, Medical, and SERE.  GA focus is on maintaining legacy weapon system capability while modernizing/improving subsystems for better mission effectiveness.

Funds will be used to obtain significant improvements in operational capability and develop items within the GA FoS to include but not limited to:  SONAR, Maritime Recovery, Technical Recovery, Oxygen Systems, Medical Monitoring, and the Guardian Angel Air Operations Kit.  The Guardian Angel weapon system development activities also include studies, analysis, and developmental testing to support both current and future program planning and execution.  Funding will deliver enhanced capability for the dismounted Guardian Angel soldier in terms of dramatic weight reduction and increased mission effectiveness across the conflict spectrum. 

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Guardian Angel (GA) program will address warfighter immediate needs to standardize, modernize, and develop additional capability for the weapon system used by Combat Rescue Officers and Pararescuemen (Phase one). The program will also address future requirements for the weapon system that will encompass the needs of all three GA career fields (Phase two).  

Phase two of the GA program is an incremental evolutionary acquisition effort in which requirements are fullfilled through further sub-system development and integration.  These requirements are being identified in an ongoing study conducted by HQ Air Combat Command.  The program has been divided into two phases to more rapidly meet the user's immediate need to standardize and modernize the weapon system.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Air Force TENCAP increases warfighter effectiveness through the exploitation of national capabilities and promotes cross-domain integration of these capabilities into military operations/training, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) activities.

AF TENCAP exploits existing air, space, cyber, national and global ISR, and Non-Traditional ISR (NTISR) for operational and tactical applications by rapidly prototyping and providing capability demonstrations.  Projects are designed to transition to warfighters and/or national intelligence agencies for operational use, sustainment and appropriate acquisition Programs of Record for further development.  AF TENCAP projects can influence the design and operation of future air, space, cyber, national and global ISR and NTISR while providing awareness to warfighters and national intelligence agency organizations and units.  

Program consists of multiple small projects supporting one of the Air Force Core Function Mission Areas (CFMAs).  Projects are executed to provide continued support to the National Warfighter, operational and Tactical Warfighter, and to Special Operations Forces.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Projects are selected for development based upon needs identified by the program's customers - DOD Departments, Combatant Commands, Components, MAJCOMs, and/or National Intelligence Agencies.  Acquisition strategies are developed using a segmented gate strategy to limit and control risks.  Many projects are executed via existing contracts maintained by other agencies; others are executed via Air Force TENCAP contracts established with vendors responding to annual Broad Agency Announcements.  The U.S. government organization sponsoring a project is responsible for assuming acquisition, deployment, logistics, and budgetary responsibilities for the developed capability after it has been successfully demonstrated by Air Force TENCAP.

AF TENCAP projects typically use an incremental acquisition strategy. AF TENCAP utilizes a disciplined systems engineering approach that allows program team to solve problems through a series of segments. Each increment has to be successful to pursue the following segment which mitigates cost and schedule risk.

Contracts funded in this program element will be awarded using competitive procedures to the maximum extent possible.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Advanced Targeting Pods (ATPs) provide long-range target acquisition and expanded weapon delivery envelopes for greater aircraft survivability. ATPs feature an infrared (IR) sensor, charged coupled device television (CCD-TV), laser designator, eye-safe laser, laser spot tracker, infrared marker, and real-time video data link for connectivity with ground forces. As non-developmental items, the majority of improvements to ATPs are the result of investments made by industry Internal Research and Development (IRAD).  In addition to operational flight program (OFP) development, this funding provides for the development and integration of capabilities which are either above the capabilities of the industrial base or that require accelerated development timelines in order to meet operational requirements.  It also includes program management support, technical analysis, studies and assessments necessary to support the development and integration of future capabilities.  Data-linking is one such area where there is an identified gap between industrial capabilities and operational requirements. Additional development efforts will be structured to support the documented ATP requirements as well as urgent operational needs (UONs) as they become known.  

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The EC-130H COMPASS CALL is the USAF's wide-area, airborne Command and Control Warfare/Information Operations (C2W /IO) weapon system.  The employment of this system interdicts adversary's use of the electronic battlespace and is a key active component in the information battlespace and prosecution of Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO).  EC-130H COMPASS CALL's sophisticated electronic combat system is capable of surgical denial or disruption of adversary radio frequency (RF) communications systems and sensors.  The system was fielded in 1983 and to date has evolved through the fielding of the Baseline 2 configuration.  Due to the rapid advances in electronic attack technology, the EC-130H COMPASS CALL was designed to be easily modified and must continue to modernize and evolve to keep pace with adversary tactics and emerging technologies.  Continuous system development is required to maintain battlespace superiority.  

The EC-130H COMPASS CALL is a level of effort funded program and employs an incremental development and fielding strategy that puts capability into the warfighter's hands as soon as practical and ensures each iteration of the weapon system is effective against the highest priority threats.  To sustain that process requires a steady stream of system development funds.  Development funds are required to accomplish subsystem additions and improvements such as the digital signal analysis and exciter subsystem (AXE), the Special Purpose Emitter Array (SPEAR), new modern communications receiver technologies, new IR and counter radar technologies, the Human-to-Machine Interface (HMI), digital cockpit avionics with multi-function displays (glass cockpits), network centric operations, phased array transmit and receive apertures and other classified hardware and software developments necessary to counter military and commercial communications evolutions, command and control operations enhancements, and new/emerging sensor developments.  Funding in FY 2016 is required to support RDT&amp;E efforts for Baseline 3 (BL3) upgrades to the EC-130H COMPASS CALL fleet and ground systems/simulators.  The BL2 and BL3 programmed requirements have advanced significantly over the two previously fielded baselines.  BL2 and BL3 upgrades will help cover the electronic attack shortfall in the foreseeable future.  Obsolescence and diminishing manufacturing sources (DMS)/Vanishing Vendor Items (VVI) are addressed with each baseline upgrade as well as annually as part of the sustainment responsibilities.  The two COMPASS CALL Mission Crew Simulators (CCMCS) are upgraded per the Baseline schedule to ensure training capacity keeps pace and matches the operational and technological upgrades delivered in the fielded aircraft.  The Weapons System Trainer (WST) will mirror the capabilities of the fielded aircraft's cockpit avionics and communications equipment as well.

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current and future program planning and execution.  

Due to the rapidly changing threat environment encountered during our prolonged commitment to OCO, the acquisition program manager has the authority to redirect funding as necessary to meet current stated and emerging requirements.  

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Aircraft Engine Component Improvement Program (CIP) provides the only source of critical sustaining engineering support for in-service Air Force engines to maintain flight safety (highest priority), to correct service revealed deficiencies, to improve system operational readiness (OR) and reliability &amp; maintainability (R&amp;M), to reduce engine Life Cycle Cost (LCC), and to sustain engines throughout their service life.  

Historically, aircraft systems change missions, tactics, and environments (including new fuels) to meet changing threats throughout their lives.  New technical problems can develop in the engines through actual use and Engine CIP provides the means to develop fixes for these field problems.  Engine CIP funding is driven by field events and types/maturity of engines, not by the total engine quantity.  The program starts with government acceptance of the first procurement-funded engine and continues over the engine's life, gradually decreasing to a minimum level (safety/depot repairs) sufficient to keep older inventory engines operational.  Engine CIP, through "Lead the Fleet" operational use and accelerated mission testing, identifies and fixes engine-related problems ahead of operational impacts.  Engine CIP addresses out-of-warranty usage/life and enables the Air Force to obtain additional warranties when manufacturers incorporate Engine CIP improvements into production engines.  Engine CIP ensures continued improvements in engine R&amp;M, which reduce out year support costs.  Historically, R&amp;M related Engine CIP efforts significantly reduce out year Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) and spares costs.  Without Engine CIP, out year support funding would have to be significantly increased. 

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Aircraft Engine Component Improvement Program (CIP) provides the only source of critical sustaining engineering support for in-service Air Force engines to maintain flight safety (highest priority), to correct service revealed deficiencies, to improve system operational readiness (OR) and reliability &amp; maintainability (R&amp;M), to reduce engine Life Cycle Cost (LCC), and to sustain engines throughout their service life. Historically, aircraft systems change missions, tactics, and environments (including new fuels) to meet changing threats throughout their lives. New technical problems can develop in the engines through actual use and Engine CIP provides the means to develop fixes for these field problems. Engine CIP funding is driven by field events and types/maturity of engines, not by the total engine quantity. The program starts with government acceptance of the first procurement-funded engine and continues over the engine's life, gradually decreasing to a minimum level (safety/depot repairs) sufficient to keep older inventory engines operational. Engine CIP, through "Lead the Fleet" operational use and accelerated mission testing, identifies and fixes engine-related problems ahead of operational impacts. Engine CIP addresses out-of-warranty usage/life and enables the Air Force to obtain additional warranties when manufacturers incorporate Engine CIP improvements into production engines. Engine CIP ensures continued improvements in engine R&amp;M, which reduce out year support costs.  Historically, R&amp;M related Engine CIP efforts significantly reduce out year Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) and spares costs. Without Engine CIP, out year support funding would have to be significantly increased.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The F135 Aircraft Engine Component Improvement Program (CIP) supports F-35 single-engine fighter propulsion systems.  It provides the only source of critical sustaining engineering support for in-service Air Force propulsion systems.  Engine CIP maintains flight safety (highest priority), to correct service revealed deficiencies, to improve system Operational Readiness (OR) and Reliability &amp; Maintainability (R&amp;M), to reduce propulsion system Life Cycle Cost (LCC), and sustain the propulsion systems throughout the service life.  Historically, aircraft systems change missions, tactics, and environment (including new fuels) and meet changing threats throughout their lives.  New technical problems can develop in the propulsion system through actual use and the Engine CIP provides the means to develop fixes for these field problems.  Engine CIP funding is driven by field events and type/maturity of the propulsion systems, not by the total quantity.  The program starts with government acceptance of the first procurement-funded engine and continues over the propulsion system's life, gradually decreasing to a minimum level (safety/depot repairs) sufficient to keep older inventory propulsion systems operational.  Engine CIP, through "Lead the Fleet" operational use and accelerated mission testing, identifies and fixes propulsion-related problems ahead of operational impacts.  Engine CIP addresses out-of-warranty usage/life and enables the Air Force to obtain additional warranties when manufacturers incorporate Engine CIP improvements into production propulsion systems.  Engine CIP ensures continued improvements in R&amp;M, which reduce out year support costs.  Historically, R&amp;M related Engine CIP efforts significantly reduce out year O&amp;M and spares costs.  Without Engine CIP, out year support funding would have to be significantly increased.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) program provides a long range, conventional air-to-surface, autonomous, precision-guided, low-observable, standoff cruise missile compatible with fighter and bomber aircraft able to attack a variety of fixed or relocatable targets.  There are two variants of the JASSM missile; JASSM baseline and JASSM-Extended Range (JASSM-ER). The requirement for JASSM baseline is given in the JASSM Operational Requirements Document (ORD) dated 20 Jan 2004, and the JASSM-ER requirement is given in JASSM-ER Capability Development Document (CDD) dated 16 Apr 2010. Both JASSM missiles have improved reliability, separate milestone decision points and separate projects within a single program element. Aircraft integration of baseline JASSM is complete on the B-52H, F-16 (Block 50), B-1, B-2 and F-15E.  Objective aircraft include the F-16 (Block 40) and F-35.  Aircraft integration of JASSM-ER is complete on the B-1B. Objective aircraft are the B-52H, F16C/D (Block 50/52), B-2, F-16C/D (Blocks 25-42), F-15E and F-35.

The FY2016 funding request was reduced by $1.821 million to account for the availability of prior execution balances.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) program provides a long range, conventional air-to-surface, autonomous, precision-guided, low-observable, standoff cruise missile compatible with fighter and bomber aircraft able to attack a variety of fixed or relocatable targets.  This project develops the baseline JASSM missile.  The requirement for JASSM baseline is given in the JASSM Operational Requirements Document (ORD), dated 20 Jan 2004.  Aircraft integration of the baseline JASSM is complete on the B-52H, F-16 (Block 50), B-1, B-2, and F-15E.  Objective aircraft include the F-16 (Block 40)and F-35.  The government is buying the JASSM system based on a contractor-developed, government-approved System Performance Specification (SPS), this SPS is on contract.  The contractor assumes total system performance responsibility (TSPR) for Lots 1-6 as defined in the SPS; for Lot 7 and beyond, the government has approval authority of Class I configuration changes. This project also develops improvements to the JASSM and JASSM-ER fuze, including the development of the Electronic Safe and Arm Fuze (ESAF). The Common Telemetry Instrumentation Kit (C-TIK) is partially executed under this project as it is common to JASSM baseline and JASSM-ER. The program is evaluating Diminishing Manufacturing Sources Material Shortages (DMSMS) and several obsolescence issues.  FY15 is the last year of JASSM baseline RDT&amp;E and procurement; this program transitions to JASSM-ER only in FY16.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides a long range (over twice the range of baseline JASSM), conventional air-to-surface, autonomous, precision-guided, low observable, standoff cruise missile compatible with fighter and bomber aircraft.  The requirement for JASSM-ER is given in JASSM-ER Capability Development Document (CDD), dated 16 Apr 2010.  This project develops the extended range version of the JASSM missile (JASSM-ER).  The threshold integration platform for JASSM-ER is the B-1B.  Objective aircraft are B-52H, F16C/D (Block 50/52), B-2, F-16C/D (Blocks 25-42), F-15E, and F-35.  JASSM-ER provides the capability to attack a variety of high value fixed or relocatable targets with precision, through preplanned missions or target-of-opportunity, deeper into enemy territory than JASSM Baseline while minimizing the threat to launch aircraft.  The Air Force is developing JASSM-ER based on a contractor-developed, government-approved System Performance Specification (SPS).  The 16 JASSM-ER Operational Test flights were successfully completed in 2013 with a 100% success rate (16/16).  Currently, this project develops a Common Telemetry Instrumentation Kit (C-TIK) which will be used during flight testing and will be common to both JASSM Baseline and JASSM-ER.  The Electronic Safe and Arm Fuze (ESAF) is partially executed under this project since it's common to JASSM baseline and JASSM-ER. The JASSM program is evaluating Diminishing Sources Material Shortages (DMSMS) and several obsolescence issues.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Air and Space Operations Center Weapon System (AOC WS) program element provides development of Command and Control (C2) capabilities across the entire spectrum of air and space operations from the strategic to the tactical level.  There are three funded projects within the AOC WS program element:

Applications Development provides worldwide operational level C2 capabilities, which include: air battle planning, management, and execution; operational level C2 of Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD); in support of DoD, Coalition Partners, and other government agencies.  

Unit Command and Control (UC2) provides both the scheduling and mission preparation activities at the wing and squadron level and the capabilities to report and track the success of each mission and influence decisions on future Air Battle Planning.   

Personnel Recovery Command and Control (PRC2): Provides an adaptive, networked, decentralized and situationally-appropriate personnel recovery command and control system which supports personnel accountability and recovery missions worldwide.  PRC2 delivers a globally accessible, collaborative, interoperable and integrated system to prevent, prepare for and respond to isolating events across the Range of Military Operation in the joint/coalition operating environment.  The system collects, stores and delivers personnel/identity biometric data, emergency locator beacon registrations, isolated personnel reports, evasion plans of action, incident reports and other information management capabilities for predictive, preventive and personnel vulnerability analysis/assessment in support of Personnel Recovery across Department of Defense and other national and international entities.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, these budget activities includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project funds operational development necessary to acquire, modify, and sustain segments of Air Force's Command and Control (C2) capabilities and services. Applications Development provides worldwide operational capabilities for AF C2 in support of DoD, Coalition Partners, and other government agencies. These efforts focus on, but are not limited to, support of the Joint Forces Air Component Commander (JFACC) that provides air, space and cyber support as presented to the AOC and to other C2 systems. Applications Development efforts deliver capabilities identified in the Joint Command and Control (JC2) Capability Development Document (CDD) (2013). Applications Development activities include but are not limited to the following: 1) Command and Control Air Operations Suite-Command and Control Information Services (C2AOS-C2IS) needs identified in the Capability Definition Package (CDP) (2012). C2AOS-C2IS I creates web-enabled information services to expose air operations data using standardized schemas, such as those developed by the Air Operations Community of Interest (AO COI). C2AOS-C2IS I also develops, matures, fields, and maintains modular net-centric C2 applications for air battle planning, execution, and management functions to include 
Network Enabled Weapons (NEW); C2AOS-C2IS I will focus on but not be limited to, the remainder of CDP and Theater Battle Management Core Systems-Force Level (TBMCS-FL) functionality along with the capabilities to include applications and services to support air mission and Friendly Order of Battle (FrOB) execution, Alerting, Publish and Subscribe, Content Management and Reporting; and integration with a Joint Command and Control (JC2) Reference Architecture (RA) host infrastructure environment.

In FY16, core activities for Applications Development include but are not limited to the following: 1) developing capabilities to support planning and replanning of the Air Battle Plan; generation and dissemination of the Air Tasking Order; defense planning and execution; targeting; weaponeering; personnel recovery tasks; other applications and services supporting C2 in the joint environment; 2) providing support to and participating in the Air Operations Community of Interest (AO COI) to improve air operations information interoperability among all joint and coalition systems within the Air Operations (AO) domain; 3) developing and assessing C2 air, space, intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and cyber technologies that will improve joint and coalition warfighter interoperability; 4) transitioning existing C2 capabilities to a net-centric environment; and 5) improving operational level C2 of Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD). Applications Development efforts include evaluation and maturation of future air, space, and cyber C2 concepts identified through research, risk reduction, prototyping, current operations, exercises, and demonstrations.

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution, as well as future program planning.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project funds are used to develop, integrate, field, and maintain Unit Command and Control (UC2) as an evolving sequence of increasing software capabilities that support the execution of the air battle plan and the air tasking order message received from the AOC.  UC2 operations software systems meet needs identified in the TBMCS Operational Requirements Document (ORD) (2001), the UC2 Baseline Systems Requirement Document (SRD) and the UC2 SRD 106 Appendix, by providing both the scheduling and mission preparation activities at the wing, group and squadron level, and the capabilities to report and track the success of each mission and influence decisions on future air battle planning.  Unit Command and Control (UC2) is fielded to the Wing Operations Center (WOC), the Maintenance Operations Center (MOC), the Squadron Operations Center (SOC), and many other work-centers.  UC2 requirements will be identified using the system modification request process.  

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution, as well as future program planning.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project funds operational development necessary to acquire, modify, and sustain a segment of Air Force's C2 capabilities and services associated with Personnel Recovery.  The Personnel Recovery Command and Control (PRC2) program develops and delivers tools and services for planning, collaborating and managing search and rescue efforts, as well as disseminating related information to all personnel recover mission coordinators across PR network.  PRC2 provides an adaptive, networked, decentralized and timely situational awareness information for personnel recovery supporting personnel accountability and recovery missions worldwide.  PRC2 delivers a globally accessible, collaborative, interoperable and integrated system to prevent, prepare for and respond to isolating events across a broad spectrum of US government which may include in the joint/coalition military and civilian rescue mission.  The Joint Personnel Recovery (JPR) Initial Capability Document (ICD) (2012) articulates capabilities needed for PRC2.

The system collects, stores and delivers personnel/identity biometric data, emergency locator beacon registrations, isolated personnel reports, evasion plans of action, incident reports and other information management capabilities. The information is used for predictive, preventive and personnel vulnerability analysis and assessment in support of Personnel Recovery across Department of Defense and other national and international entities. 

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution, as well as future program planning.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>In FY 2016, Project 67485L, Theater Air Control Sys Imp (TACSI), includes new start effort for JTIDS LINK 16 Terminal replacement.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Control and Reporting Center (CRC) program element provides for development and integration of new capabilities, upgrades, and modifications including those required to maintain capability due to replacement of diminishing manufacturing sources.  The CRC is a mobile, ground-based theater air control system (TACS) surveillance and battle management command and control (BMC2) element. It consists of facilities, equipment, and people.  It is a customizable, modular, transportable, and persistent weapon system employed at the tactical level to support air and surface operations.   The CRC projects include development of Theater Air Control Systems Improvement (TACSI) capabilities.  These efforts include, but are not limited to, the development and modification of the AN/TRC-23A Operations Module (OM), the AN/TRC-215 Remote Radio Secure Voice System (RRSVS) and the Joint Tactical Information Distribution System (JTIDS) Module Link 16 Terminal. JTIDS Module link 16 Terminal is a new start in FY16.

AN/TRC-23A OM is a low density/high demand (LD/HD), rapidly deployable, ground-based C2 asset.  This automated, computer-based information system provides operators the real-time battlespace picture necessary to plan, direct, and control tactical air operations and airspace management tasks.  In order to meet warfighter requirements, incremental updates are required. For example, these improvements will add Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRnet), Mode 5 integration, improved data links, and Multiple Source Correlator Tracker upgrades. Modifications will be required to integrate with the Three Dimensional Expeditionary Long Range Radar (3DELRR).  AN/TRC-215 RRSVS is a voice radio and OM-interface unit. The RRSVS allows real-time, secure voice communications between aircraft in development and battle management C2 operators in the CRC. Everything over Internet Protocol (EoIP), which is used for external communications, will also be integrated into a future RRSVS upgrade. JTIDS Link 16 Terminal Replacement will provide crypto modernization and will meet the FAA mandated frequency re-mapping requirement.

In FY 2016, Project 67485L, Theater Air Control Sys Imp (TACSI), includes new start effort for JTIDS LINK 16 Terminal replacement.

Activities also include studies and analysis supporting current and future program planning and future development of open system architecture requirements.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development. This budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Mission: E-3 Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) is the premier airborne platform providing battle management (BM)/command and control (C2) for Commander In Chief and combatant commander tasking in joint, allied, and coalition operations, humanitarian relief, and homeland defense. AWACS provides a real-time picture of friendly, neutral, and hostile air activity. Its capabilities include all-altitude/all-weather surveillance of the battle space; early warning of enemy actions; a real-time ability to find, fix, track, and assess airborne or maritime threats; and detection, location, and identification of electronic emitters.

1. Block 40/45 is replacing AWACS 1970's vintage mission systems that are experiencing Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues, are difficult and expensive to upgrade, and limit overall AWACS system performance. The Block 40/45 upgrade will improve integration, quality and timeliness of sensor data to the shooter, improve Combat Identification (CID), improve AWACS contribution to Time Critical Targeting via Data Link Infrastructure (DLI), improve electronic support measures processing and enable more effective, faster upgrades via an open-system, Ethernet-based architecture. This upgrade also updates the ground support infrastructure, training systems [(Mission Crew Training Set (MCTS), and Mission Computing Maintenance Trainer (MCMT)], data links and the Avionics Integration Support Facility (AISF) all located at Tinker Air Force Base

2. Next Generation Identification Friend or Foe (NGIFF) provides AWACS with enhanced IFF interrogator operation to add a more secure Mode 5 capability. The National Security Agency (NSA) declared IFF Mode 4 unsecure and obsolete on 5 Nov 2003. Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memo 047-07 requires IFF Mode 5 interrogation capability by FY14.  NGIFF is on track to declare IOC in Dec 2015.  The new Mode 5 interrogation capability extends the effective range of the AWACS interrogator, while helping discriminate against closely spaced cooperative targets. NGIFF developed and integrated a basic Mode 5 capability on Block 30/35 starting in FY09 and began developing a full Mode 5 capability on Block 40/45 in FY11. Hardware will be common between the Block 30/35 and Block 40/45 platforms. NGIFF will also integrate Mode S, a civilian air traffic control capability residing in the NGIFF hardware, as funding allows.

3. DMS Replacement of Avionics for Global Operations and Navigation (DRAGON) completes the FAA/International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)/EUROCONTROL (European Organization for the Safety of Air Navigation) air traffic control mandated safety of flight capabilities. This program will provide the E-3 fleet with the flight instruments and other avionics for the Required Navigation Performance (RNP), and the surveillance and communication capabilities necessary to maintain continued critical unrestricted access to global airspace. Non-compliance will result in airspace restrictions and denials that will impact AWACS ability to support worldwide responses to situations requiring immediate on-scene Command and Control (C2) Battle Management (BM). DRAGON replaces the existing Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) Global Positioning System (GPS) Integrated Navigation System (GINS) with a modern Flight Management System (FMS) that will accommodate new capabilities including Mode 5 IFF and Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS). Also included as part of the modification is the addition of data link communications, voice and data link digital radios, improved visual displays, and competitive acquisition of DRAGON flight simulators. Emphasis on employment of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) avionics is expected to lower cost, reduce the tech refresh cycle, and enhance life cycle management. The Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase of DRAGON is being executed as a Cooperative Program between the US and NATO.

4. Electronic Protection (EP): EP will provide improved radar processing in a specific flight environment to meet a classified requirement.  Processing will initially address radar modes comprising 90% of operational AWACS radar usage.  EP will install an adjunct processor that works in parallel with the current Radar System Improvement Program (RSIP) system.  The EP-processed radar picture will appear on the battle manager's display in place of the current RSIP output when the EP radar modes are selected.  

5.  Training, Support, and Infrastructure (TSI) program provides continuing management support for AWACS modernization and enhancement. These activities include managing the AWACS Development Test and Evaluation (DT&amp;E) infrastructure and tracking and monitoring AWACS training, support equipment and program Government Furnished Property. The overall Development Test and Evaluation (DT&amp;E) test infrastructure supports development, production, and sustainment projects and maintains facilities to support AWACS aircraft during system and sub-system testing at Boeing Field, WA.  Funding is shared between Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) and production funds.  The TSI assets also support multiple international Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&amp;C) projects on a maintenance fee basis, not limited to projects for France, Saudi Arabia, United Kingdom, Japan, and North Atlantic Treaty (NATO) AEW&amp;C efforts..
Key programs include contractual management of the AWACS Avionics Integration Laboratory (AIL) integrated with the Block 40/45 configured Advanced Development Lab (ADL) and the AWACS Radar Systems Integration Lab/Software Development Facility (SIL/SDF). These labs provide US, Foreign Military Sales (FMS), and international customers with a configured development and qualification system and subsystem environment supporting all AWACS system and radar development, production, and sustainment.  TSI efforts allow new support equipment technologies and test strategies to be analyzed to ensure concurrent capability to sustain existing, modified, and upgraded E-3 equipment. TSI supports trainer/simulator upgrade analysis and requirements definition to ensure trainers and simulators are kept current with the AWACS baseline. 


6. Command and Control, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C2ISR): C2ISR system improvements investigate and develop future capabilities of the AWACS weapon system. These efforts also include but are not limited to the investigation, analysis and development to ensure that AWACS successfully integrates with joint and coalition forces in a net-centric environment. C2ISR primarily supports pre-systems acquisition in the areas of materiel solution analysis and technology development. This is accomplished by prototyping and demonstrating capabilities required by the warfighter but also includes developing an E-3 Modernization &amp; Sustainment Roadmap that projects user capability needs, as well as materiel solutions for the user needs.
 
7. Internet Protocol Enabled Communication (IPEC): IPEC will provide the Block 40/45 E-3 with a medium-bandwidth IP communications capability to connect to the Global Information Grid and will support net-centric operations/warfare. IPEC will provide a reliable IP-enabled communication capability to support a shortened digitized kill-chain of time-sensitive targets. The modification will provide a permanent INMARSAT-based IP-enabled communications package supporting warfighter identified requirements for increased bandwidth SIPRNET and multi-domain networks.

8. MIDS (Multifunctional Information Distribution System) Radio System will provide a Link 16 capability with high-jam-resistance, high-speed, crypto-secure computer-to-computer connectivity in support of every type of military platform from Air Force fighters to Navy submarines.  Current 20 year old Class 2 terminal has sustainability/Dimishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues and does not support mandated Crypto Mod (CM) &amp; Freq Remap (FR).  MIDS resolves DMS issues, provides CM &amp; FR,  Link 16 enhancements &amp; growth for Next Gen Tactical Data Link (TDL).

9. AWACS current Combat Identification (CID) capability is based upon 1960's era technology that has become unsustainable, and requires an update to retain a significant part of AWACS overall mission capability.  
AWACS will addresses C2 CID shortfalls with a modern, persistent Airborne Moving Target Indication (AMTI) Battle Management Command and Control (BMC2) combat ID.  CID supports the kill chain and decision superiority.  The upgrade will also provide for better integration into Block 40/45 and NGIFF equipped AWACS aircraft.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational Systems Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

The FY2016 funding request was reduced by $2.284 million to account for tha availability of prior execution balances.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>a. The Joint Terminal Control Training and Rehearsal System (JTC TRS) project, under the Tactical Airborne Control System, funds development necessary to provide a Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) capable, high-fidelity simulator for Battlefield Airmen, to include Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC) operations, Special Tactics Air Traffic Control, Assault Zone operations, Guardian Angel combat rescue, and Air Support Operations Center (ASOC) operations.  

JTC TRS is essential to provide initial training, mission qualification training, continuation training, and currency control requirements JTACs and Special Tactics personnel.  JTAC control requirements exceed the ability of live-fly aircraft to meet, and JTC TRS is the only capability projected to enable JTACs to achieve and maintain minimum required training for both qualification and proficiency in accordance with the U.S and Partner Nation Memorandum of Agreement for JTAC certification and qualification. 

The JTC TRS Project provides research and development to facilitate interoperability with joint and sister Service air-ground simulation using industry standards.   Future JTC TRS development will provide the capability to network aircrew full mission trainers and training centers in a live-virtual-constructive network. This development effort will also integrate ASOCs with the Joint Theater Air to Ground Simulation System (JTAGSS) trainer for Joint Fires integration.  The Personnel Recovery capability is envisioned to be a "plug and play" module for the host JTC TRS. The PR capability will provide Guardian Angel personnel with an immersive LVC environment to plan, train, and rehearse their employment, rescue/recovery, and combat trauma care skills.  The simulator will supplement live field training and live-fly sorties to provide realistic introductory, proficiency, currency, and upgrade training in a simulated battlefield, disaster, or humanitarian relief environment.

JTAGSS is a continuation of the ASOC simulation trainer initially funded in 2009 and complements the JTC TRS trainer by providing a total air-ground constructive simulation environment for integrated networked training and mission rehearsal capability that will develop JTAC/CCT and ASOC/SOF (Special Operations Forces) C2 (Command and Control) battle staff skills.  JTAGSS will provide the ASOC, SOF, and TACP (Tactical Air Control Party) with the vertical and horizontal C2 communications and coordination training and mission rehearsal required for mission effectiveness.   There are insufficient exercises and live training events available to meet mandated readiness requirements.  The system will include a secure network connection, a constructive simulation environment generator with sharable databases, computer work stations that have synthetic reflex agent applications for each ASOC/SOF crew position to execute the air tasking order.  

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts for systems, fielded or approved, for production, that have been fully validated through formal Operation Utility Evaluation (OUE) and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

b. The acquisition strategy for the JTAGSS trainer will be to field advance technology demonstration units to continue to perform proof of concept and technology validation of mission simulations for all ASOC crew positions including detailed communications planning, asset deconfliction, integration of joint fires, and other critical mission areas required for integrated TACP/ASOC C2 mission success.  At the completion of the technology validation, a contract will be competitively awarded to complete JTAGSS  development, deployment and integration.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Tactical Air Control Party (TACP)s are Air Force units manned by airmen who advise Army Ground Commanders and plan, request and control air power in support of army ground maneuver operations. TACPs also coordinate, request, and control airlift support and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) support for Army combat operations, and they provide ground communications support for federal disaster response and Homeland Defense operations.  TACPs deploy with their aligned Army units and operate in a variety of environments including fixed operations from tactical operations centers (TOCs), mobile operations in tactical vehicles, and dismounted (on foot) operations with Army infantry patrols.  

The purpose of the TACP-Modernization program is to upgrade TACP voice, data and video communications capabilities, upgrade targeting capabilities, and improve TACP battlefield awareness capabilities.  These capabilities are employed at all echelons of Army organizations by: Air Support Operation Centers (ASOCs), Division TACPs, Brigade TACPs, Battalion TACPs, and Joint Terminal Attack Controllers (JTACs) deployed with Army companies or scout teams on the front lines.  Improved targeting and data communications capabilities provide more accurate target coordinates, reduce close air support (CAS) response times, and reduce the probability of fratricide or collateral damage through the use of networked data communications.     

The TACP-M program provides and modernizes capabilities in three major areas: Operation Center Systems, Vehicle-Mounted Systems, and Close Air Support System (CASS) software.  

Close Air Support System (CASS) software segment interfaces with all TACP-M components and joint interoperability with CAS aircraft (A-10, F-16, F/A-18, AV-8B, etc), remotely piloted aircraft (RPA), artillery fire support systems, network-enabled weapons, and C2 nodes. To enable data communications with those systems / nodes, CASS incorporates several communications protocols including Variable Message Format (VMF), Link 16, Marine Tactical System (MTS), and U.S. Message Text Format (USMTF). CASS v1.4.5 will provide advanced communication and targeting capability on mobile computing devices for Dismounted TACPs, as well as provide significant interoperability improvements in software used in vehicles and operations centers. Future upgrades necessary to maintain interoperability with CAS aircraft, joint fire support systems, and emerging data networking waveforms will be guided by the TACP CASS Information System Initial Capabilities Document (IS ICD), which was approved by the Air Force Requirement Oversight Council (AFROC), Functional Capabilities Board (FCB), and Joint Capabilities Board (JCB).

This program is in Budget Activity 07, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Tactical Data Links (TDL), as a subset of the broader airborne network, are used in a combat environment to exchange information such as messages, data, radar tracks, target information, platform status, imagery, and command assignments.  TDLs provide interoperability, local and global connectivity, and situational awareness to the user when operating under rapidly changing operational conditions.  TDLs provide a jam-resistant; secure digital data transfer network capability with new and standardized waveforms and data formats allowing line-of-sight (LOS) and beyond-line- of-sight (BLOS) intra- and inter-flight communications.  TDLs increase mission effectiveness, provide positive identification of aircraft in the network, correlate on- and off-board sensor data sharing, target, and threat information, and provide the datalink to accomplish time critical targeting and other mission update functions.  TDLs are used by all service theater command and control (C2) elements, weapons platforms, and sensors.

TDLs include, but are not limited to:  Link 16, Link 11, Situational Awareness Data Link (SADL), Multifunction Advanced Data Link (MADL) Variable Message Format (VMF), Integrated Broadcast Service (IBS), Intra-Flight Data Link (IFDL), and Tactical Targeting Network Technology (TTNT).  TDL efforts include incorporating changes and additions to the Link-16 message standard (MIL-STD-6016E) and applicable Interface Change Proposals (ICPs), assisting with Air Force and joint interoperability certification testing with the Air Combat Command (ACC) and Joint Interoperability Test Center (JITC); future development, integration, and verification of Operational Flight Program (OFP) upgrades due to TDL integration; support of data gathering processes; studying and incorporating data link technologies to ensure effectiveness and efficiency of the Global Strike and Global Persistent Attack CONOPS.

This effort provides critical capability and enhancements to the airborne network by creating common development, integration and interoperability among ground and C2 platforms and responds to quick reaction capability integration and demonstration including, but not limited to Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS), Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS), the Air and Space Operations Center (AOC), Global Hawk, Predator, Reaper, Rivet Joint, Combat Sent, and Cobra Ball.  TDLs keep all C2ISR platforms and data linked weapons current/interoperable in the airborne network to enable Global Strike, Global Persistent Attack, Offensive and Defensive Counterair (OCA and DCA) and Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) missions.

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution, as well as future program planning.

The FY2016 funding was reduced for under execution by $.079 million to account for the availability of prior execution balances.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development.  These budget activities include development efforts to upgrade systems currently fielded or has approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Command and Control Constellation (C2C) is the sole Air Force program for defining, developing, and assessing integrated effects of global, theater and tactical level Air Force air, space, and cyber command and control (C2) capabilities in support of the joint warfighter.  The Air Force faces a complex future where conflict will range across a broad spectrum of operations and lethality requiring capabilities with the maximum possible flexibility to deal with the widest possible range of conflict.  

The C2C is the enabling program element for C2 Integration/Modernization.  The Air Force is working to establish a C2 framework and architecture to be used as a unifying vision of command and control for each of the services core functions.  C2C supports the defense strategy through:  integration of air; space cyber and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR); architectural analysis; prototyping; experimentation and innovation to develop cross-cutting solutions to enable an improved "sense-to-kill" cycle time.  C2C innovations and experimentation provide strategic, operational, and tactical direction for Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership and Education, Personnel and Facilities (DOTMLPF) solutions to facilitate an integrated mission environment to support C2 planning and execution for air, space, and cyberspace.  C2C also provides an in-depth development and analyses of C2 operational systems and technical architectures geared towards identifying capability gaps, identifying required "to be" information services, and evaluating C2 program planned improvements.  Through prototyping and experimentation, C2C integrates rapidly developing technologies to promote common standards, data sharing, and information services across the Air Force and joint warfighting applications in the support of joint enterprise solutions.

Project 5078, Horizontal Integration (HI) conducts DOTMLPF analyses and assessments to guide cross-cutting, C2 sub-enterprise and cyberspace investment decisions that integrate USAF capabilities into joint and coalition operations.  HI identifies, prioritizes and develops requirements, and horizontally integrates solution recommendations to ensure that the latest technologies and information services are integrated into a cross cutting C2 systems across all warfighter domains.  The HI strategy will be validated by Headquarters, Air Force (HAF) to ensure that initiatives are harmonized with the most urgent warfighter needs described by the C2 Capability Assessment Team (CAT), C2 Core Function Master Plan (CFMP) that support the 2012 Air Force, Joint and Defense Strategies and Operational Concepts.  Once validated, HI funds are applied towards identifying the most critical warfighter capabilities to ensure they are horizontally integrated into both Air Force and joint C2 programs of record.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>In FY 2014, Project 675078, Horizontal Integration, was completed.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Horizontal Integration (HI) develops an integrated mission environment that supports cross-cutting solutions across the air, space, and cyberspace command and control (C2) warfighter domain.  HI activities include:  requirements, architecture, systems engineering, technology development, risk reduction, prototyping, and transition.  These activities are required to:  identify, design, develop, experiment, and implement C2 solutions supporting operational requirements for warfighting integration and interoperability needs which are not the sole responsibility of a specific program of record.

The nature of integrated and interoperable C2 warfighting capabilities spans multiple platforms and domains.  These capabilities are routinely being adjusted to meet the changing requirements from the warfighting communities.  The HI project is uniquely designed to look across platforms and domains enabling the Air Force to respond to operator needs across the seams of individual systems.  These horizontal integration initiatives will be prototyped, assessed, appropriately captured in requirements documents and then transitioned to programs of record for production, fielding and sustainment.

Systems Engineering and analysis is the 'glue' that holds command and control constellation (C2C) elements together and closes the seams in the C2 architectures.  Capability analysis identifies areas where interoperability can be improved within the Air Force, as well as among joint services, and coalition partners.  Once capability issues are identified, they are prioritized and pilot initiatives are developed to provide solutions to the warfighter challenges to resolve the capability gaps.  The HI project also helps to competitively prototype integrated solutions against validated program requirements.

The benefits of these activities are two-fold:  the operational community is able to weigh the cost, risk, and performance trade-offs between enterprise solutions versus program centric solutions, and it supports competitive prototyping of all acquisition programs.  The synchronization of HI prototyping and program milestone requirements offers an effective environment for increasing interoperability while reducing the impact of this policy on multiple programs.  An infrastructure environment manages a continuous distributed operational environment that supports air, space, and cyberspace C2 and rapid acquisition, prototyping, development, integration, and fielding.  C2 initiatives may use this infrastructure to mature their development status prior to entry into operational and technical suitability assessment.

The HI prototype performances are assessed for operational utility, and the most promising initiatives/technologies will be matured and transitioned into weapon system configuration control baselines.  Requirement documents will be published and revised, and a requirements database and implementation plan identifying the most significant C2C net-centric integration issues will be updated to catalog the activities necessary to accomplish this integration.

In addition, this project supports concept exploration, program definition/risk reduction efforts, and studies that support continuous improvements in C2.  Guided by the Major Commands (MAJCOM) validated C2 capability gaps developed by the HI Capability Assessment Team annual process and the defense strategy to meet the evolving Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2/AD) threats to air, space and cyber C2 operations, these improvements include but are not limited to:  integration of airspace and cross-domain synchronized operations, C2 of integrated air and missile defense, C2 of Air Force Forces and agile combat support, dynamic aerial network capabilities, and Non-Traditional ISR (NTISR), from 4th and 5th generation aircraft through processing and assessment, and interoperability with joint service, allied and coalition systems, C2 of personnel recovery, and air-sea battle.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support current program planning and execution, as well as future program planning.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Deliberate and Crisis Action Planning and Execution Segments (DCAPES) is a system being developed as the next-generation Air Force interface to the Joint Operational Planning and Execution System (JOPES). DCAPES is the Air Force's single system to present, plan, source, mobilize, deploy, account for, sustain, redeploy, and reconstitute forces for contingency and crisis operations. This system provides a real time, two way interchange of personnel, manpower, logistics, and operational data between the Air Force and the warfighting Combatant Commanders. It matches people, cargo, and airframes/weapon systems to the Combatant Commander's warfighting requirements. Acquisition of this system supports the Air Force's expeditionary force concept.

Logistics Feasibility Analysis Capability (LOGFAC) is a Web-enabled application that resides on Global Command and Control System - Air Force (GCCS-AF) infrastructure and supports logistics / operational planning staffs at Headquarters Air Staff, Major Command (MAJCOM) and Unit levels by determining wartime consumables and pre-positioning of assets for deliberate planning based on the War Mobilization Plan, Volume 4 (WMP-4).  
Development activities include Logistics Module/Manpower and Personnel Module-Base (LOGMOD/MANPER B), War and Mobilization Planning (WMP), Enhanced Contingency Rotational AEF SchedulingTool (ECAST), Web Enablement, and JOPES Modernization Migration. Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning to modify systems to consume authoritative force structure from Global Force Management - Data Initiative (GFM-DI) organizational servers, linking the identifiers to or replacing current identifiers and, as applicable, exposing the data in a net-centric fashion. Requirements validated with the Capability Development Document for DCAPES dated 2 June 2006.

This effort is an evolutionary follow-on to the Contingency Operations Mobility Planning and Execution System (COMPES). DCAPES replaced the operational tasking and priorities functionality of COMPES with modern relational databases, integrated-distributed database, and common and shared data consistent with the joint vision for integrated command and control. DCAPES is intended to provide a command and control capability by exchanging data with a range of planning support systems to provide a more effective force projection capability for a wider range of operational scenarios and will fully support the force provider function of the Air Force Forces (AFFOR) commander. DCAPES along with numerous other war planning support legacy systems are transitioning into a net-centric Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) environment via a War Planning and Execution System (WPES) management construct.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Specifically, cataloging data from applicable authoritative data sources.  Federal Logistics Data (FEDLOG) and/or Air Force Interchangeability and Substitutability Grouping List (D043) have been identified as possible sources of this data. This cataloging data consists of indicative data for applicable National Stock Numbers (NSNs) to include nomenclature, unit of issue, source of supply, unit cost and other critical data elements. This data is critical for determining funding shortfalls. Without up to date unit costs LOGFAC could be grossly under estimating War Reserve Material (WRM) funding shortfalls.</r2:Text>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>In FY 2015, Project 670003, JSTARS efforts were terminated.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The JSTARS is the world's premier airborne ground surveillance platform, meeting joint combat capability requirements.  The 707-based E-8C JSTARS aircraft provides all-weather radar-derived Command and Control, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C2ISR) and targeting information on moving and stationary ground/surface targets to include dismounts, slow moving rotary and fixed wing aircraft, and rotating antennas.  JSTARS provides target information for matching direct attack aircraft, standoff weapons, and ground-based attack assets against selected targets.  It can be cued by other intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) and target acquisition systems.  This capability enables air and ground regional/geographic commanders to effectively make and execute battlefield decisions at the component commander's level to battlefield forces.  It contributes to predictive battle space awareness.    

This program element enhanced the warfighter's ability to achieve the joint vision of combat operations.  It developed advanced battle management aids and information fusion technologies to enable rapid decisions in tracking and killing time-critical targets.  Concept exploration, program definition/risk reduction efforts, and studies supported continuous improvements in C2ISR, network centric operational capabilities, and interoperability with joint service, allied, and coalition systems.

With the AF decision to begin the Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) Recapitalization Program in FY15, and inclusion of funding for the program included in the FY15 President's Budget, no Modernization funds were requested for the legacy E-8C JSTARS program in FY 2015 and beyond.  

This program element last comprised of one development program, JSTARS Modernization, and the supporting Test and Infrastructure. Development efforts for the Prime Mission Equipment-Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (PME-DMS) and Communications and Networking Upgrades (CNU) developmental programs were completed in FY 2013.  

In FY14, Project 670003 JSTARS was completed, with JSTARS Extended Test Support (JETS), JSTARS Test Force (JTF) and Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) parts disposition continuing to January 2015. 

I. JSTARS Modernization:

In FY 2014, the JSTARS modernization program consisted of multiple efforts to develop and integrate platform wide system improvements such as, but not limited to, Multi-Agency Communication Capability (MACC), CENTRIX, Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI) Risk Reduction and Beyond-Line-of-Sight (BLOS) Network Architecture Upgrades (BNAU) .  

Training and support systems upgrade efforts included, but are not limited to: Weapon Systems Trainer (WST); Navigator Training System (NTS); and Mission Crew Trainers to include a Mission Maintenance Trainer (MMT), Prime Mission Equipment-Maintenance Training Device (PME-MTD) and the Mission System Trainer (MST).

II. Test and Infrastructure: 

The test infrastructure included the JSTARS Extended Test Support (JETS), JSTARS Test Force (JTF), and C2 Enterprise Integration Facility (CEIF). All JSTARS efforts rely on the components of this test infrastructure to carry out RDT&amp;E activities. The infrastructure included a T-3 test aircraft, laboratories, support facilities, protection level (PL-2) security, Information Assurance (IA), and range support. All of the developmental programs have been completed. In FY 2014, the program began the transfer of test infrastructure assets to Robins AFB. The JETS contract and JTF lease will be extended into the second quarter FY 2015 to facilitate preparation of the T-3 aircraft for retirement and the disposition of residual Government Furnished Equipment (GFE).  

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development. This budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Air Force operates a variety of combat aircraft that carry numerous and varied stores (munitions, missiles, fuel tanks, targeting pods, range pods, electronic countermeasures pods, etc.). Stores are carried in countless different loading combinations determined by operational and training scenarios, missions, tactics, and weapon development programs. Aircraft stores combinations change as operational plans and tactics change and as new stores are developed and fielded. Before operational, training, or test use, the Air Force must certify these configurations for safe loading, carriage, and separation (jettison and normal release), as well as verify ballistics accuracy under the user-certified carriage and employment parameters. The Air Force SEEK EAGLE program completes certification recommendations and recommended flight clearances through any combination of engineering analysis, wind tunnel testing, modeling and simulation, and ground/flight test and evaluation. The SEEK EAGLE effort encompasses eight disciplines: Fit and Function, Flutter, Loads, Stability and Control, Electromagnetic Compatibility/Interference (EMC/EMI), Separations, Ballistics, and Safe Escape.

In support of certification, the program recommends about 1000 aircraft/store combinations for flight each year with analysis and testing, requiring from weeks to years depending on the complexity. Integrated solutions for combat aircrew weapon delivery planning problems are developed and provided to combat forces via Combat Weapons Delivery Software (CWDS) and Joint Safe Escape Analysis Solution (JSEAS).  SEEK EAGLE works in coordination with the Air Force Safety Center to provide Hazards of Electromagnetic Radiation to Ordnance (HERO) analysis and certification recommendations of ordnance systems containing electro-explosive devices. The program is also responsible for inserting new and emerging technologies into the SEEK EAGLE process as well as providing resources for the sustainment of a viable Air Force aircraft/store certification capability.

SEEK EAGLE funds are currently budgeted to support certification testing and analysis for new and inventory stores including, but not limited to: Small Diameter Bomb I &amp; II (SDB), Laser Joint Direct Attack Munitions (LJDAM), Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM), Air Intercept Missile (AIM-9X), Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AIM-120D), Miniature Air-Launched Decoy (MALD), BRU-57 (Smart Bomb Rack), BRU-61 (SDB Bomb Rack), Wind Corrected Munitions Dispenser (WCMD), Sniper Targeting Pod with video data link, LITENING Targeting Pod with video data link, laser guided bombs, F-22 supersonic tank, B61 (Mod 12), penetrator warhead upgrades (BLU-111/BLU-117), practice bomb and aircraft instrumentation pod modifications.  SEEK EAGLE funds are also used to support certification of other inventory stores on Combat Air Forces (CAF) and Special Operations Command (SOCOM) aircraft, assist the F-35 JPO with subject matter expertise in the System Development and Demonstration phase (e.g., development of organic store certifications capability to support F-35 in the Production, Sustainment, and Follow-on Development phases), sustain organic F-22 store certifications capability, and to obtain non-inventory stores and store data for post-integration certification requirements. 

The FY2016 funding request was reduced by $2.306 million to account for the availability of prior execution balances.   

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development.  These budget activities include development efforts to upgrade systems currently fielded or which have approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY 2016, Project Number 674567, M&amp;S Foundations includes new start efforts.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>United States Air Force (USAF) Modeling &amp; Simulation (M&amp;S) Program Element (PE) is broken into two thrust areas:  Modeling and Simulation Foundations, and Warfighter Readiness.  It directly supports Air Force, Joint, Coalition composite training and rehearsal, concept development, and acquisition and testing through modeling and simulation development as well as the integration of these across and within Live, Virtual, and Constructive (LVC) environments.  This program focuses on support of Department of Defense (DoD) Training Transformation (T2), acquisition excellence initiatives, and foundational capabilities needed for interoperability, accessibility, reuse, and scalability.  It allows the authoritative portrayal of new and emerging Air Force capabilities within DoD and coalition LVC environments; as well as reciprocating capabilities within Air Force LVC environments.  

LVC environments today are used as the most cost effective and practical means to meet mission needs.  In support of the DoD T2 initiative, USAF M&amp;S program thrust areas develop and modernize models and simulations that are the constructive backbone of Air Force and joint training and rehearsal.  Once these models and simulations are developed, they are integrated across training LVC environments for use by Major and Combatant Commands.  This development and integration is imperative to ensure that air, space, and cyberspace training and mission rehearsal activities are supported with realistic, interoperable, and readily available tools, data, and services.  These, in turn, enable joint, coalition, and interagency training required to prepare forces for combat by generating the air and space picture for the Air and Space Operations Center (AOC), Joint Force Air Component Commander (JFACC), and Joint Force Commander in combat exercises; training over 100,000 personnel per year in exercises (e.g., Ulchi Freedom Guardian, Red &amp; Blue Flags, Unified Endeavor, etc).  These programs also provide the current foundational environment that enables warfighters to interact with high-fidelity tactical cockpit simulators, which replicate high demand/low density platforms that are often unavailable for training due to real-world operations; while simultaneously linking it to warfighters using their current command and control systems 1,000 miles away and the constructive simulations being run from key operational wargaming and simulation centers worldwide. 

USAF M&amp;S is integral to inter-agency Homeland Defense (HLD) exercises chartered to train combat units tasked to protect the Homeland, including the National Capital Region (exercise Amalgam Arrow); this generates equipment and manpower efficiencies by using simulations which reduce fuel consumption, aircraft wear and tear, and manpower costs.  In support of the DoD drive to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of its enterprise-wide acquisition business processes, the USAF M&amp;S Program Element develops and supports enhancements to models, simulations, tools, and the LVC infrastructure to provide for system-of-systems M&amp;S capabilities across the lifecycle, reduce developmental costs, and minimize risks.  These capabilities support the acquisition process from concept development through test and evaluation.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning. 

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>In FY 2016, Project Number 674567, M&amp;S Foundations includes new start efforts.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Modeling and Simulation Foundations (MSF) focuses on integrating foundational capabilities needed to improve the usefulness, productivity, scalability and efficiency of Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) capabilities derived from the Warfighter Readiness (WR) thrust.  MSF are the  standards, policies, procedures, architectures, and tools that enable the rapid and efficient composition of distributed environments to support both the warfighter needs and the US Air Force's (USAF) functional communities of acquisition, training, planning, analysis, testing, education, experimentation, and requirements. The efforts supporting the MSF thrust include both concept exploration and development.  

MSF provides the capability to rapidly and efficiently create realistic and accurate synthetic operational battlespaces to support the full spectrum of activities associated with concept development to acquisition and testing through composite training and mission rehearsal.  This is done by providing appropriate authoritative data and component representations.  With the capability generated via MSF, users will readily access available repositories of reusable, validated, and integrated synthetic components.  Synthetic components include representations of operational battlespace entities (such as friendly and enemy assets) and representations of the natural environment that include the terrain, atmospheric and space weather effects given the proper data sets, and energy and signal propagation effects.  The rapid composition is based on a durable common architecture framework, policies, and common standards.  MSF capability also supports efficient, cost-effective verification, validation, and accreditation activity across all of the M&amp;S functional and organizational communities.   

The Air Constructive Environment-Information Operations Suite (ACE-IOS) provides the authoritative representation of Air Force information operations.  ACE-IOS is comprised of models that support training and mission rehearsal for the Air Force, Joint Task Force commanders, and COCOM battle staffs during Joint and Service exercises and experimentations.  

Simulation and Analysis Facility (SIMAF) focuses on fostering M&amp;S tools, data, and infrastructure to enable high confidence acquisition of capabilities to support the joint warfighter.  This includes Live-Virtual-Constructive (LVC) infrastructure, tools and processes supporting LVC events, and models, tools, data, simulations/stimulation to support requirements definition, systems engineering and test activities.  Activities include M&amp;S support for studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.  These efforts will enable more efficient delivery of effective capabilities to the warfighter while reducing the time and resources required for design, development, test and evaluation, maintainability and sustainment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Modeling and Simulation support to our Warfighter's Readiness is a United States Air Force (USAF) corporate imperative to ensure air, space, cyberspace training, and mission rehearsal activities are supported with realistic, interoperable, and readily available, tools, data, services and environments.  Warfighter readiness supports Department of Defense (DoD) Training Transformation (T2) and Joint National Training Capability (JNTC) along with the USAF priorities and core functions.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning, execution, and future program planning.  

It includes several complimentary programs, initiatives and areas for investment:  Warfighter and Joint Training Integration supports the Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF) directed Live, Virtual, and Constructive (LVC) integration efforts and is a critical piece to the USAF's implementation of the Strategic Plan for Transforming DoD Training.  The goal of LVC training and mission rehearsal is to prepare our warfighters for the full range of military operations and maintain the combat readiness levels required by the Combatant Commands (COCOMs).  This can only be accomplished by training and rehearsing in realistic operational environments.  These environments include live training ranges and virtual simulators enhanced with constructive entities.  Specific training and mission rehearsal events can include some or all of these simultaneously; making the ability to integrate LVC capabilities a necessity.  

The Air, Space, and Cyberspace Constructive Environment (ASCCE) is the USAF's authoritative federation of constructive training models and tools realistically representing the tactical and operational capabilities the USAF brings to the joint fight.  It includes the Air Force Modeling and Simulation Training Toolkit (AFMSTT), which provides the authoritative representation of AF and joint theater-level air and space power and is used to train Air and Space Operations Center (AOC) personnel and Combat Commanders (COCOM) battle staffs.  The primary model in the AFMSTT is the Air Warfare Simulation (AWSIM).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Distributed Mission Operations Center (DMOC) provides comprehensive Live, Virtual, and Constructive (LVC) simulation capabilities which prepare warfighters to conduct dominant operations in air, space, cyber, ground, and surface domains in an environment for theater-level, full spectrum combat training for Air Force/joint/coalition partners.  This reaches 31 geographically separated LVC locations across 17 time zones representing such assets as real-world weapon systems, operator-in-the-loop, and constructive or computer-driven simulations.  It is responsible for development and integration of scenarios, models, and databases and the integration of participating sites into Virtual Flag (VF) training events via numerous network connections, DMOC-developed interoperability tools, and controlled interfaces in support of Air Force, joint, and coalition warfighter readiness.  In addition, activities include Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) technology and capability studies/analyses which support both current and future program planning and execution.

The DMOC utilizes RDT&amp;E funding for the following to enhance DMO training:

1. Distributed Mission Operations Capability/Battlespace Systems Development:  The DMOC upgrades and enhances the capabilities of Environment Generators and is in partnership with the US Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) to enhance the capabilities of the Next Generation Threat System (NGTS) from version 2.4.14 to version 3.5 over the next two-three years that will provide red/blue air and other capabilities.  The DMOC Replay Tool is regularly upgraded to facilitate a more complete mission review and debrief capability of the exercises as more sites and systems are added to events.  Future planned DMO Tool development includes enhancement &amp; improvement of:  the Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) Filter; the Tactical Air Datalink Information-J (TADIL-J) Doctor-J (Dr. J) tool which allows tactical datalinks to be communicated and translated between disparate simulator communication formats; development of Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR)/Battle Damage Assessment (BDA) which improves damage state models used by intelligence analysts in exercises and develops solutions for integrating Contested Degraded Operations (geographical and communications jamming) into DMO events.

2. Certification &amp; Accreditation (C&amp;A) and Networthiness:  The DMOC supports requirements definition, integration test support, scenario development, analysis, systems engineering support, and C&amp;A and Networthiness of core systems.  It implements requirements of Cybersecurity and is working toward the application of the Risk Management Framework and Continuous Monitoring.  Efforts include test &amp; evaluation of the Distributed Training Network Guard (DTNG), a DMOC/NAVAIR partnership; accreditation work for various interoperability tools such as the DMOC Replay Tool, Dr. J, and the DIS filter tool.

3. Distributed Training Sites &amp; Systems Integration:  DMOC integrates distributed training sites and systems into LVC DMO training events such as VF and Coalition VF (four-eyes event) by resolving interoperability issues between disparate systems and networks so that all exercise participants can interact in the DMO environment. New sites and systems are incorporated into LVC DMO events each year based on higher headquarters and Combatant Commanders (CCDRs) emerging requirements.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Distributed Mission Operations Center (DMOC) supports AF/Joint/Coalition DMO and the Joint National Training Capability (JNTC) through the development and integration of DMO training and test events, networks, scenarios, and databases. Due to evolving modeling &amp; simulation technology, the DMOC is an on-going, evolutionary effort to keep pace with those changes by continuously developing/upgrading DMO environment generators, systems, and tools and ensuring integration/interoperability of new systems into DMO to provide the best warfighter training possible.

DMOC awards full and open contracts that manage the acquisition, development, testing, and integration of DMO standards, training, modeling and simulation, cross-domain information sharing testbed, and exercises on AF/Joint/Coalition DMO networks.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Funding supports the CSAF Title 10 wargaming efforts to test concepts, capabilities, and plans using simulation and other techniques ? otherwise known as wargaming. Based on the Department and Air Force direction, there is a concerted effort in these periods of fiscal pressure to reinvigorate, institutionalize, and systematize wargaming across the Department. This effort requires additional funding to increase the level of effort to most effectively pursue an innovative strategy, avoid operational and technical surprise and make best use of limited resources. The Air Force is completing its current wargaming cycles and charting a new course to better integrate and synergize the wargaming efforts in support of the new Air Force Strategy, Planning, and Programming (SP3) process. Specifically taking the current two Title 10 wargames and creating two Concept of Operations wargames, one Materiel wargame, and experiments as needed to match the SP3 process and cycles. Also represent the Air Force at other services and Joint wargames as they ramp up across the department. These efforts will make the difference between wise and unwise investment trajectories and make our forces more successful in future conflicts.

The Wargame Information Environment (WIE) is a continually evolving system that provides an array of services to game players which enables the accomplishment of game objectives. The WIE is a deployable standalone Local Area Network (LAN) with servers and laptops that host applications to support virtual battlespace collaboration, decision making, three dimensional visualizations &amp; mapping and services. Behind these applications are cutting edge technologies and database architectures from both commercial off the shelf and government developed software that assures relevance to the wargame. The modeling, simulation, and analysis applications allow participants, adjudicators, and control team members to effectively and efficiently collaborate, make decisions, present those decisions and all the wargame to executed but also documented. Allowing for findings to quickly surface during the wargame and be noted and allowing post-game analysis. These findings Inform portfolio rebalancing exercises, concept and strategy development, and very senior leader decision making. At the conclusion of the current wargaming cycle, the current version of the WIE will need major overall to match the new charter and SP3 process along with supporting greater number and more diverse wargames. 

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>In order to achieve an innovative strategy, avoid operational and technical surprise and make best use of limited resources the new vamped wargame approach will require an Evolutionary acquisition approach and continued senior-leadership engagement in setting the objectives and strategy for every wargame. Contract support will be required because that is where the wargame specialized expertise resides. The requirements are constantly evolving and cannot be accurately defined at the outset of the contract; therefore, a cost plus fixed fee (CPFF) contract will be used. There is currently an adequate accounting system and government monitoring in place. The Air Force is aware of the increased risk but Air Force will continue to monitor the performance and cost to ensure the contractor has efficient methods and effective cost controls</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Mission planning involves the creation of a flight plan based on threats, targets, terrain, weather, aircraft performance capability, and configuration.  It is an essential task that must be completed prior to any fixed or rotary wing aircraft sortie.  The planner must have the ability to plan weapons, cargo, passenger, and/or fuel delivery, calculate fuel requirements, and assess the route based on known enemy threat location and type.  Mission planners must be able to optimize and de-conflict flight routes with other aircraft; review, print, and brief the mission plan; and download pertinent flight information to on-board aircraft avionics.
 
The Mission Planning Systems (MPS) program is a collaborative program with the Army and Navy to leverage technical solutions and business practices for all Department of Defense (DoD) platforms.  It provides automated mission planning tools and support for fixed and rotary wing aircraft and guided munitions.  It replaces two closed architecture legacy mission planning systems (UNIX-based MPS (UNIX-MPS) and the PC-based Portable Flight Planning Software (PFPS)), with a single multi-service open architecture system more commonly referred to as the Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS).  MPS will compress the mission planning cycle by providing an improved integrated planning environment, reducing the time required to respond to changing situations and urgent needs such as striking time sensitive/critical targets and conducting combat search and rescue.  MPS products have the potential to support all DoD fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft and will be shared with other AF programs as well as the Army and Navy.  MPS will deliver significant benefits to command and control performance by enhancing information superiority for the warfighter and by providing unique capabilities in support of both precision engagement and dominant maneuver.
  
The Mobility Air Force Automated Flight Planning Service (MAFPS) component of MPS will provide a centralized, net-centric global mobility mission flight planning capability.  This capability will provide significant fuel savings through automated flight route optimization utilizing aircraft performance, air traffic management, weather, and other data. 

In addition to the above, elements of Mission Planning Systems will be utilized to continue development of a Joint Precision Airdrop System - Mission Planning(JPADS-MP) in conjunction with the Army.  The JPADS  capability provides a planning and execution capability for DoD airdrop requirements.  It is the primary airdrop mission planning and execution system for all ballistic airdrop mission as well as precision guided airdrops that are required when the mission profile or surface-to-air threat assessment warrants a high-altitude and/or standoff precision delivery.  JPADS-MP enables high-altitude, precise airdrop delivery to forward ground forces, mitigating surface-to-air threats, reducing risk of Improvised Explosive Device (IED) and insurgent attack on ground convoys.  JPADS allows the warfighter to consider weather, terrain, aircraft capabilities, threat, etc. to accurately deliver payloads to keep the warfighter supplied and in the fight.

FY16 funding will continue the MPS software development program.  It will develop pre and in-flight mission planning capabilities for Air Force aircraft and weapons migrating from legacy mission planning systems to the Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS) as well as continuing to update Air Force weapon systems that have already migrated to JMPS.   These weapon systems include, but are not limited to the: A-10, B-1B, C-5, C-17, C-130, HC-130, EC-130, E-3, E-8, F-15, F-16, F-22A, RC-135, HH-60, and their associated weapons (e.g. Small Diameter Bomb (SDB), Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM), Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Munitions (JASSM), etc.).  FY16 funding will also continue the development of MAFPS to realize fuel savings and other efficiencies.  Additionally, it will continue the development of JPADS-MP airdrop software (and other system components) to provide a precision airdrop capability for the C-17, C-130, and other selected platforms as necessary.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Mission planning involves the creation of a flight plan based on multiple inputs including threats, targets, terrain, weather, aircraft performance capability, and configuration. It is an essential task that must be completed prior to any fixed or rotary wing aircraft sortie. The planner must have the ability to plan weapon, cargo, passenger, and/or fuel delivery, calculate fuel requirement and assess the route based on known enemy threat location and type. Mission planners must be able to optimize and de-conflict flight routes with other aircraft; review, print and brief the plan; download pertinent flight information to on-board aircraft avionics; and, conduct dynamic/in-flight replanning as applicable.

This project continues the development of a Joint Precision Airdrop System-Mission Planner (JPADS-MP) Phase I capability in conjunction with the Army. JPADS provides a planning and execution capability for DoD airdrop requirements. It is the primary airdrop mission planning and execution system for all ballistic airdrop missions as well as precision guided airdrops that are required when the mission profile or surface-to-air threat assessment warrants a high-altitude and/ or standoff precision delivery. It enables high-altitude, precise airdrop delivery to forward ground forces, mitigating surface-to-air threats, reducing risk of Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) and insurgent attack on ground convoys. JPADS allows the warfighter to consider weather, terrain, aircraft capabilities, threat, etc., to accurately deliver payloads to combat and other friendly forces.

The Consolidated Airdrop Tool (CAT) is the key JPADS-MP software deliverable. It will increase the accuracy of airdrop mission planning by improving aircraft, payload, and chute specific calculations along with weather analysis visualization tools specifically adapted for airdrop. Future initiatives are designated to achieve automation of airdrop planning and execution to reduce task saturation in the cockpit and support AMC's objective of moving to a two man cockpit.  These efforts include, but are not limited to the ability to automatically receive and use real-time winds in any location, calculation of a release point and airdrop in a single pass,  the ability to conduct real-time objective area analysis to calculate probable damage estimates and execute dynamic re-tasking, the ability to conduct post-drop assessments, implementation of new technologies (e.g. Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) Touch Screen environment.  In addition and in support of these objectives, the AFRL-led Precision Airdrop (PAD) Flagship Capability Concept (FCC) effort will transition technology capabilities (including but not limited to Bundle Tracking, Forced Exit release point computations, data from Autonomous Weather Sensing, Humanitarian Airdrop release point computations, and improved Airdrop Performance data) to the JPADS-MP PoR and into various CAT software release/deliverables. The PAD FCC is also charged with updating airdrop platforms and airdrop related systems to improve accuracy across all airdrop mission types. Following capabilities planned for development within the JPADS-MP program, include but are not  limited to:

Development, testing and incorporation of updates to Wireless Gate Release System (WGRS), use the digital terrain data on the mission planning laptop, the Local Area Prediction System (LAPS), Airdrop Damage Estimate (ADE),  Operating System/Standard, migration to the new Mission Planning Systems (MPS) Capability (JMPS), combination airdrop, support of new map projections including polar stereographic, Touch Screen (Tablet) User Interface, Advanced Launch Acceptable Range (LAR), Advanced Guidance Failure Footprints, Drogues and Wireless Activation Device (WAD), Automation and Health Status/Monitoring, Autonomous Guidance Unit (AGU) Data Transfer updates, bundle tracking,  Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) to enable seamless data communication between devices, secondary point of impact for cargo airdrop, forced exit, humanitarian airdrop, support for ParaNavSys, Dropsonde Optimization, transference of wind along a flight path, replacement of weather assimilation engine with Kalman Filter, weather analysis and visualization, use of ensemble weather, new chute configurations and aerial guidance units, updates to ballistics data and dispersion models, implementation of new weather observation sources (i.e. Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) and RADAR sensing capabilities) for real-time weather, support for structured Wifi network, simulator and rehearsal mode for Aircraft WSTs, ingest navigation, weather and flight performance data from the aircrafts data bus, workflow enhancements to reduce task saturation, OS/SDC updates, and implementation of human effectiveness improvements.

FY16 funding continues development and testing in preparation for fielding of CAT v3.2 software to provide precision and conventional airdrop capabilities including Airdrop Damage Estimate (ADE), Combination Airdrop, Personnel Airdrop, Unified Mission Configuration Editor, Falconview Overlays and Advanced LAR and Failure Footprints for AF and other services (e.g. the Army) aircraft platforms.  FY16 also begins effort to migrate CAT to a JMPS Framework.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, which includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production, and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Mission planning involves the creation of a flight plan(s) based on threats, targets, terrain, weather, aircraft performance capability and configuration.  It is an essential task that must be completed prior to any fixed or rotary wing aircraft sortie.  The planner must have the ability to plan weapons, cargo, passenger, and/or fuel delivery, calculate fuel requirement, and assess the route based on known enemy threat location and type.  Mission planners must be able to optimize and de-conflict flight routes with other aircraft, review, print and brief the plan; and download pertinent flight information to on-board aircraft avionics.

This project focuses on modernizing MPS to support Combat Air Forces (CAF) and Mobility Air Forces (MAF), including the development, test and sustainment of Joint Mission Planning Environments (JMPEs) to support the B-1B, C-5, C-17, C-130, HC-130, EC-130, E-3, E-8, F-15, F-16, F-22A, KC-10, KC-46, KC-135, RC-135, other platforms, and all common component (CCs)software tools  currently approved as necessary for mission requirements.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.  MPS Modernization efforts are as follows:

a. CAF MPE Modernization:  These development efforts modernize CAF MPE that were previously developed and delivered under MPS Increments II and III and IV. The modernization effort will provide new and improved mission planning capability for individual Operational Flight Program (OFP) requirements, such as new weapons, avionics upgrades, communications systems, etc. The OFPs requiring MPE updates under the CAF modernization effort in Fiscal Years 2014 through 2020 include but are not limited to those for A-10, B-1B (Sustainment Blocks 15, 16, 16a, 17 and 18), F-15 (Suites 7, 8, 9, and 10), F-16 Block 30 (System Capability Upgrade [SCU] 8, 9, and 10), F-16 Block 40/50 (M6.1, M6.5, M7.1, and M7.2) and F-22 (Increments 3.2B, 3.2C, and 4.0). CAF modernization also includes updates to mission planning capabilities supporting associated weapons, including Small Diameter Bomb (SDB-II), Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM) and the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM). Finally, CAF modernization will address required improvements to CAF related JMPS MPE CCs, including Weapon Planning System (WPS), Electronic Warfare CC (EWCC), Weather CC, etc. CAF MPE Modernization includes the following platform efforts:

3) F-16 Block 40/50 Modernization Phases I&amp;II:  The F-16 Block 40/50 modernization efforts will provide the capability within the MPE to plan/utilize a number or OFP-driven capabilities in the platform. The modernization efforts will support new aircraft capabilities established in OFPs for M6.5 (joint USAF/European Participation Air Force effort, 6.5 will be fielded by EPAF, USAF will roll 6.5 capabilities in 7.1), M7.1 and M7.2.  These capabilities include, but are not limited to, integrating the universal armament interface (UAI) with the most recent version of weapons planning software to give the platform the ability to plan missions for any type of network enabled weapon (NEW).  It will also provide for UAI compliance with the small diameter bomb (SDB; GBU-39) and the laser joint direct attack munition (LJDAM; GBU-54).  The modernization effort will also provide for the use of the advanced identification friend or foe (AIFF) Mode 5 capability in the F-16 Blk 40/50.  AIFF will allow use of enhanced authentication and verification of friendly signals, through the incorporation of cryptographically secured signals.  It will also introduce Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) technology and facilitate compliance with standards for the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen).  The development effort will also migrate the F-16 Block 40/50 MPE to the Windows 7 operating environment

4) F-22 Modernization Phase I: The F-22 Modernization program includes OFP-driven software updates v13.  F-22 OFP-driven enhancements include, but are not limited to the addition of improved capabilities for the AIM-9X and AIM-120D, the incorporation of additional electronic protection tasks, combat identification improvements, addition of an Inter-flight Data Link Gateway, and incorporation of the synthetic aperture radar planning tool.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>US Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) plans, coordinates, integrates, synchronizes, and conducts activities to: direct the operations and defense of specified Department of Defense information networks and; prepare to, and when directed, conduct full-spectrum military cyberspace operations in order to enable actions in all domains, ensure US/Allied freedom of action in cyberspace and deny the same to our adversaries.

USCYBERCOM develops defensive cyber strategies and capabilities to ensure force flow during campaign operations and to expand DoD OCO capabilities.  USCYBERCOM research's, develops, and test technologies and capabilities that allow Cyber forces to conduct future offensive and defensive cyber operations in support of COCOMs, to include title 10 infrastructures and cross-cutting technologies.  USCYBERCOM will also provide the resources for other COCOMs to conduct Offensive Cyber Operations/Defensive Cyber Operations (OCO/DCO) planning. An in-house integration team (Special Projects Vulnerability Assessment Team) performs research, small scale prototyping, and integration as required to support the mission. Further detail is classified and can be provided upon request.  Additionaly, this team will re-tool existing offensive and defensive capabilities to satisfy immediate USCYBERCOM operational needs.  Finally, USCYBERCOM will delegate resources to the Army, Navy, and Air Force Cyber Service componenents to develop deconflicted offensive cyber capabilites.

Activities also include studies and analysis to support current program planning and execution.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity funds various development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The AF Offensive Cyberspace Operations program, rapidly develops operations-ready cyberspace superiority capabilities from laboratory, industry and academia via studies, rapid prototyping, technology demonstrations, and other Research, Development, Testing and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) efforts. This program consists of a portfolio of small programs and projects called the Offensive Cyber Product Line (OCPL). The OCPL establishes a flexible and balanced approach to the rapid acquisition of cyber operational capabilities. OCPL effectiveness comes from balancing funding into three capability areas required for effective operations: Platforms include Cyber Mission Platform(CMP), access and capabilities. 

OCPL provides cyber warfare capabilities to the 24th Air Force in direct support of USCYBERCOM, AF Major Commands (MAJCOMs), unified commands, and national agencies. In accordance with AF Policy, the program office develops capabilities in the cyberspace superiority core areas.  OCPL efforts also directly support the Joint Network Attack Initial Capabilities Document (ICD), the National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations (NMS-CO), the USCYBERCOM operational directives, and the latest AF Space Command (AFSPC) Offensive Cyberspace Operations System Flight Plan, and other formal requirements documents. Planned areas of study, prototyping, and technology demonstration will be used to provide warfighters access, platforms, Offensive Cyber Operations (OCO) production (e.g. test and budgets), infrastructure (e.g. mission planning, intelligence, Command and Control/Situational Awareness (C2SA)), and tools needed to attack enemy networks, telephony, Integrated Air Defense Systems (IADS), electronic warfare operations and Command and Control systems. These advancements will be used to develop and deliver cutting-edge technologies to the warfighter. This capability area leverages cyber technology investments by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the National Security Agency (NSA), Air Force Research Labs (AFRL), and DOD national laboratories, and other sources. Many program activities are protected under AF Network Warfare Special Access Programs.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

The FY2016 funding request was reduced by $1.085 million to account for the availability of prior execution balances.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This capability area also facilitates key upgrades and modifications to the Network Attack System (NAS).  The CMP effort will standardize current and future cyberspace operations capabilities by designing and delivering a common user interface and reusable, modular components.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Offensive Cyberspace Operations program office will utilize Concept, Development, Risk Management, or Production and Deployment Plans as part of a phased approach to acquisition planning. All plans will contain sufficient information for the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) to determine readiness to enter into the applicable phase of the acquisition process. Offensive Cyberspace Operations will utilize both new and existing contractual vehicles, such as Government-Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) vehicles (Alliant, Encore II, Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement IV (SEWP IV), and General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedules.  The use of multiple-award contractual vehicles will provide a wide range of commercially-available products and services that should be able to meet many requirements related to Offensive Cyberspace Operations.  These multiple-award contractual vehicles have already met the statutory requirements of the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) and require that Offensive Cyber Operations provide a fair opportunity to all contract holders, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 16.505, unless an exception to fair opportunity applies.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY16, this program element includes new start efforts for Cyberspace Vulnerability Assessment, Cyber Defense Analysis, and AFCERT activities.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Firestarter program provides newly improved capabilities and technical transition opportunities for Cyber Defense and Information Assurance (IA) technologies and tools needed to defend Air Force Command, Control, Communications, Computer, and Intelligence (C4I) systems from Cyber-attacks, while ensuring recovery in the event of an attack. The emphasis of the program is directed toward defensive cyberspace capabilities; computer and network systems security; damage assessment and recovery; cyber threat recognition, attribution, and mitigation; and active response methodologies in response to evolving threats and changes to cyber environment. These areas of emphasis are realized through research and development, test and acquisition in the areas of: proactive defense, defensive counter cyberspace, cyberspace intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance &amp; situational awareness, persistent network operations, as well as decision support, recovery, and digital forensics.  Current Air Force systems, such as the AFNET NIPRNet Gateways, SIPRNet Modernization program, and Host Based Security System leverage this technology to meet their information assurance and defensive cyberspace needs/requirements. 

Firestarter utilizes cyber and IA technology investments by US Cyber Command, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the National Security Agency (NSA), Director of National Intelligence (DNI), Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA), and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to jump-start its development of solutions to existing Air Force cyber and IA requirements. This program supports AF Space Commands Cyberspace strategic direction in support of Cyber Defense which provides capabilities to 24th AF, as AF component to Cyber Command (CYBERCOM), Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), National Security Agency (NSA), and other services to ensure Global Information Grid (GIG) cyber and IA requirements are being met. Activities performed include those designed to identify, analyze, test, rapidly acquire, and integrate emerging IA and cyber technology and defensive cyberspace weapons systems and capabilities into all regions of the GIG - terrestrial, airborne, and space systems.In addition, this effort will support implementation of DoD Enterprise-wide IA &amp; Computer Network Defense (CND) Solutions Steering Group (ESSG) solutions.

This requirement is to support the Cyberspace Vulnerability Assessment/ Hunter Team (CVA/H) weapon system development of new capabilities to provide Air Force Cyber Command (AFCYBER) and Combatant Commanders additional mobile precision in addition to currently fielded protection capabilities to identify, pursue, and mitigate cyberspace threats.  The CVA/H weapon system performs defensive sorties world-wide via remote or on-site access.  CVA/H executes vulnerability, compliance, defense and non-technical assessments, best practice reviews, penetration testing and Hunter missions on AF and DoD networks &amp; systems.  Hunter operations characterize and then eliminate threats for the purpose of mission assurance.  The Hunter mission focuses on the capability to find, fix, track, target, engage, and assess (F2T2EA) the advanced persistent threat (APT).  This effort funds development efforts to expand the capability of the current weapon system to meet scope and scale of the USCYBERCOM directed Cyber Protection Teams.

Cyberspace Defense Analysis(CDA)is an assessment of non-secure telecommunications to determine type and amount of sensitive and/or classified information that may have been disclosed to our adversaries and encompasses the following mission subsets: Telephony Communications, Radio Frequency (RF) Communications, E-mail Communications, Internet based Capabilities (IbC), Web Risk Assessment (WRA), and Cyber Operations Risk Assessment (CORA). CDA is the cyberspace weapon system that is used to conduct assessments during peace time and contingency operations.  CDA shows its true capability in the force protection realm and helps ensure our adversaries are not provided early warning of our plans, capabilities, or limitations.

AF Computer Emergency Response Team (AFCERT) supports the AF Cyberspace Defense (ACD)weapon system is designed to prevent, detect, and respond to adversarial penetration into AF unclassified and classified networks.  It also provides forensic analysis if AF unclassified and classified networks are infiltrated by our adversaries.  AFCERT funding for this effort will focus on development of capability, capacity, and potential modifications to increase the utility of the ACD weapon system to the warfighter

In FY16 this program element will include funding for Air Force Defensive Cyberspace Operations (1) Firestarter (2) Cyberspace Vulnerability Assessment (3) Cyber Defense Analysis and (4) AFCERT.
  
Activities include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.

These programs are in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Firestarter program provides newly improved capabilities and technical transition opportunities for Cyber Defense and Information Assurance (IA) technologies and tools needed to defend Air Force Command, Control, Communications, Computer, and Intelligence (C4I) systems from Cyber-attacks, while ensuring recovery in the event of an attack. The emphasis of the program is directed toward defensive cyberspace capabilities; computer and network systems security; damage assessment and recovery; cyber threat recognition, attribution, and mitigation; and active response methodologies in response to evolving threats and changes to cyber environment. These areas of emphasis are realized through research and development, test and acquisition in the areas of: proactive defense, defensive counter cyberspace, cyberspace intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance &amp; situational awareness, persistent network operations, as well as decision support, recovery, and digital forensics. Current Air Force systems, such as the AFNET NIPRNet Gateways, SIPRNet Modernization program, and Host Based Security System leverage this technology to meet their information assurance and defensive cyberspace needs/requirements.

Firestarter utilizes cyber and IA technology investments by US Cyber Command, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the National Security Agency (NSA), Director of National Intelligence (DNI), Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA), and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to jump-start its development of solutions to existing Air Force cyber and IA requirements. This program supports AF Space Commands Cyberspace strategic direction in support of Cyber Defense which provides capabilities to 24th AF, as AF component to Cyber Command (CYBERCOM), Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), National Security Agency (NSA), and other services to ensure Global Information Grid (GIG) cyber and IA requirements are being met. Activities performed include those designed to identify, analyze, test, rapidly acquire, and integrate emerging IA and cyber technology and defensive cyberspace weapons systems and capabilities into all regions of the GIG - terrestrial, airborne, and space systems. In addition, this effort will support implementation of DoD Enterprise-wide Information Assurance (IA) &amp; Computer Network Defense (CND) Solutions Steering Group (ESSG) solutions.

This requirement is to support the Cyberspace Vulnerability Assessment/ Hunter Team (CVA/H) weapon system development of new capabilities to provide Air Force Cyber Command (AFCYBER) and Combatant Commanders additional mobile precision in addition to currently fielded protection capabilities to identify, pursue, and mitigate cyberspace threats. The CVA/H weapon system performs defensive sorties world-wide via remote or on-site access. CVA/H executes vulnerability, compliance, defense and non-technical assessments, best practice reviews, penetration testing and Hunter missions on AF and DoD networks &amp; systems. Hunter operations characterize and then eliminate threats for the purpose of mission assurance. The Hunter mission focuses on the capability to find, fix, track, target, engage, and assess (F2T2EA) the advanced persistent threat (APT). This effort funds development efforts to expand the capability of the current weapon system to meet scope and scale of the USCYBERCOM directed Cyber Protection Teams.

Cyberspace Defense Analysis (CDA) is an assessment of non-secure telecommunications to determine type and amount of sensitive and/or classified information that may have been disclosed to our adversaries and encompasses the following mission subsets: Telephony Communications, Radio Frequency (RF) Communications, E-mail Communications, Internet based Capabilities (IbC), Web Risk Assessment (WRA), and Cyber Operations Risk Assessment (CORA). CDA is the cyberspace weapon system that is used to conduct assessments during peace time and contingency operations. CDA shows its true capability in the force protection realm and helps ensure our adversaries are not provided early warning of our plans, capabilities, or limitations.

AF Computer Emergency Response Team (AFCERT) supports the AF Cyberspace Defense (ACD) weapon system is designed to prevent, detect, and respond to adversarial penetration into AF unclassified and classified networks. It also provides forensic analysis if AF unclassified and classified networks are infiltrated by our adversaries. AFCERT funding for this effort will focus on development of capability, capacity, and potential modifications to increase the utility of the ACD weapon system to the warfighter.

Activities include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.

These programs are in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>In FY16, this project, Cyberspace Vulnerability Assessment, includes new start efforts for cyber threat mitigation.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This requirement supports the Cyberspace Vulnerability Assessment / Hunter Team (CVA/H) weapon system development of new capabilities to provide Air Force Cyber Command (AFCYBER) and Combatant Commanders additional mobile precision in addition to currently fielded protection capabilities to identify, pursue, and mitigate cyberspace threats.  The CVA/H weapon system performs defensive sorties world-wide via remote or on-site access.  CVA/H executes vulnerability, compliance, defense and non-technical assessments, best practice reviews, penetration testing and Hunter missions on AF and DoD networks &amp; systems.  Hunter operations characterize and then eliminate threats for the purpose of mission assurance.  The Hunter mission focuses on the capability to find, fix, track, target, engage, and assess(F2T2EA) the advanced persistent threat (APT).  This effort funds development efforts to expand the capability of the current weapon system to meet scope and scale of the USCYBERCOM directed Cyber Protection Teams.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Cyberspace Defense Analysis (CDA) is an assessment of non-secure telecommunications to determine type and amount of sensitive and/or classified information that may have been disclosed to our adversaries and encompasses the following mission subsets:  Telephony Communications, Radio Frequency (RF) Communications, E-mail Communications, Internet based Capabilities (IbC), Web Risk Assessment (WRA), and Cyber Operations Risk Assessment (CORA).   CDA is the cyberspace weapon system that is used to conduct assessments during peace time and contingency operations.  CDA shows its true capability in the force protection realm and helps ensure our adversaries are not provided early warning of our plans, capabilities, or limitations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>
