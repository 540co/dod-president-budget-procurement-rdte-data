            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a space based positioning, navigation and timing distribution system which operates through all weather. GPS supports both civil and military users in air, space, sea and land operations. GPS is a satellite-based radio navigation system that serves military and civil users worldwide. GPS users process satellite signals to determine accurate position, velocity and time. GPS must comply with 10 United States Code (USC) sec 2281 which requires that the Secretary of Defense ensures the continued sustainment and operation of GPS for military and civilian purposes and 51 USC sec 50112, which requires that GPS complies with certain standards and facilitates international cooperation.

This Program Element (PE) funds the Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) for the GPS next generation operational control system (OCX) and the GPS Enterprise Integrator (EI). This includes advanced concept development, systems analysis, modernized control segment development, mission planning development, training simulators, integrated logistics support products, test resources, systems engineering required to meet the government's obligations to the international, military and civil communities, and system requirements verification. OCX acquisition was established to 1) provide command and control of legacy and GPS III satellites, 2)  incorporate situational awareness to support Navigation Warfare (NAVWAR) and signal monitoring, 3) enable mission capability upgrades to support a  warfighter effects- based approach to operations and 4) integrate DoD information assurance and cyber security controls and capabilities. GPS Enterprise Integrator is responsible for architecture and system definition (the analysis and definition, management, maintenance, and evolution of the GPS Enterprise requirements and interface technical documents) as well as for the planning, execution, and fielding of the GPS Enterprise.

OCX funds will support efforts such as engineering studies and analyses, architectural engineering studies, trade studies, technology needs forecasting, modernization initiatives, systems engineering, system development, test and evaluation efforts and mission operations. These activities support upgrades and product improvements for military and civil applications necessary to enable efforts to protect U.S. military and Allies' use of GPS. Additionally, funds will ensure OCX efforts meet current and future Joint Requirements Oversight Council-approved required capabilities.

The GPS Enterprise consists of Space, Ground Control, Nuclear Detonation (NUDET) Detection System (NDS) and User Equipment Segments. The government is responsible for the integration of the GPS Segments such that they provide worldwide GPS capability to support the warfighter and over a billion national security, civil, Allied, and commercial GPS users.

The GPS Enterprise Integrator project includes the efforts associated with the Government's prime contract tasks necessary to accomplish this critical integrating function with the entire GPS user community. The Enterprise Integrator maintains the GPS current architecture and system definition, controls and validates interfaces, ensures compatibility of Generation II and III systems, and develops/manages plans for execution and fielding of the GPS Enterprise. Further, the Enterprise Integrator provides modeling, simulation and technical analyses of impacts for Government-directed enterprise-level trades among the GPS segments leading to definition, management, maintenance, and evolution of the GPS Enterprise requirements and interface technical documents to build and ensure the integrity of the enterprise technical baseline, and perform system requirements verification.

In addition, the GPS Enterprise Integrator project funds the technical evolution, risk reduction, enterprise-level testing and delivery of all GPS Enterprise capabilities. Examples for Generation II include electronic protection and additional civil signals; for Generation III, additional anti-jamming protection. To accomplish this, the GPS Enterprise Integrator delivers Test and Verification capabilities, Requirements and Interface Management, and Systems Integration support across the Space, Control, and User Segments. In this capacity, the Enterprise Integrator is responsible for managing this cross-program work to provide these and other capabilities.

GPS Enterprise Integrator's analyses guide government decisions to ensure efficient and effective synchronization and execution across all Generation II and III GPS programs. For Enterprise-wide integration to be successful, the Integrator: works with the GPS and NDS prime contractor teams to develop plans for early risk reduction System Integration Demonstrations to ensure system interfaces and functionality meet user and system requirements; ensures all equipment and documentation is ready when needed; integrates and analyzes enterprise schedules; and conducts formal test and verification, including Requirement Verification Plans and System Test Plans and Procedures. GPS Enterprise Integrator performs all these efforts across all GPS programs in all acquisition phases. The government owns the Enterprise system requirements and integration, and highly leverages the Enterprise Integrator team to eliminate the need to fund a development prime contractor to perform these functions. This enhances government control, oversight and program accountability.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that were fielded or received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a space based positioning, navigation and timing distribution system which operates through all weather. This project funds the research and development for the GPS next generation operational control system (OCX). This includes, but is not limited to, advanced concept development, systems engineering and analysis, modernized control segment and mission planning, development, training simulators, integrated logistics support products, and test resources.

OCX acquisition was established to 1) provide command and control of legacy and GPS III satellites, 2) incorporate situational awareness to support Navigation Warfare (NAVWAR) and signal monitoring, 3) enable mission capability upgrades to support a warfighter effects-based approach to operations, and 4) integrate DoD information assurance and cyber security controls and capabilities. OCX funds will support efforts such as engineering studies and analyses, architectural engineering studies, trade studies, technology needs forecasting, technology development, systems engineering, system development, test and evaluation efforts and mission operations in support of upgrades and product improvements for military and civil applications necessary to support efforts to protect U.S. military and Allies' use of GPS. Additionally, funds will ensure efforts to meet current and future Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) approved required capabilities.

OCX Block 0 (through Iteration 1.5) is the Launch and Control System (LCS) intended to conduct Launch and Early Orbit (LEO) operations and the on-orbit checkout of all GPS III satellites. OCX Block 0 is a subset of OCX Block 1.

OCX Block 1 (adds Iterations 1.6, 1.7 and 2.1 to Block 0) fields the operational capability to control all legacy satellites and civil signals (L1C/A), military signals (L1P(Y), L2P(Y)) as well as the GPS III satellites and the modernized civil signal (L2C) and the aviation safety-of-flight signal (L5). In addition, Block 1 will field the basic operational capability to control the modernized military signals (L1M and L2M (M-Code)), and the globally compatible signal (L1C). It also fully meets information assurance/cyber defense requirements.

OCX Block 2 (adds Iteration 2.2 to Block 1) fields the advanced operational capability to control the advanced features of the modernized military signals (L1M and L2M (M-Code)).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Air Force is pursuing a "Block" approach to the next generation GPS control segment (OCX) to respond to warfighter capability requirements.  The strategy calls for capability (e.g., better signal maintainability, Unified S-Band (USB), Search and Rescue (SAR) GPS, and near-real time C2) on-ramps for the follow-on contract for GPS III SVs (starting no earlier than SV11) which will require updates to the OCX ground segment. Enterprise studies will ensure GPS Enterprise synchronization across space and ground segments.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Global Positioning System (GPS) Enterprise Integrator (EI) integrates, synchronizes, tests and verifies the four ACAT I Defense Acquisition Programs that constitute the GPS Enterprise to deliver reliable Positioning, Navigation, and Timing signal capability to military operators, the civil user community, and international partners. The Government Program Office owns and approves the technical baseline and is responsible for the successful fielding of all the GPS Segments. To successfully execute its responsibilities, the Government relies upon the specific expertise of the GPS Enterprise Integrator to integrate segment products and verify that system requirements are met.

The GPS Enterprise Integrator project is responsible for the development and management of the Enterprise technical baseline. The technical baseline consists of more than 6400 specifications and 330 interface documents. The technical baseline reflects the requirements of multiple stakeholder groups such as the Department of Defense (DoD), foreign governments and allies, industry, the general public (through four Interface specifications), and ensures GPS capabilities meet the needs
of warfighters, civil agencies, commercial entities, international treaties, and over four billion global GPS users. The Enterprise Integrator manages the process through which the JROC requirements are matured and flowed down to the segments of the system and that interfaces are clearly defined. This enables the GPS system to meet Title 10 of the U.S. Code, Section 2281, mandated GPS capabilities as well as obligations to the international community and allied nations to provide inter-operable PNT signals. The Enterprise Integrator is also responsible for all aspects of schedule and technical alignment across the segments. The Enterprise Integrator creates and manages plans that provide for early exercise of the products under development, compatibility analysis, and intersegment testing thereby reducing risk. The intersegment tests are required to prove the interoperability of OCX, GPS III, and modernized user equipment. The Enterprise Integrator's test efforts also extend to validating that GPS can be used for civil aircraft navigation.

The Enterprise Integrator activity supports the Government Program Office's GPS spectrum protection at international forums such as the International Telecommunications Union, assisting the United States when negotiating with foreign partners. In addition, the Enterprise Integrator provides technical expertise and continuity for maintaining relationships with other U.S. government agencies to include the FAA, NGA, NASA, as well as the Departments of State, Transportation, Homeland Security, and Commerce. Spectrum expertise from the Enterprise Integrator ensures GPS priority over eight essential spectrum signals such as the safety of life signal, L5, which is required for civil air navigation. Spectrum Protection prevents encroachment from commercial or foreign entities, which preserves reliable signals to warfighters and civil users, ensuring military operations and the integrity of the global economic infrastructure. The Enterprise Integrator is the GPS enterprise expert for Information Assurance (IA), Cyber Security, System Safety, and System Security, ultimately ensuring a protected GPS Signal for both the military and civil users from emerging cyber threats. The Enterprise Integrator is accountable for the development, execution, and analysis of OCX cyber security and IA test cases, which are necessary to deliver a secure, operational system, protected against adversarial cyber-attacks intended to deny, disrupt, or degrade GPS operations.

The Enterprise Integrator supports the Government development and implementation of various Systems engineering documents, defines the methods of verification,conducts the analyses or tests, and assists the government in leading Integrated System Tests. The Enterprise Integrator validates the system performance in various mission threat scenarios during its development. The Enterprise Integrator provides deep, technical, highly specific expertise. The GPS EI functions enhance government control, oversight and program accountability.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>In accordance with a "back to basics" acquisition approach and exercise of strong oversight of development contractors, the Air Force is required to exercise complete ownership of the architecture, system definition, and integration of the GPS space, ground, and user segments. This complex inter-segment integration is traditionally performed by a prime contractor under a systems development contract. To eliminate the need to fund a development prime contractor to perform these functions,
the government leverages systems engineering and integration expertise from both Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) contractors and a Systems Engineering &amp; Integration (SE&amp;I) contractor. GPS Enterprise Integrator function of the SE&amp;I contractor is currently funded within this Program Element (PE). The SE&amp;I effort was originally procured in 2007 through a full and open competition, as was the new follow-on SE&amp;I contract awarded in 2015. The SE&amp;I follow-on strategy builds in year over year cost reductions as requirements stabilize.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Please refer to the Performance Base Budget Overview Book for information on how Air Force resources are applied and how those resources are contributing to Air Force performance goals and most importantly, how they contribute to our mission.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Supports Air Education and Training Command's (AETC) implementation of Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training (SUPT) and the Department of Defense initiative for joint pilot training.

Undergraduate Remotely Piloted Aircraft Training supports Air Education and Training Command's (AETC) implementation of Undergraduate Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) Training (URT).  This program provides and maintains the currency of Predator Reaper Integrated Mission Environment (PRIME) Desktop Training System (DTS).

The Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) is a joint USAF/USN venture to replace the Services' fleets of primary trainer aircraft (T-37 and T-34 respectively) and their associated Ground Based Training Systems (GBTS) with the T-6 and its GBTS.  The Air Force is the Executive Service.
 
T-6 Operational System Development continues follow on development activities to JPATS including studies &amp; development efforts to support future ACAT III Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) to the T-6 Aircraft, instructional courseware, and logistics support to include Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS) and development activities related to DMSMS. Included is development for the FAA mandated ACAT III program for ADS-B Out and associated upgrades. 
  
T-38 program will continue development in FY2017 of a replacement Mission Display Processor (MDP), refurbishment of the existing Heads-Up Display (HUD), development and integration of an Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B) solution as well as replacement of the Very High Frequency (VHF) Communication radio system and the VHF Navigation system. System testing is projected to begin in FY2017 and production and deployment of the replacement the systems will begin in late FY2017 and continue through FY2021. 

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This effort supports Air Education and Training Command's (AETC) implementation of Undergraduate Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) Training (URT).  URT produces RPA pilots and Sensor Operators from accession sources to man RPA squadrons.   Success of the program is heavily dependent on Predator Reaper Integrated Mission Environment (PRIME) Desktop Training System (DTS) to prepare undergraduate students for entry in RPA Formal Training Units (FTU).  PRIME has completed 6 Phases of development and is now at baseline functionality.  PRIME evolved from a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) A-10 Warthog desktop trainer into a desktop similar to the Reaper training system now in use to train undergraduate RPA pilots and sensor operators.  PRIME currently emulates the MQ-9 Reaper and needs to keep pace with that baseline system and expand to other RPAs in order to maintain concurrency and relevancy.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) is a joint USAF/USN venture to replace the Services' fleets of primary trainer aircraft (T-37 and T-34, respectively) and associated Ground Based Training Systems (GBTS).  Additionally the US Army purchased four T-6 Army Variant aircraft to replace the T-34 aircraft for the Army Test and Evaluation Command.  The USAF/USN T-6 aircraft and GBTS are used to train entry-level student aviators in the fundamentals of flying so they can transition into advanced training tracks leading to qualification as military pilots, combat systems officers, and naval flight officers.  The program includes the purchase of aircraft, simulators, and other associated ground-based training devices, Training Integration Management System (TIMS), instructional courseware, and logistics support to include Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS) and development activities related to DMSMS.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>JPATS was competitively awarded with the intent of maximizing the use of commercially available equipment and best commercial practices.  Initially, the JPATS Program competitively awarded two contracts:  a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) Operations and Maintenance funded contract and a Fixed Price Incentive Firm Target (FPIF) manufacturing development (MD)/production contract with seven options.  The follow-on contract production for both the air vehicle and GBTS was awarded as a FAR Part 15 action. The FFP CLS Operations and Maintenance funded contract is a FAR Part 15 action.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The T-38 is a twin engine, two seat (tandem), supersonic jet trainer used by Air Education and Training Command as an advanced trainer in Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training.  Modifications are budgeted to enhance operational capability while improving flight safety, reliability  and maintainability.  There are currently 505 T-38s in the Air Force inventory (53 T-38A, 6 AT-38B and 446 T-38C) with 4 T-38Cs pending removal.  T-38s first entered service in 1962 and average over 48 years old.

T-38C avionics system obsolescence remediation efforts to qualify updated systems  the T-38C will continue from FY2016 through 2018 with development of a replacement Mission Display Processor (MDP), refurbishment of the existing Heads-Up Display, development and integration of an Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B) solution as well as replacement of the VHF Communication radio system and the VHF Navigation radio system. The development and integration of an ADS-B solution will also include A/B aircraft.
 
Additionally, studies &amp; development efforts to support future ACAT III Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) to address obsolescence issues and the regular block upgrades are required to keep the system current these will be accomplished with O&amp;M unless block upgrade provides additional capabilities. Block upgrades incorporate software and/or hardware improvements to comply with new capabilities mandated by Department of Defense, Federal Aviation Administration or National Airspace System (DoD/FAA/NAS) and to address flight safety issues.  The block upgrades support the T-38C aircraft and Aircrew Training Devices (ATD).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The T-38 Operations System Development acquisition strategy for satisfying emerging software and hardware requirements is designed to enable competition and cost control. Developmental requirements resulting from Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages research and reporting will be evaluated and implemented incrementally to efficiently deliver required capabilities to AETC in support of the pilot training program.  System Block upgrades will be required to maintain aircraft airworthiness and will be implemented based on AETC requirements.  An appropriate level of technical data rights is required by all current support contracts. 

The AvCI contract is a Type D IDIQ contract competitively awarded to address T-38C avionics system obsolescence issues and provide CLS follow-on support. The AvCI contract was awarded 4 January 2016.  Obsolescence remediation efforts will begin immediately and the follow-on CLS effort will begin 01 April 2017.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The WAS strategy is a single step acquisition approach for full capability to develop, produce, and field highly capable and sustainable, advanced sensors in the National Capitol Region. A Science &amp; Technology contract was let during the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase for both sub-systems. The EMD contract for STARS was awarded to a single developer to complete the design, build, integration, and test of the STARS system.  A follow on sole source contract will be awarded to the STARS contractor long lead components and a full competition contract will be awarded for integration of the STARS sub-sub-system as part of Full Rate Production (FRP) following the FRP Decision Review.  The EMD contract for Scorpion was awarded to a single developer to complete the design, build, integration, and test of the Scorpion system and conduct Interim Contractor Support (ICS).  A full competition contract will be awarded for the Scorpion sub-system as part of Full Rate Production (FRP) following the FRP Decision Review.

Air Force Program Executive Officer (PEO) for Battle Management (AFPEO BM) is the PEO for WAS. Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) is the Contracting Authority for the WAS program and provides contracts, legal, and comptroller support. The Office of the Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition (SAF/AQ) is the program’s Milestone Decision Authority (MDA).

The STARS primary contract type for EMD is a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contract while the Scorpion primary contract type for EMD is also a CPFF and includes ICS. Upon MDA approval at MS C, the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO) will utilize for FRP a primary contract type of Firm Fixed Price (FFP) for both the STARS integration and another FFP for the Scorpion subsystem due to stable requirements and low risk of changes in scope.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The WAS strategy is a single step acquisition approach for full capability to develop, produce, and field highly capable and sustainable, advanced sensors in the National Capitol Region.  A Science &amp; Technology contract was let during the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase for both sub-systems. The EMD contract for Stateside Affordable Radar System (STARS) was awarded to a single developer to complete the design, build, integration, and test of the STARS system.  A follow on sole source contract will be awarded to the STARS contractor long lead components.  The EMD contract for Scorpion was awarded to a single developer to complete the design, build, integration, and test of the Scorpion system and conduct Interim Contractor Support (ICS).  

The STARS primary contract type for EMD is a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contract while the Scorpion primary contract type for EMD is also a CPFF and includes ICS.  Upon MDA approval at MS C, the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO) will utilize a Firm Fixed Price (FFP)contract for both the STARS integration and another FFP for the Scorpion subsystem due to stable requirements and low risk of changes in scope.

Air Force Program Executive Officer (PEO) for Battle Management (AFPEO BM) is the PEO for WAS.  Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) is the Contracting Authority for the WAS program and provides contracts, legal, and comptroller support.  The Office of the Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition (SAF/AQ) is the program’s Milestone Decision Authority (MDA).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>In FY15, Project 641200 JDAM Development and Prototyping (BA 4), was transferred to Project 674138, JDAM Development (BA 7), within the same PE 0604618F to properly align budget activity (BA).</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The 5000lb demonstration is an integration of BLU-113 warhead with a Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) tail kit to provide accurate, precision, reliable, hard target penetration capability.  The required accuracy shall be "JDAM-like" as defined by the operational requirements community.  The greater overall system performance will tighten dispersion capability where multiple weapons are released from the same aircraft on the same pass and hit the same impact crater.  The BLU-113 is an objective requirement of the 2002 JDAM Operational Requirements Document (ORD).  The weapon system will have an identical Concept of Operations (CONOPS) to that of existing USAF inventory for Global Positioning System-aided Inertial Navigation System (GPS-aided INS) weapons as well as compatibility with aircraft Operational Flight Programs (OFPs).  

BA-7 - This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Air Force Integrated Personnel and Pay System (AFIPPS) will be a web-enabled, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solution that will integrate existing personnel and pay processes into one self-service system. The Department of the Air Force (DAF) plans to accomplish this goal by modernizing existing technology, resulting in a secure and authoritative data environment that improves accuracy, strengthens decision making and reduces processing time and costs.  AFIPPS supports effective military personnel management and development throughout the lifecycle of all military members, by providing an accurate and single authoritative source of personnel data.  AFIPPS will enable accurate and timely delivery of pay, entitlements, allowances and benefits and make appropriate information available for all levels of management.   Active, National Guard, and Reserve components will integrate personnel and pay functionality; streamline and improve automated support to the mobilization and deployment processes; and implement standard data that reflects the core requirements of the Combatant Commands, the Department of the Air Force, the Office of the Secretary of Defense and other federal agencies.

AFIPPS's customers include approximately 510,000 AF service members across all components (RegAF, ANG, and AFRes) as well as thousands of military leaders of different ranks, specialties, and career fields who are responsible for the conduct of AF operations that rely on these services to ensure service members with the appropriate skill sets are deployed where needed at home and on the battlefield.  Congress, the rest of the Department of Defense (DoD), and other federal agencies all rely on accurate AF Human Resources (HR) data to make key decisions that affect how the US military is organized, funded, deployed, and maintained.

The FY 2017 funding request was reduced by $10.0 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances. 

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>AFIPPS acquisition strategy focuses on expanding the fielded AF personnel system (MilPDS) by integrating a pay capability.  MilPDS is implemented using the commercial Oracle ERP E-Business Suite (EBS).  The AFIPPS strategy will be to configure/develop the pay portion of EBS, ensure the system is fully integrated, and deployed.  The Government will award a contract for the pay system development, test, and deployment.  The development activities will be fully coordinated and integrated with the on-going operation and sustainment of MilPDS.

Air Force Program Executive Officer (PEO) for Business and Enterprise Systems (AFPEO BES) is the PEO for AFIPPS.  Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) is the Contracting Authority for the AFIPPS Program and provides Contracts, Legal, and Comptroller support. The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics [OUSD(AT&amp;L)] is the program's Milestone Decision Authority (MDA).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Anti-Tamper  (AT) Technology Executive Agency budget funds activities related to two AT responsibilities required by DoDD 5200.47E Anti-Tamper. These responsibilities include areas unique to the DoD Executive Agent for Anti-Tamper (ATEA) and Air Force Component AT Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR). The ATEA is responsible for developing and implementing AT policy, coordinating and providing financial support for AT technology development and evaluations, hardware/software vulnerability assessments, laboratory infrastructure, establishing and maintaining a data bank/library of AT technologies, providing security mechanisms, providing outreach and education to the DoD AT community, and funding validation and evaluations of AT implementations across all DoD acquisition programs. The AF AT OPR, that is also funded by this PE and is responsible for the oversight and security of AT on all AF acquisition programs under the Program Protection Planning process and  manages AF AT technology development. 

The DoD ATEA coordinates technology development among the DoD Services/Agencies, National Laboratories, and Industry.

AT protects critical program information (CPI) in U.S. weapon systems that may be sold to foreign governments or that could possibly fall into enemy hands on the battlefield. AT protections permit the U.S. to preserve its technological advantage and the combat capabilities of critical weapons systems while supporting the warfighters’ mission requirements. Furthermore, AT adds longevity to DoD weapon systems and critical technologies by deterring efforts to reverse engineer or develop weapon countermeasures against the system or system component. 

All DoD acquisition programs, Foreign Military Sales, and Direct Commercial Sales with resident critical program information (RCPI) require a validated AT Plan. The AT program includes resources required for subject matter experts (SMEs) to review AT Plans and conduct AT validation on all DoD Weapon Systems, and perform AT assessments of both commercial off the shelf and government off the shelf products. As technology advances, AT continues to perform AT hardware/software assessment capabilities. These capabilities include the acquisition of specialized equipment, maintenance and/or renovations to support the integration of this equipment, and modifications to new and/or existing laboratory facilities to meet equipment and security requirements.

The DoD ATEA technology development strategy is to coordinate DoD AT technology development across the Services which fund development of new AT technology, as well as enhance existing AT technology efforts to increase the technology readiness level (TRL) and facilitate transition for programs to implement. The AT technology development and enhancement efforts include: advanced AT sensor hardware, secure processing, crypto-analysis, tamper penalties, and other AT enablers. 

The Air Force AT OPR conducts Anti-Tamper technology development to meet Air Force service needs to mature promising AT technologies to transition to Air Force weapons systems. Technology development priorities are given to those technologies that most benefit AF acquisition programs.  These activities are coordinated through the ATEA as a part of the ATEA technology development roadmap and to coordinate with Navy and Army AT technology development efforts.
This program is in Budget Activity 07, Operational System Development, because it includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The ATEA will coordinate the Technology Roadmap with major Prime vendors. Evaluating their AT CRADA projects is of major importance. The ATEA will also coordinate with the Service AT personnel to foster communication and understand what programs, Services are developing for their AT implementation. Emerging research areas such as materials, cryptography and electronic circuits have the potential to bring new AT capabilities with reduced power needs and smaller form factor. The goal of the research is to mature promising technologies to the point they can be transitioned to a program office or    industry for implementation in our weapon systems. Priorities will be given to those technologies that most benefit the DoD AT community.

The Air Force AT Office in 2017, will fund and manage new technology efforts to protect Air Force critical program information.  These new  AT technology requirements will be obtained from AF programs and these new AT technologies will then transition to Air Force programs.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>HC/MC-130 Recapitalization will replace and augment the aging USAF fleets of combat rescue HC-130P/N and special operations MC-130E/P/H aircraft which are experiencing airworthiness, maintainability and operational limitations.  

This program will develop and integrate changes from discrepancies found during development and operational flight test, and common C-130J block upgrades during HC/MC production.  The HC/MC Block 8.1 program follows the same "Block Upgrade" strategy being used in the C-130J program (PE 0401132F).

The internationally developed Block 8.1 program addresses mandated Communication, Navigation, and Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) requirements.  It also incorporates capabilities such as Link 16, a new Flight Management System (FMS), Civil GPS Navigation, Identification Friend or FOE (IFF) transponder Mode-5, Civil Data-link,  and Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast Out (ADS-B Out).

The HC/MC Block 8.1 RDT&amp;E effort integrates Block 8.1 into a HC-130J and a MC-130J via a trial kit install effort followed by a Development and Operational Test effort.  

The USAF is considering fielding the IFF Mode 5 and ADS-B Out portions of Block 8.1 ahead of the remaining 36 capabilities in order to comply with the 2020 mandates.

Block 8.1 Production line cut-in is planned with the FY 2019 aircraft buys.  A fleet modification program will also begin in FY 2019.

The FY 2017 funding request was reduced by $9.939 million to account for availability of prior execution balances.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The B-52 Combat Network Communications Technology (CONECT) Capability Development Document (CDD), dated 18 March 2004, captures the requirements for a Tactical Data Link (TDL) capability on the B-52. The B-52 TDL, provides low latency, jam-resistant situation awareness and command and control communications needed to support in-theater operations and missions.  This project will consist of integrating an existing off-the-shelf Link 16 terminal into the B-52. Integration includes Group A wiring, rack and antenna, and the Group B terminal Line Replaceable Unit (LRU). The TDL terminal will be fully integrated with CONECT.  This Line-Of-Sight (LOS) Link 16 capability allows the warfighter to utilize this capability by maintaining situational awareness, avoiding threats and employing an array of weapons.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>MIL-STD-1760 Internal Weapons Bay Upgrade (IWBU) requires the integration of the 1760 weapons capability into the bomb bay on 78 B-52H aircraft. It includes two Ground Instructional Training Aircraft (GITA),utilizing 44 Common Strategic Rotary Launchers (CSRLs) converted into Conventional Rotary Launchers (CRLs), where three of the CRLs will be modified under Engineering Manufacturing and Development (EMD) for test purposes. The 1760 IWBU project is segmented into increments.  Increment 1.0 provides internal and external carriage and consists of two sub increments 1.1 and 1.2. This requirement's Capability Development Document (CDD) was validated by the Air Force Requirements Oversight Council (AFROC) in June 2013.  The 1760 Capability Production Document was validated by the AFROC in February 2015.

Increment 1.1 

Increment 1.1 develops the capability for internal carriage of eight Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM) and variants, to include Laser JDAM (L/JDAM), on a rotary launcher. This increment also develops the capability for external carriage for 16 L/JDAM. The CRL Hardware modification consists of Group A (equipment racks and electrical wiring) and Group B (one Survivability/Vulnerability (SV) junction box and one Integrated Weapons Interface Unit (IWIU) per CRL). The IWIU Line Replaceable Unit (LRU) was previously developed under the Advanced Weapons Integration (AWI) project. No CSRL replacements will be required as a result of this project.  Increment 1.1 completed Preliminary Design Review in February 2013 and awarded an EMD contract in September 2013.  Critical Design Review (CDR) was conducted in October 2013.  An Integrated Baseline Review (IBR) was conducted in February 2014, validating cost and schedule baselines.  Milestone C was conducted in April 2015.  Development/Operational Flight Test was completed November 2015 and a Full Rate Production Decision was held November 2015.     

Aircraft Hardware Development:  None

Software Development: Consists of modifying aircraft Operational Flight Program (OFP) software, JDAM Stores Management Overlays (SMO) and ground based Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS).

CRL Hardware Development: Consists of modifying USSTRATCOM provided CSRLs by replacing nuclear mission equipment with Group B hardware and wiring interfaces. Group A includes equipment racks and electrical wiring; Group B includes one Survivability/Vulnerability (SV) junction box and one IWIU per CRL. The IWIU LRU was previously developed under the AWI project and work was previously accomplished during a 2005 demonstration and developed using 2006 and 2007 Congressional Add funding.  Three CSRLs modified using RDT&amp;E funds.

Support Equipment:  Consists of developing software and 38 rotary launcher cable adapter sets on existing Multi-Use System Tester Armament Next Generation (MUSTANG) testers to interface with the CRL. 

Increment 1.2 

Increment 1.2 develops the capability for internal carriage of eight Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles (JASSM) and its variants, to include JASSM Extended Range (JASSM-ER), and eight Miniature Air Launched Decoys (MALD) and its variants, to include MALD Jammer (MALD-J).  This increment also develops the capability for external carriage for 12 JASSM-ER.

Upon completion of JASSM/ER software development, an interim capability providing for carriage and deployment of no less than 16 JASSM/ER (4 bay, 12 external) is planned.  A limited DT/OT will validate this capability in advance of hardware design completion and validation.   

Aircraft Hardware Development:  Development of Group A wiring and circuit breakers to supply additional power to the CRL per JASSM-ER requirements, for all 76 operational B-52H aircraft, and two Ground Instructional Training Aircraft. 

Software Development: Development of a modification to existing aircraft SMO and weapon (JASSM and MALD) OFP software to allow for internal and external carriage and modification to ground based JMPS.

CRL Hardware Development: Develops Group A associated interface hardware and two Group B LRUs (power supply and power distribution box).  Three CRLs will be modified using RDT&amp;E funds.

Support Equipment:  Consists of developing software updates to the existing MUSTANG to interface with the CRL and the development of additional ground handling support equipment.

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The 1760 Internal Weapons Bay Upgrade project will acquire software development and hardware design via a sole-source contract to Boeing Defense, Space &amp; Security (DSS), Oklahoma City, OK. Deliverables include an updated J-series weapon SMOs (software), three prototype modified CSRLs, six Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) assets, logistics support, ground and flight test support, and engineering drawings.  The Increment 1.1 program procured the CRL modification kits via sole source to Boeing DSS, OKC for LRIP and Full Rate Production (FRP) and LRIP Installations, and FRP Installs of the kits will be completed via Contract Field Teams (CFTs).  The Increment 1.2 program plans to competitively procure the CRL modification kits for full rate production, and installs of the kits are planned to be completed via CFT.

Increment 1.1 consists of internal carriage of eight JDAM and variants, to include LJDAM, on a rotary launcher. This increment also develops the capability for external carriage for 16 LJDAM. The CRL Hardware modification consists of Group A (equipment racks and electrical wiring) and Group B (one SV junction box and one IWIU per CRL). 

Increment 1.2 develops the capability for internal carriage of eight JASSM and its variants, to include JASSM-ER, or eight MALD and its variants, to include MALD-J.  This increment also develops the capability for external carriage for 12 JASSM-ER.  Upon completion of JASSM/ER OFP and SMO software coding, an interim capability of no less than 16 JASSM/ER carriage will be vaildated thru DT/OT in FY17.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The B-52 Combat Network Communications Technology (CONECT) acquisition project supports nuclear and conventional operations by upgrading the B-52 fleet with tactical datalink and voice communications capabilities, along with improved threat and situational awareness to support participation in network centric operations. The CONECT upgrade includes new Multi-Functional Color Displays (MFCDs); a digital interphone system, on-board client/server architecture supporting distributed processing with independent control functions;  Ultra High Frequency (UHF) Beyond Line-Of-Sight (BLOS) Joint Range Extension (JRE) capability Intelligence Broadcast Receiver (IBR); limited Internet Protocol (IP)-based UHF BLOS link supporting voice, e-mail and file transfers; and Improved Data Modem (IDM)-based digital Variable Message Format (VMF) datalink. As the CONECT upgrade brings additional capability to the B-52, emerging communication and security requirements (upgrades to IBR, JRE messages, crypto modernization, etc.) and aircraft upgrades (1760 Internal Weapons Bay Upgrade, Mode S/Mode 5 Identification, Friend or Foe (IFF),etc.) may require study for potential impacts to CONECT.
In order to maintain currency with the latest aircraft configuration, the CONECT project will update existing trainers, using stimulate/simulate/computer-based training or a mix, to add CONECT functionality to meet user-training requirements, and update/maintain the system integration laboratory (SIL) for the Weapon System Trainers (WST).  In order to assist PDM during after-install checkout and Barksdale and Minot units with maintenance checkout and operational training, a CONECT ground station is being developed. 
This project is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Global Positioning System (GPS) Interface Unit (IU) Upgrade will replace three Circuit Card Assemblies (CCA) in the GPS IU, as well as the backplane (to integrate the new and old CCAs):  the Central Processing Unit/1553, the power supply CCA, and the video graphics card.  The current inventory of GPS IUs (76 installed on B-52H, plus current supply level of 16), plus 1 in the System Integration Laboratory (SIL), and 2 on Ground Instructional Training Aircraft (GITA)) will be upgraded by Prime Contractor Boeing.  The upgraded LRUs will be replaced using blue-suit installation, using remove-and-replace processes on the flight line (the current maintenance process).

The GPS IU integrates GPS Position, Navigation and Timing (PNT) data into navigation, communications, and weapons systems onboard the B-52.  The GPS IU acts as a controller for a MIL-STD-1553 data bus communications path.  The major areas of support include GPS interface control and monitoring, targeting pod functions, navigation displays for the Pilot and Copilot stations, and Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) control functions.

Originally developed with a 33MHz processor with 4MB of Static Random Access Memory (SRAM), the GPS IU has become overloaded as more software has been added to the B-52.  Currently operating at 86% throughput capacity and at 90% memory capacity, it is projected to exceed the designated safety threshold of 95% memory load by 2018.  The GPS IU is also facing parts obsolescence issues.  Studies show that the current spares will be exhausted by 2018.  The upgrade will improve system reliability and address Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS) issues on subcomponents of the IU.  The modified GPS IU will retain the existing functions and interfaces of the legacy GPS IU, and provide additional interfaces to allow for future growth requirements.

GPS IU requires upgrading to incorporate any other GPS dependent capabilities on the B-52 platform.  B-52 fleet will have the capability to carry additional GPS dependent weapons and targeting pods, and the increased capacity to incorporate future GPS-dependent capabilities beyond 2018.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>This program, BA 07 PE 0101113F, project 675056, Radar Modernization Program, is a new start.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The B-52 Radar Modernization Program (RMP) supports nuclear and conventional operations by upgrading or replacing, in whole or in part, the current APQ-166 radar Line Replaceable Units on the B-52H aircraft.  The APQ-166 system will be increasingly difficult to sustain due to diminished manufacturing sources and obsolescent technologies; the current failure rate of the APQ-166 places long-duration missions at risk.  This modernization program will encompass the radar antenna array and up to 14 individual LRUs that comprise the entire radar system.  Development,  production and installation of new components and systems to replace the legacy equipment; to be installed on all 76 B-52H aircraft.  RMP will take advantage of advances in technology and on-going development efforts to acquire, to the maximum extent possible, off-the-shelf components and integrate them into the B-52.  The use of new technology will increase both the overall reliability of the radar system and the capabilities for new missions.  This Radar Modernization Program will allow the operational command (AF Global Strike Command) to fully utilize the capabilities of the B-52H aircraft to employ an array of weapons and to perform mission-essential navigation and weather avoidance functions.			

In addition, all the applicable training devices which process radar data or represent the radar subsystem must also be modified and upgraded in conjunction with the aircraft modifications.  This upgrade will affect all three Weapon System Trainers (WST), the WST Training Systems Integration Laboratory (SIL), both B-52 Offensive Station Maintenance Trainers (OSMT), and the Bombing-Navigation System Maintenance Trainers (BNSMT).  Based on input from AFGSC, the program will retire the five existing BNMSTs and replace them with three new virtual training devices.


This project is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The principal mission of the B-52 Training Systems program is to ensure high fidelity simulators and training systems are available for aircrew members to support credible training, maintain proficiencies, and increase skill levels. B-52 Aircrew Training Devices simulates the necessary visual, motion, and audible cues to provide ground training of Air Force Global Strike Command aircrew members. The B-52 Weapon System Trainer (WST) Air Refueling Upgrade is a comprehensive project that will allow B-52 Aircrew to accomplish credible air refueling training in the simulator, which minimizes the requirement for on-aircraft air refueling training. To facilitate this capability, scope of work may involve development of Analysis of Alternatives(AoA),Studies and Analysis, Capability Development Documents (CDD) or any other Analysis or paperwork necessary to establish a program of record.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The AGM-86B, Air Launched Cruise Missile (ALCM), is a subsonic, air-to-surface strategic nuclear missile, operational since 1982.  Armed with a W-80 warhead, it is designed to evade air and ground-based defenses in order to strike targets at any location within any enemy’s territory.  The ALCM is designed for B-52H internal and external carriage. 

The Aging and Surveillance (A&amp;S) program continuously assesses critical components and subsystems.  The program identifies aging trends prior to failures in fielded components that would result in fleet-wide reliability and supportability problems. In 2016, A&amp;S will be accomplished via 3400 Central Asset Management (CAM).

The ALCM Test Plan Development and Evaluation program develops test procedures for testing nuclear systems, and implements those procedures as directed by the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff. As A&amp;S shifts to CAM, the program will increase emphasis on the program's two phases of Test Plan Development, Evaluation and implementation.  Phase 1 focuses on Electromagnetic (EM) development and testing for High Altitude Electromagnetic Pulse (HEMP), Hazards of Electromagnetic Radiation to Ordnance (HERO), and High Power Microwave (HPM) testing. Phase 2 focuses on the development of radiation testing and radiation testing.

RDT&amp;E funds are used to develop new test and evaluation procedures, software, and equipment, to ensure ALCM sustainability supports Air Force strategic nuclear deterrence and Global Strike mission requirements through 2030. 

BA7- This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>This program, BA 07 PE 0101126F, project 675344, B-1B Global Positioning System (GPS) Military-Code (M-Code), is a new start.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The B-1B Lancer is a swing-wing, supersonic, long-range, conventional bomber.  It carries the largest payload of both guided and unguided weapons in the United States Air Force inventory.  The multi-mission B-1B is the backbone of America's long-range conventional bomber force and can rapidly deliver massive quantities of precision and non-precision weapons against any adversary, anywhere in the world, at any time. The current service life extends beyond 2040.

The B-1B modernization projects alleviate aircraft obsolescence issues due to Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) while at the same time providing improved capabilities to the B-1B weapon system that require significant hardware and software development and testing. 

GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM (GPS) MILITARY-CODE (M-CODE)
This project will integrate a  military GPS receiver delivering improved capabilities to allow for accurate and reliable positioning, navigation, and timing for B-1 primary flight instrumentation, navigation, radar, weapon, and communication systems where current receiver performance might be compromised or unavailable.  M-Code has a higher-power signal offering better resistance to jamming and interference; advanced security features to prevent unauthorized access or exploitation by adversaries; and improved message formats and signal modulation techniques for faster and more accurate performance.

INTEGRATED BATTLE STATION (IBS) SIMULATOR DEVELOPMENT
B-1B training systems upgrades (both flight and maintenance simulators/trainers) provide required training assets for  the aircraft Central Integrated Test System (CITS), Fully Integrated Data Link (FIDL), and Vertical Situational Display Upgrade (VSDU) modernization projects.  These upgrades are required to bring the simulators up to the same configuration of the modernized aircraft.  The B-1B training system provides the warfighter with a fully integrated, cost effective, high fidelity training capability in flight operations, weapons employment, and maintenance of the B-1B weapon system.

FLIGHT TEST AIRCRAFT UPGRADES
Upgrades to the B-1B flight test aircraft are included in the modernization projects to keep the test flight systems current.  RDT&amp;E funded test jets are currently configured with Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Line Replaceable Units (LRUs) for CITS, FIDL and VSDU.  Replacement of the EMD LRUs is required to bring two flight test aircraft to fleet representative configuration.  Maintenance and logistic support from the manufacturer is required until the Air Force supply chain is established.  Replacement of the LRUs will ensure maximum supportability, maintainability, and reliability for continued and future flight tests.  

GAP &amp; INTEGRATION ANALYSIS
Additionally, program funds cover engineering/planning studies, related engineering efforts, and auxiliary equipment needed for development projects that have not yet fielded.  Cost includes Program Management Administrative (PMA) costs and initiatives for anticipated weapon system enhancements, including efforts to improve weapon system operational capabilities, safety, supportability, maintainability, reliability, and total ownership cost.  All B-1B development projects support planned requirements for unique identification in their production phases. 

The FY2017 funding request was reduced by -$.451 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances
	
This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The B-2 Spirit is the world's most advanced long-range strike asset. The unique combination of range, precision, payload, and ability to penetrate and operate in anti-access/area denial environments allow the B-2 to identify, locate, target, and destroy the highest value enemy targets. The B-2 can, with necessary upgrades, accomplish its mission regardless of location, return to base safely, and permit freedom of movement for follow-on forces, including other long range strike platforms. An array of planned RDT&amp;E projects are necessary to preserve a strategic advantage against 21st century threats as well as increase flexibility, lethality, and survivability of this national asset tasked across a broad spectrum of tactical and national strategic objectives. B-2 will achieve these objectives by adapting mature technologies/ systems in the fleet to rapidly deliver relevant combat capability, leveraging other Department of Defense investments and programs, utilizing innovative acquisition strategies.

The B-2 has a projected service life through 2058. To ensure the fleet can accomplish its nuclear and conventional mission in highly defended and anti-access environments, periodic modernization efforts must be undertaken to upgrade combat capability as well as improve the viability, supportability, and survivability of the weapon system.

Recent and ongoing investments in avionics, structures, communications, and weapons keep the B-2 viable in the immediate future. Current system upgrades include Low Observable Signature and Supportability Modifications, Defensive Management System Modernization, Flexible Strike Phase 1, alternative communication solutions such as Common Very Low Frequency Receiver and B-2 AEHF (Strategic Communications), Extended Range Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile weapon integration and Global Positioning System  enhancements. The B-2 is also exploring opportunities for architecture updates to reduce future integration costs and improve program affordability. The Defensive Management System effort is documented in the exhibit for PE 0605931F. 

In addition to the B-2 improvements described above, the Air Force has continuing efforts for Training Systems, Mission Planning System improvements, flight test aircraft upgrades and base of operations support, integration and testing of upgraded cryptographic components, as well as B-2 platform studies and acquisition planning.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development. This budget activity includes developmental efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

This program, BA 07 PE 0101127F, project 675345, B-2 Cryptographic Modernization, is a new start.
This program, BA 07 PE 0101127F, project 675345, B-2 Adaptable Communications Suite (ACS), is a new start.

In FY17 and subsequent the B-2 AEHF strategic communications effort is documented in Project 676022 AEHF Strategic Comm.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The B-2 is currently undergoing modernization of avionics/communications systems, engines, armament systems, low observable components, core training system components, aircraft supportability improvements, support equipment development.

The Air Force will also study multiple structural, avionics, and engine modifications that could improve the performance of the aircraft and engines and reduce maintenance manhours and the logistics footprint of the fleet. Focus of the studies will be on non-mission capable (maintenance) drivers, safety issues, and obsolescence issues through modernization of key components in the airframe, avionics, and engines resulting in improved aircraft availability of a high demand/low density fleet.

Modern communications are key enablers for the B-2 in the anti-access/area denial battlespace, and directly enhance lethality and force multiplication. The Common Very Low Frequency (VLF) Receiver effort develops and integrates a receive-only, low bandwidth receiver and antenna subsystem to provide a secure, survivable strategic nuclear communication capability for the B-2. The receiver will be adaptable for use by other Department of Defense platforms. B-2 Cryptographic Modernization, an FY 2017 new start, updates cryptographic equipment for B-2 AIT/ARC-234, AN/ARC-211 and MIDS/LVT communication systems. The Adaptive Communication Suite (ACS) is an FY 2017 new start to explore incremental improvements to the B-2 ACS UHF communication system. The B-2 AEHF effort was established in Project 675345 B-2 Modernization; the B-2 AEHF effort continues in FY 2017 and subsequent years under Project 676022 AEHF Strategic Comm.

B-2 Armament upgrades integrate new and/or advanced weapons on the B-2 to attack a wider array of target sets, to include hardened, deeply buried targets, as well as destroy more targets per sortie. The Flexible Strike Phase 1 program will rehost the current B-2 stores management software onto a new integrated processor. B-2 will also integrate the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile Extended Range (JASSM-ER) weapon to further enhance the B-2's ability to attack and destroy high value target sets.

Low Observable Signature and Supportability Modifications (LOSSM) directly address B-2 aircraft availability. Given the extremely small fleet size (20 aircraft), mission accomplishment is particularly sensitive to the availability of this high-demand strategic asset. LOSSM projects increase aircraft availability, decrease low observable (LO) maintenance, and maintain and improve the combat-ready LO signature for the B-2 fleet ensuring survivable combat operations. LOSSM projects improve materials, structures, and diagnostic tools necessary to evaluate LO materials and systems in the B-2 fleet. LOSSM structure improvement projects include, but are not limited to, advanced high frequency materials placement, windshield bounce patch and tape improvements, composite plies, advanced signature reduction, and radar radome and antennae improvements. Material improvements include, but are not limited to, tailpipe and inlet coatings, pre- cured gap fillers, and other advanced LO materials development. Diagnostic tool efforts include, but are not limited to, improved radar frequency diagnostics, Signature Diagnostic System database upgrades, Tier One Material Inspection System improvements, Portable Laser Removal Tool development, Next Generation Mapper, SCI-2K Radar, Mobile Diagnostics Laboratory, Ground Air Radar System development, and other low observable special test equipment and information systems upgrades.

The B-2 Training System upgrades include updates to training device hardware and components, simulation software, courseware and academic materials, instructional system design architectures, engineering drawings, and system documentation that is not driven by a funded aircraft modification.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) Satellite Communications (SATCOM) system provides the only survivable, low probability of intercept/detection, high bandwidth system that ensures secure intra/inter-flight and two-way command and control communications in the modern anti-access/aerial denial battlespace. This communications upgrade replaces the Milstar/Ultra High Frequency (UHF) Satellite Communications (SATCOM) system (which is nearing system end of life) on the B-2.

The strategic communications effort will select, install, and integrate the radio, antenna and system components required to provide two-way EHF communication for the B-2.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The MM Ground and Comm Equipment program replaces obsolete/unsupportable ground-based weapon system equipment located at Launch Control Centers (LCCs) and Launch Facilities (LFs) necessary to continue MM III operations through 2030.  Current efforts include development, qualification, integration, and testing of replacement equipment such as the LGM-30G Air Launch Control System Replacement (ALCS), LGM-30G Automatic Switching Unit (ASU), LGM-30G Fast Rising B-Plug Phase II (FRBP II), LGM-30G Launch Control Center Break-In-Kit  (LCCB), LGM-30G Launch Control Center Block Upgrade (LCCBU), and LGM-30G Remote Visual Assessment Phase II (RVA II). 

MM III Baseline Support program replaces or upgrades obsolete/unsupportable flight test unique equipment installed on the missile during flight test, used to test MM III systems on the ground, or located at test facilities to collect, process, and analyze test data.  Flight test equipment supports test and evaluation of newly developed or modified MM III capabilities and conduct of MM III Operational Test Launches (OTLs) to determine ICBM force readiness, reliability and capability shortfalls.  Efforts include development, qualification, integration and testing of replacement equipment such as LGM-30G Cadmium Replacement Support Equipment Program (CaDRP), LGM-30G Flight Test Telemetry and Termination System (FT3), LGM-30G Ground Test Upgrade (GTU), and LGM-30G Squadron Data Simulator (SDS).  As other similar equipment is identified for replacement, it will be added to this program.  MM III Baseline Support also provides for other MM III unique government costs, studies of system performance, contract closeout costs, cost trades and acquisition planning activities, up to and including proposal preparation, for future capabilities.  

MM Support Equipment program designs, develops, and tests replacement of obsolete/non-serviceable weapon system support equipment. Current efforts include design, development, and testing of support equipment such as LGM-30G Alignment Set Test Set (ASTS), LGM-30G Control Monitor Procedure Trainer Upgrade (CMPT), LGM-30G Code System Media (CSM), LGM-30G G6B4 Build Equipment Replacement (G6B4 BER), LGM-30G Performance Assessment Data System Communications Equipment Interface Unit (PADS CEIU), LGM-30G Pendulous Integrating Gyroscopic Accelerometer Build Equipment Replacement (PIGA BER), LGM-30G Payload Transporter Replacement (PTR), LGM-30G Reentry Field Support Equipment (RFSE), LGM-30G Reentry Support Equipment Replacement Program (RSERP), LGM-30G Strategic Targeting and Applications Computer System (STACS), and LGM-30G Transporter Erector Replacement Program (TERP).  As other similar equipment is identified for replacement, it will be added to this program.  

MM Crypto Mods executes USSTRATCOM, Air Force Global Strike Command, and Nuclear Weapon Safety Center requirements by implementing the KS-60 capabilities in the LGM-30G ICBM Cryptography Upgrade II (ICU II) of remote key/code change and irreversible transformations mandated in the approved Capabilities Development Document (dated 4 Jan 05) and addresses Nuclear Weapon System Safety Group Operational Safety Review requirements 98-2, 00-1 and 02-2.  As other similar equipment is identified for replacement, it will be added to this program.

MM Operational Equipment program efforts identify viable concepts and material solutions in support of the Air Force's Ground Based Strategic Deterrent.  Funding supports design, development, test, integration and replacement of weapon system equipment including flight systems; Nuclear Command, Control and Communications (NC3); launch and control facilities; and Security/Ground Equipment upgrades.  Efforts within the MM Operational Equipment program will ensure MM III operations through 2030 as well as support future Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) requirements. Guidance Modernization Program (GMP) and Solid Rocket Motor Modernization (SRMM) were transferred into PE 0605230F, Ground Based Strategic Deterrent, Project 641025. As other similar equipment is identified for replacement, it will be added to this program. 

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes developmental efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal years.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

These programs will also implement processes, procedures and data systems to mitigate the transition risk from MM III to GBSD. Current efforts include development, qualification, integration, and testing of replacement equipment such as the LGM-30G Air Launch Control System Replacement (ALCS), LGM-30G Automatic Switching Unit (ASU), LGM-30G Fast Rising B-Plug Phase II (FRBP II), LGM-30G Launch Control Center Break-In-Kit (LCCB), LGM-30G Launch Control Center Block Upgrade (LCCBU), and LGM-30G Remote Visual Assessment Phase II (RVA II).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>ALCS-R will replace the legacy nuclear command and control system that provides the capability to launch MM III ICBMs from an airborne platform (Navy E-6B). The system consists of an Ultra High Frequency (UHF) radio and MM III interface at each LF, and a suite of launch equipment and cryptographic equipment that generates and transmits commands from the E-6B.  ALCS-R is dependent on the Strategic Air Command Code Processing System for codes data supplied to airborne equipment, and the Navy E-6B UHF Command, Control, and Communication data path to transmit signals to the LFs.  The approved acquisition strategy will recapitalize ALCS equipment in a single increment to support continued MM III operations by 2024 and resolve critical sustainment and cryptographic sunset issues.  ALCS-R will be designed to support transition into the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) airborne survivable launch platform capability maximizing investment across both weapon systems.</r2:Description>

The ASU is controlled by the MPP, which contains software and electronics to measure incoming and standby power characteristics. The DEU provides standby power in the event of a loss of the primary power source. Current equipment and lack of repair/reprogram capability causes inadvertent source transfers by the MPP. Technical data does not exist for repair or reprogramming of the MPP making it unsupportable. The ASU contacts have exceeded their service life, and unnecessary source transfers stress mission critical components. The increased power transfers have increased the use and accelerated the wear on the DEU.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Fast Rising B-Plug (FRBP) is a security element that delays access to the Launch Facility. It is a 14,000 pound rising door that obstructs the Personnel Access Shaft (PAS). The current setup can experience Uncommanded Raises (UCR) due to single point failures and transient voltages in the system. The Fast Rising B-Plug Phase II (FRBP II) program will update hardware and software to reduce susceptibility for UCRs, improve maintainability and address obsolescence issues.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Launch Control Center (LCC) Block Upgrade (LCCBU) program will address several elements within the LCC that are experiencing supportability issues and impacting voice communications in the MM missile fields. The LCCBU program is a single modification effort that replaces five components. Components will be procured as a single modification kit and installed as a single kit at each LCC. It will consist of five primary replacement efforts: 

1) Journal Memory Loader (JML) - replaces the JML with a modern data storage solution which will increase the available memory required to support annual software changes and mitigate Floppy Disk obsolescence concerns.
2) Floppy Disk Drive (FDD) - replaces the legacy FDDs which are no longer manufactured with a modern, supportable hardware solution.
3) Voice Communications Control Panel (VCCP) - replaces the current deficient equipment to provide the voice communications quality required to perform the ICBM mission and may require additional components to resolve voice communication degradations.
4) Weapon System Control Console (WSCC) Printer - replaces the current printer that is no longer produced and is unsupportable due to aging hardware and a lack of qualified vendors for replacement/repair components.
5) Oxygen Regeneration Unit (ORU) - replaces the current unsupportable system to provide the crew with breathable air during periods when the LCC is locked down.

All LCCBU efforts will support the 45 operational LCCs and additional support equipment/test/maintenance locations.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>MM III Baseline Support program replaces or upgrades obsolete/unsupportable flight test unique equipment installed on the missile during flight test, used to test MM III systems on the ground, or located at test facilities to collect, process, and analyze test data.  Flight test equipment supports test and evaluation of newly developed or modified MM III capabilities, and MM III Operational Test Launches (OTLs) to determine ICBM force readiness, reliability and capability shortfalls.  Efforts include development, qualification, integration and testing of replacement equipment such as LGM-30G Cadmium Replacement Support Equipment Program (CaDRP), LGM-30G Flight Test Telemetry and Termination System (FT3), LGM-30G Ground Test Upgrade (GTU), and LGM-30G Squadron Data Simulator (SDS). These programs will also implement processes, procedures and data systems to mitigate the transition risk from MM III to GBSD. As other similar equipment is identified for replacement, it will be added to this program.  MM III Baseline Support also provides for other MM III unique government costs, studies of system performance, contract closeout costs, cost trades and acquisition planning activities, up to and including proposal preparation, for future capabilities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>Cadmium plating is used in the LF and LCC Motor Generators. Motor generator parts are coated with the material to inhibit corrosion, ensure a low electrical signature (bonding and grounding) and aide in the ability to withstand a nuclear environment. Cadmium is one of the EPA-17 chemicals selected for reduction. Executive Directive 13148 and FAR part 23.703 states, "eliminate or reduce the generation of hazardous waste and the need for special material processing." CaDRP will provide a cadmium replacement coating with the same properties for corrosion inhibiting, bonding and grounding, and nuclear event survivability to meet these directives. Process must meet the weapon system parameters for form, fit, function, system safety, and hardness</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>FT3 designs, develops, fabricates and tests replacements for the Mod 7 Instrumentation Wafer, associated Signal Conditioner Monitor Group (SCMG), as well as the Flight Destruct System (FDS) and the Launch Safety System (LSS).  This will replace the unsupportable instrumentation wafer and FDS that do not meet current Range Safety Standards.  The Mod 7 instrumentation wafer transmits missile performance telemetry and position data and receives command destruct messages during MM III OTLs and developmental flight test evaluations. The SCMG and associated cabling capture Reentry System performance data during OTLs and developmental flight tests.  FT3 will replace the current MM III OTL flight destruct capability used in the event of a flight anomaly where it would be necessary to destroy the missile.  LSS replaces the current unique, specialized test system at Vandenberg AFB used to monitor and control test launch flights and ground support equipment. The current LSS is over 15-years old and experiencing major supportability issues. LSS failure trends are increasing due to hardware aging and obsolescence creating a need for workarounds, waivers and contractor intervention. A new Instrumentation Wafer and FDS are required to continue OTLs through 2030. A new LSS is required to field the Instrumentation Wafer and the FDS.</r2:Description>

Segment #1 completed in Sep 2011 and provided software to accept National Security Agency (NSA) codes, Operations Plan (OPLAN) changes and software updates on compact disk (CD). Segment #2 completed in Oct 2013 and provided software and hardware necessary to import all other data on CD and produce Wing Codes Processing System products on CD. Finally, the program will replace the Cartridge Tape Unit (CTU) with a Data Transfer Unit (DTU). The shelf life of the current stock of DC300 tape cartridges used by the CTUs and 9-track tapes will age out by 2017. The DTU provides the capability to load codes/software on Minuteman III ICBMs through 2030 and is critical to code change activities to secure the nuclear ICBMs.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>MM Crypto Mods executes USSTRATCOM, Air Force Global Strike Command, and Nuclear Weapon Safety Center requirements by implementing the KS-60 capabilities in LGM-30G ICBM Cryptography Upgrade II (ICU II) of remote key/code change and irreversible transformation as mandated in the approved Capabilities Development Document (dated 4 Jan 05) and addresses Nuclear Weapon System Safety Group Operational Safety Review requirements 98-2, 00-1 and 02-2. It also incorporates continuous signal lockout capabilities to prevent the widespread loss of status monitoring. These features will greatly increase security during code changes by reducing the frequency of open sites 75 days annually and will reduce associated resource costs for 450 Launch Facilities (LFs) and 45 Launch Control Centers (LCCs).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>In FY 2016, Project 672987, MM Ops Equipment, the two ongoing efforts were transferred into PE 0605230F, Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD), Project 641025. The efforts transferred were the Solid Rocket Motor Modernization (SRMM) and Guidance Modernization Program (GMP).</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>MM Operational Equipment program efforts will identify viable concepts and materiel solutions in support of the Air Force's GBSD. Funding supports design, development, test, integration and replacement of weapon system equipment including flight systems, Nuclear Command, Control and Communications (NC3), launch and control facilities, and Security/Ground Equipment upgrades.  Efforts within the MM Operational Equipment program will ensure MM III operation through 2030 as well as support future GBSD requirements. MM Operational Equipment also provides for other unique government costs, studies, cost trades and acquisition planning activities for future GBSD requirements.  In support of the future flight systems, the GMP effort will further define requirements, explore available technologies and architectures, select the most promising technology and architecture for development, and prepare acquisition plans. Efforts under the ICBM Demonstration and Validation Guidance Application Program (GAP), PE 0603851F, ICBM Dem/Val, will be leveraged to inform these efforts.  Also in support of the future flight systems, the SRMM effort will define operational requirements, investigate available technologies and prepare an acquisition strategy for SRMM development. SRMM will design and replace the existing solid rocket motors with a qualified modern design. This effort, coupled with ICBM Demonstration and Validation Propulsion Application Program (PAP), PE 0603851F, ICBM Dem/Val, will support development of requirements and an implementation timeline for the SRMM program.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>This program, BA 07 PE 0101313F, project 675029, Increment 5, is a new start.

In FY 2018, PE 0101313F, Strategic War Planning System - USSTRATCOM, Project 675029, ISPAN Increment 5 efforts will transfer to PE 0101324F, Integrated Strategic Planning and Analysis Network, Project 675029, ISPAN Increment 5, in order to provide improved transparency.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The mission of the US Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) is to establish and provide full-spectrum global strike, coordinate space and information operations capabilities to meet both deterrent and decisive national security objectives, and to provide operational space support, integrated missile defense, Global Command Control Communications and Computers Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR), and specialized planning expertise to the joint warfighter.  This mission has been defined by the 2002 Unified Command Plan (UCP) changes 1 and 2.  To enable completion of these missions, USSTRATCOM is modernizing the Integrated Strategic Planning and Analysis Network (ISPAN) (formerly known as Strategic War Planning System (SWPS)).

ISPAN is a multi-increment effort designed to incrementally add capability for USSTRATCOM and the National Command Authorities (NCA). The program is currently comprised of four increments (ISPAN Block 1, ISPAN Increment 2, Increment 4, and Increment 5.) Block 1, Increment 2, Increment 4, and FY17 Increment 5 are in PE 0101313F.  FY18-21 Increment 5 are in PE 0101324F.  ISPAN Block 1 modified and delivered capability for both the Global Adaptive Planning Collaborative Information Environment (GAP CIE) and the Mission Planning and Analysis System (MPAS) components. It achieved Full Deployment in July 2010. ISPAN Increment 2 further developed and provided increased capability for GAP CIE. ISPAN Increment 4 starts the  modernization of MPAS.  ISPAN Increment 5 will complete the modernization.  MPAS modernization will enable USSTRATCOM to revitalize its unique Force Planning mission of developing Joint Staff Level 1 through Level IV nuclear and conventional attack options for national and theater requirements. Force planning has become more complicated due to weapons reductions, increased accuracy requirements and delivery options, changing targeting requirements, shortened timelines for senior leader decision-making, and reduced financial resources to develop and sustain these national planning capabilities. ISPAN will modernize MPAS and allow it to fulfill the requirements for a more timely, flexible, and agile planning capability.  When ISPAN Increment 5 is complete the system will support the warfighter in both deliberate and adaptive planning environments while allowing the National Command Authority (NCA) to employ the full spectrum of kinetic and non-kinetic weapons.  Additionally, studies and analyses will be conducted to identify options for evolving the system as interfacing weapon systems are matured, new systems are developed, and the threat changes (particularly in the area of worldwide proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD). 


The FY 2017 funding request was reduced by $1.8 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.


GSIN establishes a unified schema integrating disparate Missile Warning/Missile Defense (MW/MD) data into a single exposed data set providing redundant MW/MD data to facilitate the rapid exchange of information across multiple missions and removes information ambiguity that delays time critical national C2 decision-making processes. GSIN nets together all sensors, from tactical to strategic (including the Nation's most modern and capable assets) taking advantage of their larger numbers, improved algorithms, mobility and forward deployment to provide earlier cross-cueing and expanded decision space when every second counts. GSIN will permit an IP-based User Defined Operational Picture (UDOP) to augment voice conferencing and rapidly build a single, unambiguous missile event picture allowing real-time senior collaboration for nuclear C2 and improved senior leader situational awareness (SA) and decision-making.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Integrated Strategic Planning and Analysis Network (ISPAN) (formerly known as SWPS) is a USSTRATCOM system that must be capable of both deliberate and adaptive planning employing the full spectrum of kinetic and non-kinetic weapons. The planning system will continue to evolve as weapon systems are matured, new systems are developed, and the threat changes, particularly in the area of worldwide proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD).

ISPAN Increment 4 will modernize the Mission Planning and Analysis System (MPAS), that develops Joint Staff Level I through Level IV nuclear and conventional attack options for national and theater requirements.  Increment 4 will fulfill MPAS requirements by reducing Crisis Action Planning and Time Sensitive Planning timelines, integrating nuclear and conventional kinetic weapon capabilities with non-kinetic effects, providing the capability to integrate planning and analysis capabilities of future Global Strike weapons, updating the MPAS system to provide the ability to train users in significantly less time, and leveraging new technologies to lower sustainment costs.  ISPAN Inc 4 is an evolution of the ISPAN Block 1 baseline system using proven technologies.


The FY 2017 funding request was reduced by $1.8 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The mission of USSTRATCOM is to establish and provide full-spectrum, global strike, coordinated space and information operations capabilities to meet both deterrent and decisive national security objectives and to provide operational space support, integrated missile defense, Global Command Control Communications and Computers Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR), and specialized planning expertise to the joint warfighter. This mission has been defined by the 2011 Unified Command Plan (UCP) change 1, the CJCS GSIN Planning Order (PLANORD) dated 06/1400Z Mar 10, the USSTRATCOM GSIN PLANORD dated 29/1943Z Jan 10 and a memorandum from the Senior Warfighter Forum (SWarF) to the VCJCS dated 13 October 2011 documenting data and information sharing deficiencies and recommendations to address them. GSIN directly supports this mission as it nets together selected systems and sensors, from tactical to strategic, including the Nation's most modern and capable assets, taking advantage of their larger numbers, improved algorithms, mobility and forward deployment to provide earlier cross-cueing and expanded decision space when every second counts. Using these traditionally stove-piped systems and sensors, GSIN enables the warfighter in several ways. First it will enable a User Defined Operating Picture (UDOP) to provide a single, unambiguous missile event picture allowing real-time senior collaboration for nuclear C2 and improved senior leader situational awareness (SA) for effective decision-making. Secondly, it will improve Space Situational Awareness (SSA) by tapping additional sensor capability. Finally, GSIN will dramatically improve the ingestion of non-traditional, but readily available non-US government and commercial data to the space catalog.

GSIN establishes a unified schema integrating disparate Missile Warning/Missile Defense (MW/MD) data into a single exposed data set providing redundant MW/MD data to facilitate the rapid exchange of information across multiple missions and removes information ambiguity that delays time critical national C2 decision-making processes. GSIN enables existing sensors to provide data in net-centric formats consumable by other authorized systems and mission areas, thus reducing the need to acquire more sensors. Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning, execution, and future program planning.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>FY15 funding received $3.5M (not reflected above) through approved Above Threshold Reprogramming to initiate the SACCS program.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Worldwide Joint Strategic Communication efforts include Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3) systems to include the Defense Injection Reception Emergency Action Message (EAM) C2 Terminals (DIRECT), Aircrew Alerting Communications Electromagnetic Pulse (AACE), the Strategic Emergency Action Transmission System (SEATS), the Defense Red Switch Network (DRSN), and the Strategic Automated Command and Control System (SACCS).  Funding may be used to modernize these, and other, NC3 systems.  Funding may also be used for research, testing, validation, certification, configuration management, and assessment of the Air Force NC3 Weapon System.   

SACCS is a dedicated, high speed, multi-level secure, data transmission, processing, and display system. SACCS provides the primary non-survivable command and control capability for receiving and disseminating secure Emergency Action Messages (EAM), Force Direction Messages (FDM), Force Status Reporting (FSR), and exchanging information type messages from USSTRATCOM. SACCS provides messages for effective deployment of strategic bombers, reconnaissance aircraft, mobilization aircraft, tanker support aircraft, and the Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) force.   

SACCS has equipment that has reached its end of life and is no longer repairable due to diminished manufacturing sources and parts obsolescence. This jeopardizes Air Force Global Strike Command's (AFGSC) ability to meet mission requirements as required by Chairman Joint Chief of Staff Nuclear Technical Performance Criteria and Operational Standards (CJCSI 6811.01). In order to mitigate the risk of SACCS inability to operate once the current spares are completely diminished, and ensure the system remains secure against modern/future threats, the Air Force is developing a replacement system.

This program is in Budget Activity 07, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal years.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Replaces all SACCS network components (e.g. Subnet Communications Processor (SCP), Base Communication Processor (BCP), Port Expansion Processor (PEP), and end user terminals). New equipment resolves cybersecurity issues, improves Mean Time Between Failure rates, reliability, availability, improves user interface, decreases annual sustainment costs, addresses Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages and obsolescence challenges, and meets Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Nuclear Technical Performance Criteria and Operational Standards (CJCSI 6811.01).</r2:Description>

                <r2:SummaryExplanation>Based on CY2015 market research, the Air Force believes the UH-1N Replacement program will include a need to integrate certain non-developmental military equipment and capabilities into an existing in-production commercial or military helicopter.  This requirement will involve one-time systems engineering activities to integrate this equipment into an existing technical and manufacturing baseline, and revise the aircraft type and airworthiness certifications accordingly.  Additional systems engineering activities will be needed to integrate UH-1N Replacement program requirements into operational mission planning and aircrew training systems associated with the aircraft solution.  The Air Force also believes live fire test and evaluation activities will be necessary to assess compliance with aircraft protection and survivability requirements.  Qualification and operational test and evaluation will be necessary to validate the solution's operational performance, effectiveness, and suitability.  These RDT&amp;E-related requirements emerged subsequent to the previous President's Budget, and form the basis for requesting RDT&amp;E, AF funding in the current President's Budget.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The UH-1N Replacement program will replace the Air Force fleet of UH-1N aircraft with modern helicopters that will close significant mission capability gaps associated with the current fleet of UH-1N aircraft.  The replacement aircraft will provide vertical airlift and support the requirements of five Air Force major commands and operating agencies:  Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC), Air Force District of Washington, Air Education and Training Command, Pacific Air Forces, and Air Force Materiel Command.  AFGSC is the Air Force lead command and operational capability requirements sponsor.  This program is an element of the Air Force's nuclear enterprise reform initiatives.  

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Air Force intends to procure an in-production commercial/government-off-the-shelf helicopter that requires only minimal integration of existing non-developmental military equipment (e.g. forward looking infrared sensors, personnel recovery hoists, auxiliary internal fuel tanks, cockpit/cabin armor, etc.) as necessary to meet all operational capability requirements.  The overarching program acquisition strategy will be determined in 3Q/FY2016.  Specific acquisition and contracting strategies for RDT&amp;E funded design/integration tasks and the test &amp; evaluation program will be determined as parts of the overall program strategy.  The Air Force intends to enter the acquisition process at Milestone C, and contract for this program no later than the end of 3Q/FY2017.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>BATTLE CONTROL SYSTEM-FIXED (BCS-F) is a weapon system that comprises operational equipment in the fixed air defense sites, Region/Sector Air Operations Center (R/SAOC), also known as Region Air Operations Center-Air Defense Sector (RAOC-ADS).  The BCS-F program supports a battle management command and control system with capability to integrate data from existing and future civil and military defense surveillance systems into a comprehensive recognized air picture.  BCS-F systems serve as Air Force Homeland Defense battle management command and control hubs and integrators for data from radar sensors, data links and supporting communications architecture.  BCS-F provides tactical communications and data link capabilities with other military and civil systems responsible for planning, directing, coordinating and controlling forces for air surveillance, air defense, and control of sovereign US air space.  This integrated air picture enhances the capability to conduct peacetime air sovereignty operations and transition to active air defense operations in the event of aggression.  The ACAT I BCS-F Increment 3 program declared full deployment in November 2012. BCS-F baseline also includes Remote Tactical Air Picture/Remote Work Station (RTAP/RWS).  BCS-F is a bi-national program with Canada, ensuring air defense and surveillance capability across the CONUS, Canada, Alaska and Hawaii.  NATIONAL CAPITAL REGION - INTEGRATED AIR DEFENSE SYSTEM (NCR-IADS) is a post-September 11, 2001 rapidly fielded capability that improves low altitude detection capability in order to prosecute airborne threats to the NCR.  NCR-IADS provides ground-based air defense of the National Capital Region airspace, and provides an integrated air picture, ground air defense weapons, enhanced regional situational awareness and forensic data collection capabilities for the warfighter mission to protect the NCR.  

BCS-F efforts will include systems engineering, development, prototyping, risk reduction, integration, and test &amp; evaluation of the BCS modernization upgrades program for areas that will include but not be limited to:  Mods supporting Battle Control Center (BCC) expansion (e.g., 3-D Coordinate System/Whole Earth); Ingestion/processing of advanced communications/sensors/data streams (such as ADS-B, Mode 5/S capability increase, and Live Virtual Construction (LVC) Distributed Mission Operations (DMO), Wide Area Surveillance (WAS) and Joint Land Attack Cruise Missile Defense Elevated Netted Sensor (JLENS)); System re-architecture/upgrade (such as cybersecurity upgrades, RTAP publish/subscribe architecture, system throughput/processing improvements (including 64-bit processing), and additional operator workstation capacity).  Some aspects of the development are classified and will be provided on a need to know basis.   Activities also include studies and analysis supporting current and future program planning and development.

NCR-IADS efforts may include system engineering, development, integration, and test &amp; evaluation in support of the NCR-IADS sustainment transfer of the Enhanced Regional Situational Awareness (ERSA) system.  Activities also include studies and analysis supporting future program planning and development.
  
This program is in Budget Activity 07, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Critical Infrastructure Program (DCIP) is a Department of Defense (DoD) risk management program that seeks to ensure the availability of networked assets critical to DoD missions. An October 2014 memorandum of agreement between USSTRATCOM and Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Defense Continuity and Mission Assurance transferred budget authority for SPACE SECTOR DCIP to USSTRATCOM to streamline the execution of funding. Critical infrastructure assets can include installations, facilities, antennas, vehicles, computing systems, and communications links. DCIP manages the identification, prioritization, assessment, and assurance of Defense Critical Infrastructure as a comprehensive program. The program includes the development of adaptive plans and procedures to mitigate risk.  

Navigation Warfare (Navwar) is deliberate defensive and offensive action to assure positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) information through coordinated employment of space, cyberspace, and electronic warfare (EW) operations.   The JNWC develops and maintains the Department’s premier collection of Navwar knowledge, and provides subject matter expertise support to warfighters, Department decision makers, the Federal Interagency (the Department of Homeland Security and other civil agencies concerned with the Critical National Infrastructure), and the Coalition.  Navwar expertise is developed in part by execution of PNT Operational Field Assessments (POFAs), modeling and simulation, analysis, and exercise and training support. JNWC-conducted POFAs are a key element in evaluating US and Coalition Navwar capabilities and vulnerabilities and adversary capabilities and vulnerabilities, both crucial to executing PNT superiority mission sets in potentially denied / degraded PNT environments.  JNWC helps develop defensive and offensive PNT capabilities by focusing on three Lines of Effort (LOE) to fulfill the mission tasks:

1. Create NAVWAR Knowledge – Conduct PNT operational field assessments, studies and analyses, analyze and disseminate NAVWAR intelligence, and maintain a NAVWAR armory
2. Operationalize PNT Superiority – Enable NAVWAR operations and provide planning subject matter expertise to Combatant Commands, Services, interagency partners and the coalition
3. Institutionalize PNT Superiority– Advocate DoD-wide NAVWAR activities to fully integrate NAVWAR into military operations and the future force structure


The Space Analysis and Application Development program integrates space based effects into Department’s ‘Model of Record’ for joint campaign analysis. Current modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) models are inadequate to represent the contribution that U.S space capabilities make to the air, sea, and land fight and do not accurately portray current and future space threats.  This line of effort integrates effects of space capabilities into the Synthetic Theater Operations Research Model (STORM) campaign level M&amp;S tool.  Enhanced space M&amp;S will enable the DoD to make informed decisions regarding the direction of U.S. Space Doctrine, Tactics, Techniques, Procedures, and Resource Decisions. The DoD requires the ability to conduct campaign-level analysis to quantify the holistic operational impacts of adversary space actions on military campaigns and U.S. global operations. 

USSTRATCOM Data Integration and Fusion Center (DIFC) is an innovative organization developing and experimenting innovative concepts designed to validate both material and non-material methodologies to overcome data isolation in order to enable kill chains in the Joint Battlespace.  These data isolation challenges result from  network isolation, incomplete communications architectures, data security, incompatible information formats, security release policy, etc., inhibiting effective and efficient consolidation of decision quality strategic, operational and tactical information.  The DIFC develops machine to machine solutions capable of ingesting Title 10 data at multiple classification levels, to include Special Access Program data, and associating/correlating with National Technical Means at multiple classification levels to both enhance and amplify the Common Operational Picture. The DIFC works closely with DoD SAPCO and elements of the Director of National Intelligence, to include NSA, NRO and CIA, to both identify and address policy barriers, architectures and training opportunities necessary to enable seamless flow of data from all available sensors to warfighters during time of conflict, primarily leveraging currently fielded tactical data links.  Though some recommended solutions validated during demonstration events may not transition to operations immediately, but nevertheless provide validated architecture solutions and approved security policies for use should conflict arise versus ad hoc attempts to solve data movement issues during conflict.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Navigation Warfare (Navwar) is deliberate defensive and offensive action to assure positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) information through coordinated employment of space, cyberspace, and electronic warfare (EW) operations.  Funds are used to create and maintain NAVWAR knowledge. Navwar expertise is developed in part by execution of PNT Operational Field Assessments (POFAs). GYPSY assessments are linked to USSTRATCOM’s Tier 1 GLOBAL Series exercises and other CCMD exercises and provide operational realistic threat-representative, GPS-contested environments for analytical assessment of air, ground, or maritime mission capability.  FORTUNE POFAs are smaller-scale PNT capability and vulnerability assessments used as future assessment risk reduction or as stand-alone PNT capability assessments. Assessments inform service acquisition decisions, capability gaps, intelligence gaps and tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP) development and implementation to mitigate effects on warfighter operations in the anticipated theater Navwar threat environments.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>In FY 2017, Project 67A011, Space Analysis and Application Development, includes new start efforts for the Data Integration and Fusion Center</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Space Analysis and Application Development program Integrates space based effects into Department’s ‘Model of Record’ for joint campaign analysis. Current modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) models are inadequate to represent the contribution that U.S space capabilities make to the air, sea, and land fight and do not accurately portray current and future space threats.  This line of effort integrates effects of space capabilities into the Synthetic Theater Operations Research Model (STORM) campaign level M&amp;S tool.  Enhanced space M&amp;S will enable the DoD to make informed decisions regarding the direction of U.S. Space Doctrine, Tactics, Techniques, Procedures, and Resource Decisions.  

The DoD requires the ability to conduct campaign-level analysis to quantify the holistic operational impacts of adversary space actions on military campaigns and U.S. global operations. 

USSTRATCOM Data Integration and Fusion Center (DIFC) is an innovative organization developing and experimenting innovative concepts designed to validate both material and non-material methodologies to overcome data isolation in order to enable kill chains in the Joint Battlespace. Funds are necessary to update current government-owned software to ingest and disseminate new data sources from Title 10 and Title 50 sensors.  The DIFC efforts at COCOM sponsored experimentation events will inform service acquisition decisions, capability gaps, intelligence gaps and tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP) development and implementation to mitigate effects on warfighter operations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>This program, BA 07 PE 0205219F, project 675249, MQ-9 Upgrade, is a new start.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The basic MQ-9 Reaper system consists of the aircraft, sensors, ground control station (GCS), communications equipment, weapon kits, support equipment, simulator and training devices, Readiness Spares Packages (RSP), technical data/training, and personnel required to operate, maintain, and sustain the system. The system is designed to be modular and open-ended.  Mission-specific equipment is employed on specific aircraft and control station configurations to be tailored to fit mission needs.  

In FY17, the MQ-9 Reaper system has two separate development programs:

1.  MQ-9 Development and Fielding.  This effort is for development and fielding of the baseline MQ-9 aircraft and GCSs and associated communications systems, sensors, payloads, simulators and support equipment.

2.  MQ-9 Upgrade.  This effort is to develop improvements for existing systems and to field new capabilities for the baseline MQ-9 fleet using a Hybrid Acquisition Strategy.

In FY18, an additional development program will commence:

Squadron Operations Centers (SOC).  This effort is for development and fielding of standardized operations centers to provide mission data and tasking information to the aircrew and disseminate and/or exchange mission data with decision-makers and the intelligence community.  

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The basic MQ-9 Reaper system consists of the aircraft, sensors, ground control station (GCS), communications equipment, weapon kits, support equipment, simulator and training devices, Readiness Spares Packages (RSP), technical data/training, and personnel required to operate, maintain, and sustain the system. The system is designed to be modular and open-ended.  Mission-specific equipment is employed on specific aircraft and control station configurations to be tailored to fit mission needs.  

The MQ-9 Reaper aircraft is a single-engine, turbo-prop Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) designed to operate over-the-horizon at medium-to-high altitude for long endurance sorties. The aircraft is designed to primarily prosecute critical, emerging Time-Sensitive-Targets (TSTs) as a Synthetic Aperture Radar, Electro-optical/Infrared (EO/IR), and laser designator-based attack asset with on-board hard-kill weapon capability (hunter-killer). It also performs Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Target Acquisition (ISR TA).

The MQ-9 system is continuing to develop and field capabilities to meet evolving mission needs through incremental upgrades, including:  increasing the maximum gross takeoff weight; increasing operational range and endurance; propulsion system improvements; integrated redundant avionics; incorporating provisions for a Foreign Military Sales(FMS) exportable version of the weapon system; communications upgrades to include datalink encryption, Internet Protocol (IP) networking, secure voice and data communications, navigation system upgrades; electrical system upgrades; sensor/stores management computer improvement; MIL-STD-1760 advanced weapons data bus; advanced sensor and weapon payloads; improved human-machine interface (HMI); integrating additional precision weapons, hardware and software upgrades to the ground control station.  The program will also complete airworthiness and weapon system certification and accreditation; produce applicable training for payloads funded in other program elements (e.g. SIGINT, communications, Wide Area Motion Imagery (WAMI), Near Vertical Direction Finding (NVDF), Gorgon Stare Quick Reaction Capability, advanced Counter-Improvised Explosive Device (C-IED), missile defense, hyperspectral, and other sensors and weapons).  Development efforts will address reliability, maintainability, sustainability, and safety issues.  Activities also include trade studies, analyses, preliminary systems engineering, system and subsystem level testing in accordance with DoD and military standards, and specification development in support of both current program planning and execution, and studies supporting analysis and investment in future MQ-9 program planning.

The GCS functions as the aircraft cockpit and can control the aircraft either within Line-of-Sight (LOS) or Beyond Line-of-Sight (BLOS) via a combination of satellite relay and terrestrial communication architectures. The GCS is either mobile to support forward operating locations or fixed at a facility to support reach back Remote Split Operations (RSO). The GCS has the capability to: perform mission planning; provide a means for manual control; and enable personnel to launch, recover, and monitor aircraft, payloads, and system communications status.  It incorporates secure data links to send aircraft and payload commands and receive system telemetry and payload data; monitors threats to the aircraft; displays the common operational picture; and provides support functions. Launch and Recovery GCS (LRGCS) is used for servicing, systems checks, maintenance, launch and recovery of aircraft under LOS control for hand-off to a mobile or fixed facility GCS, and conducting operations within line-of-sight range of the LRGCS. GCS upgrades will be developed and fielded in coordination with improvements to other MQ-9 system capabilities and in response to evolving operational and information assurance/certification and accreditation requirements.

This project will also increase interoperability among developed systems by developing common standards and tools.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The MQ-9 Reaper system will be acquired via sole-source contracts with General Atomics Aeronautical Systems Inc. (GA-ASI), L3Comm, and Raytheon as the prime contractors.  GA-ASI is the prime contractor for aircraft and ground control stations. L3Comm is the prime contractor for the Predator Satellite Link.  Raytheon is the prime contractor for the MTS-B EO/IR sensor system.  Management of development and fielding of new capabilities will be through a Hybrid Acquisition Strategy that combines the rigor of an event driven development process (referred to as a Technology Maturation Effort (TME)) with the expeditious delivery of a schedule driven integration and fielding process (referred to as a Hybrid Release).  This will allow continued baseline improvements while rapidly integrating limited urgent needs fleet-wide.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>This program, BA 07 PE 0205219F, project 675249, MQ-9 Upgrade, is a new start.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The MQ-9 Reaper Upgrade Program will develop improvements for existing systems and field new capabilities for the MQ-9 fleet through a Hybrid Acquisition Strategy.  The objective is to enable fielding of new hardware and/or software for integration into the MQ-9 fleet on an 18-month schedule.  The first two releases are under the auspices of the baseline MQ-9 Development and Fielding program.  Release 3 and 4 upgrades include, but are not limited to, repositioning Airhandler equipment from the payload tray into "cheeks" on the MQ-9 aircraft fuselage, implementing VORTEX Phase II, replacing the GPS with a differential GPS, implementing an Autonomous Systems upgrade, upgrading the data links to use the new Bandwidth Efficient Common Data Link (BE-CDL), enhancing the Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) targeting capability, the Universal Armament and Sensor Interface and Miniature/Store Interface, implementing the results of the Technology Insertion program, Beyond Line of Sight (BLoS), Barrett Asymmetric Digital Datalink Computer (BADDC), Guided Bomb Unit (GBU)-54, and fielding of the hardware and software required to separate the payload software from the operational flight program (OFP) software to enable fielding of new sensors, weapons, and payloads without requiring changes in the OFP.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>Will develop upgrade capabilities to support Releases 3 and 4 of the Hybrid Acquisition strategy.  New capabilities will include upgrades of existing aircraft, Ground Control Station (GCS), communication, and payload systems as well as the addition of new capabilities and subsystems. 
Final lists of upgrades included in each release will be determined as part of future Configuration Steering Board direction and inputs from JUONs and Urgent Operational Need request. Formal approval of Release 3 content will be established in FY 2016 and is currently subject to fluctuation pending customer priorities. Some current candidates for Release 3 include the following: 
•	Autonomous Systems upgrades 
•	Communication Systems upgrades to include the following efforts:
       •	Video Orientated Transceiver for EXchange of Information (VORTEX) Phase 2 will complete the Ground Control Station (GCS) upgrade allowing functionality within the GCS only currently available via laptop computer

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Acquisition of MQ-9 upgrades will initially be accomplished via sole-source contracts with General Atomics-ASI and L-3 Communications, the prime contractors.  Management of development and fielding of new capabilities will be through a Hybrid Acquisition Strategy that combines the rigor of an event driven development process (referred to as a Technology Maturation Effort (TME)) with the expeditious delivery of a schedule driven integration and fielding process (referred to as a Hybrid Release).  This will allow continued baseline improvements while rapidly integrating limited urgent needs fleet-wide.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The A-10 is a twin engine, single seat weapon system capable of delivering a full range of air-to-ground munitions and self-defense air-to-air missiles. The A-10 is an essential capability for successful joint air operations and represents a crucial component of the Combat Air Forces. The A-10 concept of operations requires a flexible, adaptable and survivable weapon system to conduct close air support (CAS), combat search and rescue and special operations missions. The A-10 must conduct around-the-clock air operations under various weather conditions against numerous and varied enemy threats.

Operational Flight Program (OFP) development addresses evolving and continuing user requirements that must be incorporated in the aircraft software in order to employ advanced weapons, increase situational awareness and enhance targeting capabilities as they become available. The funds budgeted continue regular OFP suite development efforts.  Additionally, these funds will ensure concurrency with systems impacted by OFP development, including but not limited to the Full Mission Trainer (FMT), mission planning and support equipment. 

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The F-16 Fighting Falcon is the world's premier fixed-wing, high performance, single engine multi-mission fighter aircraft that comprises 50% of the AF fighter inventory.  Operational since 1980, the F-16 has proven itself in combat in a variety of air-to-air and air-to-surface missions, such as, offensive and defensive counter-air, close air support, forward air control, air interdiction (day/night and all-weather) and Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD)/destruction of enemy air defenses (DEAD).  The F-16 remains the USAF's primary SEAD/DEAD platform.  The aircraft has evolved its capabilities by capitalizing upon advancements made in computers, avionics systems, engines, and structures technologies to meet emerging warfighter requirements and combat current and evolving enemy threats.  The F-16 has been selected by more than 20 air forces around the world and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) production continues in the 21st century.  The F-16 System Program Office continues to develop, integrate, and qualify systems/subsystems to enhance the overall performance of the F-16 weapon system to meet new mission requirements.

Modernization programs include: Operational Flight Program (OFP) development on Block 40/42/50/52 OFPs required to integrate new precision weapons, advanced targeting pods, improved avionics, hardware (HW) and software (SW) mods to meet DoD mandates and keep the F-16, the respective training simulators, and other hardware subsystems current; Legacy Service Life Extension Program (SLEP), which is a two-phased RDT&amp;E effort, includes a Full Scale Durability Test (FSDT) and Engineering, Manufacturing and Development (EMD) to support structural modifications to Block 40/42/50/52 aircraft to increase Certified Service Life (CSL) from 8,000 Equivalent Flight Hours (EFH) to 10,000 EFH (Threshold), or 12,000 EFH (Objective); EMD Hardware/Advanced capability improvements require funding to develop, test, and qualify, weapon systems, aircraft subsystems replaced or modified due to requirements changes, pre-planned product improvements (P3I), Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) and parts obsolescence; Modular Mission Computer (MMC)/Display Generator Upgrade resolves shortfalls in mission computer memory and throughput brought on by the addition of incremental combat capability and includes Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE), design, development, integration, and ground/flight test for fielding; F-16 Training Simulator updates enable the USAF to exercise/train using the most current F-16 OFP available to all block configurations, to include both aircrew and maintenance trainers; Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile-Extended Range (JASSM-ER) on F-16 Blk 40/42/50/52 aircraft, and includes NRE, test assets, SEEK EAGLE, integration, and flight test; improved satellite communication (SATCOM) radio updates to meet next-gen tactical narrowband SATCOM with better crypto capabilities; and an active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar that offers advanced electronic protection capabilities as well as improved reliability and maintainability on F-16 aircraft that perform the aerospace alert control mission.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because it includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>OFP M-tapes are updated continually to integrate new weapons, targeting pods, and improved avionics.  M6.5+/M7+ is in Phase III development with M6.5+ common candidates to include Universal Armament Interface (UAI) and Embedded GPS/INS (EGI) updates and M7.1+ candidates to include AIM-9X Block II.  The USAF M6.5+ OFP is not intended to field and is the baseline for the 309 SMXG (Hill AFB) developed M7.1+ which will field in FY2017.  M7.2+ OFP is in SW design phase and will incorporate DoD mandates.  M8+ is in the early stages of planning and will incorporate the MMC upgrade architecture and Display Generator Upgrade.  The OFP effort also contains Program Management Administration (PMA) support activities to include travel, office supplies, training courses, Video Teleconferencing (VTC) and support contractors.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The F-16 Program acquisition strategy is to improve capability, maintenance and safety mods through OFP development/flight test, enhanced weapons integration, structural upgrades, and simulator concurrency.

OFP software will be continually updated on a 3-year cycle to bring new capabilities to the warfighter.  The current OFP development effort (M7.1+) is the first software tape to be completely developed with organic software development at 309 SMXG (Hill AFB).  Subsequent tapes will incorporate DoD approved mandates (Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B), Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS), B61-12) and the MMC/PDG architecture.

The Legacy SLEP program completed FSDT to determine the engineering solutions necessary to resolve life-limiting structural issues, and to feed the EMD effort to develop mod kits and airworthiness certification recommendation. Currently performing aircraft teardown and structural analysis, and begins kit proof in FY 2016.

The EMD HW/Advanced capability improvements will develop, test, and qualify aircraft weapons systems, including subsystems, replaced/modified due to requirements changes, P3I and DMS/parts obsolescence.

Contract types are Time and Material, Cost Plus Incentive Fee, Cost Plus Fixed Fee and Firm Fixed Price.

The acquisition strategy for Phase 1 of the USNORTHCOM JUON includes the development, testing, and USG integration of an AESA radar to meet the limited JUON requirements of improved air-air detect and track.  This phase includes the procurement of five (5) EMD assets with support equipment.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The F-15 is the most versatile fighter in the world today.  The F-15C/D continues to provide air superiority with an undefeated and unmatched aerial combat record.  The F-15E retains this air superiority capability and adds systems, such as advanced imaging and targeting systems, to meet the requirement for all-weather, deep penetration, and night/under-the-weather, air-to-surface attack.  Configured with conformal fuel tanks (CFTs), the F-15E deploys worldwide with minimal tanker support and arrives combat-ready.  A mainstay in operations both domestic and abroad, upgrades to the F-15 (avionics, armament, airframe, and engines) are critical to maintaining combat viability (lethality, survivability, and supportability).  Projected to remain in service past 2040, avionics modernization is key to long-term weapon system viability.  This modernization is built on a foundation of technical and acquisition support studies (both internal to the Air Force and through outside contractors), forestalling obsolescence, exploiting proven technological advances, and leveraging new technology.  Major avionics upgrades center around radar modernization (both hardware and software upgrades) and the exploitation of enhanced capability via precision timing, data delivery and processing technology, precision registration systems, cockpit Heads Up Display (HUD) and Heads Down Display, instrumentation digitization and modernization, central computer processing power increases, digital mission event recording systems and an infrared (IR) based fire control system.  The proliferation of fourth generation enemy aircraft and sophisticated "double-digit" anti-aircraft missile systems pose a significant threat to F-15 survivability.  A fully integrated electronic warfare suite holds the promise of providing survivability as well as expanded electronic attack capability. Nearly all improvements are linked to an aircraft operational flight program update schedule that works to integrate new capabilities with the airframe.  These updates are a responsive way to increase the offensive and defensive capability and survivability of the F-15.  Incorporation of corresponding spiral and/or phased technology/equipment improvements that include support equipment, mission planning systems, and training device upgrades will improve performance, supportability, and aircrew training. This includes technical and acquisition-related studies to ensure F-15 lethality and survivability beyond 2040.

The2017 funding request was reduced by $4.238 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This includes development of the F-15C and F-15E Advanced Display Core Processor (ADCP) II and Mode 5/ADS-B new start.  The ADCP II will develop a common mission computer for the F-15C and F-15E.  The current mission computers of both platforms have reached their limits of speed, memory and throughput.  Additionally, digital systems have changed the security requirements of both platforms and the older mission computers cannot be upgraded to meet these new requirements.  A common mission computer is expected to reduce overall development costs as well as long term maintenance costs.  The program will also develop a new F-15C cockpit display to replace an obsolete one. Mode 5 enables the NSA-mandated Mode 5 encryption and anti-jam for Air-Air Interrogator (AAI) and Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) systems.  ADS-B provides Air Traffic Control position and other secondary surveillance data and must be installed on all CONUS aircraft by 2020 IAW FAA mandate.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>These development efforts include F-15 Radar Enhancements Electronic Protection (EP) capabilities, Operational Flight Program (OFP) upgrades, Flight Testing, Infrared Search and Track (IRST) and Multifunctional Information Distribution System-Joint Technical Radio System (MIDS-JTRS).

The Radar Enhancements (EP) will upgrade the digital Active Electronic Scanned Array (AESA) radar capabilities to counter sophisticated electronic threats.  Suite 7C introduces EP into the C/D-model fleet. Initial EP capability for APG-82(V)1 equipped E model aircraft will take place in Suite 8E. Suite 9 will add additional EP capability to both the F-15E and F-15C. 

For the F-15 to maintain operational effectiveness, the program must continuously provide the platforms with improved capabilities.  To accomplish this there is an on-going need to develop software and hardware upgrades and to flight test new capabilities and systems.   The OFP funding line allows the Air Force to release software upgrades approximately every 3 years.  At any one time, there will normally be three OFP upgrades in work: one in requirements definition/pricing, one in code writing and test, and one in flight test and release preparation.  The Flight Test funding line allows the Air Force to fund the on-going test effort. 

Infrared Search and Track (IRST) system will provide air to air detection, tracking and ranging capability for F-15C/D in a radar-denied environment.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The Infrared Search and Track (IRST) system will provide the F-15C/Ds with the capability to detect and track objects by infrared radiation. The IRST complements other onboard sensors by scanning a large volume of air space, fills gaps left by other sensors. This capability complements the radar to enhance survivability and lethality against air-to-air threats, provides a passive infrared sensor system that searches for and detects infrared energy, and provides the aircraft mission computer track file data on infrared targets.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Manned Destructive Suppression (MDS) program element funds the development, procurement, and sustainment of the Air Force's Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) and Destruction of Enemy Air Defenses (DEAD) capabilities. The F-16 HARM Targeting System (HTS) is currently the only programmed reactive SEAD capability and enables targeting the HARM missile in its most lethal 'range known' mode. The program provides F-16 Block 50/52 and Block 40/42 aircraft with the ability to employ the AN/ASQ-213 Pod. With the introduction of HTS Revision 7 (HTS R7) in 2007, the AN/ASQ-213 Pod now has a precision geo-location capability to target Precision Guided Munitions (PGMs) to destroy fixed and mobile enemy air defense elements.  Additionally, by relocating the AN/ASQ-213 HTS R7 Pod to the aircraft's left inlet hard point, the F-16 can simultaneously carry the HTS R7 Pod and an Advanced Targeting Pod (ATP). HTS R7 fielding is complete and represents the Air Force's near-term solution for reactive time critical targeting for DEAD until this mission can be transferred to F-35 or a yet to be defined system. HTS R7 derived precision targeting data can be provided to all Joint Forces via Link-16. This effort continues preplanned product improvements (P3I) for the HTS and applies technologies similar to those demonstrated in the Advanced Tactical Targeting Technologies (AT3) program and HTS R7 development. 

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The F-22 Raptor provides air superiority to the Joint Force; access in the highly contested operational environment; as well as, homeland and cruise missile defense for the next 25+ years.  The F-22 is the only operational multi-mission fighter aircraft that combines stealth, supercruise, maneuverability and integrated avionics to make it the world's most capable combat aircraft.  The Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase of F-22 acquisition is complete.  The program is now continuing pre-planned, incremental modernization development that enhances both F-22 Air Superiority and Global Strike capabilities.  The F-22 modernization program upgrades the air vehicle, engine, and training systems to improve F-22 weapons, communications, and Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities.

The FY2017 funding request was reduced by $.600 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.

BA7 - This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational Systems Development--development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

This program, BA 07 PE 0207138F, project 674785, F-22 Global Positioning System (GPS) Military Code (M-Code), is a new start.

Totals include funding for PRCP Program Number 265, F-22A Squadrons.

In FY13, a separate Program Element (0605213F) was created for Increment 3.2B upon designation as an ACAT I program.  All Increment 3.2B efforts and associated funding prior to FY13 are included in the F-22A Squadrons (0207138F) budget documentation.

In FY15, a separate Budget Project Activity Code (BPAC 674788) was created for F-22 Tactical Mandates, formerly known as F-22 Mandates.  

F-22 development and production are complete. The remaining program consists of F-22 Operational Flight Program (OFP) updates, capability enhancements, and mandates necessary to sustain F-22 weapon system survivability, lethality and availability. The "Continuing" Cost to Complete and Total Cost reflect these initiatives.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The F-22 Raptor represents the USAF's priority placed on providing the Joint Force with air dominance, operational access, and homeland &amp; cruise missile defense for the next 25+ years.  The F-22 is a multi-mission fighter aircraft that combines stealth, supercruise, advanced maneuverability and integrated avionics to make it the world's most capable combat aircraft.  While F-22 Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) and aircraft production completed May 2012, funding for F-22 modernization is "continuing" beyond the FYDP. 

This program funds all non-MDAP development efforts for the F-22.  The program is now continuing the pre-planned and evolutionary modernization effort through incremental development phases that enhance the F-22 anti-access / area denial, Air Superiority and Global Strike capabilities.  The development program modernizes and upgrades the air vehicle, engine, avionics, and training systems to improve/enhance F-22 weapons, communications, and intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Raptor Enhancement Development &amp; Integration (REDI) contract is an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) Ordering contract that maximizes flexibility to start, stop, accelerate and decelerate projects as required. The REDI contract was established to be more responsive to evolving war fighter requirements. The REDI contract allows the issuance of orders for the highest priority war fighter capabilities in operationally meaningful capability increments: requirements analysis, contractor cost estimates and studies, development and demonstration of capability enhancements, and unanticipated future war fighter requirements. Each increment is broken into phases to initiate requirements analysis, the design phase and the development, integration and verification phase of a specific incremental development effort. The REDI II contract is a follow-on Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract to the initial REDI contract.  The REDI II contract is used to issue delivery and task orders for the planning, analysis, design, development, qualification, test and documentation of F-22 weapon system performance enhancements, life-cycle improvements, Operational Flight Program (OFP) upgrades, and associated efforts essential to accomplishing the F-22 mission.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>This program, BA 07 PE 0207138F, project 674788, TACLink 16, is a new start.

Totals include funding for PRCP Program Number, 265 F-22 Tactical Mandates 

In FY15, a separate Budget Program Activity Code (BPAC 674788) within PE 0207138F was created for F-22 Tactical Mandates, formerly known as F-22 Mandates. F-22 Tactical Mandates proposal activities were initiated in BPAC 674785 in FY14.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The TACLink 16 and F-22 Tactical Mandates programs are follow-on modernization efforts to Increment 3.2B. The programs will provide Open Systems Architecture, Link 16 Transmit and Mode 5 Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) Transpond/Interrogate on the F-22.  Thru the FY16 budget, these capabilities were all part of the F-22 Tactical Mandates program.  Via the TACLink 16 program, the FY17 budget request recognizes an important opportunity to accelerate fielding of Open Systems Architecture and Link 16 Transmit onto the F-22 one year earlier than possible as part of F-22 Tactical Mandates.

Capability integration for the TACLink 16 program will be accomplished using Open Systems Architecture to enable future life cycle savings opportunities for the F-22 and as a risk reduction effort for the F-22 Tactical Mandates program. Both programs will require hardware and software modifications to the Block 30/35 combat coded F-22 fleet.

Link 16 Transmit enables the 5th generation F-22 fighter aircraft to transmit tactical information through datalink to the 5th generation F-35 (a.k.a. 5th-to-5th), as well as to 4th generation aircraft (a.k.a. 5th-to-4th).  Enabling the F-22 to transmit tactical data to other aircraft types via datalink is a top Air Force priority. With Link 16 Transmit, the Raptor's superior 5th Generation sensor suite will be able to aid the situational awareness of all participants in the operating environment.  The TACLink 16 program is an opportunity to accelerate the install of this key data link capability onto the F-22 Raptor.

Mode 5 IFF is a Joint Requirements Oversight Council-mandated Blue Force identification capability that improves Raptor survivability and reduces fratricide risk DoD-wide.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The TACLink 16 program will accelerate fielding of key technologies previously aligned with the F-22 Tactical Mandates program. The program consists of software and hardware development necessary to field basic Link 16 Transmit capability on the F-22.  Link 16 Transmit will be accomplished via an Open Mission Systems (OMS) architecture integrated with F-22 legacy avionics.  The OMS implementation will provide a pathway to more competitive and open future F-22 modernization. Includes Mission Support of the F-22 Program Office: travel, computer costs, and other miscellaneous contract support.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) Program will develop and field an affordable, highly common family of next generation strike aircraft for the United States Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps and allies. The three variants are the F-35A Conventional Takeoff and Landing; F-35B Short Take Off and Vertical Landing; and the F-35C Aircraft Carrier suitable variant. Maximum commonality among the variants, consistent with National Disclosure Policy, will minimize life cycle costs.  As Initial Operational Capability (IOC) delivers for each variant during System Development and Demonstration (SDD), planning and initial systems engineering for the Follow-on Development(FoD) continues.

FoD capability requirements were initiated through ongoing Service-led operational analysis of warfighting gaps identified in the Fifth Generation Fighter Modernization Initial Capabilities Document (ICD), and through F-35 JSF Program Block 4 Mission Decomposition analysis completed in FY2014. These analyses serve as basis for the F-35 FoD Capabilities Development Document (CDD), staffed through the Air Force Requirements Oversight Council (AFROC) and signed by the USAF Chief of Staff in January 2015.  JROC approval of the CDD is expected in FY2016.  Pre-modernization activities in FY2016 and FY2017 include systems engineering, risk reduction, and FoD facility upgrades to support an initial Block 4 fleet availability in 2020. The FoD program includes a robust weapons integration portfolio, and expands new opportunities for International Partners to assess, integrate, and field unique capabilities based on global sovereign requirements. Additionally, the F-35 JSF Operational Requirements Document (ORD) calls for the F-35A to have the capabilities and provisions for Dual-Capable Aircraft (DCA) operations in the first post-SDD block upgrade. DCA refers to the capability to carry and deliver conventional and non-conventional weapons. DCA operation for the F-35A is internal carriage of up to two B-61s. Due to extensive certification requirements, the DCA capability planning and design, testing and certification will continue throughout Block 4.

The United Kingdom, Italy, Netherlands, Turkey, Canada, Australia, Denmark and Norway are participants in F-35 modernization.  The program shown here reflects USN, USMC, USAF, and International Partner funding.  Funding at the accomplishment/planned program level is reported as the total of all service and partners as these activities support all aircraft variants.  Foreign Military Sales are ongoing separately. 

The FY2017 funding request was reduced by $19.745 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.

BA7 - This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>F-35 FoD provides continuing incremental upgrades of the three F-35 variants and associated ground equipment.  Upgrades are essential mission improvements for Air Interdiction and Strategic Attack, Close Air Support, Suppression and Destruction of Enemy Air Defenses, Offensive and Defensive Counter Air and expanded Surface Warfare.  The Block 4 acquisition strategy is based upon incremental deliveries of capabilities in 4 sub-blocks.  The strategy includes deliveries on a two year cycle with a focus on hardware and tech refresh change every four years.  FoD capability planning  includes an efficient transition from F-35 SDD to Follow-on Development.  As SDD development activities ramp down, the FoD will assume responsibility for improvements and modernization efforts.  Block 4 capability planning includes Block 4.1 through 4.4 modernization efforts with initial increment of capability available in 2020 and subsequent releases every two years.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>This is a joint program with no executive service.  Service Acquisition Executive (SAE) authority alternates between the Department of the Navy and the Department of the Air Force and currently resides with the Navy.  Program Element 0604800N/0604800M continues USN development efforts budgeted in 0603800N prior to FY2002.  The United Kingdom, Italy, Netherlands, Turkey, Canada, Australia, Denmark, and Norway are participants in the SDD phase of JSF.

Note:  The USAF/USN/USMC procurement lines include Aircraft Procurement and Advanced Procurement only.  Initial Spares and Repair Parts for all Services are reflected in separate lines.  International Partner Funding also includes funds provided under the Italy and Netherlands Bilateral agreements.  

RELATED RDT&amp;E:  Funding prior to JSF SDD (FY94-FY01):  USN PE 0603800N $1,950,617; USAF PE 0603800F $1,907,352; DARPA PE 0603800E $118,056; and International Partner contributions of $253,921 for a total of $4,229,946.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>To enable the ability to adjust to potential discrepancies discovered during SDD Block 3 Test and Evaluation, the engineering and development planning support for FoD will be procured under a cost type contract.  A fee provision will be used to target and motivate contractor performance.  A separate Basic Ordering Agreement or Indefinite Quantity/Indefinite Delivery contract is planned to provide a long term approach to upgrading and maintaining laboratories and test aircraft.  Both Development Support and Management Services will use CPFF and CPIF Delivery Orders.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>F-35 Follow-on Development(FoD) provides continuing incremental upgrades of the three F-35 variants and associated ground equipment.  Upgrades are essential mission improvements for Air Interdiction and Strategic Attack, Close Air Support, Suppression and Destruction of Enemy Air Defenses, Offensive and Defensive Counter Air and expanded Surface Warfare.   The Block 4 acquisition strategy is based upon incremental deliveries of capabilities in 4 sub-blocks.   The strategy includes deliveries on a two year cycle with a focus on hardware and tech refresh change every four years. FoM capability planning includes an efficient transition from F-35 SDD to Follow-on Development.  As SDD development activities ramp down, FoD will assume responsibility for improvements and modernization efforts.  Block 4 capability planning includes Block 4.1 through 4.4 modernization efforts  with intial increment of capability available in 2020 and subsequent releases every two years. 

Additionally, the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) Operational Requirements Document (ORD) calls for the F-35A variant to have the capabilities and provisions for Dual Capable Aircraft (DCA) operations in the first post SDD block upgrade.  DCA refers to the capability to carry and deliver conventional and non-conventional weapons.   DCA operation for the F-35A is internal carriage of two B-61s.  Due to extensive certification requirements, the Follow-on Modernization Capability Development Document (CDD).

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

It identifies and mitigates potential technical and cost risks, as well as defines the integration and certification trade-space to field the DCA capability with the B61-12 weapon. This effort also supports follow-on risk reduction efforts that will ensure future integration alignment with  the earliest feasible post-SDD block upgrade, and is expected to include full integration efforts pending Service decisions.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>Funding in FY11 and out is for the Block II program only.  The AIM-9X Block I program costs for FY11 and prior are $233.583M.  The AIM-9X Block II program costs for FY14 and prior are $67.290M.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>AIM-9X is a long-term evolution of the AIM-9, a fielded system, qualifying this as a research category operational systems development. The AIM-9X short range Air-to-Air missile modification program provides a launch and leave, air combat munition that uses passive Infra-Red (IR) energy for acquisition and tracking of enemy aircraft and complements the Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile. Air superiority in the short range Air-to-Air Missile arena is essential and includes first shot, first kill opportunity against an enemy employing IR countermeasures. The AIM-9X employs several components common with the AIM-9M (fuze, rocket motor and warhead). The AIM-9X Block II missile is critical to project power and win decisively in accordance with the Fiscal Year 2015 Defense Planning Guidance. The missile is essential to Pacific Command plans to counter threats employing advanced Digital Radio Frequency Memory (DRFM) jamming, cruise missiles, and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles.

The Block II program has completed Independent Operational Testing and found to be Operationally Effective and Suitable.  The program obtained a Full Rate Production decision in August 2015, with the first Full Rate Production Lot contract awarded in September 2015.  This budget line will continue technical refresh of critical obsolete components, implement cost reduction initiatives, improve insensitive munitions performance, correct deficiencies, increase capabilities through software enhancements, and conduct testing to ensure platform integration onto threshold US Air Force aircraft.

The program strategy is to first redesign the control actuation system (CAS) battery and incorporate it into the Lot 17 (FY 2017) production missile. Next, the program will complete AIM-9X Block II software improvements (software version 9.4) and release it into Lot 18 (FY 2018) and prior missiles. The software will provide improved infrared counter-countermeasures, improved lock on after launch capability, added partial and degraded cue capability, improve small target acquisition, and provide surface attack capability. Finally, the program will redesign the inertial measurement unit, the dome, and the guidance unit processor and incorporate these hardware changes into the Lot 19 (FY 2019) production missile. This last item will include a software re-host(software version 10.4) to make software compatible with the new processor. The guidance unit processor is the critical component to ensure continued production of the missile system and avoid production line gaps after Lot 18. 

AIM-9X Block I concluded in FY2011 and all funding/quantity data in the documents are associated with Block II activities.

BA7- This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>Congressional language directed the program to report as a missile procurement (3020, BP20), starting in FY2002, and not as a missile modification (3020, BP21).</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The program received USN Initial Operational Capability (IOC) in March 2015 and Full Rate Production (FRP) Approval in August 2015 followed by contract award for FRP-1 in September 2015. The Air Force anticipates receiving Initial Operational Capability in April 2016. The program will modify the production contract in June 2016 to award option year 1 for FRP-2 and add option year 2 for FRP-3. Option year 2 will be awarded in February 2017.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Air Force and Navy continue to develop improvements to the Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM) to counter existing and emerging air vehicle threats operating at high or low altitude, and having advanced Electronic Attack (EA) capabilities. The development program also enables AMRAAM compatibility with advanced fighters, enhances AMRAAM capability and operational flexibility against current and projected threats, incorporates high payoff technology development, performs risk reduction activities, and investigates new variants and/or alternate missions which may use AMRAAM attributes. The latest AMRAAM variant, the AIM-120D, delivers improved performance via Global Positioning System (GPS)-aided navigation; two-way datalink capability for enhanced aircrew survivability and improved network compatibility; and incorporates new guidance software which improves kinematic performance and weapon effectiveness. Operational Testing (OT) was completed in Jul 14 and the Air Force and Navy authorized operational fielding in Jan 15. The Navy declared Initial Operational Capability (IOC) in Jan 15 and the Air Force declared IOC in Jul 15.  The program continues to address aircraft integration efforts to maintain compatibility/ performance of the missile with changes occurring on threshold AMRAAM platforms per Capability Production Document (CPD). To keep the existing inventory as effective as possible, the Air Force and Navy also develop, test, and field improvements that are implemented via software upgrades reprogrammed into fielded AMRAAMs, and/or hardware upgrades inserted into production units.  AMRAAM is a joint Air Force/Navy, Acquisition Category IC (ACAT IC) program with Air Force as lead service.

This program is in Budget Activity 7-Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The EPIP program is underway to keep AIM-120C missiles capable against the growing electronic attack threat environment.  EPIP Basic development completed in     Jun 14.  Capability improvement continues with the EPIP Advanced effort. This effort was awarded in Jun 12 as a CPFF with performance awards.  This development effort is planned for completion in Apr 17.

Post OT System Improvements Program (SIP) is underway as part of the AIM-120D missile upgrade program.  SIP Increment 1 (SIP-1) awarded in 2009 as a CPFF effort aims to improve baseline AIM-120D capabilities.  SIP-2 EMD, which incorporates basic EPIP in the AIM-120D, was awarded in Jul 15.  This CPIF effort was awarded for 19 months.  SIP-3 TMRR was awarded in  Sep 15 as a 19-month CPFF effort with SIP-3 EMD award planned for FY 17. SIP-3 primarily incorporates AEPIP capabilities in the AIM-120D.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

In FY 2016, PE 0207171F, F-15 EPAWSS, Project 676038, EPAWSS, Budget Activity 07, Operational Systems Development was transferred to PE 0207171F, F-15 EPAWSS, Project 657108, EPAWSS Development, Budget Activity 05, System Development and Demonstration to align the program in the correct budget activity.

Prior Years funding $14.677M was executed in PE 0207134F.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The F-15 is the most versatile fighter in the world today. The F-15C continues to provide air superiority with an undefeated and unmatched aerial combat record. The F-15E retains this air superiority capability and adds systems, such as advanced imaging and targeting systems, to meet the requirement for all-weather, deep penetration, and night / under-the-weather, air-to-surface attack. A mainstay in operations both domestic and abroad, upgrades to the F-15 (avionics, armament, airframe and engines) are critical to maintaining combat viability (lethality, survivability and supportability). Projected to remain in service past 2040, avionics modernization is key to long-term weapon system viability. This modernization is built on a foundation of technical and acquisition support studies (both internal to the Air Force and through outside contractors). The proliferation of fourth generation enemy aircraft, sophisticated "double-digit" anti-aircraft missile systems and other enemy systems pose a significant threat to F-15 survivability. The F-15 Eagle Passive Active Warning and Survivability System (EPAWSS) will replace the F-15's functionally obsolete self-defense Tactical Electronic Warfare System (TEWS) to enhance weapon system situational awareness and survivability against enemy threats. F-15 EPAWSS will also improve reliability and sustainability. F-15 EPAWSS is linked to an aircraft operational flight program update schedule that works to integrate new capabilities with the airframe. Incorporation of corresponding spiral and / or phased technology / equipment improvements that include support equipment, mission planning systems, and training device upgrades will improve performance, supportability and aircrew training.

The F-15 EPAWSS upgrade will significantly improve the F-15's capability to autonomously and automatically detect, identify and locate radio frequency (RF) threats as well as provide the ability to deny, degrade, deceive, disrupt and defeat RF and electro-optical / infrared (EO / IR) threat systems in contested and unplanned operations within highly contested environments through 2040. The F-15 EPAWSS will provide indication, type and position of ground-based RF threats as well as the indication, type and bearing of airborne threats with the situational awareness needed to avoid, engage or negate the threat. The F-15 EPAWSS will prevent RF and IR threat systems from detecting or acquiring accurate targeting information prior to threat engagement to complicate and / or negate an enemy threat targeting solution--and effectively counter enemy missiles / weapons if adversary threat systems engage and employ weapons against friendly forces--through components such as chaff, flares, decoys / angle countermeasures and jamming.    

BA7- This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Air Force Rotary Wing Avionics Development and Integration effort is a program to develop a fully integrated avionics upgrade that includes predictive terrain awareness.   This program focuses on developing and integrating technologies that will increase the situational awareness of helicopter crews in a degraded visibility environment.  A severable portion of this program is Brown Out Symbology Software &amp; Landing Guidance (BOSS-LG), which provides precision approach cues to command navigation to a landing point in adverse weather and/or reduced visibility conditions.  This total effort was initiated by the Defense Safety Oversight Council. 

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current and subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Air Force is in the process of integrating the Three Dimensional Landing Zone (3D-LZ) technology into an airworthy payload.  This payload will be integrated with existing forward looking infrared turrets to minimize additional equipment and weight on the aircraft.  Once the payload is tested, the Air Force will finalize its strategy for fleet implementation.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Guardian Angel (GA) is an Air Force non-aircraft weapon system within the overarching Battlefield Airmen Modernization program.  GA is a Family of Systems (FoS) based in both human and equipment capabilities formulated to execute Air Force Personnel Recovery (PR) across the full spectrum of military operations.  Established by the Air Force Chief of Staff in 2003 and officially captured in AFPD 10-9, the GA FoS is employed by three distinct Air Force specialties: Pararescuemen (PJ), Combat Rescue Officer (CRO), and Survival, Evasion, Resistance, Escape (SERE).  The GA FoS is comprised of nine critical mission areas:  Precision Aerial Insertion, Information Management, Force Application, Visual Augmentation, Maritime Recovery, Ground Mobility, Technical Rescue, Medical, and SERE.  GA focus is on maintaining legacy weapon system capability while modernizing/improving subsystems for better mission effectiveness.

Funds will be used to obtain significant improvements in operational capability and develop items within the GA FoS to include but not limited to:  SONAR, Maritime Recovery, Technical Recovery, Oxygen Systems, Medical Monitoring, and the Battlefield Air Operations Kit. This may be conducted through industry technology demonstrations, prototypes and associated engineering support to posture the GA program for technology insertion. The Guardian Angel weapon system development activities also include studies, analysis, requirements development and developmental testing to support both current and future program planning and execution.  Funding will deliver enhanced capability for the dismounted Guardian Angel soldier in terms of dramatic weight reduction and increased mission effectiveness across the conflict spectrum. 

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Guardian Angel (GA) program will address warfighter immediate needs to standardize, modernize, and develop additional capability for the weapon system used by Combat Rescue Officers and Pararescuemen (Phase 1). The program will also address future requirements for the weapon system that will encompass the needs of all three GA career fields (Phase 2).  

Phase 2 of the GA program is an incremental evolutionary acquisition effort in which requirements are fullfilled through further sub-system development and integration.  These are being identified through updates to the Core Function Support Plan and GA Concept of Operations by HQ Air Combat Command.  The program has been divided into two phases to more rapidly meet the user's immediate need to standardize and modernize the weapon system.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>In FY16, Project 670001, Air Force Tactical Exploitation of National Capabilities (TENCAP), Talon HATE effort will be completed.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Air Force TENCAP increases warfighter effectiveness through the exploitation of national capabilities and promotes cross-domain integration of these capabilities into military operations/training, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) activities.

AF TENCAP exploits existing air, space, cyber, national and global ISR, and Non-Traditional ISR (NTISR) for operational and tactical applications by rapidly prototyping and providing capability demonstrations.  Projects are designed to transition to warfighters and/or national intelligence agencies for operational use, sustainment and appropriate acquisition Programs of Record for further development.  AF TENCAP projects can influence the design and operation of current and future air, space, cyber, national and global ISR and NTISR while providing situational awareness to warfighters, national intelligence agency organizations and units.  

Program consists of multiple small projects supporting one of the Air Force Core Function Mission Areas (CFMAs).  Projects are executed to provide continued support to the National Warfighter, operational and Tactical Warfighter, and to Special Operations Forces.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Projects are selected based upon needs identified by the program's customers - DOD Departments, Combatant Commands, Components, MAJCOMs, and/or National Intelligence Agencies.  Many projects are executed via existing contracts maintained by other agencies; others are executed via Air Force TENCAP contracts established with vendors responding to annual Broad Agency Announcements.  The U.S. government organization sponsoring a project is responsible for assuming acquisition, deployment, logistics, sustainment and budgetary responsibilities for the developed capability after it has been successfully demonstrated by Air Force TENCAP.

AF TENCAP projects typically use an incremental acquisition strategy. AF TENCAP utilizes a disciplined systems engineering approach that allows program team to solve problems through a series of segments. Each increment has to be successful to pursue the following segment which mitigates cost and schedule risk.

Contracts funded in this program element will be awarded using competitive procedures to the maximum extent possible.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Please refer to the Performance Base Budget Overview Book for information on how Air Force resources are applied and how those resources are contributing to Air Force performance goals and most importantly, how they contribute to our mission.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Advanced Targeting Pods (ATPs) provide long-range target acquisition and expanded weapon delivery envelopes for greater aircraft survivability. ATPs feature an infrared (IR) sensor, charged coupled device television (CCD-TV), laser designator, eye-safe laser, laser spot tracker, infrared marker, and real-time video data link for connectivity with ground forces. As non-developmental items, the majority of improvements to ATPs are the result of investments made by industry Internal Research and Development (IRAD).  In addition to operational flight program (OFP) development, this funding provides for the development and integration of capabilities which are either above the capabilities of the industrial base or that require accelerated development timelines in order to meet operational requirements.  It also includes program management support, technical analysis, studies and assessments necessary to support the development and integration of future capabilities.  Data-linking is one such area where there is an identified gap between industrial capabilities and operational requirements. Additional development efforts will be structured to support the documented ATP requirements as well as urgent operational needs (UONs) as they become known.  

The FY 2017 funding request was reduced by $0.459 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The EC-130H COMPASS CALL is the USAF's wide-area, airborne Command and Control Warfare/Information Operations (C2W /IO) weapon system.  The employment of this system interdicts adversary's use of the electronic battlespace and is a key active component in the information battlespace and prosecution of Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO).  EC-130H COMPASS CALL's sophisticated electronic combat system is capable of surgical denial or disruption of adversary radio frequency (RF) communications systems and sensors.  The system was fielded in 1983 and to date has evolved through the fielding of the Baseline 2 (BL2) configuration and the mid-Baseline 2 (MBL2) enhancements.  BL2 configuration and MBL2 enhancements currently being fielded have advanced the COMPASS CALL's electronic attack capabilities significantly over the two previously fielded baselines (BL0 and BL1).  Due to the rapid advances in electronic attack technology, the EC-130H COMPASS CALL was designed to be easily modified and must continue to modernize and evolve to keep pace with adversary tactics and emerging technologies. Continuous system development is required to maintain battlespace superiority.  The two COMPASS CALL Mission Crew Simulators (CCMCS #1 and CCMCS #2) are upgraded per the Baseline schedule to ensure training capacity keeps pace and matches the operational and technological upgrades delivered in the fielded aircraft.  The Weapons System Trainer (WST) mirrors the capabilities of the fielded aircraft's cockpit avionics and communications equipment as well to ensure training requirements provide the worldwide operational proficiency needed to comply with continually evolving CNS/ATM and RNP enhancements, parameters, and guidance.

The EC-130H COMPASS CALL program employs an incremental development and fielding strategy that puts capability into the warfighter's hands as soon as practical and ensures each iteration of the weapon system is effective against the highest priority threats.  To sustain that process requires a steady stream of system development funds. Development funds are required to accomplish subsystem additions and improvements such as the digital signal analysis and exciter subsystem (AXE), the third generation of Special Purpose Emitter Array (SPEAR), new modern communications receiver technologies, new IR and counter radar technologies, the Human-to-Machine Interface (HMI), digital cockpit avionics with multi-function displays (a.k.a. glass cockpits), network centric operations, phased array transmit and receive apertures and other classified hardware, firmware and software developments necessary to counter military and commercial communications evolutions, command and control operations enhancements, and new/emerging sensor developments.  

FY 2017 RDT&amp;E efforts will concentrate support for Baseline 3(BL3)/platform upgrades to the COMPASS CALL fleet and ground systems/simulators.  The programmed BL3 upgrades will advance the primary mission equipment (PME) even further as the 2017 development efforts address the evolving electronic attack requirement for the foreseeable future.  Obsolescence and diminishing manufacturing sources (DMS)/Vanishing Vendor Items (VVI)are addressed with each baseline upgrade/enhancement as well as annually as part of the sustainment responsibilities.

Activities in the FY 2017 RDT&amp;E efforts also include studies and analysis to support both current and future program planning and execution.

Due to the rapidly changing threat environment encountered during our prolonged commitment to OCO, the acquisition program manager has the authority to redirect funding as necessary to meet current stated and emerging requirements.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development  because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Aircraft Engine Component Improvement Program (CIP) provides the only source of critical developmental engineering support for in-service Air Force engines to maintain flight safety (highest priority), correct service revealed deficiencies, improve system operational readiness (OR) and reliability &amp; maintainability (R&amp;M), reduce engine Life Cycle Cost (LCC), and sustain engines throughout their service life.  

Historically, aircraft systems change missions, tactics, and environments (including new fuels) to meet changing threats throughout their life cycle.  New technical problems can develop in the engines through actual use and Engine CIP provides the means to develop fixes for these field problems.  Engine CIP funding is driven by field events and types/maturity of engines, not by the total engine quantity.  The program starts with government acceptance of the first procurement-funded engine and continues over the engine's life, gradually decreasing to a minimum level (safety/depot repairs) sufficient to keep older inventory engines operational.  Engine CIP, through "Lead the Fleet" operational use and accelerated mission testing, identifies and fixes engine-related problems ahead of operational impacts.  Engine CIP addresses out-of-warranty usage/life and enables the Air Force to obtain additional warranties when manufacturers incorporate Engine CIP improvements into production engines.  Engine CIP ensures continued improvements in engine R&amp;M, which reduce out year support costs.  Historically, R&amp;M related Engine CIP efforts significantly reduce out year Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) and spares costs.   

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Aircraft Engine Component Improvement Program (CIP) provides the only source of critical developmental engineering support for in-service Air Force engines to maintain flight safety (highest priority), to correct service revealed deficiencies, to improve system operational readiness (OR) and reliability &amp; maintainability (R&amp;M), to reduce engine Life Cycle Cost (LCC), and to sustain engines throughout their service life. Historically, aircraft systems change missions, tactics, and environments (including new fuels) to meet changing threats throughout their lives. New technical problems can develop in the engines through actual use and Engine CIP provides the means to develop fixes for these field problems. Engine CIP funding is driven by field events and types/maturity of engines, not by the total engine quantity. The program starts with government acceptance of the first procurement-funded engine and continues over the engine's life, gradually decreasing to a minimum level (safety/depot repairs) sufficient to keep older inventory engines operational. Engine CIP, through "Lead the Fleet" operational use and accelerated mission testing, identifies and fixes engine-related problems ahead of operational impacts. Engine CIP addresses out-of-warranty usage/life and enables the Air Force to obtain additional warranties when manufacturers incorporate Engine CIP improvements into production engines. Engine CIP ensures continued improvements in engine R&amp;M, which reduce out year support costs.  Historically, R&amp;M related Engine CIP efforts significantly reduce out year Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) and spares costs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The F135 Aircraft Engine Component Improvement Program (CIP) supports F-35 single-engine fighter propulsion system.  It provides the only source of critical developmental engineering support for the F135 propulsion system.  F135 CIP maintains flight safety (highest priority), to correct service revealed deficiencies, to improve system Operational Readiness (OR) and Reliability &amp; Maintainability (R&amp;M), to reduce propulsion system Life Cycle Cost (LCC), and sustain the propulsion system throughout its service life.  Historically, aircraft systems change missions, tactics, and environment (including new fuels) and meet changing threats throughout their lives.  New technical problems can develop in the propulsion system through actual use and the F135 CIP provides the means to develop fixes for field problems.  F135 CIP funding is driven by field events and type/maturity of the propulsion system, not by the total quantity.  The program starts with government acceptance of the first procurement-funded engine and continues over the propulsion system's life, gradually decreasing to a minimum level (safety/depot repairs) sufficient to keep older inventory operational.  F135 CIP, through "Lead the Fleet" operational use and accelerated mission testing, identifies and fixes propulsion-related problems ahead of operational impacts.  F135 CIP addresses out-of-warranty usage/life and enables the Air Force to obtain additional warranties when the manufacturer incorporate F135 CIP improvements into production.  F135 CIP ensures continued improvements in R&amp;M, which reduce out year support costs.  Historically, R&amp;M related F135 CIP efforts significantly reduce out year O&amp;M and spares costs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) program provides a long range, conventional air-to-surface, autonomous, precision-guided, low-observable, standoff cruise missile compatible with fighter and bomber aircraft able to attack a variety of fixed or relocatable targets. There are two variants of the JASSM missile; JASSM baseline and JASSM Extended Range (JASSM-ER). The requirement for JASSM baseline is given in the JASSM Operational Requirements Document (ORD) dated 20
Jan 2004, and the JASSM-ER requirement is given in JASSM-ER Capability Development Document (CDD) dated 16 Apr 2010. Both JASSM missiles have improved reliability, separate milestone decision points and separate projects within a single Program Element. Aircraft integration of JASSM baseline is complete on the B-52H, F-16 (Block 50), B-1, B-2, and F-15E. Objective aircraft include the F-16 (Block 40) and F-35. Aircraft integration of JASSM-ER is complete on the B-1B. Objective aircraft are the B-52H, F16C/D (Block 50/52), B-2, F-16C/D (Blocks 25-42), F-15E, and F-35.

The FY2017 funding request was reduced by -$.658 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) program provides a long range, conventional air-to-surface, autonomous, precision-guided, low-observable, standoff cruise missile compatible with fighter and bomber aircraft able to attack a variety of fixed or relocatable targets. This project develops the baseline JASSM missile. The requirement for JASSM baseline is given in the JASSM Operational Requirements Document (ORD), dated 20 Jan 2004. Aircraft integration of the baseline JASSM is
complete on the B-52H, F-16 (Block 50), B-1, B-2, and F-15E. Objective aircraft include the F-16 (Block 40) and F-35. The government is buying the JASSM system based on a contractor-developed, government-approved System Performance Specification (SPS), this SPS is on contract. The contractor assumes total system performance responsibility (TSPR) for Lots 1-6 as defined in the SPS; for Lot 7 and beyond, the government has approval authority of Class I configuration changes.  This project also develops improvements to the JASSM and JASSM-ER fuze, including the development of the Electronic Safe and Arm Fuze (ESAF). Since the cancelation of the Common Telemetry Instrumentation Kit (C-TIK) the program has transitioned to the Intelligent Telemetry Instrumentation Kit (ITIK).  The ITIK is partially executed under this project and will be used for JASSM baseline and JASSM-ER. The program is also evaluating vulnerability enhancements, Diminishing Manufacturing Sources Material Shortages (DMSMS), and several obsolescence issues.  FY15 is the last year the JASSM program will execute under the baseline RDT&amp;E (674515) project.  The RDT&amp;E program transitions to JASSM-ER only in FY16.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides a long range (over twice the range of baseline JASSM), conventional air-to-surface, autonomous, precision-guided, low observable, standoff cruise missile compatible with fighter and bomber aircraft. The requirement for JASSM-ER is given in JASSM-ER Capability Development Document (CDD), dated 16 Apr 2010. This project developed the extended range version of the JASSM missile (JASSM-ER).  Aircraft integration of JASSM-ER is complete on the B-1B.  Objective aircraft are B-52H, F16C/D (Block 50/52), B-2, F-16C/D (Blocks 25-42), F-15E, and F-35. JASSM-ER provides the capability to attack a variety of high value fixed or relocatable targets with precision, through preplanned missions or target-of-opportunity, deeper into enemy territory than JASSM Baseline while minimizing the threat to launch aircraft. The Air Force developed JASSM-ER based on a contractor-developed, government-approved System Performance Specification (SPS).  Since the cancelation of the Common Telemetry Instrumentation Kit (C-TIK) the program has transitioned to the Intelligent Telemetry Instrumentation Kit (ITIK).  The ITIK will be used for both JASSM baseline and JASSM-ER.  The Electronic Safe and Arm Fuze (ESAF) is partially executed under this project since it's common to JASSM baseline and JASSM-ER.  The program is also evaluating vulnerability enhancements, Diminishing Manufacturing Sources Material Shortages (DMSMS), several obsolescence issues, as well as developing and integrating a Military Code (M-Code) receiver.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The Air Force is evaluating the continuing requirement for AOC WS Modifications program funding across appropriations through the FYDP for the FY18 PB.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Air and Space Operations Center Weapon System (AOC WS) program element provides development of Command and Control (C2) capabilities across the entire spectrum of air and space operations from the strategic to the tactical level.  There are four funded projects within the AOC WS program element:

AOC WS Modifications allow for the consolidation to a single baseline across the AOC WS enterprise and provide required modifications for the AOC WS to remain interoperable, certified, supportable, and compliant through the development, integration, testing, fielding, and sustainment of new capabilities and upgrades.  Modifications are required for the AOC WS to keep pace with evolving Government Off the Shelf (GOTS) components, integrated Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) components, Department of Defense (DoD) directives, and changes in the underlying Information Technology (IT) environment, as well as to deliver effective training solutions for the user.

Applications Development provides worldwide operational level C2 capabilities, which include: air battle planning, management, and execution; operational level C2 of Integrated Air and Missile Defense (C2 of IAMD); in support of DoD, Coalition Partners, and other government agencies.  

Unit Command and Control (UC2) provides both scheduling and mission preparation activities at the wing and squadron level, and the capabilities to report and track the success of each mission and influence decisions of future Air Battle Planning.   

Personnel Recovery Command and Control (PRC2) provides an adaptive, networked, decentralized and situationally-appropriate personnel recovery command and control system which supports personnel accountability and recovery missions worldwide.  PRC2 delivers a globally accessible, collaborative, interoperable and integrated system to prevent, prepare for and respond to isolating events across the Range of Military Operations in the joint/coalition operating environment.  The system collects, stores and delivers personnel/identity biometric data, emergency locator beacon registrations, isolated personnel reports, evasion plans of action, incident reports and other information management capabilities for predictive, preventive and personnel vulnerability analysis/assessment in support of Personnel Recovery across DoD and other national and international entities.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development. These budget activities include development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded, or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Air Operations Center Weapon System (AOC WS), AN/USQ-163 Falconer, the senior element of the Theater Air Control System (TACS), is the weapon system the Commander, Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR) provides the Combined/Joint Force Air Component Commander (C/JFACC) for planning, executing, and assessing theater-wide air and space operations.  The C/JFACC provides air, space and cyber support to the Combined/Joint Forces Commander (C/JFC) by coordinating, deconflicting and assessing the progress of various weapon systems to advance the C/JFC's campaign.  The AOC WS develops operations strategy and planning documents.  The weapon system also disseminates tasking orders; executes day-to-day peacetime and combat air, space and cyber operations; and provides rapid reaction to immediate situations by exercising positive control of friendly forces.

In FY17, AOC WS Modifications are required to enable the retirement of Theater Battle Management Core System Force Level (TBMCS FL) and the legacy AOC 10.1 system.  Further, AOC WS Modifications are required for the AOC to keep pace with evolving COTS/GOTS components, DoD directives, changes in the underlying IT environment, and to remain interoperable, certified, supportable, and compliant through the development, integration, testing, fielding, training, and sustainment of new capabilities and upgrades to the AOC WS.  Additionally, FY17 AOC WS Modification activities evolve the AOC through development, integration, and test of progressively improving capabilities in support of mission requirements at Geographic and Functional AOCs, as well as Support and Manpower Augmentation units, keeping the AOC current and interoperable with the Combatant Commands (CCMD), cyber requirements, and next generation weapon systems/weapons.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The acquisition strategy builds on existing capabilities using evolutionary acquisition to standardize and modify the AOC WS.  The initial capability was AOC WS Increment 10.0, which fielded the 10.0 configuration to five operational sites, plus a Help Desk and a Formal Training Unit.  The second increment, Increment 10.1, upgraded these locations to an integrated baseline and fielded the baseline to additional operational and reserve units worldwide.  The last increment, AOC 10.2, evolved the AOC to a Net-Centric environment, compliant with DoD SOA standards.  The AOC WS Modifications program builds upon these evolutionary weapon system updates to develop, integrate, test, train, deliver, and sustain new capabilities and baseline updates to the AOC WS.  The AOC WS Modifications program will leverage an AOC WS Long-Term Modification and Sustainment (LTM&amp;S) contract, projected to be awarded in 4QFY16, which will provide for government led integration of the AOC WS enterprise. The AOC WS Program Management Office (PMO) will provide technical oversight to the AOC WS Modification program, led by a Government AOC Weapon System (WS) Chief Engineer. Additionally, significant technical expertise will be provided by MITRE, MIT Lincoln Laboratory, and Engineering &amp; Technology Acquisition Support Services contractors.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>This program, BA 07 PE 0207410F, project 675218, C2AOS-C2IS Modifications (rebaselined to include efforts formerly known as C2AOS-C2IS II), is a new start.

- FY 2017 funding increased $7.848M in order to accelerate the completion of Air Execution Information System (AXIS) to enable the retirement of Theater Battle Management Core Systems Force Level (TBMCS FL)</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project funds operational development necessary to acquire and modify segments of Air Force's Command and Control (C2) capabilities and services.  Applications Development provides worldwide operational capabilities for AF C2 in support of DoD, Coalition Partners, and other government agencies.  These efforts focus on, but are not limited to, support of the Joint Forces Air Component Commander (JFACC) that provides air, space and cyber support as presented to the AOC and to other Air Force and Joint Services C2 systems.  Applications Development efforts deliver capabilities identified in the Joint Command and Control (JC2) Capability Development Document (CDD) (2013).  Applications Development activities include but are not limited to the following: Command and Control Air Operations Suite - Command and Control Information Services (C2AOS-C2IS) needs identified in the Capability Definition Package (CDP) (2012).  C2AOS-C2IS creates web-enabled information services to expose air operations data using standardized schemas, such as those developed by the Air Operations Community of Interest (AO COI).  C2AOS-C2IS also develops, matures, fields, and maintains modular net-centric C2 applications for air battle planning, execution, and management functions to include: 
Network Enabled Weapons (NEW); C2AOS-C2IS will focus on but not be limited to, the remainder of CDP and Theater Battle Management Core Systems - Force Level (TBMCS FL) functionality along with the capabilities to include applications and services to support air mission and Friendly Order of Battle (FrOB) execution, Alerting, Publish and Subscribe, Content Management and Reporting; and integration with a Joint Command and Control (JC2) Reference Architecture (RA) host infrastructure environment.

In FY17, core development activities will be to complete development of Air Execution Information System (AXIS).  Funding originally allocated to C2AOS-C2IS II was realigned internally within the program to C2AOS-C2IS Development (formerly C2AOS-C2IS I) to accelerate the AXIS program.  The acceleration of development and completion of AXIS allows for planned retirement of the legacy TBMCS FL system.  The revised fielding strategy to retire TBMCS FL all at once reduces the technical and operational complexities of incrementally deploying the applications.  AXIS encompasses the remaining TBMCS FL capability and functionality missing from the suite of C2AOS-C2IS applications.  Full retirement of TBMCS FL provides modernized and improved capability to the warfighter, resolves security issues, and reduces future sustainment costs.  Additional FY17 activities include fixing deficiencies coming out of individual developmental tests (DT), maintaining information assurance (IA) posture and ensuring integration and testing of all Capability Packages (CP).  Also, FY17 will include preparation for Request for Proposal (RFP) release and source selection of the C2AOS-C2IS Modification program.

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution, as well as future program planning.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project funds are used to develop, integrate, field, and maintain Unit Command and Control (UC2) as an evolving sequence of increasing software capabilities that support the execution of the air battle plan and the air tasking order message received from the AOC.  UC2 operations software systems meet needs identified in the TBMCS Operational Requirements Document (ORD) (2001), the UC2 Baseline Systems Requirement Document (SRD) and the UC2 SRD 1067 Appendix, by providing both the scheduling and mission preparation activities at the wing, group and squadron level, and the capabilities to report and track the success of each mission and influence decisions on future air battle planning.  UC2 is fielded to the Wing Operations Center (WOC), the Maintenance Operations Center (MOC), the Emergency Operations Center (EOC), Crisis Action Team (CAT), and many other work-centers.  UC2 requirements will be identified using the system modification request process.  

In FY17, core development activities will be to complete development of UC2 1.2 and begin development of UC2 1.3.  UC2 1.2 will provide Wing Commanders with a modernized Common Operating Picture (COP) and allow better situational awareness throughout base command and control (C2) nodes.  UC2 1.3 will allow UC2 to be accessed on mobile platforms.  Additional FY17 activities will include fixing deficiencies coming out of the associated developmental tests (DT), maintaining information assurance (IA) posture and insuring integration and testing of UC2 interfaces with other applications. 

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution, as well as future program planning.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project funds operational development necessary to acquire, modify, and sustain a segment of Air Force's C2 capabilities and services associated with Personnel Recovery.  The Personnel Recovery Command and Control (PRC2) program develops and delivers tools and services for planning, collaborating and managing search and rescue efforts, as well as disseminating related information to all personnel recovery mission coordinators across PR network.  PRC2 provides an adaptive and networked system, delivering timely situational awareness information supporting personnel accountability and recovery mission management worldwide.  PRC2 delivers a globally accessible, collaborative, interoperable and integrated set of capabilities to prevent, prepare for and respond to joint/coalition military personnel recovery activities, and civilian rescue missions.  The Joint Personnel Recovery (JPR) Initial Capability Document (ICD) (2012) articulates capabilities needed for PRC2.

The system collects, stores and delivers personnel/identity biometric data, emergency locator beacon registrations, isolated personnel reports, evasion plans of action, incident reports and other information management capabilities.  The information is used for predictive, preventive and personnel vulnerability analysis and assessment in support of Personnel Recovery across Department of Defense and other national and international entities. 

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution, as well as future program planning.

In FY17, PRMS modifications are required to develop and field PRMS 5.0 to enable the transition from the existing Web Forms implementation to a Model View Controller (MVC) implementation. This release will also address known Deficiency Reports (DR), incorporate user inputs, facilitate reducing maintenance costs to operate PRMS, updating the User Interface (UI) to a modern design , and increase overall efficiency. Additionally, FY17 PRMM modifications will Import/validate Isolated Personnel (IP) events/alerts, Import/validate Isolated Personnel (IP) events/alerts and enable case files for Defense Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office (DPMO) and Joint Personnel Recovery Agency (JPRA).

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>This program, BA 07 PE 0207412F, project 67485L, OM Mod Increment 1, is a new start.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Control and Reporting Center (CRC) program element provides for development and integration of new capabilities, upgrades, and modifications including those required to maintain capability due to replacement of diminishing manufacturing sources.  The CRC is a mobile, ground-based theater air control system (TACS) surveillance and battle management command and control (BMC2) element. It consists of facilities, equipment, and people.  It is a customizable, modular, transportable, and persistent weapon system employed at the tactical level to support air and surface operations.   The CRC projects include development of Theater Air Control Systems Improvement (TACSI) capabilities.  These efforts include, but are not limited to, the development and modification of the AN/TYQ-23A(V)1 Operations Module (OM), the AN/TRC-213/214 Remote Radio Secure Voice System (RRSVS) and the Joint Tactical Information Distribution System (JTIDS) Module (JM) Link 16 Upgrade.

AN/TYQ-23A(V)1 OM is a low density/high demand (LD/HD), rapidly deployable, ground-based C2 asset.  This automated, computer-based information system provides operators the real-time battlespace picture necessary to plan, direct, and control tactical air operations and airspace management tasks.  In order to meet warfighter requirements, incremental updates are required. For example, these improvements will add Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRnet), Mode 5 integration, improved data links, and Multiple Source Correlator Tracker upgrades. Modifications will be required to integrate with the Three Dimensional Expeditionary Long Range Radar (3DELRR).  AN/TRC-213/214 RRSVS is a voice radio and OM-interface unit. The RRSVS allows real-time, secure voice communications between aircraft and battle management C2 operators in the CRC. Everything over Internet Protocol (EoIP), which is used for external communications, Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) and Integrated Waveform will also be integrated into a future RRSVS upgrade. JM Link 16 Upgrade will provide crypto modernization and will meet the FAA mandated frequency re-mapping requirement.  

Activities also include studies and analysis supporting current and future program planning and future development of open system architecture requirements.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development. This budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The CRC program is utilizing evolutionary development to modernize and further advance current and future battlespace awareness and tactical battle management command and control capabilities. A variety of contract types will be utilized depending on type of effort. Management strategy relies on Air Force Program Executive Officer for Battle Management (AFPEO BM) as the PEO; and Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) as the Contracting Authority.   
In 4th quarter of FY 2016 the entire program including SPM responsibilities transitions to HBZ at Hill AFB, Utah.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Mission: E-3 Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) is the premier airborne platform providing Battle management (BM)/Command and Control (C2) for Commander In Chief and combatant commander tasking in joint, allied, and coalition operations, humanitarian relief, and homeland defense. AWACS provides a real-time picture of friendly, neutral, and hostile air activity. Its capabilities include all-altitude/all-weather surveillance of the battle space; early warning of enemy actions; a real-time ability to find, fix, track, and assess airborne or maritime threats; and detection, location, and identification of electronic emitters.

1. E-3 DMS Replacement of Avionics for Global Operations and Navigation (DRAGON):  DRAGON completes the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), and European Organization for the Safety of Air Navigation (EUROCONTROL) air traffic control mandated safety of flight capabilities. This program will provide the E-3 fleet with the flight instruments and other avionics for the Required Navigation Performance (RNP), and the surveillance and communication capabilities necessary to maintain continued critical unrestricted access to global airspace. Non-compliance will result in airspace restrictions and denials that will impact AWACS ability to support worldwide responses to situations requiring immediate on-scene BM/C2. DRAGON replaces the existing Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) Global Positioning System (GPS) Integrated Navigation System (GINS) with a modern Flight Management System (FMS) that will accommodate new capabilities including Mode 5 Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) and Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS). Also included as part of the modification is the addition of data link communications, voice and data link digital radios, improved visual displays, and competitive acquisition of DRAGON flight simulators. Emphasis on employment of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) avionics is expected to lower cost, reduce the tech refresh cycle, and enhance life cycle management. DRAGON will provide development of support and test equipment needed for DRAGON production; DRAGON will also provide initial DMS and Initial Contractor Support (ICS) needed to support the first US developmental test aircraft (i.e., D-1) prior to the contract award of the DRAGON production effort. The Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase of DRAGON is being executed as a Cooperative Program between the US and NATO.

2. E-3 Electronic Protection (EP):  EP will provide improved radar processing in a specific flight environment to meet a classified requirement.  Processing will initially address radar modes comprising 90% of operational AWACS radar usage.  EP will install an adjunct processor that works in parallel with the current Radar System Improvement Program (RSIP) system.  The EP-processed radar picture will appear on the battle manager's display in place of the current RSIP output when the EP radar modes are selected.  

3.  E-3 Training, Support, and Infrastructure (TSI):  TSI provides continuing management support for AWACS modernization and enhancement. These activities include managing the AWACS Development Test and Evaluation (DT&amp;E) and Production infrastructure and tracking and monitoring the AWACS vendor’s core mission and aircrew training, support equipment and program Government Furnished Property. The overall DT&amp;E test infrastructure supports development, production, and sustainment projects and maintains facilities to support AWACS aircraft during system and sub-system testing at Boeing Field, WA, Baltimore, MD, and Oklahoma City, OK.  Funding is shared between Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) and production funds.  The TSI assets also support multiple international Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&amp;C) projects on a maintenance fee basis, not limited to projects for France, Saudi Arabia, United Kingdom, Japan, and North Atlantic Treaty (NATO) AEW&amp;C efforts. Key programs include contractual management of the AWACS Avionics Integration Laboratory (AIL) integrated with the Block 40/45 Functional Group configured lab and the AWACS Radar Systems Integration Lab/Software Development Facility (SIL/SDF). These labs provide US, Foreign Military Sales (FMS), and international customers with a configured development and qualification system and subsystem environment supporting all AWACS system and radar development, production, and sustainment.  TSI efforts allow new support equipment technologies and test strategies to be analyzed to ensure concurrent capability to sustain existing, modified, and upgraded E-3 equipment. 

4. E-3 Command and Control, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C2ISR):  C2ISR system improvements investigate and develop future capabilities of the AWACS weapon system. These efforts also include but are not limited to the investigation, analysis and development to ensure that AWACS successfully integrates with joint and coalition forces in a net-centric environment. C2ISR primarily supports pre-systems acquisition in the areas of materiel solution analysis and technology development. This is accomplished by prototyping and demonstrating capabilities required by the warfighter but also includes developing an E-3 Modernization &amp; Sustainment Roadmap that projects user capability needs, as well as materiel solutions for the user needs.  C2ISR will also support an analytical comparison of the operational effectiveness, suitability, and life-cycle cost of alternative materiel solutions beyond the current AWACS that satisfy an established capability need identified in an Initial Capabilities Document (ICD).

5. E-3 Internet Protocol Enabled Communication (IPEC):  IPEC will provide the Block 40/45 E-3 with a medium-bandwidth Internet Protocol (IP) communications capability to connect to the Global Information Grid and will support net-centric operations/warfare. IPEC will provide a reliable IP-enabled communication capability to support a shortened digitized kill-chain of time-sensitive targets. The modification will provide a permanent Inmarsat-based IP-enabled communications package supporting warfighter identified requirements for increased bandwidth Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet) and multi-domain networks.  IPEC was originally planned for accomplishment as a traditional acquisition program, but due to warfighter demand, the effort has been re-classified as an Urgent Operational Need (UON). 

6. E-3 Combat Identification (CID) DMS:  AWACS' current CID capability is based upon 1960's era technology that has become unsustainable, and requires an update to retain a significant part of AWACS overall mission capability.  AWACS will address C2 CID shortfalls with a modern, persistent Airborne Moving Target Indication (AMTI) BM/C2 combat ID.  CID DMS supports the kill chain and decision superiority.  The upgrade will also provide for better integration into Block 40/45 and NGIFF equipped AWACS aircraft.

7. E-3 Communication Network Upgrade (CNU):  CNU will provide a Link 16 capability with high-jam-resistance, high-speed, crypto-secure computer-to-computer connectivity in support of every type of military platform from Air Force fighters to Navy submarines.  Current 20 year old Class 2 terminal has sustainability/DMS issues and does not support mandated Crypto Mod (CM) &amp; Freq. Remap (FR).  CNU resolves DMS issues, provides CM &amp; FR, Link 16 enhancements &amp; growth for Next Gen Tactical Data Link (TDL).  In previous budget cycle, this effort was referred to as Multifunctional Information Distribution System Joint Tactical Radio System (MIDS JTRS).

The FY 2017 funding request was reduced by $22.122M to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational Systems Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The modernization of the AWACS weapon system consists of multiple capability upgrades that are developed and fielded on an existing sole source Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract to the Boeing Corporation, Seattle, WA and Oklahoma City, OK.  Full and open competition is explored for all new efforts where market research indicates opportunities exist.

Air Force Program Executive Officer (PEO) for Battle Management (AFPEO/BM) is the PEO and Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) for all AWACS Programs, with the exception of the E-3 Block 40/45 Upgrade.  The E-3 Block 40/45 Upgrade MDA is the Secretary of the Air Force, with authority delegated to the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Acquisition) [SAF/AQ].  Of note, E-3 Block 40/45 Upgrade has completed development activities, so it has no 3600 funding and thus not otherwise referenced in this document.  Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) is the Contracting Authority for the AWACS portfolio and provides Contracts, Legal, and Comptroller Support.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Joint Terminal Control Training and Rehearsal (JTC TRS) project, under the Tactical Airborne Control System, funds development necessary to provide a Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) capable, high-fidelity simulator for Battlefield Airmen, to include Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC) operations, Special Tactics Combat Control Team (CCT) Air Traffic Control (ATC), Assault Zone operations, Guardian Angel combat rescue, and Air Support Operations Center (ASOC) operations.  

JTC TRS is essential to provide initial training, mission qualification training, continuation training, and currency control requirements to JTACs and Special Tactics personnel.  JTAC control training requirements exceed the ability of live-fly aircraft to meet, and JTC TRS is the only capability projected to enable JTACs to achieve and maintain minimum required training for both qualification and proficiency in accordance with the U.S and Partner Nation Memorandum of Agreement for JTAC certification and qualification. 

The JTC TRS Project provides research and development to facilitate interoperability with joint and sister Service air-ground simulation using industry standards.   Future JTC TRS development will provide the capability to network aircrew full mission trainers and training centers in a live-virtual-constructive network. This development effort will also integrate ASOCs with the Joint Theater Air Ground Simulation System (JTAGSS) trainer for Joint Fires integration.  The Personnel Recovery (PR) capability is envisioned to be a "plug and play" module for the host JTC TRS. The PR capability will provide Guardian Angel personnel with an immersive LVC environment to plan, train, and rehearse their employment, rescue/recovery, and combat trauma care skills.  The simulator will supplement live field training and live-fly sorties to provide realistic introductory, proficiency, currency, and upgrade training in a simulated battlefield, disaster, or humanitarian relief environment.

b. JTAGSS is a continuation of the ASOC simulation trainer initially funded in 2009 and complements the JTC TRS trainer by providing a total air-ground constructive simulation environment for integrated networked training and mission rehearsal capability that will develop JTAC/CCT and ASOC/Special Operations Forces (SOF) Command and Control (C2) battle staff skills.  JTAGSS will provide the ASOC, SOF, and TACP (Tactical Air Control Party) with the vertical and horizontal C2 communications and coordination training and mission rehearsal required for mission effectiveness.   There are insufficient exercises and live training events available to meet mandated readiness requirements.  The system will include a secure network connection, a constructive simulation environment generator with sharable databases, computer work stations that have synthetic reflex agent applications for each ASOC/SOF crew position to execute the air tasking order.  

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts for systems, fielded or approved, for production, that have been fully validated through formal Operation Utility Evaluation (OUE) and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>a.  The JTC TRS acquisition will be a single step to full capability as defined in the CPD.  A small business set-aside competitive lowest price technically acceptable source selection will be conducted and result in the award of a single contract to produce and sustain JTC TRS systems.    Pre-priced production options will also include replacement or modification, as required, of current fielded active duty immersive JTAC training systems (Air National Guard (ANG) Advanced JTAC Training System (AAJTS)) to the JTC TRS software and EME baseline.  The contract structure will allow for maintaining concurrency, implementing system improvements/technical refresh, and other modifications as required.  The JTC TRS acquisition strategy is to enter the acquisition process pre-Milestone C and obtain a decision to procure up to five Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP) at contract award.  An Operational Utility Evaluation (OUE) will be conducted in place of Operational Test and Evaluation.  Following successful OUE, a Full Rate Production (FRP) decision will be sought to authorize procurement of the remaining total planned production quantity.  Development will be required for engineering changes related to Air Traffic Control (ATC) and TACP-Close Air Support System.


b. The acquisition strategy for the JTAGSS trainer will be to field advance technology demonstration units to continue to perform proof of concept and technology validation of mission simulations for all ASOC crew positions including detailed communications planning, asset deconfliction, integration of joint fires, and other critical mission areas required for integrated TACP/ASOC C2 mission success.  At the completion of the technology validation, a contract will be competitively awarded to complete JTAGSS development, deployment and integration. Current software is Government or Commercial Off-the-Shelf technologies (GOTS/COTS) allowing almost any training technology development company to compete, which lowers technical risk, schedule risk, and cost.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Tactical Air Control Party (TACP)s are Air Force units manned by airmen who advise Army Ground Commanders and plan, request and control air power in support of army ground maneuver operations. TACPs also coordinate, request, and control airlift support and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) support for Army combat operations, and they provide ground communications support for federal disaster response and Homeland Defense operations.  TACPs deploy with their aligned Army units and operate in a variety of environments including fixed operations from tactical operations centers (TOCs), mobile operations in tactical vehicles, and dismounted (on foot) operations with Army infantry patrols.  

The purpose of the TACP-Modernization program is to upgrade TACP voice, data and video communications capabilities, upgrade targeting capabilities, and improve TACP battlefield awareness capabilities.  These capabilities are employed at all echelons of Army organizations by: Air Support Operation Centers (ASOCs), Division TACPs, Brigade TACPs, Battalion TACPs, and Joint Terminal Attack Controllers (JTACs) deployed with Army companies or scout teams on the front lines.  Improved targeting and data communications capabilities provide more accurate target coordinates, reduce close air support (CAS) response times, and reduce the probability of fratricide or collateral damage through the use of networked data communications.     

The TACP-M program provides and modernizes capabilities in three major categories/areas:(1)ASCOC/TOC Systems(used in fixed Air Support Operations Centers and Army Tactical Operations Centers),(2)Dismounted and Mobile Systems(used by JTACs during infantry operations and vehicle-mounted mobile operations), and (3) Close Air Support System (CASS) software. CASS 1.4.5 software comes in two versions: A) Dismounted version for dismounted mission operations and a B) Mounted version for ASOC, TOC, and Mobile Systems (ATM).

The Close Air Support System (CASS) software segment interfaces with all TACP-M components and provides interoperability with joint strike aircraft (F-35, A-10, F-16, F-15E, F/A-18, AV-8B, etc.), remotely piloted aircraft (RPA), artillery fire support systems, network-enabled weapons, and C2 nodes. To enable data communications with those systems / nodes, CASS incorporates several communications protocols including Variable Message Format (VMF), Link 16, Marine Tactical System (MTS), and U.S. Message Text Format (USMTF). CASS v1.4.5 will provide advanced communication, advanced targeting capability, and significant interoperability improvements for mobile computing devices used by Dismounted JTACs, for vehicle-mounted systems, and for stationary systems used in operations centers. Future upgrades necessary to maintain interoperability with strike aircraft, joint fire support systems, and emerging data networking waveforms will be guided by the TACP CASS Information System Initial Capabilities Document (IS ICD approved by the Air Force Requirement Oversight Council (AFROC), Functional Capabilities Board (FCB), and Joint Capabilities Board (JCB).

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Tactical Data Links (TDL), as a subset of the broader airborne network, are used in a combat environment to exchange information such as messages, data, radar tracks, target information, platform status, imagery, and command assignments.  TDLs provide interoperability, local and global connectivity, and situational awareness to the user when operating under rapidly changing operational conditions.  TDLs provide a jam-resistant; secure digital data transfer network capability with new and standardized waveforms and data formats allowing line-of-sight (LOS) and beyond-line- of-sight (BLOS) intra- and inter-flight communications.  TDLs increase mission effectiveness, provide positive identification of aircraft in the network, correlate on and off-board sensor data sharing, target, and threat information, and provide the datalink to accomplish time critical targeting and other mission update functions.  TDLs are used by all service theater command and control (C2) elements, weapons platforms, and sensors.

TDLs include, but are not limited to:  Link 16, Link 11, Situational Awareness Data Link (SADL), Multifunction Advanced Data Link (MADL) Variable Message Format (VMF), Integrated Broadcast Service (IBS), Intra-Flight Data Link (IFDL), and Tactical Targeting Network Technology (TTNT).  TDL efforts include incorporating changes and additions to the Link-16 message standard (MIL-STD-6016E) and applicable Interface Change Proposals (ICPs), assisting with Air Force and joint interoperability certification testing with the Air Combat Command (ACC) and Joint Interoperability Test Center (JITC); future development, integration, and verification of Operational Flight Program (OFP) upgrades due to TDL integration; support of data gathering processes; studying and incorporating data link technologies to ensure effectiveness and efficiency of the Global Strike and Global Persistent Attack CONOPS.

This effort provides critical capability and enhancements to the airborne network by creating common development, integration and interoperability among ground and C2 platforms and responds to quick reaction capability integration and demonstration including, but not limited to Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS), Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS), the Air and Space Operations Center (AOC), Global Hawk, Predator, Reaper, Rivet Joint, Combat Sent, and Cobra Ball.  TDLs keep all C2ISR platforms and data linked weapons current/interoperable in the airborne network to enable Global Strike, Global Persistent Attack, Offensive and Defensive Counterair (OCA and DCA) and Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) missions.

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution, as well as future program planning.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development.  These budget activities include development efforts to upgrade systems currently fielded or has approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Air Force Program Executive Officer for Command, Control, Communications, Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Networks (PEO C3I&amp;N) is the PEO for C2ISR TDL. PEO C3I&amp;N manages activities for the common development, integration and interoperability across the entire airborne network. These actions ensure TDLs are procured and maintained as a joint, end-to-end, command and control system. This program executes various types of contract types to provide technical expertise necessary to test, evaluate and provide recommended solutions to modernize C2 platform data links. The program delivers annual lab tested software implementations of Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) Link 16 Interface Change Proposals (ICPs). Additionally, the program participates in annual lab demonstrations that produce reports as required to assist with platform integration of Link 16 modernization efforts.

The E-3 Platform architecture utilizes a JTIDS Class 2H Link 16 radio with defined environmental and physical cabinet constraints. An Investigation Report (IR) was initiated to investigate the integration of an Ethernet enabled Concurrent Multinetting (CMN) MIDS JTRS variant into the E-3 platform. To understand the dynamics of the L-16 enhancements and facilitate integration of new Link 16 capabilities onto the E-3 platform to ensure cross-service interoperability; an IR was issued.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The mission of Deliberate and Crisis Action Planning and Execution Segments (DCAPES) is to support Joint and Air Force Adaptive Planning and Execution (APEX) needs by enabling the warfighter to rapidly respond to a Combatant Commander's (COCOM's) force requirements through the development, management, presentation, and execution of scalable packages of manpower and equipment comprising our Aerospace Expeditionary Forces (AEF). Provide real-time command, control, planning, and execution information supporting the United States Air Force (USAF) manpower, personnel, operations and logistics force presentation and execution processes while providing a single integrated data environment to project aerospace power anywhere in world. DCAPES enables force projection C2 to all missions requiring USAF presence regardless of mission type (contingency, humanitarian, disaster relief, etc.).

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>DCAPES Increment 2B provides capabilities that enable the Air Force to posture trained and equipped forces, organized in effects-based operational capability packages, to deliver effective aerospace capabilities to the Joint warfighter. Furthermore, it includes the migration of the application from four regionally fielded strategic server enclaves fielded on the Global Command and Control System – Air Force to a virtualized platform in Defense Information Systems Agency Defense Enterprise Computing Centers. Additional technical requirements planned for Increment 2B include enabling the system to support Public Key Infrastructure and Public Key enabling as well as elimination of Social Security Account Numbers as the primary key for identifying Air Force military and civilian members by replacing it with the Electronic Data Interchange Personal Identifier.  

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this Budget Activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The DCAPES program successfully awarded the DCAPES Development Task Order for a one-year Base Period and four one-year Option Periods using the NETCENTS 2 Application Services Small Business Indefinite delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. The period of performance started on 6 April 2015 and ends on 5 April 2020, given all option years are exercised. 

DCAPES is an Evolutionary Acquisition Program using an incremental development approach (DoDI 5000.02 Model 3) to develop capabilities over several increments. To support the rapid development and delivery of capabilities, DCAPES will transition from a waterfall approach used in Increment 2A to an evolutionary acquisition strategy in which capabilities are incrementally delivered in time-phased stages based on warfighter priorities and adoption of key architecture and technology requirements as a trade-off for accelerated delivery and risk reduction.

The DCAPES Program Management Office (PMO) will utilize a mix of agreements (Service Level Agreements and Memorandums) with DCAPES interface partners. A Service Level Agreement is in place with the Capabilities Integration Environment (AFLCMC/HNIZ) to conduct software development and testing. Memorandums of Agreement with Joint Interoperability Test Command, Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Command, and the 46th Test Squadron are in place and outline the test support required before fielding the system. 

The DCAPES Increment 2B requirements have been packaged into eight discreet capabilities which will be developed in multiple smaller increments. Each capability will be developed using several builds and with one or more fieldings to satisfy the approved requirements within each package.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>DCAPES Increment 2A delivered Air Force functional specific capabilities as well as technical changes necessary for the Air Force to migrate from a directly connected architectural relationship with the Joint Operations Planning and Execution System (JOPES) to one utilizing data services across the Wide Area Network (WAN).  This ‘Loose Coupling’ solution enabled DCAPES to be interoperable with JOPES and at the same time significantly reduced interoperability costs.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this Budget Activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Increment 2A used the Waterfall approach to develop functional capabilities and maintain interoperability with JOPES.  The DCAPES program successfully awarded the DCAPES Development Task Order using the NETCENTS 2 Application Services Small Business Indefinite delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. The task order, comprised of Cost Plus Fixed Fee CLINs, started on 6 April 2015 and ends on 5 April 2020, given all option years are exercised. This task order will be used to close out the Increment. 

The DCAPES Program Management Office (PMO) will utilize a mix of agreements (Service Level Agreements and Memorandums) with DCAPES interface partners. A Service Level Agreement is in place with the Capabilities Integration Environment (AFLCMC/HNIZ) to conduct software development and testing. Memorandums of Agreement with Joint Interoperability Test Command, Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Command, and the 46th Test Squadron are in place and outline the test support required before fielding the system.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Air Force operates a variety of combat aircraft that carry numerous and varied stores (munitions, missiles, fuel tanks, targeting pods, range pods, electronic countermeasures pods, etc.). Stores are carried in countless different loading combinations determined by operational and training scenarios, missions, tactics, and weapon development programs. Aircraft stores combinations change as operational plans and tactics change and as new stores are developed and fielded. Before operational, training, or test use, the Air Force must certify these configurations for safe loading, carriage, and separation (jettison and normal release), as well as verify ballistics accuracy under the user-certified carriage and employment parameters. The Air Force SEEK EAGLE program completes certification recommendations and recommended flight clearances through any combination of engineering analysis, wind tunnel testing, modeling and simulation, and ground/flight test and evaluation. The SEEK EAGLE effort encompasses eight disciplines: Fit and Function, Flutter, Loads, Stability and Control, Electromagnetic Compatibility/Interference (EMC/EMI), Separations, Ballistics, and Safe Escape.

In support of certification, the program recommends about 1000 aircraft/store combinations for flight each year with analysis and testing, requiring from weeks to years depending on the complexity. Integrated solutions for combat aircrew weapon delivery planning problems are developed and provided to combat forces via Combat Weapons Delivery Software (CWDS) and Joint Safe Escape Analysis Solution (JSEAS).  SEEK EAGLE works in coordination with the Air Force Safety Center to provide Hazards of Electromagnetic Radiation to Ordnance (HERO) analysis and certification recommendations of ordnance systems containing electro-explosive devices. The program is also responsible for inserting new and emerging technologies into the SEEK EAGLE process as well as providing resources for the sustainment of a viable Air Force aircraft/store certification capability.

SEEK EAGLE funds are currently budgeted to support certification testing and analysis for new and inventory stores including, but not limited to: Small Diameter Bomb I &amp; II (SDB), Laser Joint Direct Attack Munitions (LJDAM), Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM), Air Intercept Missile (AIM-9X), Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AIM-120D), Miniature Air-Launched Decoy (MALD), BRU-57 (Smart Bomb Rack), BRU-61 (SDB Bomb Rack), Wind Corrected Munitions Dispenser (WCMD), Sniper Targeting Pod with video data link, LITENING Targeting Pod with video data link, laser guided bombs, F-22 supersonic tank, B61 (Mod 12), penetrator warhead upgrades (BLU-111/BLU-117), practice bomb and aircraft instrumentation pod modifications.  SEEK EAGLE funds are also used to support certification of other inventory stores on Combat Air Forces (CAF) and Special Operations Command (SOCOM) aircraft, assist the F-35 JPO with subject matter expertise in the System Development and Demonstration phase (e.g., development of organic store certifications capability to support F-35 in the Production, Sustainment, and Follow-on Development phases), sustain organic F-22 store certifications capability, and to obtain non-inventory stores and store data for post-integration certification requirements.  

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development.  These budget activities include development efforts to upgrade systems currently fielded or which have approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>United States Air Force (USAF) Modeling &amp; Simulation (M&amp;S) Program Element (PE) is broken into two thrust areas:  Modeling and Simulation Foundations, and Warfighter Readiness.  It directly supports Air Force, Joint, Coalition composite training and rehearsal, concept development, and acquisition and testing through modeling and simulation development as well as the integration of these across and within Live, Virtual, and Constructive (LVC) environments.  This program focuses on support of Department of Defense (DoD) Training Transformation (T2).  It allows the authoritative portrayal of new and emerging Air Force capabilities within DoD and coalition LVC environments; as well as reciprocating capabilities within Air Force LVC environments.  

LVC environments today are used as the most cost effective and practical means to meet mission needs.  In support of the DoD T2 initiative, USAF M&amp;S program thrust areas develop and modernize models and simulations that are the constructive backbone of Air Force and joint training and rehearsal.  Once these models and simulations are developed, they are integrated across training LVC environments for use by Major and Combatant Commands.  This development and integration is imperative to ensure that air, space, and cyberspace training and mission rehearsal activities are supported with realistic, interoperable, and readily available tools, data, and services.  These, in turn, enable joint, coalition, and interagency training required to prepare forces for combat by generating the air and space picture for the Air and Space Operations Center (AOC), Joint Force Air Component Commander (JFACC), and Joint Force Commander in combat exercises; training over 100,000 personnel per year in exercises (e.g., Ulchi Freedom Guardian, Red &amp; Blue Flags, Unified Endeavor, etc).  These programs also provide the current foundational environment that enables warfighters to interact with high-fidelity tactical cockpit simulators, which replicate high demand/low density platforms that are often unavailable for training due to real-world operations; while simultaneously linking it to warfighters using their current command and control systems 1,000 miles away and the constructive simulations being run from key operational wargaming and simulation centers worldwide. 

USAF M&amp;S is integral to inter-agency Homeland Defense (HLD) exercises chartered to train combat units tasked to protect the Homeland, including the National Capital Region (exercise Amalgam Arrow); this generates equipment and manpower efficiencies by using simulations which reduce fuel consumption, aircraft wear and tear, and manpower costs.  In support of the DoD drive to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of its enterprise-wide acquisition business processes, the USAF M&amp;S Program Element develops and supports enhancements to models, simulations, tools, and the LVC infrastructure to provide for system-of-systems M&amp;S capabilities across the lifecycle, reduce developmental costs, and minimize risks. 

The FY 2017 funding request was reduced by $.929 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.  

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Modeling and Simulation Foundations (MSF) focuses on integrating foundational capabilities needed to improve the usefulness of Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) capabilities derived from the Warfighter Readiness (WR) thrust.  The efforts supporting the MSF thrust include both concept exploration and development.  

MSF provides the capability to rapidly and efficiently create realistic and accurate synthetic operational battlespaces to support the full spectrum of activities associated with concept development to acquisition and testing through composite training and mission rehearsal.   

The Air, Space, and Cyberspace Constructive Environment-Information Operations Suite (ACE-IOS) provides the authoritative representation of Air Force information operations.  ACE-IOS is comprised of models that support training and mission rehearsal for the Air Force, Joint Task Force commanders, and Combatant Commands (COCOM) battle staffs during Joint and Service exercises and experimentations.  

Simulation and Analysis Facility (SIMAF) focuses on fostering M&amp;S tools, data, and infrastructure to enable high confidence acquisition of capabilities to support the joint warfighter.  This includes Live-Virtual-Constructive (LVC) infrastructure, tools and processes supporting LVC events, and models, tools, data, simulations/stimulation to support requirements definition, systems engineering and test activities.  Activities include M&amp;S support for studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.  These efforts will enable more efficient delivery of effective capabilities to the warfighter while reducing the time and resources required for design, development, test and evaluation, maintainability and sustainment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Modeling and Simulation support to our Warfighter's Readiness is a United States Air Force (USAF) corporate imperative to ensure air, space, cyberspace training, and mission rehearsal activities are supported with realistic, interoperable, and readily available, tools, data, services and environments.  Warfighter readiness supports Department of Defense (DoD) Training Transformation (T2) and Joint National Training Capability (JNTC) along with the USAF priorities and core functions.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning, execution, and future program planning.  

It includes several complimentary programs, initiatives and areas for investment:  Warfighter and Joint Training Integration supports the Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF) directed Live, Virtual, and Constructive (LVC) integration efforts and is a critical piece to the USAF's implementation of the Strategic Plan for Transforming DoD Training.  The goal of LVC training and mission rehearsal is to prepare our warfighters for the full range of military operations and maintain the combat readiness levels required by the Combatant Commands (COCOMs).  This can only be accomplished by training and rehearsing in realistic operational environments.  These environments include live training ranges and virtual simulators enhanced with constructive entities.  Specific training and mission rehearsal events can include some or all of these simultaneously; making the ability to integrate LVC capabilities a necessity.  

The Air, Space, and Cyberspace Constructive Environment (ASCCE) is the USAF's authoritative federation of constructive training models and tools realistically representing the tactical and operational capabilities the USAF brings to the joint fight.  It includes the Air Force Modeling and Simulation Training Toolkit (AFMSTT), which provides the authoritative representation of AF and joint theater-level air and space power and is used to train Air and Space Operations Center (AOC) personnel and Combat Commanders (COCOM) battle staffs.  The primary models in the AFMSTT are the Air Warfare Simulation (AWSIM) and Air Base Simulation (ABS).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Distributed Mission Operations Center (DMOC) provides comprehensive Live, Virtual, and Constructive (LVC) simulation capabilities which prepare warfighters to conduct dominant operations in air, space, cyber, ground, and surface domains in an environment for theater-level, full spectrum combat training for Air Force/joint/coalition partners.  This reaches 31 geographically separated LVC locations across 17 time zones representing such assets as real-world weapon systems, operator-in-the-loop, and constructive or computer-driven simulations.  It is responsible for development and integration of scenarios, models, and databases and the integration of participating sites into Virtual Flag (VF) training events via numerous network connections, DMOC-developed interoperability tools, and controlled interfaces in support of Air Force, joint, and coalition warfighter readiness.  In addition, activities include Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) technology and capability studies/analyses which support both current and future program planning and execution.  

The DMOC utilizes RDT&amp;E funding for the following to enhance DMO training:

1. Distributed Mission Operations Capability/Battlespace Systems Development:  The DMOC upgrades and enhances the capabilities of various systems, tools, and simulators to incorporate ever-changing technology and emerging training requirements into DMO events such as VIRTUAL FLAG (VF), Coalition VF (CVF), etc. to enhance the quality of warfighter training.  Activities include:  a. Environment Generator development:  DMOC is in partnership with the US Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) to enhance the capabilities of the Next Generation Threat System (NGTS).  The NGTS is the primary environment generator for both Blue and Red Air in DMOC White Force; b.  DMO Tool development:  The DMOC Replay Tool facilitates a more complete mission review and debrief capability of the exercises as more sites and systems are added to events.  Future DMO Tool development includes enhancement &amp; improvement of the Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) Filter; the Tactical Air Datalink Information-J (TADIL-J) Doctor-J (Dr. J) tool to enable tactical datalinks to be communicated and translated between disparate simulator and operationally fielded (i.e. live aircraft) communication formats; and development of Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR)/Battle Damage Assessment (BDA) to improve damage state models used by intelligence analysts in exercises and develops solutions for integrating Contested Degraded Operations (geographical and communications jamming) into DMO events; and c. Simulator Enhancement:  Incorporates Mission Package standards upgrades into the Control and Reporting Center Simulation Package (CSP) to allow a real-world system to be used as a simulator when needed in DMO events.   
2. Certification &amp; Accreditation (C&amp;A) and Networthiness:  The DMOC supports requirements definition, integration test support, analysis, systems engineering support, and C&amp;A and Networthiness of core systems.  It implements requirements of Cybersecurity and is working toward the application of the Risk Management Framework and Continuous Monitoring.  Efforts include Cross-Domain Information Sharing / Multi-national Information Sharing (CDIS/MNIS) ruleset development, load sharing, and testing; accreditation work for various newly developed / updated systems such as the DMOC Replay Tool, Dr. J, DIS Filter, and the DMOC Battlespace.  

3. Distributed Training Sites &amp; Systems Integration:  DMOC integrates distributed training sites and systems into LVC DMO training events; such as, VF and CVF (four-eyes events) by resolving interoperability issues between disparate systems and networks so that all exercise participants can interact in the DMO environment.  New sites and systems are incorporated into LVC DMO events each year based on higher headquarters and Combatant Commanders (CCDRs) emerging requirements.

The FY 2017 funding request was reduced by $1.77 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Distributed Mission Operations Center (DMOC) supports AF/Joint/Coalition DMO and the Joint National Training Capability (JNTC) through the development and integration of DMO training and test events, networks, scenarios, and databases.  Due to evolving modeling &amp; simulation technology, the DMOC is an on-going, evolutionary effort to keep pace with those changes by continuously developing/upgrading DMO environment generators, systems, and tools and ensuring integration/interoperability of new systems into DMO to provide the best warfighter training possible.

DMOC has two primary contracts that manage the acquisition, development, testing, and integration of DMO standards, training, modeling and simulation, cross-domain information sharing testbed, and exercises on AF/Joint/Coalition DMO networks.

Infrastructure, Development, and Engineering (IDE) Contract:  Develops / upgrades various DMOC tools, systems and simulators that are needed to conduct DMO training events.  Develops, implements, and tests technical solutions for the integration of sites/systems into VF, CVF, and other DMO events.  The IDE contract is cost-plus-fixed-fee with multiple task orders awarded for individual projects over the course of the fiscal year. 

Command and Control Technical Support Contract (C2TSC):  Supports government by assisting with development of technical requirements for upgrades to various systems and tools that will be developed by the IDE contractor and then performs acceptance testing of the those products.  Develops requirements for site/system integration of sites/systems into  VF, CVF, and other DMO events.  C2TSC is a firm-fixed-price contract that is incrementally funded over the course of the fiscal year.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Funding supports the CSAF Title 10 wargaming efforts to test concepts, capabilities, and plans using simulation and other techniques otherwise known as wargaming. Based on the Department and Air Force direction, there is a concerted effort in these periods of fiscal pressure to reinvigorate, institutionalize, and systematize wargaming across the Department. This effort requires additional funding to increase the level of effort to most effectively pursue an innovative strategy, avoid operational and technical surprise and make best use of limited resources. The Air Force is completing its current wargaming cycles and charting a new course to better integrate and synergize the wargaming efforts in support of the new Air Force Strategy, Planning, and Programming (SP3) process. Specifically taking the current two Title 10 wargames and creating two Concept of Operations wargames, one Materiel wargame, and experiments as needed to match the SP3 process and cycles. Also represent the Air Force at other services and Joint wargames as they ramp up across the department. These efforts will make the difference between wise and unwise investment trajectories and make our forces more successful in future conflicts.

The Wargame Information Environment (WIE) is a continually evolving system that provides an array of services to game players which enables the accomplishment of game objectives. The WIE is a deployable standalone Local Area Network (LAN) with servers and laptops that host applications to support virtual battlespace collaboration, decision making, three dimensional visualizations &amp; mapping and services. Behind these applications are cutting edge technologies and database architectures from both commercial off the shelf and government developed software that assures relevance to the wargame. The modeling, simulation, and analysis applications allow participants, adjudicators, and control team members to effectively and efficiently collaborate, make decisions, present those decisions and all the wargame to executed but also documented. Allowing for findings to quickly surface during the wargame and be noted and allowing post-game analysis. These findings Inform portfolio rebalancing exercises, concept and strategy development, and very senior leader decision making. At the conclusion of the current wargaming cycle, the current version of the WIE will need major overall to match the new charter and SP3 process along with supporting greater number and more diverse wargames. 

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This will require reprograming of some hard coded, CONOPS-specifics to into broader, more generic, wargame support. Additional models and analytical tools used by other wargames will require the creation of custom interfaces to allow interaction within the WIE.
- Development and deployment of Force Tracker Request For Forces (RFF) Tool. RFF Tool will permit wargame participants to nominate, vet, and authorize the movement of forces through player selected processes. Its integration into Force Tracker makes the process transparent in a universally accessible database, eliminating errors in transposition.  It also serves as a record of participant decisions suitable for subsequent analysis.</r2:Text>

Contract support will be required because that is where the wargame specialized expertise resides. The requirements are constantly evolving and cannot be accurately defined at the outset of the contract; therefore, a cost plus fixed fee (CPFF) contract will be used. There is currently an adequate accounting system and government monitoring in place. The Air Force is aware of the increased risk but Air Force will continue to monitor the performance and cost to ensure the contractor has efficient methods and effective cost controls.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY 2017, the Mobility Air Forces Automated Flight Planning Service (MAFPS), Air Mobility Command (AMC) Transition, and Special Mission Air Combat Command, Combat Search and Rescue (SMACC CSAR) efforts within PE 0208006F, Mission Planning Systems, Project 675380, Mission Planning Systems (MPS) Modernization, were transferred to PE 0208006F, Mission Planning Systems, Project 675385, MPS Increment 5, in order to provide improved transparency for the overarching MPS Major Automated Information System (MAIS) program.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Mission planning involves the creation of a flight plan based on multiple inputs including threats, targets, terrain, weather, aircraft performance capability, and configuration. It is an essential task that must be completed prior to any fixed- or rotary wing aircraft sortie.  The planner must have the ability to plan weapon, cargo, passenger, and/or fuel delivery, calculate fuel requirements, and assess the route based on known enemy threat location and type.  Mission planners must be able to optimize and de-conflict flight routes with other aircraft; review, print, and brief the plan; download pertinent flight information to on-board aircraft avionics; and, conduct dynamic/in-flight re-planning as applicable.

The Mission Planning Systems (MPS) program is a collaborative program with the Navy to leverage technical solutions and business practices for all Department of Defense (DoD) platforms.  It provides automated mission planning tools and support for fixed- and rotary wing aircraft and guided munitions.  It replaces two closed architecture legacy mission planning systems (UNIX-based MPS (UNIX-MPS) and the PC-based Portable Flight Planning Software (PFPS)), with a single multi-service, open architecture system, frequently referred to as the Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS).  MPS will compress the mission planning cycle by providing an improved integrated planning environment, reducing the time required to respond to changing situations and urgent needs such as striking time sensitive/critical targets and conducting combat search and rescue.  MPS products have the potential to support all DoD fixed-wing and rotary wing aircraft and is shared with the selected programs in the Navy.  MPS will deliver significant benefits to command and control performance by enhancing information superiority for the warfighter and by providing unique capabilities in support of both precision engagement and dominant maneuver.

MPS Increment 5 will complete the initial migration of Air Force platforms from their legacy planning systems to the new Mission Planning System (aka the Joint Mission Planning Systems (JMPS)).  It will complete development of three efforts originally started as separate and individual projects with the MPS Modernization development effort.  Those projects are: 1) Mobility Air Forces Automated Flight Planning Service (MAFPS); 2) Air Mobility Command (AMC) Transition; and 3) Special Mission Air Combat Command, Combat Search and Rescue (SMACC CSAR).  These projects, and their associated platforms, are now included in the overarching MPS Major Automated Information Systems (MAIS) program as MPS Increment 5 to provide improved transparency and oversight.  As such, MPS Increment 5 is not a new start but a continuation of efforts previously started under the development umbrella of the MPS Modernization project.
  
In addition to the above, elements of Mission Planning Systems will be utilized to continue development of a Joint Precision Airdrop System - Mission Planning (JPADS-MP) in conjunction with the Army.  The JPADS capability provides a planning capability for DoD airdrop requirements.  It is the primary airdrop mission planning system for all ballistic airdrop missions, as well as, precision guided airdrops that are required when the mission profile or surface-to-air threat assessment warrants a high-altitude and/or standoff precision delivery.  JPADS-MP enables high-altitude, precise airdrop delivery to forward ground forces, mitigating surface-to-air threats, reducing risk of Improvised Explosive Device (IED) and insurgent attack on ground convoys.  JPADS allows the warfighter to consider weather, terrain, aircraft capabilities, threat, etc... to accurately deliver payloads to keep the warfighter supplied and in the fight.

FY17 funding will continue the MPS software development program.  It will develop pre-, post-, and in-flight mission planning capabilities for Air Force aircraft and weapons migrating from legacy mission planning systems to the Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS), as well as, continuing to provide new capabilities and updates for Air Force platforms/weapon systems that have already migrated to JMPS.  These platforms/weapon systems include, but are not limited to, the B-1, C-5, C-17, C-130, HC-130, EC-130, E-3, E-8, F-15, F-16, F-22A, KC-10, KC-46, KC-135, RC-135, HH-60, and their associated weapons (e.g. Small Diameter Bomb (SDB), Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM), Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Munitions (JASSM), etc.).  FY17 funding will also continue the development of the Mobility Air Force Automated Flight Planning Service (MAFPS) to realize fuel savings and other efficiencies.  Additionally, it will continue the development of JPADS-MP airdrop software (and other system components) to provide a precision airdrop capability for the C-17, C-130, and other selected platforms as necessary.

The FY 2017 funding request was reduced by $2.3 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

It is the primary airdrop mission planning system for all ballistic airdrop missions as well as precision guided airdrops that are required when the mission profile or surface-to-air threat assessment warrants a high-altitude and/ or standoff precision delivery.  It enables high-altitude, precise airdrop delivery to forward ground forces, while mitigating surface-to-air threats, reducing risk of exposure to Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) and insurgent attack on ground convoys.  JPADS allows the warfighter to consider weather, terrain, aircraft capabilities, threat, etc., to accurately deliver payloads to combat and other friendly forces.

The Consolidated Airdrop Tool (CAT) is the key JPADS-MP software deliverable.  It will increase the accuracy of airdrop mission planning by improving aircraft, payload, and chute specific calculations along with weather analysis visualization tools specifically adapted for airdrop.  Future initiatives are designated to achieve automation of airdrop planning and execution to reduce task saturation in the cockpit and support Air Mobility Command's (AMC) objective of moving to a two-man cockpit.  These efforts include the ability to automatically receive and use real-time winds in any location, calculation of a release point and airdrop in a single pass, the ability to conduct real-time objective area analysis to calculate probable damage estimates and execute dynamic re-tasking, the ability to conduct post-drop assessments, and the implementation of new technologies (e.g. Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) Touch Screen environment).

In addition the Air Force Research Laboratories (AFRL) led Precision Airdrop (PAD) Flagship Capability Concept (FCC) effort will transition technology for new capabilities into various CAT software release/deliverables.  The PAD FCC is also charged with updating airdrop platforms and airdrop related systems to improve accuracy across all airdrop mission types.  The following capabilities are planned for development within the JPADS-MP program:

- Wireless Gate Release System (WGRS) 
- Local Area Prediction System (LAPS)
- Airdrop Damage Estimate (ADE)
- Combination Airdrop
- Support of new map projections including polar stereographic
- Advanced Launch Acceptable Range (LAR)
- Drogues and Wireless Activation Device (WAD)
- Automation and Health Status/Monitoring
- Autonomous Guidance Unit (AGU) Data Transfer updates
- Bundle Tracking
- Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) to enable seamless data communication between devices
- Support for ParaNavSys, Dropsonde Optimization
- Transference of wind along a flight path
- Replacement of weather assimilation engine with Kalman Filter
- Implementation of new weather observation sources (i.e. Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) and RADAR sensing capabilities) for real-time weather
- Simulator and rehearsal mode for Aircraft Weapon System Trainers (WST)

FY17 funding continues CAT v5 development and testing to provide precision and conventional airdrop capabilities including, but not limited to, Airdrop Damage Estimate (ADE), Combination Airdrop, Personnel Airdrop, Unified Mission Configuration Editor, Falconview Overlays and Advanced LAR and Failure Footprints, Kalman Filter Implementation and calculation optimization, Humanitarian airdrop, and bundle tracking for AF and other services (e.g. the Army) aircraft platforms.  FY17 will also begin CAT v6.x development efforts.  

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, which includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production, and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The MPS PADS efforts are developed and fielded using a variety of contracting instruments.  Efforts to accomplish activities such as software development, systems engineering and integration, training, and support are completed using competitively awarded contracts (e.g. Cost Plus Award Fee (CPAF), Fixed Price (FP)).

Program Management Administration (PMA) contracts are awarded competitively and consist of various types of contracts at various locations.

MITRE, a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) contractor, provides technical support via a no fee for service contract.

Other efforts are accomplished using Purchase Orders (PO) and Military Interdepartmental Purchase Requests (MIPR).  As an example, a portion of funding is transferred via MIPR to the Defense Information Systems Agency’s Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DISA/DITCO) who contracts for AFLCMC/HBM at a fee.

For the efforts listed above, the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center at Hanscom AFB (AFLCMC/HB) is the Contracting Authority and provides Contracts, Legal, and Comptroller Support.  

Air Force Program Executive Officer (PEO) for Battle Management (AFPEO/BM) is the PEO and Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) for the PADS program.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>In FY 2017, the Mobility Air Forces Automated Flight Planning Service (MAFPS), Air Mobility Command (AMC) Transition, and Special Mission Air Combat Command, Combat Search and Rescue (SMACC CSAR) efforts within PE 0208006F, Mission Planning Systems, Project 675380, Mission Planning Systems (MPS) Modernization, were transferred to PE 0208006F, Mission Planning Systems, Project 675385, MPS Increment 5, in order to provide improved transparency for the overarching MPS Major Automated Information System (MAIS) program.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Mission planning involves the creation of a flight plan based on multiple inputs including threats, targets, terrain, weather, aircraft performance capability, and configuration.  It is an essential task that must be completed prior to any fixed- or rotary wing aircraft sortie.  The planner must have the ability to plan weapon, cargo, passenger, and/or fuel delivery, calculate fuel requirements, and assess the route based on known enemy threat location and type.  Mission planners must be able to optimize and de-conflict flight routes with other aircraft; review, print and brief the plan; download pertinent flight information to on-board aircraft avionics; and, conduct dynamic/in-flight re-planning as applicable.
This project focuses on modernizing MPS to support Combat Air Forces (CAF) and Mobility Air Forces (MAF), including the development, test and sustainment of Mission Planning Environments (MPEs) to support the B-1, C-5, C-17, C-130, HC-130, EC-130, E-3, E-8, F-15, F-16, F-22A, KC-10, KC-46, KC-135, RC-135, HH-60 other platforms, Framework (FW) and all Common Component (CCs) software tools for mission requirements.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.  MPS Modernization efforts are as follows:

a. CAF MPS Modernization:  These development efforts modernize CAF MPEs.  The modernization effort will provide new and improved mission planning capability for individual Operational Flight Program (OFP) requirements, such as new weapons, avionics upgrades, communications systems, etc.  The OFPs requiring MPE updates under the CAF modernization effort include, but are not limited to, B-1 (Sustainment Blocks 15, 16, 16a, 17 and 18), F-15 (Suites 7, 8, 9 and 10), F-16 Block 30 (System Capability Upgrade [SCU] 8, and 9, F-16 Block 40/50 (M6.1, M6.5, M7.1, and M7.2) and F-22 (Increments 3.2B, 3.2M, and 4.0).  CAF modernization also includes updates to mission planning capabilities supporting associated weapons including, but not limited to, Small Diameter Bomb (SDB-II), Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM) and the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM).  Finally, CAF modernization will address required improvements to CAF related JMPS MPE CCs, including Weapon Planning Software (WPS), Electronic Warfare CC (EWCC), GPS Crypto (including GPS M-code), Weather CC, etc.  CAF MPE Modernization includes, but is not limited to, the following platform efforts:

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>MPS Modernization consists of multiple capability upgrades across multiple platforms that are developed and fielded using a variety of contracting instruments.  The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center at Hanscom AFB AFLCMC/HB) competitively awarded multiple ID/IQ (Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantities) contracts for software development.  Currently there are five (5) contractors, one of which is Small Business set aside, who are qualified sources.  Each Delivery Order (DO) is competed among the five contractors.

Efforts to accomplish program activities such as software development, systems engineering and integration, training, and support are competitively awarded using a variety of contract types (e.g. Cost Plus Award Fee (CPAF), Fixed Price (FP), Fixed Price Incentive Fee (FPIF)).

Program Management Administration (PMA) contracts are awarded competitively and consist of various types of contracts at various locations.

Mitre, a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) contractor provides technical support on a no fee for service contract.

Other efforts are accomplished via Purchase Orders (PO) and Military Interdepartmental Purchase Requests (MIPR).

For the efforts listed above, the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center at Hanscom AFB (AFLCMC/HB) provides program management, contracts, legal, and financial management support.

Air Force Program Executive Officer (PEO) for Battle Management (AFPEO/HB) is the PEO and Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) for all MPS Modernization projects (with the exception of those efforts that make up MPS Increment 5 for which the Under Secretary of Defense, Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics is the MDA).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>In FY 2017, the Mobility Air Forces Automated Flight Planning Service (MAFPS), Air Mobility Command (AMC) Transition, and Special Mission Air Combat Command, Combat Search and Rescue (SMACC CSAR) efforts within PE 0208006F, Mission Planning Systems, Project 675380, Mission Planning Systems (MPS) Modernization, were transferred to PE 0208006F, Mission Planning Systems, Project 675385, MPS Increment 5, in order to provide improved transparency for the overarching MPS Major Automated Information System (MAIS) program.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>MPS Increment 5 will complete the initial migration of Air Force platforms from their legacy planning systems to the new Mission Planning System (aka the Joint Mission Planning Systems (JMPS)).  It will complete development of three efforts originally started as separate and individual projects within the MPS Modernization development effort.  Those projects are:

1) Mobility Air Forces Automated Flight Planning Service (MAFPS);
2) Air Mobility Command (AMC) Transition; and 
3) Special Mission Air Combat Command, Combat Search and Rescue (SMACC CSAR)

These projects, and their associated platforms, are now included in the overarching MPS Major Automated Information Systems (MAIS) program as MPS Increment 5 to provide improved transparency and oversight.  As such, MPS Increment 5 is not a new start but a continuation of efforts previously started under the development umbrella of the MPS Modernization project.

FY17 funding will continue software development activities for the three efforts (MAFPS, AMC Transition, and SMACC CSAR) that are being transferred from the MPS Modernization project beginning in FY17.  Specific capabilities include but are not limited to the following:
  
A.	Mobility Air Forces Automated Flight Planning Service (MAFPS):  The MAFPS component to MPS Increment 5 provides modern flight planning service compliant with current and emerging airspace and air traffic control constraints.  Central to the program is an improved route and fuel optimizer.  MAFPS replaces the legacy Advanced Computer Flight Planning (ACFP) system.  Warfighter benefits include:

- Flight planning calculations for Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC)-managed missions and AMC aircraft
- Generate, validate, and file valid ATS flight plans and meet all CNS/ATM and RVSM standards
- Produce and graphically display optimum mission routes, fuel calculations, and aerial refueling activity
- Calculate optimized fuel loads to include Cost Indexing
- Graphical user interface and capability to dynamically re-compute flight plans

B.	AMC Transition:  The AMC Transition to MPS component will migrate selected Airlift (C-5), Tanker (KC-135, KC-10) and Air Drop (C-17, C-130) platforms from their legacy PFPS mission planning systems which is sun setting in August 2018.  Additional warfighter benefits include:

- Color moving map (Digimap) Common Component
- Enhanced Air Refueling Common Component
- Aircraft FPM/TOLD/VIP Development
- CNS/ATM certified navigation avionics images

C.	Special Missions Air Combat Command (SMACC) Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR):  This development effort will migrate the CSAR community (HH-60, HC/MC-130 aircraft) from PFPS to the MPS environment.  Warfighter benefits include:

- Ability to support a spectrum of missions ranging from simple day-to-day training and proficiency flying to peacetime operational/exercise sorties
- Rapid mission planning
- Mission data transfer to the aircraft via DTD
- In flight situational awareness</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

All three efforts were previously initiated as part of the MPS Modernization effort (Project 675380).  All will be transferred into MPS Increment 5 (beginning in FY17) to provide improved transparency and oversight of MPS MAIS programs.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>No other program funding is specifically identified for MPS Increment 5.  WSC 833170, Mission Planning Systems provides financial resources to efficiently and economically procure Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) hardware for all MPS operational users (no matter which MPS software increment they are using to complete the mission planning function).  Funding for the MPS Hardware Program is identified in the Other Program Funding section of Project 675380, MPS Modernization and is not being duplicated here because it would be redundant.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>MPS Increment 5 consists of multiple capability upgrades across multiple platforms that are developed and fielded using a variety of contracting instruments.  It leverages strategies and efforts originally established under MPS Increment IV and MPS Modernization.  The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center at Hanscom AFB (AFLCMC/HB) competitively awarded multiple ID/IQ (Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantities) contracts for software development.  Currently there are 5 qualified contractors, one of which is Small Business set aside, and each Delivery Order (DO) is competed among the 5 contractors.

Efforts to accomplish program activities such as software development, systems engineering and integration, training, and support are competitively awarded using a variety of contract types (e.g. Cost Plus Award Fee (CPAF), Fixed Price (FP), Fixed Price Incentive Fee (FPIF)).

Program Management Administration (PMA) contracts are awarded competitively and consist of various types of contracts at various locations.

Mitre, a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) contractor provides technical support on a no fee for service contract.

Other efforts are accomplished via Purchase Orders (PO) and Military Interdepartmental Purchase Requests (MIPR).

For the efforts listed above, the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center at Hanscom AFB (AFLCMC/HB) provides program management, contracting, legal, and financial management support.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

O&amp;M will remain the only appropriated funding in this PE.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>US Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) plans, coordinates, integrates, synchronizes, and conducts activities to: direct the operations and defense of specified Department of Defense information networks; and prepare to, and when directed, conduct full-spectrum military cyberspace operations in order to enable actions in all domains, ensure US/Allied freedom of action in cyberspace, and deny the same to our adversaries.

USCYBERCOM develops defensive cyber strategies and capabilities to ensure force flow during campaign operations and to expand DoD OCO capabilities.  USCYBERCOM researches, develops, and tests technologies and capabilities that enable cyber forces to conduct future offensive and defensive cyber operations in support of COCOMs, to include title 10 infrastructures and cross-cutting technologies.  USCYBERCOM will also provide the resources for other COCOMs to conduct Offensive Cyber Operations/Defensive Cyber Operations (OCO/DCO) planning. An in-house integration team (Special Projects Vulnerability Assessment Team) performs research, small scale prototyping, and integration as required to support the mission. Further detail is classified and can be provided upon request.  Additionally, this team will re-tool existing offensive and defensive capabilities to satisfy immediate USCYBERCOM operational needs.  Finally, USCYBERCOM will delegate resources to the Army, Navy, and Air Force Cyber Service components to develop deconflicted offensive cyber capabilites.

Activities also include studies and analysis to support current program planning and execution.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity funds various development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The AF Offensive Cyberspace Operations (OCO) program rapidly develops operations-ready cyberspace superiority capabilities from laboratory, industry, and academia via studies, rapid prototyping, technology demonstrations, and other Research, Development, Testing and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) efforts. This program consists of a portfolio of small programs and projects called the Offensive Cyber Product Line (OCPL) that contribute to an overall Distributed Cyber Weapons Operations (DCWO) architecture. The OCPL establishes a flexible and balanced approach to the rapid acquisition of cyber operational capabilities. OCPL effectiveness comes from balancing funding into three capability areas required for effective operations: Platforms, Access and Capabilities. 

OCPL provides cyber warfare capabilities to the 24th Air Force in direct support of US Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM), AF Major Commands (MAJCOMs), unified commands, and national agencies. In accordance with AF Policy, the program office develops capabilities in the cyberspace superiority core areas.  OCPL efforts also directly support the Joint Network Attack Initial Capabilities Document (ICD), the National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations (NMS-CO), the USCYBERCOM operational directives, the latest AF Space Command (AFSPC) Offensive Cyberspace Operations System Flight Plan, and other formal requirements documents. Planned areas of development, prototyping, and technology demonstration will be used to provide warfighters access, platforms, and tools. This includes mission planning, intelligence, and Command and Control/Situational Awareness (C2SA) tools needed to attack enemy networks, telephony, Integrated Air Defense Systems (IADS), electronic warfare operations and Command and Control systems. These advancements will be used to develop and deliver cutting-edge technologies to the warfighter. This capability area leverages cyber technology investments by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the National Security Agency (NSA), Air Force Research Labs (AFRL), DOD national laboratories, and other sources. Many program activities are protected under AF Network Warfare Special Access Programs.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Offensive Cyberspace Operations program office will utilize Concept, Development, Risk Management, or Production and Deployment Plans as part of a phased approach to acquisition planning. All plans will contain sufficient information for the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) to determine readiness to enter into the applicable phase of the acquisition process. Offensive Cyberspace Operations will utilize both new and existing contractual vehicles, such as Government-Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) vehicles (Alliant, Encore II, Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement IV (SEWP IV), and General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedules and a new Cyber IDIQ contract.  The use of multiple-award contractual vehicles will provide a wide range of commercially-available products and services that should be able to meet many requirements related to Offensive Cyberspace Operations.  These multiple-award contractual vehicles have already met the statutory requirements of the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) and require that Offensive Cyber Operations provide a fair opportunity to all contract holders, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 16.505, unless an exception to fair opportunity applies.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>AF Defensive Cyberspace Operations (AF DCO) provides defensive cyber capabilities that protect the AFNET and DoD network enclaves, to include their associated computer systems, software applications and sensitive operational information against unauthorized intrusion, corruption, and/or destruction. The emphasis of the program is directed toward defensive cyberspace capabilities; computer and network systems security; damage assessment and recovery; cyber threat recognition, attribution, and mitigation; and active response methodologies in response to evolving threats and changes to cyber environment. These areas of emphasis are realized through research and development, test and acquisition in the areas of: proactive defense, defensive counter cyberspace, cyberspace intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, command and control situational awareness, persistent network operations, as well as decision support, recovery, and digital forensics.  

Firestarter utilizes cyber and Information Assurance (IA) technology investments by US Cyber Command, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the National Security Agency (NSA), Director of National Intelligence (DNI), Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA), and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to jump-start its development of solutions to existing Air Force cyber and IA requirements. This program supports AF Space Commands Cyberspace strategic direction in support of Cyber Defense which provides capabilities to 24th AF, as AF component to Cyber Command (CYBERCOM), Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), National Security Agency (NSA), and other services to ensure Global Information Grid (GIG) cyber and IA requirements are being met. Activities performed include those designed to identify, analyze, test, rapidly acquire, and integrate emerging IA and cyber technology and defensive cyberspace weapons systems and capabilities into all regions of the GIG - terrestrial, airborne, and space systems. In addition, this effort will support implementation of DoD Enterprise-wide IA &amp; Computer Network Defense (CND) Solutions Steering Group (ESSG) solutions. Current Air Force systems, such as the AFNET NIPRNet Gateways, SIPRNet Modernization program, and Host Based Security System leverage this technology to meet their information assurance and defensive cyberspace needs/requirements. 

Cyberspace Vulnerability Assessment/ Hunter Team (CVA/H) weapon system develops new capabilities to provide Air Force Cyber Command (AFCYBER) and Combatant Commanders additional mobile precision in addition to currently fielded protection capabilities to identify, pursue, and mitigate cyberspace threats.  The CVA/H weapon system performs defensive sorties world-wide via remote or on-site access.  CVA/H executes vulnerability, compliance, defense and non-technical assessments, best practice reviews, penetration testing and Hunter missions on AF and DoD networks &amp; systems.  Hunter operations characterize and then eliminate threats for the purpose of mission assurance.  The Hunter mission focuses on the capability to find, fix, track, target, engage, and assess (F2T2EA) the advanced persistent threat (APT).  This effort funds development efforts to enhance command and control situational awareness and to expand the capability of the current weapon system to meet scope and scale of the USCYBERCOM directed Cyber Protection Teams.

Cyberspace Defense Analysis (CDA) is an assessment of non-secure telecommunications to determine type and amount of sensitive and/or classified information that may have been disclosed to our adversaries and encompasses the following mission subsets: Telephony Communications, Radio Frequency (RF) Communications, E-mail Communications, Internet based Capabilities (IbC), Web Risk Assessment (WRA), and Cyber Operations Risk Assessment (CORA). CDA is the cyberspace weapon system that is used to conduct assessments during peace time and contingency operations.  CDA shows its true capability in the force protection realm and helps ensure our adversaries are not provided early warning of our plans, capabilities, or limitations.

AF Computer Emergency Response Team (AFCERT) supports the AF Cyberspace Defense (ACD) weapons system and is designed to prevent, detect, and respond to adversarial penetration into AF unclassified and classified networks.  It also provides forensic analysis if AF unclassified and classified networks are infiltrated by our adversaries.  AFCERT funding for this effort will focus on development of capability, capacity, and potential modifications to increase the utility of the ACD weapon system to the warfighter as well as testing requirements for new capabilities.
 
Activities include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.

These programs are in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This requirement supports the Cyberspace Vulnerability Assessment / Hunter Team (CVA/H) weapon system development of new capabilities to provide Air Force Cyber Command (AFCYBER) and Combatant Commanders additional mobile precision in addition to currently fielded protection capabilities to identify, pursue, and mitigate cyberspace threats.  The CVA/H weapon system performs defensive sorties world-wide via remote or on-site access.  CVA/H executes vulnerability, compliance, defense and non-technical assessments, best practice reviews, penetration testing and Hunter missions on AF and DoD networks &amp; systems.  Hunter operations characterize and then eliminate threats for the purpose of mission assurance.  The Hunter mission focuses on the capability to find, fix, track, target, engage, and assess(F2T2EA) the advanced persistent threat (APT).  This effort funds development efforts to enhance command and control situational awareness and to expand the capability of the current weapon system to meet scope and scale of the USCYBERCOM directed Cyber Protection Teams.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Cyberspace Defense Analysis (CDA) is an assessment of non-secure telecommunications to determine type and amount of sensitive and/or classified information that may have been disclosed to our adversaries and encompasses the following mission subsets: Telephony Communications, Radio Frequency (RF) Communications, E-mail Communications, Internet based Capabilities (IbC), Web Risk Assessment (WRA), and Cyber Operations Risk Assessment (CORA). CDA is the cyberspace weapon system that is used to conduct assessments during peace time and contingency operations. CDA shows its true capability in the force protection realm and helps ensure our adversaries are not provided early warning of our plans, capabilities, or limitations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Air Force Computer Emergency Response Team (AFCERT) supports the AF Cyberspace Defense weapon system and is designed to prevent, detect, and respond to adversarial penetration into AF unclassified and classified networks.  It also provides forensic analysis if AF unclassified and classified networks are infiltrated by our adversaries.  AFCERT funding for this effort will focus on development of capability, capacity, and potential modifications to increase the utility of the ACD weapon system to the warfighter as well as testing requirements for new capabilities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>
