                <r2:SummaryExplanation>The FY 2015 program is in compliance with Section 638 of Title 15 USC-Small Business Innovation Research Program and the Small Business Technology Transfer Program.  The FY 2015 program has developed, tested, and deployed integrated business tools to enhance human resource management, acquisition, and executive services business processes supporting WHS/OSD.  Funds are also used for developing and testing tools that will improve the delivery of IT services and capabilities for all WHS/OSD users.  

1.  Enterprise Information Technology Services Directorate (EITSD) IT FY 2015 $509K.
To develop, test, pilot, and deploy new integrated business tools that will enhance human resource management, acquisition, and executive services business processes that support WHS/OSD.  WHS/OSD continues to expand the Engineering, Test and Development networks for NIPR and SIPR.  The long term goal is to provide and maintain a centrally managed, "State-of-the-Art", Virtual Environment for developers throughout OSD, WHS and PFPA.

2.  Secure Mobile Computing FY 2015 $103K.
Developing better mobile classified computing and communications platforms for all customers to have secured computing at residences and at temporary and mobile locations around the world.

For FY 2016 we did not report any programs in the 0901598D8W PE, but under the new PE 0903230D8W.  

For FY 2017 we reported all funding in the newly established PE 0903235D8W.</r2:SummaryExplanation>
