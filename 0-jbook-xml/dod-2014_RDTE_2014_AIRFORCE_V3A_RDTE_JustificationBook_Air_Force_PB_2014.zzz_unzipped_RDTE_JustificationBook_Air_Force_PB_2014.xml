                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a space based positioning, navigation and timing distribution system, which operates through weather and electromagnetic environments (jamming, spoofing, etc.). GPS supports both civil and military users in air, space, sea and land operations.  GPS is a satellite-based radio navigation system that serves military and civil users worldwide.  GPS users process satellite signals to determine accurate position, velocity and time.  GPS must comply with 10 United States Code (USC) sec 2281 which requires that the Secretary of Defense ensures the continued sustainment and operation of GPS for military and civilian purposes and 51 USC sec 50112, which requires that GPS complies with certain standards and facilitates international cooperation. 

This Program Element (PE) funds the Research &amp; Development for the GPS next generation operational control system (OCX) and the GPS Enterprise Integrator.  This includes the advanced concept development, systems analysis, modernized control segment development, training simulators, integrated logistics support products, and developmental test resources, and systems engineering required to meet the government's obligations to the international, military and civil communities, and system requirements verification.  OCX acquisition was established to 1) provide command and control of legacy and GPS III satellites, 2) incorporate situational awareness to support Navigation Warfare and signal monitoring, and 3) enable mission capability upgrades to support warfighter effects-based approach to operations.  GPS Enterprise Integrator is responsible for architecture and system definition (the analysis and definition, management, maintenance, and evolution of the GPS Enterprise requirements and interface technical documents) as well as for the planning, execution, and fielding of the Enterprise.

OCX funds will support efforts such as engineering studies and analyses, architectural engineering studies, trade studies, technology needs forecasting, modernization initiatives, systems engineering, system development, test and evaluation efforts and mission operations in support of upgrades and product improvements for military and civil applications necessary to support efforts to protect U.S. military and allies' use of GPS.  Additionally, funds will ensure efforts to meet current and future Joint Requirements Oversight Council approved required capabilities. 

GPS supports both military and civil users in air, space, sea and land operations. The GPS Enterprise consists of Space, Ground Control, Nuclear Detonation Detection System (NDS) and User Equipment Segments. The government is responsible for the integration of the GPS Segments such that they provide worldwide GPS capability to support the warfighter and over a billion national security, civil, allied, and commercial GPS users. The GPS Enterprise Integrator project includes the efforts associated with the Government's prime contract tasks necessary to accomplish this critical integrating function with the entire GPS user community. The Enterprise Integrator maintains the GPS current architecture and system definition, controls and validates interfaces, ensures compatibility of Generation II and III systems, and develops/manages plans for execution and fielding of the GPS Enterprise.  Further, the Integrator provides modeling, simulation and technical analyses of impacts for Government-directed enterprise-level trades among the GPS segments leading to definition, management, maintenance, and evolution of the GPS Enterprise requirements and interface technical documents to build and ensure the integrity of the enterprise technical baseline, and perform system requirements verification. 

 In addition, the GPS Enterprise Integrator project funds the technical evolution, risk reduction, enterprise-level testing and delivery of all GPS Enterprise capabilities.  Examples for Generation II include electronic protection and additional civil signals; for Generation III, additional anti-jamming protection.  To accomplish this, the GPS Enterprise Integrator delivers Test and Verification capabilities, Requirements and Interface Management, and Systems Integration support across the Space, Control, and User Segments.  In this capacity, the Enterprise Integrator is responsible for managing this cross-program work to provide these and other capabilities.   GPS Enterprise Integrator's analyses guide government decisions to ensure efficient and effective synchronization and execution across all Generation II and III GPS programs.  For Enterprise-wide integration to be successful, the Integrator: works with the GPS and NDS prime contractor teams to develop plans for early risk reduction System Integration Demonstrations to ensure system interfaces and functionality meet user and system requirements; ensures all equipment and documentation is ready when needed; integrates and analyzes enterprise schedules, conducts formal test and verification, including Requirement Verification Plans; and System Test Plans and Procedures. GPS Enterprise Integrator performs all these efforts across all GPS programs in all acquisition phases. The government owns the Enterprise system requirements and integration, and highly leverages the Enterprise Integrator team to eliminate the need to fund a development prime contractor to perform these functions. This enhances the government control, oversight and program accountability.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a space based positioning, navigation and timing distribution system, which operates through weather and electromagnetic environments (jamming, spoofing, etc.).  This project funds the research and development for the GPS next generation operational control system (OCX). This includes, but is not limited to, advanced concept development, systems engineering and analysis, modernized control segment development, training simulators, integrated logistics support products, and developmental test resources.  

The OCX acquisition was established to accomplish the following three objectives: 1) provide command and control of legacy and GPS III satellites, 2) incorporate situational awareness to support Navigation warfare and signal monitoring, and 3) enable mission capability upgrades to support warfighter effects-based approach to operations.  OCX funds will support efforts such as engineering studies and analyses, architectural engineering studies, trade studies, technology needs forecasting, systems engineering, system development, test and evaluation efforts and mission operations in support of upgrades and product improvements for military and civil applications necessary to support efforts to protect U.S. military and allies' use of GPS.  Additionally, funds will ensure efforts to meet current and future Joint Requirements Oversight Council approved required capabilities. Funds will support technology development and systems development efforts.  

OCX Block 0 is the GPS satellite command and control system intended to conduct Launch and Early Orbit (LEO) operations and the checkout of all GPS III satellites.  OCX Block 0 is a subset of OCX Block 1.

OCX Block 1 fields the operational capability to control all legacy satellites and signals (L1C/A, L1P(Y), L2P(Y)) as well as the GPS III satellites and the L2C and L5 signals.  It also fully meets information assurance/cyber defense requirements.

OCX Block 2 fields the operational capability to control L1M and L2M (M-Code), and L1C signals.  

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that were fielded or received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Air Force is pursuing a "Block" approach to the next generation GPS control segment (OCX) to rapidly respond to warfighter capability requirements.  The Block acquisition strategy approach follows the "Back to Basics" space program acquisition philosophy which focuses on mission success and on-time delivery.  Additionally, the strategy calls for capability (i.e. better signal maintainability (Digital Waveform Generation (DWG)), Unified S-Band (USB), Search and Rescue (SAR) GPS, and near-real time C2) on-ramps for the follow on contract for GPS III SVs 09 and beyond which will require updates to the OCX ground segment.  This will ensure enterprise synchronization across space and ground segments.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a space based positioning, navigation and timing distribution system, which operates through weather and electromagnetic environments (jamming, spoofing, etc.).   GPS supports both civil and military users in air, space, sea and land operations. GPS provides a worldwide capability that supports over a million warfighters and over a billion national security, civil, allied, and commercial GPS users.  The GPS Enterprise consists of four segments: Space, Ground Control, Nuclear Detonation Detection System (NDS) and User Equipment Segments.  Each segment has prime contracts to provide specific segment products (eg. spacecraft, master control system, receivers &amp; antennas). The government, not a development contractor, is responsible for the integration of the GPS Segments and relies upon GPS Enterprise Integrator contracts to supply specific expertise and sufficient resources to successfully allocate the segment requirements, integrate the segment products, and verify that system requirements are met. 

The GPS Enterprise Integration project includes the efforts of the FFRDC and SE&amp;I contract tasks necessary to accomplish this critical integrating function. The Enterprise Integration maintains the GPS current architecture and system definition, controls and validates interfaces, ensures compatibility of previous, current, and future GPS segment products (Generation II and III systems), and develops/manages plans for execution and fielding of the GPS Enterprise.  Further, the Integrator provides modeling, simulation and technical analyses of impacts for Government-directed enterprise level trades among the GPS segments leading to definition, management, maintenance, and evolution of the GPS Enterprise requirements and interface technical documents to build and ensure the integrity of the enterprise technical baseline.  

In addition, the GPS Enterprise Integration project funds the technical evolution, risk reduction, enterprise-level testing and delivery of all GPS Enterprise capabilities.  Examples for Generation II include electronic protection and additional civil signals; for Generation III, additional anti-jamming protection.  To accomplish this, the GPS Enterprise Integrator delivers Test and Verification capabilities, Requirements and Interface Management, and Systems Integration support across the Space, Control and User Segments.  In this capacity, the Enterprise Integrator is responsible for managing this cross-program work to provide these and other capabilities.   GPS Enterprise Integrator's analyses guide government decisions to ensure efficient and effective synchronization and execution across all Generation II and III GPS programs.  For Enterprise-wide integration to be successful, the Integrator: works with the GPS and NDS prime contractor teams to develop plans for early risk reduction System Integration Demonstrations to ensure system interfaces and functionality meet user and system requirements; ensures all equipment and documentation is ready when needed; integrates and analyzes enterprise schedules, conducts formal test and verification, including Requirement Verification Plans; and System Test Plans and Procedures. GPS Enterprise Integrator performs all these efforts across all GPS programs in all acquisition phases. The government owns the Enterprise system requirements and integration, and highly leverages the Enterprise Integrator team to eliminate the need to fund a development prime contractor to perform these functions. This enhances the government control, oversight and program accountability.


This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to support operational systems.

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>In accordance with a "back to basics" acquisition approach and exercise of strong oversight of development contractors, the Air Force will exercise complete ownership of the architecture, system definition, and integration of the GPS space, ground, and user segments.  This complex inter-segment integration is tradtionally performed by a prime contractor under a systems development contract.  To elminiate the need to fund a development prime contractor to perform these functions, the government leverages systems engineering and integration expertise from both Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) contractors and a Systems Engineering &amp; Integration (SE&amp;I) contractor.  GPS Enterprise Integrator function of the SE&amp;I contractor is currently funded within this Program Element (PE) for the Next Generation Operational Control System (OCX).  SE&amp;I services were procured in 2007 through a full and open competition.  GPS Enterprise Integrator function is now being tracked as a separate Project (67A025) within this PE.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Beginning in FY14, PE 0604445F funds the development and fielding of prototype units of the Stateside Affordable Radar System (STARS) which will improve the existing air surveillance capabilities for homeland defense. Initial efforts will focus upon improving the quality of air surveillance in the airspace surrounding the National Capitol Region (NCR) as well as integration into existing NORAD/NORTHCOM command and control systems and the NCR Integrated Air Defense System (NCR-IADS). Additional details about the capabilities of STARS are classified.

FY14 activities include, but not limited to, establishment of an Air Force program office, integration of the Air Force development team into the Army development team to facilitate transfer of STARS to the Air Force. In addition, FY14 activities will include development of acquisition documentation to establish STARS as a program of record. 

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development. 
However, this reflects an incorrect database. This program should be in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment.

This program should be in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>AF-IPPS will be a web enabled, Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS)-based solution aligning with the Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF) "3 to 1" (Regular Air Force [RegAF], Air National Guard [ANG], and Air Force Reserve [AFRes]) initiative dated October 15, 2010 that will integrate many existing personnel and pay processes into one self-service system. The system represents the AF commitment to modernizing business practices and providing enhanced support for today's service members and their families. AF-IPPS will align with Department of Defense (DoD) data standards for personnel, pay, and accounting, including the Common Human Resource Information Standards (CHRIS), which will ensure compliance with the Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA).  AF-IPPS will provide Enterprise Information Web (EIW) services.  The AF-IPPS program will be bound by using the BEA "Hire-to-Retire" (H2R) construct.  

The purpose of AF-IPPS is to provide the AF with a sustainable, cost-effective, auditable and regulatory compliant method of effectively capturing and maintaining personnel information so that Service members are paid accurately and on-time without requiring repetitive action or onerous paperwork, while allowing commanders/managers to easily access pertinent information.

The goal of AF-IPPS is to fully integrate personnel and pay management for the AF's Total Force (RegAF, ANG, and AFRes).  The future state will be characterized by streamlined, Total Force business processes; efficient and accurate management of pay entitlements; auditable financial statements with regard to military pay; improved access to accurate and timely personnel data for authorized users; and a modernized IT systems environment that is cost-effective and can adapt to future needs.

AF-IPPS's customers include approximately 507,000 AF Service members across all components (330,000 RegAF, 107,000 ANG, and 70,000 AFRes) as well as thousands of military leaders of different ranks, specialties, and career fields who are responsible for the conduct of AF operations that rely on these services to ensure Service members with the appropriate skill sets are deployed where needed at home and on the battlefield.  Congress, the rest of the DoD, and other federal agencies all rely on accurate AF Human Resources (HR) data to make key decisions that affect how the US military is organized, funded, deployed, and maintained.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>AF-IPPS's acquisition strategy comprises a multiple release/multiple contract strategy.  The Government will conduct a Full and Open Competition (trade-off) to award contracts to deliver the integrated personnel and pay system for the military Total Force (i.e., RegAF, ANG, and AFRes).

The initial AF-IPPS contract includes the effort to blueprint for all releases with an option to develop, integrate, test, train, deploy, and sustain Release 1 (Leave).  Development, integration, testing, training, deployment, and sustainment of subsequent releases will be competed.  The primary contract type will be Fixed Price Incentive Firm (FPIF).  Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF) and Firm Fixed Price (FFP) will be used for the smaller portions of the contract, as appropriate.

Air Force Program Executive Officer for Business and Enterprise Systems (AFPEO BES) is the PEO for AF-IPPS.  Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) is the Contracting Authority for the AF-IPPS Program and provides Contracts, Legal, and Comptroller support.  The Office of the Secretary of Defense Deputy Change Management Officer [OSD(DCMO)] is the program's Milestone Decision Authority (MDA).

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Air Force is the DoD Anti-Tamper Executive Agent (ATEA).  The ATEA is responsible for developing and  implementing Anti-Tamper (AT) policy, coordinating and providing financial support for AT technology development and evaluations, hardware/software vulnerability assessments, laboratory infrastructure, establishing and maintaining a data bank/library of Anti-Tamper technologies, providing proper security mechanisms, and conducting effective validation and verification of  AT implementations.  The purpose of AT is to protect critical program information in U.S. weapon systems that may be sold to foreign governments or that could possibly fall into enemy hands.  AT protections will permit the U.S. to preserve its technological advantage of critical weapons systems while supporting the warfighter?s mission requirements.  Furthermore, AT will add longevity to DoD critical technologies by deterring efforts to reverse engineer or develop weapon countermeasures against a system or system component. 
  
The DoD ATEA will coordinate technology development and enhancement efforts among the DoD Services/Agencies, National Laboratories, and industry.  The DoD ATEA acquisition strategy is to fund development of new AT technology, as well as enhancing existing AT technology efforts to increase the technology readiness level (TRL).  The AT technology development and enhancement efforts will occur in multiple areas, including the following:  Advanced sensor hardware, secure processing, crypto-analysis, tamper penalties, and power solutions.  Emerging research in the areas of materials, cryptography and electronic circuits has the potential to bring new AT capabilities that have reduced power needs and smaller form factor.  The goal of the research is to mature promising technologies to the point that they can be transitioned to a program office or industry for implementation in our weapons systems.  Priorities will be given to those technologies that most benefit the DoD AT community.

All DoD acquisition programs, Foreign Military Sales, and Direct Commercial Sales with critical program information (CPI) and/or resident-critical program information (R-CPI) require a validated AT Plan. The AT program includes resources required for the subject matter experts (SMEs) to review AT Plans and conduct AT validation, and perform AT assessments of both commercial off the shelf and government of the shelf products.  To maintain its advantage, the AT program continues to improve its AT hardware/software assessment capabilities.   These capabilities include the acquisition of specialized equipment, maintenance and/or renovations to support the integration of this equipment, and modifications to new and/or existing laboratory facilities to meet equipment and security requirements.

This program is in Budget Activity 07, Operational System Development, because it includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Air Force is the DoD Anti-Tamper Executive Agent (ATEA).  The ATEA is responsible for developing and  implementing Anti-Tamper (AT) policy, coordinating and providing financial support for AT technology development and evaluations, hardware/software vulnerability assessments, laboratory infrastructure, establishing and maintaining a data bank/library of Anti-Tamper technologies, providing proper security mechanisms, and conducting effective validation and verification of  AT implementations.  The purpose of AT is to protect critical program information in U.S. weapon systems that may be sold to foreign governments or that could possibly fall into enemy hands.  AT protections will permit the U.S. to preserve its technological advantage of critical weapons systems while supporting the warfighter?s mission requirements.  Furthermore, AT will add longevity to DoD critical technologies by deterring efforts to reverse engineer or develop weapon countermeasures against a system or system component. 
  
The DoD ATEA will coordinate technology development and enhancement efforts among the DoD Services/Agencies, National Laboratories, and industry.  The DoD ATEA acquisition strategy is to fund development of new AT technology, as well as enhancing existing AT technology efforts to increase the technology readiness level (TRL).  The AT technology development and enhancement efforts will occur in multiple areas, including the following:  Advanced sensor hardware, secure processing, crypto-analysis, tamper penalties, and power solutions.  Emerging research in the areas of materials, cryptography and electronic circuits has the potential to bring new AT capabilities that have reduced power needs and smaller form factor.  The goal of the research is to mature promising technologies to the point that they can be transitioned to a program office or industry for implementation in our weapons systems.  Priorities will be given to those technologies that most benefit the DoD AT community.

All DoD acquisition programs, Foreign Military Sales, and Direct Commercial Sales with critical program information (CPI) and/or resident-critical program information (R-CPI) require a validated AT Plan. The AT program includes resources required for the subject matter experts (SMEs) to review AT Plans and conduct AT validation, and perform AT assessments of both commercial off the shelf and government of the shelf products.  To maintain its advantage, the AT program continues to improve its AT hardware/software assessment capabilities.   These capabilities include the acquisition of specialized equipment, maintenance and/or renovations to support the integration of this equipment, and modifications to new and/or existing laboratory facilities to meet equipment and security requirements.

This program is in Budget Activity 07, Operational System Development, because it includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>B-52 MODERNIZATION PROGRAMS
Prior to FY13, all B-52 modernization programs were funded in a single BPAC, 675039 B-52 Modernization.  B-52 modernization is a comprehensive program to ensure B-52 viability to perform current and future wartime missions to include datalinks, navigation, sensors, weapons, and electronic warfare (EW) and training capabilities.  B-52 modernization (initiated in FY 2005) integrates and adds both tactical and global datalink communications for real time command and control, targeting, and intelligence.  It upgrades antiquated air traffic management (ATM) systems with those supported by three key functions using satellite technology:  Communications, Navigation and Surveillance (CNS).  Modernization upgrades training devices to support aircrew and maintenance training with the latest B-52 capability.  In addition, modernization improves conventional warfare capability with additional MIL-STD-1760 smart weapons and improved weapons carriage and fully integrates advanced targeting pods with the offensive avionics system.  B-52 modernization upgrades or replaces legacy defensive EW systems to include the radar warning receiver, jammers, chaff and flare dispensers and situational awareness displays as well as integration of offensive EW such as the Miniature Air-Launched Decoy (MALD) and MALD-Jammer (MALD-J).   

CONECT 
The B-52 Combat Network Communications Technology (CONECT) acquisition program supports nuclear and conventional operations by upgrading the B-52 fleet with tactical datalink and voice communications capabilities along with improved threat and situational awareness to support participation in network centric operations. The CONECT upgrade includes new multi-functional color displays (MFCDs) and a digital interphone system, which will survive and function through the nuclear environment to enhance crew interaction and situational awareness. To enable net centric operations, the CONECT upgrade integrates the following systems: on-board client/server architecture supporting distributed processing with independent control functions, UHF Beyond Line-Of-Sight (BLOS) Joint Range Extension (JRE) capability via ARC-210 Warrior radio to exchange J-Series messaging within theater, Intelligence Broadcast Receiver (IBR), limited Internet Protocol (IP)-based UHF BLOS link supporting e-mail and file transfers, and Improved Data Modem (IDM)-based digital Variable Message Format (VMF) datalink to significantly enhance close air support (CAS) missions. This integrated suite will provide the B-52 fleet with a machine-to-machine data transfer capability supporting aircraft re-tasking and re-targeting of Conventional Air Launched Cruise Missile (CALCM), Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile/JASSM-Extended Range (JASSM/JASSM-ER), and other J-series weapons across the range of B-52 military operations and missions. 

In the FY13PB, the CONECT program was restructured to only replace the current Multi-Function Displays (MFDs) located at each of the crew stations, make the temporary Evolutionary Data Link (EDL) modification permanent, and demod of the CONECT test aircraft as required.   However, the original CONECT development effort, as laid out in FY12, will be completed as planned and the technical design/baseline is being maintained in support of the FY14 POM decision to reinstate the program.

For FY14, the FY13 decision to restructure the CONECT program was reversed.  The Air Force FY14 PB submission funds the completion of the full CONECT capability development, updates due to Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Materiel Sources (DMSMS) issues, changes to incorporate updates to GFP, recurring changes to B-52 Software baseline, CONECT capability inclusion into the required B-52 training systems, and production/installation/initial support for a total 30 CONECT capable (2 kits were funded in EMD) aircraft.  The test aircraft will not be de-modified from its CONECT configuration.

TRAINERS AND UPGRADES FOR CONECT
In order to maintain currency with the latest aircraft configuration, the CONECT program will update existing trainers or use computer-based training to add CONECT functionality to meet user-training requirements and establish a system integration laboratory (SIL) for updates of the Weapon System Trainers (WST).   


MIL-STD 1760 IWBU
The MIL-STD 1760 Internal Weapons Bay Upgrade (IWBU) program modifies hardware and software for seventy-six (76) B-52H aircraft.  It also modifies hardware for the Common Strategic Rotary Launchers (CSRL).  The 1760 IWBU program is segmented into two increments.  Increment 1 consists of two sub-increments: 1.1 and 1.2.  

Increment 1.1 provides capability for internal carriage of eight Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM) smart weapons on a rotary launcher. Excess Nuclear CSRLs will be converted to Conventional Rotary Launchers (CRL). 
 
CRL Hardware modification: Consists of Group A equipment racks and electrical wiring, Group B consists of one Integrated Weapons Interface Unit (IWIU) per CRL, this Line Replaceable Unit (LRU) was previously developed under the Advanced Weapons Integration (AWI) program and work previous accomplished for a 2005 demonstration or developed using 2006 and 2007 Congressional Add funding. CRLs will lose their nuclear capability until integration of the Mil-STD 1760 System II nuclear munitions and development and integration of a nuclear hardened IWIU.  No new Nuclear CSRLs are required. 

Aircraft Software modification: Consists of modifying existing aircraft, JDAM Software and ground based Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS).
     
Increment 1.2 provides capability for internal carriage of eight Joint Air to Surface Standoff Missiles-Extended Range (JASSM-ER) or eight Miniature Air Launched Decoys (MALD).  Internal capabilities include authorized munition variants, for example, JDAM, GBU-31 (v)1, (v)3, GBU-38, JASSM, and MALD-Jammer (MALD-J).
 
Common Rotary Launcher(CRL) Hardware modification: Consists of modifying the Increment 1.1 configuration by adding four Group B LRUs, (three power supplies, one junction box) and Group A associated interface wiring.
 
Seventy-six (76) Aircraft Hardware modification: Consists of Group A wiring and circuit breakers to supply additional power to the CRL.  Aircraft Software modification: Includes modifying existing JASSM-ER, MALD software.

Support Equipment:  Thirty-eight (38) Multi-Use System Tester Armament Next Generation (MUSTANG) testers will be modified to support both increments.

Increment 2 will provide carriage expansion of the CRL through a software and hardware modification and will increase the number of weapon stations from 8 to 16 to support 500 lb class munitions. This will occur after increment one completes. 

 
Mode S/5 IFF 
Mode S/5 Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) is part of the Communication Navigation Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) effort and will develop and integrate modern technolog into the B-52 to enable it to operate in the evolving air traffic environment.  This effort is driven by International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) mandates to comply with performance standards to allow the B-52 to operate safely in controlled airspace.  This program will also yield significant savings by allowing the use of more efficient flight routes and altitudes.

CNS/ATM
Capabilities identified under CNS/ATM activities will include Frequency Management (FM) immunity, digital communications (voice and data), improved navigation accuracy such as Required Navigation Performance (RNP) or Global Positioning System (GPS) enhancements, Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM), enhanced situational awareness such as Mode S/5 IFF, Communications Management Unit, HF Data Link, Auto Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B), and any follow-activities to associated components/systems resulting from modifications to CNS/ATM systems.

Anti-Skid Replacement
Anti-Skid system is used to maintain control of aircraft during landings and taxi operations.  The B-52 Anti-Skid system prevents aircraft skidding by sensing the exact amount of brake pressure needed for safe braking under all runway conditions without tire damage.  Previous B-52 Anti-Skid supportabilty analysis, completed in 2006 by General Atomics, indicated a supportability end date of 2011, based on parts obsolescence, a lack of test equipment and a lack of repair personnel.  Parts obsolescence continues to be a major supportability factor.  However, since the previous analysis, test equipment and new depot maintenance procedures to refurbish previously failed Anti-Skid Detectors have been put in place in order to provide spares until 2015 when the replacement will be availabale.  The Anti-Skid Replacement program develops and installs a new system.  This effort includes an upgrade of the maintenance trainers.

B-52 EHF 
The B-52 Extremely High Frequency (EHF) program integrates and installs the B-52 fleet with the equipment needed to provide secure, survivable two-way EHF SATCOM link for Emergency Action Messages (EAMs) and report-backs to meet Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) nuclear protected Information Exchange Requirements (IERs). The B-52 EHF will install/integrate the Family of Advanced Beyond-Line-of-Sight (BLOS) Terminal (FAB-T) Airborne Wideband Terminal system developed and procured by Space and Missile Center (SMC) through PE 0303601F or other equivalent terminals/solutions, as necessary to meet user requirements.  The B-52 EHF will also integrate a high data rate BLOS communication link supporting IP-based Global Information Grid (GIG) interoperability into the B-52 architecture. The B-52 EHF program is planned to be accomplished in two increments. Increment 1 preserves the existing B-52 capability to receive EAMs and report-backs via SATCOM to include an Environmental Control System (ECS) modification required to support the additional communication equipment.  Increment 2 provides GIG and net-ready capability as well as full integration with other-B-52 systems.

The B-52 EHF program was terminated in the FY13 PB.
 

SR2  
The B-52 Strategic Radar Replacement (SR2) program replaces the current AN/APQ-166 Strategic Radar fielded in the 1960s and then upgraded in the 1970s and 1980s.  Although modified several times, it has never been totally replaced and several parts of the system remain from the original design, such as the antenna reflector, feed, and casting.  Although sustainable through the current service life of the B-52, the legacy radar system MTBF continues to degrade and sustainment costs are expected to significantly increase after 2017. The SR2 program is a radar replacement program that may take advantage of the advanced capabilities of modern non-developmental radars, maximizing commonality with other platforms.  The B-52 SR2 Program will integrate, test, and field a modern radar system, which supports all weather targeting and navigation to support the requirements of keeping the B-52 combat capable for its extended service life.  Additionally, the remaining two legacy MFDs will be upgraded to take advantage of the replacement radar's full capability.

The B-52 SR2 program was terminated in the FY13 PB.


Reconstitution of B-52 Nuclear Capability Study/Electromagnetic Pulse Test (EMP)
Renewed emphasis of the Air Force Nuclear Mission and the pivotal role the B-52 capabilities play into that role require a study be completed to ensure the platform maintains an enhanced level of readiness.  The study wlll evaluate the nuclear hardening of the platform and ensure the survivability of existing Global Strike Weapons.  Tasks include development of a plan required for full-scale EMP test of the B-52's nuclear mission essential systems.

ENGINEERING STUDIES &amp; ANALYSIS AND TEST &amp; EVALUATION  
B-52 modernization funds test activities at the Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC), engineering and planning studies for potential future weapon system enhancements (weapons, sensors, avionics and EW) and emerging requirement on current programs, upgrades to the B-52 SIL, AISF and WSTs, and weapon system operational/safety, supportability, reliability, and Total Ownership Cost (TOC) improvements.

ARMS CONTROL ACTIVITIES (Funding is in the ARMS Control PE, 35145F)
Arms Control Activities under the New START Treaty drives the need to modify a number of B-52s to a conventional only role by removing the Code Enable Switch and associated equipment.  This effort requires a complete design to remove the equipment from the aircraft and install metal plates prohibiting reinstallation of removed equipment to comply with treaty protocols.

ADDITIONAL EFFORTS  
B-52 modernization funds additional efforts that stem from the operation and maintenance of a 50-plus-year-old aircraft, such as parts obsolescence, DMS, and emerging requirements to add to or maintain the existing capabilities.  Examples include, but are not limited to upgrades to outdated avionics computers, mission planning interfaces to JMPS, Air Force Mission Support System (AFMSS), and other mission planning systems (JMPS), upgrades to the EW suite, and studies and analysis.  All B-52 development programs support planned requirements for unique identification in their production phases.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Prior to FY13, all B-52 modernization programs were funded in a single BPAC, 675039 B-52 Modernization.

B-52 MODERNIZATION PROGRAMS
B-52 modernization is a comprehensive program to ensure B-52 viability to perform current and future wartime missions to include datalinks, navigation, sensors, weapons, and electronic warfare (EW) and training capabilities.  B-52 modernization (initiated in FY 2005) integrates and adds both tactical and global datalink communications for real time command and control, targeting, and intelligence.  It upgrades antiquated Air Traffic Management (ATM) systems with those supported by three key functions using satellite technology:  Communications, Navigation and Surveillance (CNS).  Modernization upgrades training devices to support aircrew and maintenance training with the latest B-52 capability.  In addition, modernization improves conventional warfare capability with additional MIL-STD-1760 smart weapons and improved weapons carriage and fully integrates advanced targeting pods with the offensive avionics system.  B-52 modernization upgrades or replaces legacy defensive EW systems to include the radar warning receiver, jammers, chaff and flare dispensers and situational awareness displays as well as integration of offensive EW such as the Miniature Air-Launched Decoy (MALD) and MALD-Jammer (MALD-J).   Lastly, B-52 Modernization replaces the current aging strategic radar capability with a state-of-the-art, non-developmental radar.

BA7- This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The B-52 CONECT EMD prime contract was a sole source to Boeing Defense, Space &amp; Security (DSS), Wichita, KS.  Boeing designed, developed, tested and procured the necessary equipment from their subcontractors; developed engineering drawings, logistic and technical data, and time compliance technical order (TCTO) for installation on the B-52.  The EMD effort included installing and testing CONECT equipment on a B-52 aircraft.  The B-52 EHF EMD prime contract was a sole source to Boeing DSS, Wichita, KS.  Boeing preserved the B-52 capability to receive EAMS and report-backs, upgraded current SIL and the environmental control system.  The Engineering Manufacturing Development (EMD) effort includes installing and testing the EHF equipment on a B-52 aircraft. 
 

The 1760 Internal Weapons Bay program will acquire software development and hardware design via a sole-source contract to Boeing DSS, Wichita, KS.  Deliverables include an updated J-series weapon SMOs (software), a prototype modified CSRL, logistics support, ground and flight test support, and engineering drawings.  The program will competitively procure the CRL modification kits for full rate production.


The B-52 Anti-Skid program is a joint effort between OC-ALC and OO-ALC.  The modification will be implemented via Program Depot Maintenance (PDM) and Contract Field Team (CFT).

The B-52 Strategic Radar Replacement (SR2) Program was a sustainment upgrade to the B-52H fleet by leveraging existing technologies, designs, and radar components (e.g., line replaceable units (LRUs) already in production and fielded on other military platforms.  It used existing, mature, proven technologies and focused resources on identifying and reducing the risk associated with integrating a modern radar onto the B-52H platform.  The SR2 program was created to replace the AN/APQ-166 radar and several components in the Offensive Avionics System (OAS) associated with managing the video chain. Closeout activities began in FY12 due to program termination beginning in FY13.

The Mode S/5 IFF Program's EMD contract is sole source to Boeing Defense, Space and Security (DSS), Wichita, KS.  This modification will be implemented via Contract Field Team (CFT).   

The Tactical Data Link (TDL) will be sole source to Boeing DSS, Wichita, KS for the integration of TDL based on the CONECT baseline.  

The Reconstitution of B-52 Nuclear Capability Study will be sole source to Boeing DSS.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>MIL-STD 1760 Internal Weapons Bay Upgrade (IWBU) requires the integration of the 1760 weapons capability into the bomb bay on seventy-six (76) B-52H aircraft utilizing Common Strategic Rotary Launcher (CSRLs) converted into Conventional Rotary Launchers (CRLs).  The 1760 IWBU program is segmented into two Increments; Increment 1 consists of two sub-increments 1.1 and 1.2.  

Increment 1.1 consists of internal carriage of eight Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM) and variants, to include Laser JDAM (L-JDAM), on a rotary launcher. Additionally, L-JDAM will be integrated on external hard points during this effort.  The CRL Hardware modification consists of Group A equipment racks and electrical wiring and Group B consists of one Integrated Weapons Interface Unit (IWIU) per CRL.  This Line Replaceable Unit (LRU) was previously developed under the Advanced Weapons Integration (AWI) program and work was previously accomplished for a 2005 demonstration or developed using 2006 and 2007 Congressional Add funding. CSRLs will lose their nuclear capability when modified into a CRL.  No new Nuclear CSRLs will be required. The aircraft software modification consists of modifying existing aircraft, JDAM Stores Management Overlays (SMO), and ground based Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS).

CRL Hardware modification: Consists of Group A equipment racks and electrical wiring, Group B consists of one Integrated Weapons Interface Unit (IWIU) per CRL, this Line Replaceable Unit (LRU) was previously developed under the Advanced Weapons Integration (AWI) program and work previous accomplished for a 2005 demonstration or developed using 2006 and 2007 Congressional Add funding. CRLs will lose their nuclear capability until integration of the MIL-STD 1760 System II nuclear munitions and development and integration of a nuclear hardened IWIU.  No new Nuclear CSRLs will be required. 

Aircraft Software modification: Consists of modifying existing aircraft, JDAM Software and ground based Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS).
Increment 1.2 provides capability for internal carriage of eight Joint Air to Surface Standoff Missiles-Extended Range (JASSM-ER) or eight Miniature Air Launched Decoys (MALD).  Internal capabilities include authorized munition variants, for example, JDAM, GBU-31 (v)1, (v)3, GBU-38, JASSM, and MALD-Jammer (MALD-J).

CRL Hardware modification: Consists of modifying the Increment 1.1 configuration by adding four Group B LRUs, (up to three power supplies and one junction box) and Group A associated interface wiring.

Aircraft Hardware modification: Consists of Group A wiring and circuit breakers to supply additional power to the CRL.  Aircraft Software modification: Includes modifying existing JASSM-ER, MALD software.

Support Equipment:  Thirty-eight (38) Multi-Use System Tester Armament Next Generation (MUSTANG) testers will be modified to support both increments.

A future Increment (Increment 2) will provide carriage expansion of the CRL through a software and hardware modification and will increase the number of weapon stations from 8 to 16 and provide mixed load capability. This will occur after Increment 1 completes. 

B-52 Advanced Weapons Integration (AWI) initiatives previously managed under MN-4260 are now managed under two separate modifications for clarity in effort, funding and schedule.  The initiatives are now described in MN-4260 Advanced Weapons Integration (AWI) and MN-6884 MIL-STD-1760

Budget Item Justification:  FY14 continues Increment 1.1 development, continues SEEK EAGLE safe separation analysis, and conducts ground and flight testing of CRL prototype and JDAM SMO.  Continue B-52 Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS) and Trainer/GMCP software.  Finalize drawings for CRL, and test support equipment modification kits to support Milestone C activity. Begin development of technical orders in preparation for kit-proof. Modify three prototype CRLs.

BA7- This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Beginning in FY13 Project Number 675049, Mode S/5 IFF, transferred from Project Number 675039, B-52 Modernization.

Mode S/5 IFF
Mode S/5 Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) is part of the Communication Navigation Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) effort and will develop and integrate modern technology into the B-52 to enable it to operate in the evolving air traffic environment.  This effort is driven by International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) mandates to comply with performance standards to allow the B-52 to operate safely in controlled airspaces.  This program will also yield significant savings through more efficient flight routes and altitudes.   

CNS/ATM 
Capabilities identified under CNS/ATM activities will include Frequency Management (FM) immunity, digital communications (voice and data), improved navigation accuracy such as Required Navigation Performance (RNP) or Global Positioning System (GPS) enhancements, Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM), enhanced situational awareness such as Mode S/Mode 5 IFF, Communications Management Unit, HF Data Link, Auto Dependent Surveillance- Broadcast (ADS-B), and any follow-on activities to associated components/systems resulting from modifications to CNS/ATM systems.

BA7- This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>CONECT
The B-52 Combat Network Communications Technology (CONECT) acquisition program supports nuclear and conventional operations by upgrading the B-52 fleet with tactical datalink and voice communications capabilities along with improved threat and situational awareness to support participation in network centric operations. The CONECT upgrade includes new multi-functional color displays (MFCDs) and a digital interphone system, which will survive and function through the nuclear environment to enhance crew interaction and situational awareness. To enable net centric operations, the CONECT upgrade integrates:  on-board client/server architecture supporting distributed processing with independent control functions;  UHF Beyond Line-Of-Sight (BLOS) Joint Range Extension (JRE) capability via ARC-210 Warrior radio to exchange J-Series messaging within theater; Intelligence Broadcast Receiver (IBR); limited Internet Protocol (IP)-based UHF BLOS link supporting e-mail and file transfers; and Improved Data Modem (IDM)-based digital Variable Message Format (VMF) datalink to significantly enhance close air support (CAS) missions. This integrated suite will provide the B-52 fleet with a machine-to-machine data transfer capability supporting aircraft re-tasking and re-targeting of Conventional Air Launched Cruise Missile (CALCM), Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile/JASSM-Extended Range (JASSM/JASSM-ER), and other J-series weapons across the range of B-52 military operations and missions. 

For FY14, the FY13 decision to restructure the CONECT program was reversed.  The Air Force FY14 PB submission funds the completion of the full CONECT capability development, updates due to Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Sources (DMSMS) issues, changes to incorporate updates to GFP, recurring changes to B-52 Software baseline, CONECT capability inclusion into the required B-52 training systems, and production/installation/initial support for a total 30 CONECT capable (2 kits were funded in EMD) aircraft.  The test aircraft will not be de-modified from its original CONECT configuration.

TRAINERS AND UPGRADES FOR CONECT
In order to maintain currency with the latest aircraft configuration, the CONECT program will update existing trainers or use computer-based training to add CONECT functionality to meet user-training requirements and establish a system integration laboratory (SIL) for updates of the Weapon System Trainers (WST).  

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Beginning in FY13 Project Number 675051, B-52 Anti Skid Replacement, transferred from Project Number 675039, B-52 Modernization.  

The B-52 Anti-skid system is used to maintain control of aircraft during landings and taxi operations.  The B-52 Anti-skid system prevents aircraft skidding by sensing the exact amount of brake pressure needed for safe braking under all runway conditions without tire damage.  Previous B-52 Anti-skid supportability analysis, completed in 2006 by General Atomics, indicated a supportability end date of 2011, based on parts obsolescence, a lack of test equipment and a lack of repair personnel.  Parts obsolescence continues to be a major supportability factor.  However, since the previous analysis, test equipment and new depot maintenance procedures to refurbish previously failed Anti-skid detectors have been put in place in order to provide spares until 2014/2015 when the replacement will be available.  The Anti-skid Replacement program develops and installs a new system.  This effort includes an upgrade of the maintenance trainers.

BA7- This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The AGM-86B, Air Launched Cruise Missile (ALCM), is a subsonic, air-to-surface strategic nuclear missile, operational since 1982.  Armed with a W80 warhead, it is designed to evade air and ground-based defenses in order to strike targets at any location within any enemy's territory.  The ALCM is designed for B-52H internal and external carriage.  

The purpose of this program element is to ensure ALCM sustainability to 2030 in support of Air Force strategic nuclear deterrence and global strike mission requirements.

An ALCM Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) was developed to support ALCM Service Life to 2030.  The results of SLEP studies identified system components and support equipment that will become non-supportable prior to 2030.  Service life extension of this critical weapon is essential to meet United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) deliberate planning commitments.

The Aging and Surveillance program for ALCM continuously assesses critical components such as those in the safe arm and fuze subsystem, navigation/guidance system, and electrical/power distribution system.  The program identifies aging trends prior to failures in fielded components that would result in fleet-wide reliability and supportability problems.  Development funds are required to update software, test procedures, and test equipment.  FY12 funding supported development of new hardware and software to update the contractor's testing complex/capabilities in order to add the Guided Missile Flight Controller (GMFC) to the annual Aging &amp; Surveillance testing program.  

As part of the build phase of the sustaining engineering approach, the SPO is developing a plan for ALCM sustainment using a computer-aided decision making process.  This concept is called ALCM Sustainment Enhancement Toolbox (ASET).  The first phase of ASET is the ALCM Report Recommendation Tool (ARRT).

Beginning in FY13, development funds are required to develop ARRT to track and archive missile safety and flight test anamoly investigations, OEM failure analyses and feasibility studies.  Also, FY13 funds are required to develop test procedures to implement a new CJCS-directed requirement for High-Altitude Electromagnetic Pulse (HEMP) testing for nuclear systems.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The B-1B Lancer is a swing-wing, supersonic, long-range, conventional bomber. It carries the largest payload of both guided and unguided weapons in the Air Force inventory.  The multi-mission B-1B is the backbone of America's long-range bomber force and can rapidly deliver massive quantities of precision and non-precision weapons against any adversary, anywhere in the world, at any time. The current service life extends beyond 2040.

This Research, Development, Test &amp; Engineering (RDT&amp;E) effort provides funding for B-1B modernization programs. These modernization programs alleviate aircraft obsolescence issues due to Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) while at the same time providing improved capabilities to the B-1B weapon system that require significant hardware and software development and testing. B-1B RDT&amp;E efforts include development of the Self-Contained Standby Attitude Indicator (SCAI). If the primary flight instruments are lost due to electrical failure, the SCAI will remain powered by the backup battery and continue to provide the primary flight information needed to keep the aircraft in stable flight providing attitude, altitude, and airspeed/Mach. This development activity will replace three standby flight indicators (attitude indicator, altimeter, and airspeed indicator) with a more reliable/supportable off-the-shelf display that combines all necessary flight information into one device. SCAI must be functional and reliable in the event of primary flight display failure, and is a Mission-Essential Subsystem List (MESL) item required for flight. RDT&amp;E funding will also provide upgrades to the B-1B training systems (both flight and maintenance simulators/trainers) that are included in the modernization programs to bring the training systems to the same configuration as the Central Integrated Test System (CITS), Fully Integrated Data Link (FIDL), and Vertical Situation Display Upgrade (VSDU) programs. The B-1B training system provides the war fighter fully integrated, cost effective, high fidelity training in the operation, weapons employment, and maintenance of the B-1B weapon system. Upgrades to the B-1B flight test aircraft are included in the modernization programs to keep the test flight systems current. RDT&amp;E funded test jets are currently configured with Engineering Manufacturing and Development (EMD) Line Replaceable Units (LRUs) for CITS, FIDL and VSDU. Replacement of the EMD LRUs are required to bring two flight test aircraft to a fleet-representative configuration to ensure maximum supportability, maintainability and reliability for continued and future flight tests. In addition, program funds cover engineering/planning studies, related engineering efforts, and auxiliary requirement for development programs that have not yet fielded due to diminishing manufacturing sources. Cost includes program management administrative (PMA) costs and initiatives for anticipant weapon system enhancements, including efforts to improve weapon system operational capabilities, safety, supportability, maintainability, reliability, and total ownership cost. All B-1B development programs support planned requirements for unique identification in their production phases. 

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipated production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Key elements of the overall B-1B Modernization acquisition strategy include: use of sole source contract with a prime/integrating contractor (Boeing); installed performance responsibility; use of Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF) development contracts; and combining developmental upgrades with software sustainment blocks to minimize the number of software releases, aircraft downtime and differences in fielded configurations.

Self Contained Standby Attitude Indicator (SCAI) acquisition strategy will consist of two years EMD, three years Production and Installation.  Contract will be a Firm Fixed Price (FFP).

The acquisition strategy for Simulator Upgrades for VSDU, Central Integrated Test Systems (CITS), and Fully Integrated Data Link (FIDL) is a Fixed Price Incentive Firm (FPIF) competitive award contract.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>Funding prior to FY14, and the estimate to complete after FY14 for B-2 ACAT 1 programs as follows: 

The ACAT 1C B-2 Extremely High Frequency Satellite Communication (EHF SATCOM) and Computers Increment 1: Prior years funding: $373M; estimate to complete: Not applicable. Program begins procurement in FY12; there are no remaining RDT&amp;E efforts after FY13.
 
</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The B-2 Spirit is the world's most advanced long-range strike asset. The unique combination of range, precision, payload, and ability to operate in anti-access area denial environments allow the B-2 to identify, locate, target, and destroy the highest value enemy targets. The B-2 can, with necessary upgrades, accomplish its mission regardless of location, return to base safely, and permit freedom of movement for follow-on forces, including other long range strike platforms. An array of planned RDT&amp;E projects are necessary to preserve a strategic advantage against 21st century threats as well as increase flexibility, lethality, and survivability of this national asset tasked across a broad spectrum of tactical and national strategic objectives. B-2 will achieve these objectives by adapting mature technologies/systems in the fleet to rapidly deliver affordable and relevant combat capability, leveraging other Department of Defense investments and programs utilizing innovative acquisition strategies.  

The B-2 has a projected service life through 2058. To ensure the fleet can accomplish its nuclear and conventional mission in highly defended and anti-access environments, periodic modernization efforts must be undertaken to upgrade combat capability as well as improve the viability, supportability, and survivability of the weapon system.  

Recent and ongoing investments in avionics, structures, communications, and weapons upgrades keep the B-2 viable in the immediate future.
Specific development efforts are managed in four projects: 

     675345 B-2 Modernization 
     676021 Baseline Support 
     676022 EHF SATCOM and Computer
     676023 Defensive Management System Modernization (FY12 only)

Current development efforts include: 

Alternative communication solutions such as Common Very Low Frequency Receiver and Adaptable Communications Suite, Massive Ordnance Penetrator integration, Flexible Strike Phase 1 -- formerly known as Stores Management Operational Flight Program re-host -- which will re-host the stores management processor software, Low Observable Signature and Supportability Modifications, Aircraft Supportability Modifications, and Training System Upgrades;

Flight test aircraft upgrades and base of operations support, Advanced Low Detection Data Link studies, and Mission Planning System improvements as well as B-2 acquisition planning; 

Extremely High Frequency Satellite Communications (SATCOM) and Computers Increments 1 and 2; 

Defensive Management System Modernization (FY12 only - beginning in FY13, managed under Program Element 0605931F, project 653844).

In addition to on-going projects, the B-2 also performs studies for possible or projected projects such as integration of Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff missile-Extended Range, and other weapons integration, avionics, communication, aircraft and engine improvements. The long range vision for the aircraft anticipates that future improvements may also include such capabilities as Moving Target Kill or Non-Traditional Surveillance and Reconnaissance combat.  Studies may explore: the development of a Universal Armament Interface, integrating multi-platform advanced data links with high bandwidth satellite communication links, Link-16 Center Instrument Display/In-Flight Replanner, integration of the Global Positioning System M-Code hardware and software necessary for modernization of Air Traffic Management communications/navigation/ surveillance systems, and enhancement of the Mode 5/S Identification Friend or Foe system with Automatic Dependence Surveillance-Broadcast capability mandated by US and European military and civil aviation agencies to improve situational awareness of controlled and contested airspaces. Improvements may be required on the B-2 data/voice/video recorders to comply with Air Force Safety Board mandates to provide specific flight and aircraft data, frequency of update, data precision, and recording duration that do not exist in the B-2 recorders today, which may drive studies. Finally, other studies will look at possible enhancements of current radar modes, high resolution improvements to the synthetic aperture radar, and improved information fusion required to gather, analyze, and communicate enemy movements and combat capabilities to friendly follow-on forces, the National Command Authority, and other operation centers via the Global Information Grid.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes developmental efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The B-2 is currently undergoing modernization of avionics/communications systems, engines, armament systems, low observable components, core training system components, aircraft supportability improvements, support equipment development, as well as studying future Integrated Strike Warfare and Advanced Tactical Data Link integration requirements.

B-2 communications upgrades integrate new communications equipment or inprove the performance of already fielded systems. The Common Very Low Frequency (VLF) Receiver effort develops and integrates a receive-only VLF receiver and antenna subsystem to provide a secure, survivable strategic communication capability for the B-2. The CVR receiver will be adaptable for use by other Department of Defense platforms. 

In addition to the funded CVR project, B-2 will also peform studies to explore other potential communications improvements which are not currently funded, such as: upgrades to the Adaptable Communications Suite non-integrated communications system; Link-16 Center Instrument Display/In-Flight Replanner; Mode 5/S ADS-B Identification Friend or Foe with Automatic Dependence Surveillance-Broadcast; and Integrated Strike Warfare Airborne Network distributed modeling and simulation network. 

 
B-2 armament upgrades integrate new and/or advanced weapons on the B-2 to address a wider array of target sets, to include moving targets, and hardened, deeply buried targets. The Flexible Strike Phase 1 program -- formerly known as Stores Management Operational Flight Program re-host -- will recombine and rehost the current B-2 stores management software onto a new integrated processor, providing the processing and bandwidth to handle advanced digital weapons such as B61-12 or Long Range Stand Off (LRSO).

B-2 will also perform studies for potential future efforts, including: a Flexible Strike Phase 2 to enable multiple weapons carriage capabilities; and integration of additional weapons such as the extended range variant of the Joint Air to Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM-ER), laser JDAM or upgrades or replacements to weapons testing or weapons loading equipment.

Additional B-2 modernization efforts will be accomplished in four main areas: 
   (1) Low observable improvements; 
   (2) B-2 training systems;
   (3) Aircraft supportability modifications; and 
   (4) Peculiar Support Equipment (PSE). 

Details are provided below:

Low Observable Signature and Supportability Modification (LOSSM) projects decrease low observable (LO) maintenance, increase aircraft availability, and maintain and improve the combat-ready LO signature for the B-2 fleet ensuring survivable combat operations. LOSSM projects improve materials, structures, and diagnostic tools necessary to evaluate LO materials and systems in the B-2 fleet. LOSSM structure improvement projects include, but are not limited to, advanced high frequency materials placement, windshield bounce patch and tape improvements, composite plies, advanced signature reduction, and radome improvements.  Material improvements include, but are not limited to, tailpipe and inlet coatings, pre-cured gap fillers, and other advanced LO materials development. Diagnostic tool efforts include, but are not limited to, improved radar frequency diagnostics, signature diagnostic system database upgrades, Tier One Material Inspection System improvements, Portable Laser Removal Tool development, Integrated Collections And Reporting System, Mobile Diagnostics Laboratory, Ground Air Radar System development, and other low observable special test equipment and information systems upgrades. 

The B-2 Training System upgrades include updates to training device hardware and components, simulation software, courseware and academic materials, instructional system design architectures, engineering drawings, and system documentation that is not driven by a funded aircraft modification.  Improvements include, but are not limited to, threat systems parametrics and order of battle information, radar display emulation improvements, improved aero fidelity of key pilot procedures, courseware improvements, and upgrades to display systems, subsystems, and simulation and computational processors. Other upgrades include, but are not limited to, conventional and nuclear guided weapons delivery training, expanded crypto keyfill capability in simulators, upgraded capability to train weapons as powered up upon completion of initial conditions, as well as upgrades to the electronic combat environment threat database tools to include threat laydown, threat parametrics, and Integrated Air Defense System. Upgrades also include the current Defensive Management System (DMS) simulation, improved DMS alternative/ emergency procedures courseware, and upgraded Mission Generation System, Suppressor tool, and simulation and computational processors as necessary. Enhancements are provided to the B-2 family of trainers to include the Weapon System Trainers, Mission Trainer, Cockpit Procedures Trainers, Computerized Maintenance Training System, Weapon System Training Aids, Weapons Load Trainer, Crew Escape System Maintenance Trainer, Flight Control System Trainer, instructor-operator station, and Training System Support Center.

The Aircraft Supportability Modifications (ASM) improve the reliability, maintainability, supportability, and availability of the B-2 fleet through its 2058 service life. Studies and planning will examine B-2 Common Processor, Proximity Sensor Logic Unit, and future improvements to the Generator Control Unit, Rudder Access Panel and Elevon Drain Hole upgrades, Cockpit Voice and Flight Data Recorder, Radomes, Audio Control Display Unit, Center Instrument Display improvements, Aft Deck Doublers, Center Instrument Display connection to the aircraft Digital Video Recorder, Multi-function Information Distribution System Power Transfer, Global Positioning System Splitter Cable, Airborne Integrated Terminal Crypto, and upgraded cryptological functionality of all B-2 communications systems as necessary.  Engine improvements to be looked at include F118 engine Service Life Extension Program, Extended Mission Oil Tank, and the Next Generation Engine Core upgrade. Stage 1 and 3 engine fan blade improvements will reduce engine changes while increasing aircraft availability and reducing maintenance costs. Engine upgrades are necessary to maintain commonality with the F110 engine core and reduce maintenance and repair costs of divergent engine configurations.   

Peculiar Support Equipment (PSE) development activities include design, development, test, and procurement of new peculiar support equipment, to include but not limited to, special test equipment for newly emerging test and support requirements of legacy B-2 capabilities and/or functionality. Development of new peculiar support equipment will support test and sustainment activities at the B-2 Weapon System Support Center Ground Test Facility, Program Depot Maintenance facility, Test Range facilities, and Air Force Global Strike Command operating locations.


This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Baseline Support maintains and upgrades the B-2 unique flight test aircraft as well as hardware/software and test equipment to support developmental systems integration and flight test, reducing the need for additional operational aircraft and accelerating deployment of advanced operational capabilities to the warfighter. Baseline Support also ensures the Mission Planning System keeps pace with aircraft modifications and improves the mission planning core system. Baseline Support provides for other B-2 unique government costs and includes assorted studies of aircraft performance and cost trades as well as acquisition planning activities, up to and including proposal preparation, for future capabilities.
 
This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

                            <r2:ProjectNote>EHF Increment 2 program funding was removed in the FY13 PB due to higher Air Force priorities.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The aging Ultra High Frequency (UHF) Military Satellite Communications system is being phased out and replaced by the Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) Satellite Communications (SATCOM) system.  The B-2 Extremely High Frequency (EHF) SATCOM program supports the replacement of the present UHF Terminal Set with an EHF SATCOM system that will be compatible with the legacy MILSTAR I/II satellite constellation as well as the AEHF satellite constellation. The B-2 EHF SATCOM system is one element of a system-of-systems that includes the AEHF satellites, multiple platforms, and the Family of Advanced Beyond-line-of-site Terminals (FAB-T) or other equivalent terminals (if required). The B-2 EHF SATCOM upgrade is an incremental program. 

EHF Increment 1 provides upgraded flight management control processors, increased data storage, rehosted Flight Management Operational Flight Program, and a high bandwidth data bus to prevent degradation of existing capabilities. Additionally, the Increment 1 Integrated Processing Unit and Disk Drive Unit architectures establish a high speed fiber optic structure network as well as maintain connectivity to legacy interfaces.  EHF Increment 1 provides a processing growth path to future B-2 upgrades.

EHF Increment 2 ensures two-way, secure, survivable low probability of intercept/low probability of detection beyond-line-of-site communication in an anti-access area-denial environment.  EHF Increment 2 integrates the FAB-T Government Furnished Equipment, or other equivalent terminals (if required), into the B-2 as well as develops and installs a low-observable antenna system consisting of arrays, antenna line replaceable units, and structural modifications for both power and cooling. EHF Increment 2 also implements B-2 unique terminal modifications, as required. This upgrade is critical to ensure the B-2 is compatible with the next generation communications satellite architecture, and provides uninterrupted, highly survivable, two-way communications for the command and control of the nation's strategic nuclear and conventional forces. Connectivity is mandatory to enable network centric enabled attack in an anti-access area denial environment. 

EHF Increment 2 was defunded in the FY13 President's Budget.  The Air Force will pursue the Common Very Low Frequency Receiver to satisfy the immediate user need date for B-2 survivable strategic communication.  However, secure, survivable two-way strategic communication remains a requirement for the warfighter.  To that end, EHF Increment 2 will continue maturing the array technolgy with residual FY12 funds.
 
This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate
production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

                            <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>In FY12, funding for Extremely High Frequency (EHF) SATCOM and Computers transferred from project 675345 PE 0101127F, B-2 Squadrons to project 676022 PE 0101127F, B-2 Squadrons.

EHF Increment 2 program funding was removed in the FY13 PB due to higher Air Force priorities.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Key elements of the overall acquisition strategy include: use of sole source contract with a prime/integrating contractor (Northrop Grumman), leverage mature technology and system development investments by other Department of Defense organizations, encourage prime contractor to conduct competitions at the subsystem/key component level to reduce risk and cost, use cost plus incentive fee (CPIF) development contracts, and combine developmental upgrades with software sustainment blocks to minimize the number of software releases, aircraft downtime, and differences in fielded configurations</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>DMS-M is the #1 priority modification program in the B-2 program office.  The B-2 Defensive Management System Modernization (DMS-M) program maintains the B-2 direct attack capability while addressing emerging 21st century threats. DMS-M will upgrade the Electronic Support Measures, antennas, and display processing units.  Modernization of this system will resolve the #1 obsolescence issue in the B-2 fleet.

The B-2 DMS-M will provide the Joint Force Commander and the B-2 fleet with advanced situational awareness, improved supportability, enhanced lethality, increased platform survivability, and networked battlespace awareness. The DMS-M upgrade will provide the following core capabilities for the B-2 and joint warfighting force:  

1) Ability to provide indication, type, and position of airborne and ground-based radio frequency (RF) threats with the situational awareness needed to avoid, engage, or negate threats,

2) Improved RF threat information that can be reported to control agencies or inter-flight for improved situation/battlespace awareness,

3) Ability to adequately control, process, and display incoming threat information to the aircrew and provide updated battle-space awareness, and
 
4) Improved supportability and reduced operations and maintenance costs.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY 2013, 675282, Joint Navigation Warfare Center, efforts were transferred to PE 0105921F, Service Support to STRATCOM Space Activities in order to properly execute program.
</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The mission of USSTRATCOM is to establish and provide full-spectrum global strike, coordinated space and information operations capabilities to meet both deterrent and decisive national security objectives, and to provide operational space support, integrated missile defense, Global Command Control Communications and Computers Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR), and specialized planning expertise to the joint warfighter.  This mission has been defined by the 2002 Unified Command Plan (UCP) changes 1 and 2.  To enable completion of these missions, USSTRATCOM is modernizing the Integrated Strategic Planning and Analysis Network (ISPAN) (formerly known as SWPS), developing information systems and techniques to counter and conduct Navigation Warfare (NAVWAR) and establishing a unified national architecture integrating disparate Missile Warning/Missile Defense (MW/MD) systems into a single Internet Protocol (IP)-based system known as the Global Sensor Integrated Network (GSIN) to provide redundant and unambiguous MW/MD data to national leadership.  When the ISPAN modernization is complete the system will support the warfighter in both deliberate and adaptive planning environments while allowing the National Command Authorities to employ the full spectrum of kinetic and non-kinetic weapons.  The ISPAN system will continue to evolve as weapon systems are matured, new systems are developed, and the threat changes, particularly in the area of worldwide proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD).   

Navigation Warfare (NAVWAR) is a warfighting application of electronic warfare (EW), Information Operations (IO) and space control (SC) employing various techniques and technologies to negate or prevent hostile use of positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) information and protect unimpeded use of PNT information by U.S., Allied, and Coalition Forces while not unduly disrupting peaceful use outside an area of operation.  The Joint Navigation Warfare Center (JNWC) was established to integrate and coordinate NAVWAR PNT capabilities across the mission areas of intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, information operations, electronic warfare, and space control.  The JNWC is also commissioned to integrate NAVWAR into space operations and assists the warfighter with subject matter expertise to "operationalize" NAVWAR, encouraging the NAVWAR view that the Global Positioning System is a taskable weapons system in addition to being a worldwide PNT service.  The JNWC establishes and maintains the Department's premier basis of NAVWAR expertise, and provides subject matter expertise and knowledge support to warfighters, Department decision makers, the Federal Interagency (the Department of Homeland Security and other civil agencies concerned with the Critical National Infrastructure), and the coalition through testing and evaluation; modeling, simulation and analysis; and exercise and training support.  

The nation's strategic Command and Control (C2), sensors and mission planning programs cannot rapidly exchange information across multiple missions, creating ambiguity that delays time critical national C2 decision making processes.  GSIN establishes a unified national architecture integrating disparate MW/MD systems into a single IP-based system providing redundant and unambiguous MW/MD data to national leadership.  GSIN nets together all sensors, from tactical to strategic, including the Nation's most modern and capable assets - taking advantage of their larger numbers, improved algorithms, mobility and forward deployment to provide earlier cross-cueing and expanded decision space when every second counts.  GSIN will permit an IP-based User Defined Operational Picture (UDOP) to augment voice conferencing and rapidly build a single, unambiguous missile event picture allowing real-time senior collaboration for nuclear C2 and improved senior leader situational awareness (SA) and decision-making. 

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The mission of USSTRATCOM is to establish and provide full-spectrum global strike, coordinated space and information operations capabilities to meet both deterrent and decisive national security objectives, and to provide operational space support, integrated missile defense, Global Command Control Communications and Computers Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR), and specialized planning expertise to the joint warfighter. This mission has been defined by the 2002 Unified Command Plan (UCP) changes 1 and 2. To enable these missions, the Integrated Strategic Planning and Analysis Network (ISPAN) (formerly known as SWPS) must be capable of both deliberate and adaptive planning employing the full spectrum of kinetic and non-kinetic weapons. The planning system will continue to evolve as weapon systems are matured, new systems are developed, and the threat changes, particularly in the area of worldwide proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD).

The ISPAN modernization program includes initiation of Course of Action (COA) Development as a service to the DoD enterprise, workflow and decision support development, Combatant Commander (COCOM) Collaboration, User Defined Operational Picture (UDOP), conventional mission planning integration, and Mission Planning Analysis System (MPAS) maintenance and modernization. This includes software coding, integration of multiple internal and external planning applications, as well as developmental and early operational test activities. ISPAN also includes automated data processing equipment (ADPE), software, facilities support, manpower, and training to support the mission objectives of ISPAN, associated deployable and distributed data processing nodes, and subsidiary systems. Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.

ISPAN Increment 2 develops the next increment of planning tools for ISPAN Collaborative Information Environment (CIE).  It builds on capabilities delivered during Block 1 and develops advanced decision support capabilities for senior leader situational awareness through enhanced data analysis and visualization. ISPAN Increment 3 (when directed) will continue the development of expanded planning tools for CIE. ISPAN Increment 4 will modernize the Mission Planning and Analysis System (MPAS), the system that develops Joint Staff Level I through Level IV nuclear and conventional attack options for national and theater requirements.  Increment 4 will fulfill MPAS requirements by reducing Crisis Action Planning and Time Sensitive Planning timelines, integrating nuclear and conventional kinetic weapon capabilities with non-kinetic effects, providing the capability to integrate planning and analysis capabilities of future Global Strike weapons, updating the MPAS system to provide the ability to train users in significantly less time, and leveraging new technologies to lower sustainment costs.  Increment 4 will consist of three development spirals over a five year period, which includes testing and validation of the new capability.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>In FY 2013, 675282, Joint Navigation Warfare Center, efforts transferred to PE 0105921F, Service Support to STRATCOM Space Activities (O&amp;M). </r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Navigation Warfare (NAVWAR) is deliberate defensive and offensive action to assure and prevent positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) information through coordinated employment of space, cyberspace, and electronic warfare (EW) operations.  The term NAVWAR is sometimes equated with "PNT Superiority".  The Joint Navigation Warfare Center (JNWC) was established by DEPSECDEF Memo, 17 November 2004, as the DoD Center of Excellence, tasked to integrate and coordinate NAVWAR PNT capabilities across electronic spectrum, cyberspace, and space operations.  NAVWAR leverages various techniques and technologies from these mission areas to negate or prevent hostile use of PNT information and protect unimpeded use of PNT information by U.S., Allied, and Coalition Forces while not unduly disrupting peaceful use outside an area of operation. The JNWC develops and maintains the Department's premier collection of NAVWAR knowledge, and provides subject matter expertise support to warfighters, Department decision makers, the Federal Interagency (the Department of Homeland Security and other civil agencies concerned with the Critical National Infrastructure), and the Coalition.  NAVWAR expertise is developed in part by execution of PNT Operational Field Assessments (POFAs), modeling and simulation, analysis, and exercise and training support. In recent years, the Global Positioning System (GPS) has become one of the most critical enablers of modern advanced technology warfare. In an era where everything from advanced weapons systems and networks to basic goods and services are tracked, guided or disciplined by PNT systems such as GPS, NAVWAR is an ever increasing capability of interest and concern, especially if PNT systems are interrupted or lost. Likewise, as Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) proliferate, it becomes necessary to consider not only denying adversary use of GPS but also negating adversary use of alternate GNSS systems for PNT. The primary mission of the JNWC is to provide joint warfighter NAVWAR support through three broad mission areas:

a. Warfighter Operational Support - The JNWC applies knowledge of PNT vulnerabilities, prevention capabilities, and system operations to integrate NAVWAR as an element of warfighting operations. The JNWC provides reach-back capabilities to assist in resolving NAVWAR issues, address situations involving degradation or denial of PNT capabilities, and recommend actions to mitigate effects of both hostile and non-hostile events. The JNWC develops and maintains current information for the warfighter and theater commanders to include assessments of adversary capabilities, assessments of coalition capabilities and limitations, and other topics of special interest. The JNWC also provides subject matter expertise and knowledge support to Department acquisition and policy decision makers, the Federal Interagency (the Department of Homeland Security and other civil agencies concerned with the Critical National Infrastructure), and the coalition.

b. Test, Training, Exercises, and Experiments - This JNWC mission area is the centerpiece for maintaining NAVWAR currency of information for the warfighter. The JNWC conducts annual NAVWAR field test events, and provides NAVWAR technical assistance for training, exercises and experiments. The JNWC, as part of this effort, maintains Integrated Joint NAVWAR Test Roadmaps and current intelligence products on adversary NAVWAR capabilities and Coalition NAVWAR capabilities and vulnerabilities. JNWC GYPSY field test events focus on fielded operational systems and capabilities to integrate NAVWAR and PNT operations, to baseline current NAVWAR electronic protection, support, and attack capabilities, and to assist warfighters optimize and deconflict theater/tactical assets. JNWC FORTUNE field test events are more engineering focused and are used to evaluate specific NAVWAR capabilities or vulnerabilities, and to reduce engineering risk for GYPSY events. Test, training, exercise and experiment activities: 1) prepare the joint warfighter for operations in current and rapidly evolving NAVWAR threat environments; 2) establish priorities, standardized operational procedures for tactics, techniques, and procedures; 3) test electronic attack CONOPs to endure deconfliction and optimization with other operations to mitigate blue force fratricide; and 4) evolve standardized test methods.

c. Navigation Warfare Information Analysis Center (IAC) - The JNWC develops and maintains methods, standards, models and simulations used in NAVWAR analysis and operates the NAVWAR Information Analysis Center (IAC). JNWC evaluates new models for accuracy and applicability to specific situations and rapidly evolving threat environments. It also develops and maintains standard test methodologies created solely by the U.S. as well as test methods developed in collaboration with coalition partners. These standard methodologies ensure data sharing is efficient and effective, and ensures accurate feedback to the operational communities. The JNWC, as part of this effort, manages the GPS EA Frequency Clearance process and conducts independent analysis and verification of EA frequency clearance requests. It also maintains and upgrades the Global Positioning System Reliability Prediction Model (GPS-RPM) frequency clearance model as required and conducts modeling and simulation exercises on GPS interference to include test and exercise threat laydowns for DoD organizations unable to perform their own modeling. The NAVWAR IAC serves as a source of NAVWAR information and technical expertise for DoD researchers, engineers, program managers, warfighters, testers, and others. It collects, analyzes, synthesizes, and disseminates scientific and technical information in clearly defined specialized subject areas. It promotes standardization by: 1) providing in-depth analyses; 2) creating products that respond to technical inquiries; 3) preparing state-of-the-art reports, handbooks, and databases; 4) conducting technology assessments; and 5) supporting the exchange of information within the NAVWAR community. Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The mission of USSTRATCOM is to establish and provide full-spectrum, global strike, coordinated space and information operations capabilities to meet both deterrent and decisive national security objectives, and to provide operational space support, integrated missile defense, Global Command Control Communications and Computers Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR), and specialized planning expertise to the joint warfighter.  This mission has been defined by the 2002 Unified Command Plan (UCP) changes 1 and 2, the CJCS Plan ORD and the USSTRATCOM Plan ORD.  GSIN nets together selected systems and sensors, from tactical to strategic, including the Nation's most modern and capable assets, taking advantage of their larger numbers, improved algorithms, mobility and forward deployment to provide earlier cross-cueing and expanded decision space when every second counts.  GSIN will enable a User Defined Operating Picture (UDOP) to provide a single, unambiguous missile event picture allowing real-time senior collaboration for nuclear C2, improved senior leader situational awareness (SA), and decision-making.

The Nation's strategic C2, sensors and mission planning programs cannot rapidly exchange information across multiple missions, creating ambiguity that delays time critical national C2 decision making processes.  GSIN establishes a unified schema integrating disparate Missile Warning/Missile Defense (MW/MD) data into a single exposed data set providing redundant and unambiguous MW/MD data to national leadership.  GSIN enables existing sensors to provide data in net-centric formats consumable by other authorized systems and mission areas, thus reducing the need to acquire more sensors.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning, execution, and future program planning.  

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production fielding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Battle Control System-Fixed (BCS-F) is the replacement for the fixed sites for the Region/Sector Air Operations Center (R/SAOC), also known as Region Air Operations Center-Air Defense Sector (RAOC-ADS).  The BCS-F Program, which supports Operation NOBLE EAGLE, is a next-generation battle management command and control system with enhanced capability to integrate data from existing and future civil and military defense surveillance systems into a comprehensive recognized air picture and National Capital Region/Integrated Air Defense System (NCR/IADS).  This multi-input single integrated air control picture enhances the North American Aerospace Defense/Combatant Commander's (NORAD/CC's) capability to conduct peacetime air sovereignty, transition, and conventional warfare in the event of aggression toward the North American continent (including Hawaii).  The BCS-F system serves as the Air Force's Homeland Defense battle management, command, and control hub and integrates data from radar sensors, data links, and the supporting communications architecture.  It provides the tactical communications and data link capabilities that enable planning, directing, coordinating, and controlling forces for air surveillance, air defense, and control of sovereign US air space (including the National Capital Region).  BCS-F is a bi-national cooperative program with Canada, ensuring air defense and surveillance capability for the entire North American continent (including Hawaii).  BCS-F achieved Initial Operational Capability in October 2006. The BCS-F Increment 3 program achieved Full Deployment 29 November 2012. Upon the full deployment declaration, the ACAT 1AC is transitioning to an inactive program. 

NCR-IADS is the post-September 11 2001, quickly established, ground based air defense system using sensors to enhance the air surveillance picture incorporated in BCS-F.

Battle Control System-Modernization/Sustainment: The BCS Modernization program efforts include, but are not limited to, providing system changes to facilitate mission area changes such as Radiant Mercury (RM) Redundancy, Distributed Mission Operations (DMO), Battle Control Center (BCC) Expansion, Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B),  Remote Tactical Air Picture (RTAP) extensibility, sensor integration (JLENS, LSTAR, STARS), and Certified Network Defense Service Provider (CNDSP). Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution, as well as future program planning.   

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, which incude development efforts to upgrade systems currently fielded or have approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>In the 2006 Strategic Master Plan, the AFSPC/CC identified a need to provide timely, accurate, relevant intelligence data to support Space Superiority operations - Offensive Counterspace (OCS), Defense Counterspace (DCS), and Space Situational Awareness (SSA).  USSTRATCOM further stated the need for such a requirement in its February 2006 Space Control JCD.   This program element provides Space Intelligence Preparation of the Battlespace (SIPB) Human-to-Machine/Machine-to-Machine Interface (HMMI) in response to those requirements.  The SIPB HMMI is an information technology that links intelligence analysts to space operators, enabling them to share in the production, dissemination and visualization of predictive and highly graphic decision-making products - SIPBs.  The SIPB HMMI gives the JSpOC, JFCCs, and COCOM J2/J3/J5s an Adaptive Planning tool to obtain adversary space and counterspace tactics, centers of gravity, and courses of action.  Linking existing space operational and intelligence data, databases, and products, the SIPB HMMI becomes the integral effort for a space intelligence TCPED capability that influences the kill chain.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>In the 2006 Strategic Master Plan, the AFSPC/CC identified a need to provide timely, accurate, relevant intelligence data to support Space Superiority operations - Offensive Counterspace (OCS), Defense Counterspace (DCS), and Space Situational Awareness (SSA).  USSTRATCOM further stated the need for such a requirement in its February 2006 Space Control JCD.   This program element provides Space Intelligence Preparation of the Battlespace (SIPB) Human-to-Machine/Machine-to-Machine Interface (HMMI) in response to those requirements.  The SIPB HMMI is an information technology that links intelligence analysts to space operators, enabling them to share in the production, dissemination and visualization of predictive and highly graphic decision-making products - SIPBs.  The SIPB HMMI gives the JSpOC, JFCCs, and COCOM J2/J3/J5s an Adaptive Planning tool to obtain adversary space and counterspace tactics, centers of gravity, and courses of action.  Linking existing space operational and intelligence data, databases, and products, the SIPB HMMI becomes the integral effort for a space intelligence TCPED capability that influences the kill chain.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Warfighter Rapid Acquisition Process (WRAP) is a CSAF-directed initiative that supports the specific DoD goal of significantly shortening the acquisition response time and acquisition cycle times.  This process is expected to shorten the project decision/initiation time by 2-5 years for selected projects due to the integrated headquarters review and immediate availability of transition funding.  The WRAP process allows the Air Force the flexibility to accelerate the development and fielding of operational  initiatives resulting from innovation and transition them to the warfighter in a manner that coincides with Air Forces' development of the President's Budget. Candidate projects will compete for WRAP approval and funds based on business case analyses, actual or potential operational impacts, cost savings, project development, production, lifecycle costs, and project risk.  The Air Force, through appropriate program offices, will manage the acquisition and development process for the integration and fielding of WRAP-approved projects.  Each project will have a complete acquisition plan defined and approved as a criterion for project selection and subsequent funding.  Each sponsoring Major Command/Agency must commit full project funding in the subsequent programming cycle.  Congress will be notified when all projects have been approved by the end of the current fiscal year via Congressional Notification Letters.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The basic MQ-9 Reaper system consists of the aircraft, sensors, a ground control station (GCS), Squadron Operations Center (SOC), communications equipment, weapon kits, support equipment, simulator and training devices, Readiness Spares Packages (RSP), technical data/training, and personnel required to operate, maintain, and sustain the system.  The system is designed to be modular and open-ended.  Mission-specific equipment is employed in a 'plug-and-play' mission kit concept allowing specific aircraft and control station configurations to be tailored to fit mission needs.  

The MQ-9 Reaper aircraft is a single-engine, turbo-prop remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) designed to operate over-the-horizon at medium-to-high altitude for long endurance sorties.  The aircraft is designed primarily to prosecute critical, emerging Time-Sensitive-Targets (TSTs) as a radar, Electro-optical/Infrared (EO/IR), and laser designator-based attack asset with on-board hard-kill capability (hunter-killer).  It also performs Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Target Acquisition (ISR TA).  In the hunter-killer role, the aircraft employs fused multi-spectral sensors to find, fix, and track ground targets using Automatic Target Cueing (ATC), high definition EO/IR, Metric Sensor and other capabilities, and assesses post-strike results.  The MQ-9 system is continuing to develop and field capability through incremental upgrades.  Future capabilities development activity includes airframe and airframe system improvements, such as; increasing the maximum gross takeoff weight capability of the aircraft from 10,500 to 11,700lbs; increasing the operational range and endurance of the baseline MQ-9 aircraft (adding external fuel tanks and/or airframe modifications such as wing extensions); incorporating an anti-ice/de-ice capability to transit light icing conditions (will involve wing/tail modifications as well as turbine inlet heating); propulsion system improvements; enhancing MQ-9 systems to include automatic takeoff and landing capability (ATLC); integrated redundant avionics; modifying the system to include provisions for a Foreign Military Sale exportable version of the weapon system; Predator Primary Data Link (PPDL) communication system upgrades and communications upgrades to include data link encryption, IP networking, and Beyond Line-of-Sight comm upgrades; navigation system upgrades; electrical system upgrades; incorporation of Elevated Temperature Wet (ETW) materials; secure voice and data communications, including SATCOM upgrades; sensor/stores management computer improvement; MIL-STD-1760 advanced weapons data bus; Universal Armament and Sensor Interface and Miniature Munitions/Store Interface; advanced sensor and weapon payloads; improved human-machine interface (HMI); integrating precision weapons (e.g. AGM-114 Hellfire missile, GBU-12/38/49 guided bombs, and Small Diameter Bomb variants); Mode 5 / Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B) integration; hardware and software upgrades to the ground control station for MQ-9 operations; completing airworthiness certification; weapons system certification and accreditation; and producing applicable training devices that emulate weapon system functionality and capabilities.  The MQ-9 program will continue to support other payload and capability development activities funded in other Program Elements (e.g. SIGINT, communications, Wide Area Motion Imagery (WAMI) leveraging Gorgon Stare Quick Reaction Capability, advanced Counter-Improvised Explosive Device (C-IED), Dismount Detection Radar (DDR), missile defense, hyperspectral, and other sensors and weapons) and address reliability, maintainability, sustainability, and safety issues.  Activities also include trade studies, analyses, preliminary systems engineering, system and subsystem level testing in accordance with DoD and military standards, and specification development in support of both current program planning and execution, and studies supporting analysis and investment in future program planning.
   
The GCS, common with the MQ-1 Predator, functions as the aircraft cockpit and can control the aircraft either within line-of-sight (LOS) or beyond LOS (BLOS) via a combination of satellite relay and terrestrial communications.  The GCS is either mobile to support forward operating locations or fixed at a facility to support Remote Split Operations (RSO).  The GCS has the capability to perform mission planning; provides a means for manual control; allows personnel to launch, recover, and monitor aircraft, payloads, and system communications status; incorporates secure data links to send aircraft and payload commands and receive system telemetry and payload data; monitors threats to the aircraft; displays the common operational picture; and provides support functions.  Launch and Recovery GCS (LRGCS) allow for servicing, systems checks, maintenance, launch and recovery of aircraft under LOS control for hand-off to a mobile or fixed facility GCS, and conducting operations within line-of-sight range of the LRGCS.  GCS upgrades will be developed and fielded in coordination with improvements to MQ-9 system capabilities and in response to evolving operational and information assurance/certification and accreditation requirements.  Key efforts include GCS upgrades that add new LINUX processors, high definition monitors, ergonomic improvements, improved human-machine interfaces, open systems architecture, and improved crew habitability. In addition, the GCS upgrade effort also includes development/integration of the Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Command and Control (C2) Initiative (UCI) government-owned standard to enable improved capabilities for situational awareness and multi-mission management monitoring and oversight in the GCS and SOC. This project will also increase interoperability among developed systems by developing common standard and tools.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Overall, this program element (PE) funds on-going sustainment, maintenance, and upgrade of Multi-Platform Electronic Attack (EA) jamming pods and associated combat test equipment as well as sustainment of various other Electronic Warfare equipment.  Specifically, this program provides procurement, research and development, and operations and maintenance for sustaining the ALQ-131 and ALQ-184 EA jamming pods.  These pods are the sole self-protection jamming systems for US Air Force A-10 aircraft and most models of the F-16 aircraft.  This upgrade to the electronic attack pod is necessary to keep pace with adversary technological advances in surface-to-air and air-to-air missile systems.  Digital Radio Frequency Memory (DRFM) allows an electronic system to digitally record and store characteristics of received signals in order to produce a jamming pulse that more precisely replicates the threat systems pulse.  With the current/near term threat systems the A-10 and F-16 are likely to encounter, this level of fidelity is necessary to effectively protect these aircraft in this increasingly lethal environment.  This PE is in Budget Activity 7 - Operational System Development because it supports upgrade development of the A-10 and F-16 EA pods which are fielded systems.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The A-10 is an essential component of successful joint air operations representing a crucial component of the Combat Air Forces (CAF) force structure. The A-10 concept of operations requires a flexible, adaptable and survivable weapon system providing close-air support, combat search and rescue, and special operations capabilities. Current high operational tempo experienced by the Expeditionary Air Force requires the A-10 to perform effectively in a variety of operational roles. The A-10 must conduct around-the-clock air operations under various weather conditions against numerous enemy threats employing a full spectrum of air defense systems. 

FY 2014 RDT&amp;E funds address evolving and continuing user requirements that must be incorporated within the Operational Flight Program (OFP) in order to operate improving weapons and targeting capabilities as they become available. User requirements are formally reviewed for incorporation with a 2-year release cycle.  These requirements address hardware and software OFP deficiencies. Final integration of hardware and software requirements into a unified release occurs after rigorous testing, validation and verification using software integration laboratories (SIL), field representative assets, and production representative assets. Results of previously planned developmental and modernization actions provide the A-10 with new combat capabilities that employ a variety of smart weapons, improved situational awareness, and enhanced target identification and designation capability. The funds budgeted in the near term provide development of a SIL in support of the transition to organic software development.  These funds also provide updates and integration of the aircraft OFP (Suites 8, 9, and 10), weapons integration, targeting pod updates and integration, communication/navigation/datalink improvements (e.g. Mode 5, Combatant Survivor Evader Locator (CSEL), Anti-Jam Embedded Global Positioning System/Inertial Navigation System (Embedded GPS/ INS),  Improved Data Modem (IDM), etc.), self-protection integration (e.g. Electronic Protection, self-protection flares/chaff, Radar Warning Receiver, etc.), and Full Mission Trainer (FMT) concurrency development.  Ongoing planning activities will continue to address diminishing manufacturing sources and obsolescence issues as required and provide replacement capabilities.  

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Prior to FY 2009, A-10 OFP development efforts were conducted under the A-10 Prime Contract, awarded to Lockheed Martin Systems Integration in December 1997 through a full-and-open competition.  Suite 8 development efforts began in FY12, with lab development and stand-up beginning in FY11 as A-10 OFP suites development and sustainment efforts transitioned from contractual work by Lockheed Martin to organic work by 309th Software Maintenance Group (SMxG) at Hill AFB.  All additional suites beyond 8 will be performed by the 309th SMxG until directed otherwise.  The A-10 FMT simulator OFP is managed by the Simulator Division at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and is contractor developed and integrated.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The F-16 Fighting Falcon is the world's premier multi-mission fighter.  It is a fixed-wing, high performance, single-engine fighter aircraft.  In its 35-year history, the F-16 has proven itself in combat in a variety of air-to-air and air-to-surface missions such as offensive and defensive counter-air, close air support, forward air control, air interdiction (day/night and all-weather) and suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD)/destruction of enemy air defenses (DEAD).  Also during these years the aircraft has evolved in its capabilities to exploit the advances made in computer, avionics systems, engine, and structures technologies.  The F-16 has been selected by more than 20 air forces around the world and foreign military sales production continues in the 21st century. AFLCMC/WWM (The F-16 System Program Office) develops, integrates, and qualifies systems to enhance the overall performance of the F-16 mission.  Enhancements which are being or will be developed during the Five Year Defense Plan (FYDP) include:  

a. Operational Flight Program (OFP) Development:  Blk 40-52 OFP (M-tapes) are updated continually to integrate new precision weapons, advanced targeting pods, improved avionics, hardware and software mods to keep F-16 training simulators current,  and other hardware (HW) Group B subsystems.  Major tapes (e.g., M6/6+) are released every three years and a minor tape (e.g., M6.2+) is released 1 year after each major tape.  The European Participating Air Forces (EPAF) countries participate in the development of M-tapes and share the cost of developing common capabilities and totally fund development of their unique capabilities.  Generally, three major or minor tapes are under development/testing at any one time.  Extensive ground and flight testing is required to field each M-tape.  Advanced weapons integration includes joint air-to-surface stand-off missile (JASSM) and joint direct attack munitions (JDAM, Laser JDAM), small diameter bomb (SDB and SDB II), advanced medium range air-to-air missile (AMRAAM) AIM-120D, Sidewinder (AIM-9X/AIM-9X Block II), and updates to existing weapons.  JASSM-ER (Extended Range) integrates JASSM-ER on F-16 Blk 40-50 aircraft, includes NRE, SEEK EAGLE, test assets, integration, and test. Weapons integration also includes tasks such as performing risk reduction activities on advanced weapon integration, developing and integrating advanced racks, pylons, adapters, and the universal armament interface (UAI), and ensuring nuclear surety, safety and compatibility. Updates to electronic warfare systems allow for incorporation of latest updates for changing threat environment reducing war fighter vulnerabilities.  Link 16 provides the F-16s with a secure, jam resistant, high-capacity data communications link with other combat aircraft, airborne control aircraft, and ground control centers.  Major new capabilities currently being integrated via M-tapes include GPS inertial navigation set (GPS/INS) updates to improve targeting accuracy and GPS security, EGBU-12 (laser/GPS guided bomb), Mode 5 identification friend or foe (IFF), SDB with UAI, AIM-120D, joint mission planning system (JMPS), and Alpha II Lite.  As part of OFP transition and M6.5/M7+ OFP upgrade, Lockheed Martin Aeronautics (LM Aero) and Ogden Air Logistics Center will split responsibility for software development.  LM Aero will produce the common USAF/EPAF core software tape for USAF M6.5+ and serve as the baseline for the USAF M7+ OFP. OO-ALC will have software development responsibility for the M7+ software/hardware candidates being incorporated on USAF jets with M7+ Phase III OFP development scheduled to field in FY16.  M8+ will be the initial CAPES OFP. 
 
b. F-16 Blk 40-52 Legacy SLEP structures: includes full scale durability test (FSDT) which requires a test fixture and structural analysis to begin structural testing.  The test fixture began fabrication in FY11. FSDT is intended to determine whether the F-16 Block 40-52 airworthiness certification can be extended from the current certified service life of 8,000 equivalent flight hours (EFH) to 10,000+ EFH.  In accordance with the Aircraft Structural Integrity Program (ASIP) and MIL-STD 1530C, testing will support Blk 40-52 structural upgrade program that replaces or reworks known life-limited structure to preclude the onset of widespread fatigue damage, maintain safety of flight and enhance aircraft availability beyond 8,000 hours.  Engineering, Manufacturing and Development (EMD) extends through FY16. 

c. F-16 Blk 40-52 Combat Avionics Programmed Extension Suite (CAPES): This avionics modernization program is needed to keep the F-16 Blk 40-52 aircraft viable in the threat environment beyond 2025.  It includes but is not limited to an active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar that offers improved destruction of enemy air defenses (DEAD), and advanced electronic protection capabilities as well as improved reliability and maintainability; center display unit (CDU), which replaces the existing flight instrument cluster with a large higher resolution color multi-function display; electronic warfare suite (EW), which provides a single-point access for automated or hands-on EW system control; and an integrated broadcast service (IBS) that integrates multiple intelligence broadcasts into a system of systems and migrates tactical receive terminals into a single related joint tactical terminal (JTT) family and modular mission computer (MMC) throughput memory upgrades, high speed data communications within the aircraft systems. FY12 risk reduction funding was available as part of SLEP avionics to initiate this capability modernization. 

d. Auto ground collision avoidance system (AGCAS) builds on the Air Force research laboratories (AFRL) fighter risk reduction program (FRRP) demonstrated capability and results in the AGCAS capability being production ready for incorporation in the M6.2+ OFP fielding in FY14 with potential for nearly eliminating controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) accidents, a leading cause of F-16 loss of pilot and aircraft accidents.

e. EMD hardware/advanced capability improvements:  EMD HW provides funding to develop, test, and qualify, weapon systems, aircraft subsystems replaced or modified due to requirements changes, pre-planned product improvements (P3I), diminishing manufacturing sources (DMS) and parts obsolescence.  The approach to contracting varies by individual project.  These hardware improvements include but are not limited to flight systems, improved navigation, multiplex architecture, modular mission computer (MMC) throughput memory upgrades, high speed data communications within the aircraft systems, embedded GPS inertial navigation set (GPS/INS) updates, Blk 40 air-to-air interrogator (AAI), digital video recorder, advanced data transfer equipment (ADTE) and related data transfer and retrieval devices, display upgrades and display generators, radio/communication studies, and Control Actuation System (CAS) data link. Advanced capability improvements include software integration, sensor upgrades, radar updates and other self-protection/electronic protection (EP) enhancements, 4th/5th gen fighter network communications, lab and/or on-aircraft evaluation of potential subsystem changes/capability improvements on the F-16 as well as establishment of associated requirement specification changes. These capability improvements also fund integration of pods including updates and tech order changes (SNIPER, Harm targeting system (HTS), low (altitude) infrared targeting and navigating (LITENING)) etc. Advanced capabilities also includes integration of new replacement DMS hardware for a crash survivable data recorder. 

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because it includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

CAPES ASP was held Jun 2012 and AESA NTE was received in late CY 2012.  Initial risk reduction efforts require our prime integrator and subsystem vendors to define the F-16 CAPES avionics architecture, determine potential requirements, conduct studies on RF compatibility impacts, and gather assistance to draft the system requirement document (SRD). A flight demo has been initiated to assess CDU system functionality, performance and interfaces to determine unique requirements for the integration of the CDU into an F-16 Block 40/42 aircraft.

                                    <r2:Description>This program will nearly eliminate controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) accidents, a leading cause of F-16 loss of pilots and aircraft accidents.  One study predicted this capability could have saved 10 pilots and 15 aircraft lost from CFIT accidents had it been available.  Air Force 1067 signed by the Combat Air Force Requirements Oversight Council (CAFROC) on 3 Mar 2008 directed development of Auto GCAS for F-16 Blk 40-52 aircraft for fielding with M6.2+.

The requested solution is for Auto GCAS and other flight control safety enhancements identified in Phase II for F-16 Blocks 40-52 aircraft to be integrated and delivered with the M6.2+ OFP in FY14.  The effort is to qualify and release a digital flight control computer (DFLCC) configuration that is backward compatible with M6.1+ F-16 USAF OFP that can initiate DFLCC Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO) upgrades without Auto GCAS in the core avionics.  Production configurations of the remaining software items will be incorporated during the M6.2+ effort and will enable the Auto GCAS function.

The contractor incorporates avionics and flight control requirements or requirement revisions (core avionics, DTS, mission planning and flight control OFPs) into DTO #2.  Key efforts include configuring the Design Try Out (DTO) #2 digital flight control (DFLCC) flight test OFP as a production OFP and formally regression testing it with the F-16 USAF M6.1+ avionics suite so fielding of the DFLCC with an Auto GCAS enabled OFP can be initiated via TCTO prior to fielding with M6.2+ OFP.</r2:Text>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>RDT&amp;E funds will primarily be executed in developing improved capability, maintenance and safety mods.  Operational flight program (OFP) software will be continuously updated to complement modification development efforts.  Starting with M7+ OO-ALC will be primary OFP SW developer.

The F-16 Blk 40-52 Legacy SLEP and CAPES programs will keep the F-16 aircraft viable in the threat environment beyond 2025 by extending the service life and increasing the capabilities of the F-16.  Legacy SLEP EMD runs through FY17. CAPES AESA Radar EMD ends in FY18.

The EMD hardware development line provides funding to develop, test, and qualify aircraft subsystems upgrades, communication upgrades, parts obsolescence and diminishing manufacturing source (DMS). The approach to contracting varies by individual project.  LM Aero is the prime contractor on all systems except the General Electric engines and the Pratt &amp; Whitney engines.  Contract types are Time and Material (T&amp;M), Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF), Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) and Firm Fixed Price (FFP).

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The F-15 is the most versatile fighter in the world today.  The F-15C/D continues to provide air superiority with an undefeated and unmatched aerial combat record.  The F-15E retains this air superiority capability and adds systems, such as advanced imaging and targeting systems, to meet the requirement for all-weather, deep penetration, and night/under-the-weather, air-to-surface attack.  Configured with conformal fuel tanks (CFTs), the F-15E deploys worldwide with minimal tanker support and arrives combat-ready.  A mainstay in operations both domestic and abroad, upgrades to the F-15 (avionics, armament, airframe, and engines) are critical to maintaining combat viability (lethality, survivability, and supportability). Projected to remain in service past 2030, avionics modernization is key to long-term weapon system viability.  This modernization is built on a foundation of technical and acquisition support studies (both internal to the Air Force and through outside contractors), forestalling obsolescence, exploiting proven technological advances, and leveraging new technology.  Major avionics upgrades center around radar modernization (both hardware and software upgrades) and the exploitation of enhanced capability via precision timing, data delivery and processing technology, precision registration systems, cockpit Head Up Display (HUD), instrumentation digitization and modernization, central computer processing power increases, digital mission event recording systems and an infrared (IR) based fire control system.  Funds are also used, as required, to resolve Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues. The proliferation of fourth generation enemy aircraft and sophisticated "double-digit" anti-aircraft missile systems pose a significant threat to F-15 survivability.  A fully integrated electronic warfare suite holds the promise of providing survivability as well as expanded electronic attack capability. Nearly all improvements are linked to an aircraft operational flight program update schedule that works to integrate new capabilities with the airframe.  These updates are a responsive way to increase the offensive and defensive capability and survivability of the F-15.  Incorporation of corresponding spiral and/or phased technology/equipment improvements that include support equipment, mission planning systems, and training device upgrades will improve performance, supportability, and aircrew training


This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This includes development of the F-15E APG-82(V)1 Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar, the F-15C/D and F-15E Advanced Display Core Processor (ADCP) II and the F-15C/D and F-15E Eagle Passive/Active Warning Survivability System (EPAWSS).

The APG-82(V)1 will supply the F-15E with a digital radar that will provide improved range and resolution, as well as a significant improvement in reliability.  This AESA radar has the ability to provide electronic attack and protection capabilities.  

The ADCP II will develop a common mission computer for the F-15C/D and F-15E.  The current mission computers of both platforms have reached their limits of speed, memory and throughput.  Additionally, digital systems have changed the security requirements of both platforms and the older mission computers cannot be upgraded to meet these new requirements.  A common mission computer is expected to reduce overall development costs as well as long term maintenance costs.  The program will also develop a new F-15C/D cockpit display to replace an obsolete one.

EPAWSS will replace the obsolete Tactical Electronic Warfare System (TEWS), which will help the aircraft survive in high threat environments.

                            <r2:ProjectNote>Project 676020 was created in the FY 2012 President's Budget to improve management of F-15 development.  Funds were moved from Project 670131 to Project 676020. </r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This effort includes development of F-15 Electronic Protection (EP) capabilities and provides funding for Operational Flight Program (OFP) upgrades and for Flight Testing.

EP will enhance digital Active Electronic Scanned Array (AESA) radar capabilities to counter sophisticated electronic threats.  The development of F-15 EP will maximize Key System Attibutes (KSA) and EP techniques for F-15E Radar Modernization Program (RMP) in Suite 8E; ensure remaining KSAs and EP techniques for F-15E RMP are included in Suite 9; ensure legacy EP for F-15C APG-63(v)3, commensurate with the APG-63(v)1 radar legacy EP capability, is included in Suite 9; and maximize additional advanced EP for F-15C APG-63(v)3 in Suite 9."  

For the F-15 to maintain operational effectiveness, the program must continuously provide the platforms with improved capabilities.  To accomplish this there is an on-going need to develop software upgrades and to flight test new capabilities and systems.   The OFP funding line allows the Air Force to release software upgrades approximately every 3 years.  At any one time the program has three OFP upgrades in work: one in requirements definition/pricing, one in code writing and test, and one in flight test and release preparation.  The flight Test funding line allows the Air Force to fund the on-going test effort.  

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Manned Destructive Suppression (MDS) program element funds the development, procurement, and sustainment of the Air Force's Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) and Destruction of Enemy Air Defenses (DEAD) capabilities. The F-16 HARM Targeting System (HTS) is currently the only programmed reactive SEAD capability and enables targeting the HARM missile in its most lethal 'range known' mode. The program provides F-16 Block 50/52 and Block 40/42 aircraft with the ability to employ the AN/ASQ-213 Pod. With the introduction of HTS Revision 7 (HTS R7) in 2007, the AN/ASQ-213 Pod now has a precision geo-location capability to target Precision Guided Munitions (PGMs) to destroy fixed and mobile enemy air defense elements.  Additionally, by relocating the AN/ASQ-213 HTS R7 Pod to the aircraft's left inlet hard point, the F-16 can simultaneously carry the HTS R7 Pod and an Advanced Targeting Pod (ATP). HTS R7 fielding is complete and represents the Air Force's near-term solution for reactive time critical targeting for DEAD until this mission can be transferred to F-35 or a yet to be defined system. HTS R7 derived precision targeting data can be provided to all Joint Forces via Link-16. This effort continues preplanned product improvements (P3I) for the HTS and applies technologies similar to those demonstrated in the Advanced Tactical Targeting Technologies (AT3) program and HTS R7 development. 

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Manned Destructive Suppression (MDS) program element funds the development, procurement, and sustainment of the Air Force's Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) and Destruction of Enemy Air Defenses (DEAD) capabilities. The F-16 HARM Targeting System (HTS) is currently the only programmed reactive SEAD capability and enables targeting the HARM missile in its most lethal 'range known' mode. The program provides F-16 Block 50/52 and Block 40/42 aircraft with the ability to employ the AN/ASQ-213 Pod. With the introduction of HTS Revision 7 (HTS R7) in 2007, the AN/ASQ-213 Pod now has a precision geo-location capability to target Precision Guided Munitions (PGMs) to destroy fixed and mobile enemy air defense elements.  Additionally, by relocating the AN/ASQ-213 HTS R7 Pod to the aircraft's left inlet hard point, the F-16 can simultaneously carry the HTS R7 Pod and an Advanced Targeting Pod (ATP). HTS R7 fielding is complete and represents the Air Force's near-term solution for reactive time critical targeting for DEAD until this mission can be transferred to F-35 or a yet to be defined system. HTS R7 derived precision targeting data can be provided to all Joint Forces via Link-16. This effort continues preplanned product improvements (P3I) for the HTS and applies technologies similar to those demonstrated in the Advanced Tactical Targeting Technologies (AT3) program and HTS R7 development. 

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The F-22 Raptor represents the USAF's top priority for providing the Joint Force with air dominance, operational access, homeland and cruise missile defense for the next 20+ years.  The F-22 is a first-of-a-kind multi-mission fighter aircraft that combines stealth, supercruise, advanced maneuverability and integrated avionics to make it the world's most capable combat aircraft.  While F-22 aircraft production has completed as of May 2012, funding for F-22 modernization is "continuing" beyond the FYDP.  The Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) and production phase of F-22 acquisition is complete.  The program is now continuing the pre-planned and evolutionary modernization effort through incremental development phases that enhance the F-22 anti-access, area denial, and Global Strike capability.  The development program modernizes and upgrades the air vehicle, engine, and training systems to improve/enhance F-22 weapons, communications, and Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities.  

BA7- This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Raptor Enhancement Development &amp; Integration (REDI) contract is an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity Ordering contract that maximizes flexibility to start, stop, accelerate and decelerate projects as required. The REDI contract was established to be more responsive to evolving war fighter requirements. The REDI contract allows the issuance of orders for the highest priority war fighter capabilities in operationally meaningful capability increments, requirements analysis, contractor cost estimates and studies, development and demonstration of capability enhancements, and unanticipated future war fighter requirements. Each increment is broken into phases to initiate requirements analysis, the design phase and the development, integration and verification phase of a specific incremental development effort. The (REDI) II contract is a follow-on Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract to the current REDI contract.  REDI II provides maximum flexibility to manage various modernization projects.  The REDI II contract allows for the issuance of orders for efforts associated with the planning, analysis, design, development, qualification ,test and documentation of F-22 weapon system performance enhancements, life-cycle improvements, Operational Flight Program (OFP) upgrades, and associated efforts essential to accomplishing the F-22 mission.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) Program is developing a family of highly common, affordable, next generation, multi-role aircraft to meet the needs of the USMC, USN, USAF and international partners.  The three variants are the F-35A Conventional Takeoff and Landing (CTOL); F-35B Short Takeoff and Vertical Landing (STOVL); and the F-35C Carrier Variant (CV).  Maximum commonality among the variants, consistent with National Disclosure Policy, will minimize life cycle costs.  FY2014 continues EMD development and testing of the F-35.  As the initial capabilities are being delivered from the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) program, capability planning for Follow-on Development (FoD) is underway.  Capability requirements are being assessed and FoD capability planning continues based upon the approved Fifth Generation Fighter Modernization Initial Capabilities Document (ICD), an approved Electronic Warfare ICD, and the results of an OSD Tiger Team Review.   Follow-on Development will provide capability enhancements, required systems upgrades and cost improvements through an incremental acquisition approach.  

Additionally, the Joint Contract Specification requirements call for the F-35A (CTOL) Variant Air Vehicle to have the capabilities and provisions for Dual Capable Aircraft (DCA) operations. DCA refers to the capability to carry and deliver conventional or non-conventional weapons. DCA operation for the F-35A is internal carriage of two B-61s.   

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>F-35 Follow-on Development (FoD) provides continuing incremental upgrades of the three F-35 variants and associated ground equipment.  The FoD acquisition strategy is based upon incremental development of capabilities with each increment consisting of two development cycles.  FoD capability planning includes an efficient transition from F-35 SDD to Follow-on Development.  As SDD development activities ramp down through FY17, the FoD program will assume responsibility for new development and the maintenance of associated developmental infrastructure.    FoD capability planning currently includes Milestone B in late FY15 to enable Block 4 Engineering and Manufacturing Development efforts from FY16 through FY18, followed by DT and OT testing in 2020 with delivery of capabilities in early 2021. A Materiel Development Decision (MDD) formally approving FoD Material Solution Analysis and Technology Development/Risk Reduction phases for technology acquisition is planned in late FY13. 

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

                            <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>This is a joint program with no executive service.  Service Acquisition Executive (SAE) authority alternates between the Department of the Navy and the Department of the Air Force and currently resides with the Navy.  Program Element 0604800N/0604800M continues USN development efforts budgeted in 0603800N prior to FY2002.  The United Kingdom and other International countries are participants in the SDD phase of JSF.

Note:  The USAF/USN/USMC PROCUREMENT lines include Aircraft Procurement and Advanced Procurement only.  Initial Spares and Repair Parts for all Services are reflected in separate lines.  International Partner Funding includes funds provided under the Italy and Netherlands Bilateral agreements.  

RELATED RDT&amp;E:  Funding prior to JSF SDD (FY94-FY01):  USN PE 0603800N $1,950,617; USAF PE 0603800F $1,907,352; DARPA PE 0603800E $118,056; and International Partner contributions of $253.921 for a total of $4,229,896.

</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>To enable the ability to adjust to potential discrepancies discovered during SDD Block 3 Test and Evaluation, the engineering and development planning support for Follow-on Development will be procured under a cost type contract.  A fee provision will be used to target and motivate contractor performance.  A separate Basic Ordering Agreement or Indefinite Quantity/Indefinite Delivery contract is planned to provide a long term approach to upgrading and maintaining laboratories and test aircraft.  Both Development Support and Management Services will primarily use CPFF Delivery Orders.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program will develop and deploy a family of highly common, affordable next generation, stealthy, multi-role strike fighter aircraft that meets the needs of the USN, USAF, USMC and allies with maximum commonality among the variants, consistent with National Disclosure Policy, to minimize life cycle costs. The Joint Contract Specification requirements call for the F-35A (CTOL) Variant Air Vehicle to have the capabilities and provisions for Dual Capable Aircraft (DCA) operations. DCA refers to the capability to carry and deliver conventional or non-convnentional weapons. DCA operation is internal carriage of two non-conventional weapons. In accordance with the Operational Requirements Document, DCA will be integrated in the first post-SDD block upgrade in time to meet Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan force structure requirements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>This effort provides for the assessment of Dual Capable Aircraft (DCA) weapon integration impacts on the Joint
Strike Fighter (JSF) aircraft, early in the weapon design phase. It identifies and avoids potential technical and cost risks, as well
as defining the integration and certification trade-space to field the DCA capability with the B61 weapon. This effort also supports
follow-on risk reduction efforts that will ensure future integration alignment with the first feasible post SDD block upgrade, and is
expected to include full integration efforts pending Service decisions.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The AIM-9X Sidewinder short-range air-to-air missile is a long-term evolution of the AIM-9 series of fielded missiles.  The AIM-9X missile program provides a launch and leave, air combat munition that uses passive infrared (IR) energy for acquisition and tracking of enemy aircraft and complements the Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM).  Air superiority in the short range air-to-air missile arena is essential and includes first-shot, first-kill opportunity against an enemy employing IR countermeasures.  The AIM-9X employs several components common with the AIM-9M (fuse, rocket motor, and warhead).  Anti-Tamper features have been incorporated to protect improvements inherent in this design.  AIM-9X is a Post Milestone III, Acquisition Category 1C (ACAT 1C) joint-service program with Navy lead.

This budget line item will fund the development, test and integration of software updates to the missile, insensitive munitions improvements and aircraft platform integration, to ensure these capabilities perform in accordance with established requirements.

Completion of OT-C1 has been extended from 3rd Qtr FY 2013 to 1st Qtr FY 2014 as a result of the Operational Test Readiness Review (OTRR) held in April 2012.
Updated program requirements leading up to the OTRR (including detailed OT Test Plan development) and provided during the OTRR determined the need to extend the OTC1
period. Begin of DT-D1 has slid from 3rd Qtr FY 2012 to 2nd QTR 2014 to allow completion of OT-C1 activity. Beginning of IT-D1 has slid from 4th Qtr FY 2013 to

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The AIM-9X Sidewinder short-range air-to-air missile is a long-term evolution of the AIM-9 series of fielded missiles.  The AIM-9X missile program provides a launch and leave, air combat munition that uses passive infrared (IR) energy for acquisition and tracking of enemy aircraft and complements the Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM).  Air superiority in the short range air-to-air missile arena is essential and includes first-shot, first-kill opportunity against an enemy employing IR countermeasures.  The AIM-9X employs several components common with the AIM-9M (fuse, rocket motor, and warhead).  Anti-Tamper features have been incorporated to protect improvements inherent in this design.  AIM-9X is a Post Milestone III, Acquisition Category 1C (ACAT 1C) joint-service program with Navy lead.

This budget line item will fund the development, test and integration of software updates to the missile, insensitive munitions improvements and aircraft platform integration, to ensure these capabilities perform in accordance with established requirements.

Completion of OT-C1 has been extended from 3rd Qtr FY 2013 to 1st Qtr FY 2014 as a result of the Operational Test Readiness Review (OTRR) held in April 2012.
Updated program requirements leading up to the OTRR (including detailed OT Test Plan development) and provided during the OTRR determined the need to extend the OTC1
period. Begin of DT-D1 has slid from 3rd Qtr FY 2012 to 2nd QTR 2014 to allow completion of OT-C1 activity. Beginning of IT-D1 has slid from 4th Qtr FY 2013 to
3rd Qtr 2015 to allow for DT-D1 activity to begin. Beginning of OT-D1 has slid from 2nd QTR FY 2015 to 1st QTR 2017 to allow for completion of DT-D1 activity.

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP), LOT 4, Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) contract was awarded in April 2004.  Assistant Secretary of the Navy for (Research Development &amp; Acquisitions) approved the Full-Rate Production (FRP) decision in May 2004.  FRP 1, LOT 5 contract was awarded November 2004.  FRP 1, LOT 5 through FRP 3 LOT 7 contracts were awarded  November 2006.   Rewards or penalties are provided depending on Raytheon Missile Systems  Performance relative to the Procurement Price Commitment Curve (PPCC) for LOTs 5 through 7 (FY 2005 through FY 2007).  FRP 4 LOT 8 (FY 2008) contract was re-negotiated outside of the PPCC, and was awarded in January 2008.  The FRP 5 LOT 9 (FY 2009) contract was awarded in June 2009, and incorporated the new electronics unit into the Captive Air Training Missile resolving critical obsolescence issues, as well as a low quantity of test articles to prove out the capability and producibility of the AIM-9X missile.  The FRP 6 Lot 10 (FY 2010) contract was awarded in June 2010 to procure Block I All Up Round missiles as well as additional tactical test articles.  

Block II: Milestone C decision for LRIP was held on June 24th 2011, and the program has entered into LRIP contracts for Block II in FY 2011 and FY 2012.  The program will enter the final LRIP in FY 2013, followed by Block II full rate production (FRP) in FY 2014 and beyond.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Air Force and Navy continue to develop improvements to the Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM) to counter existing and emerging air vehicle threats operating at high or low altitude, and having advanced Electronic Attack (EA) capabilities. The development program also enables AMRAAM to be compatible with advanced fighters, enhances AMRAAM capability and operational flexibility against current and projected threats, incorporates high payoff technology development, performs risk reduction activities and investigates new variants and/or alternate missions which may use AMRAAM attributes. The latest AMRAAM variant, the AIM-120D, delivers improved performance via Global Positioning System (GPS) aided navigation, a two-way datalink capability for enhanced aircrew survivability and improved network compatibility, and incorporates new guidance software which improves kinematic performance and weapon effectiveness. The AIM-120D Operational Test Readiness Review was successfully completed in May 2012 and the program is in dedicated Operational Testing (OT).  The aircraft integration program maintains compatibility/performance of the missile with changes occurring on the F/A-18E/F, F-15C/D/E, F-16, F-22A, and F-18 C/D platforms.  To keep the existing inventory as effective as possible, the Air Force and Navy also develop, test, and field improvements that are implemented via software upgrades reprogrammed into fielded AMRAAMs (AIM-120As, Bs, and Cs), and/or hardware upgrades inserted into production units.  AMRAAM is a joint Air Force/Navy, Acquisition Category IC (ACAT IC) program with Air Force as lead service. 

This program is in Budget Activity 7-Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The AIM-120D program entered dedicated Operational Testing (OT) in June 2012.  This OT phase will continue into early FY14, with initial fielding by the Air Force and Navy projected in FY14.  Post-OT missile improvements are underway as part of the AIM-120D upgrade program.  The System Improvement Program, Increment 1 (SIP-1) has begun and is expected to field in late FY14.  Additional SIP increments are in the planning phase and will further improve the AIM-120D to meet emerging warfighter requirements.

The Electronic Protection Improvement Program (EPIP) is also underway, with the initial capabilities currently in flight testing.  EPIP Basic capabilities will field in FY14.  The EPIP effort will keep AIM-120C missiles capable against the growing electronic attack threat environment.  Additional capabilities (EPIP Advanced) are in the detail design stage with initial fielding projected for FY15.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS) develops a helmet display system capable of depicting aircraft heading data, pilot's viewing perspective, target indication tracking/cueing, and other information on the aircrew visor to enhance pilot situational awareness.  This display allows the pilot to quickly align platform sensors and weapons on targets, and engage threats using High Off-Boresight System (HOBS) weapons such as the AIM-9X.   

JHMCS is a Post Milestone C, Acquisition Category III (ACAT-III) joint AF/Navy program with the AF as the lead service.  Program is in Full Rate Production (FRP).  Continuing activities include deficiency resolution; improvements to tooling and test equipment; Electronic Unit (EU) obsolescence/Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) redesign; a systems engineering approach for implementing alternate displays; improvements to integrate Night Vision Cueing &amp; Display (NVCD); software updates; platform integration; improvements to Reliability and Maintainability (R&amp;M); system upgrade studies and analysis; other obsolescence upgrades; improved magnetic mapping processes to reduce maintenance manhours/life cycle costs; and efforts to support the transition to depot activation.  

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Air Force Rotary Wing Avionics Development and Integration effort is a program to develop a fully integrated avionics upgrade that includes predictive terrain awareness.   This program focuses on developing and integrating technologies that will increase the situational awareness of helicopter crews in a degraded visibility environment.  This effort was initiated by the Defense Safety Oversight Council.

In FY12, Project Number 657001, Avionics Development and Integration, efforts were transferred from PE 0605229F, CSAR HH-60 Recapitalization, Project Number 657001, Avionics Development and Integration, in order to effectively execute this effort for currently fielded HH-60G helicopters.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Guardian Angel (GA) is an Air Force non-aircraft weapon system within the overarching Battlefield Airmen Modernization program.  GA is a Family of Systems (FoS) based in both human and equipment capabilities formulated to execute Air Force Personnel Recovery (PR) across the full spectrum of military operations.  Established by the Air Force Chief of Staff in 2003 and officially captured in AFPD 10-9, the GA FoS is employed by three distinct Air Force specialties: Pararescuemen (PJ), Combat Rescue Officer (CRO), and Survival, Evasion, Resistance, Escape (SERE).  The GA FoS is comprised of nine critical mission areas:  Precision Aerial Insertion, Information Management, Force Application, Visual Augmentation, Maritime Recovery, Ground Mobility, Technical Rescue, Medical, and SERE.  GA focus is on maintaining legacy weapon system capability while modernizing/improving subsystems for better mission effectiveness.

Funds will be used to obtain significant improvements in operational capability and develop items within the GA FoS to include but not limited to:  SONAR, Maritime Recovery, Technical Recovery, Integrated Oxygen System, Medical Monitoring, and the Guardian Angel Air Operations Kit.  The Guardian Angel weapon system development activities also include studies, analysis, and developmental testing to support both current and future program planning and execution.  Funding will deliver enhanced capability for the dismounted Guardian Angel soldier in terms of dramatic weight reduction and increased mission effectiveness across the conflict spectrum. 

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.  </r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The GA program will address the warfighter immediate needs to standardize, modernize, and develop additional capability for the weapon system used by Combat Rescue Officers and Pararescuemen (Phase one).  Until this point, GA has not had a formal acquisition process for the weapon system.  The program will also address future requirements for the weapon system that will encompass the needs of all three GA career fields (Phase two).  

Phase two of the GA program is an incremental evolutionary acquisition effort in which requirements are fullfilled through further sub-system development and integration.  These requirements are being identified in an ongoing F-study conducted by HQ ACC.  The program has been divided into two phases to more rapidly meet the users immediate need to standardize and modernize the weapon system.  All work prior to FY10 was accomplished using 3400 dollars and NGREA 350 funds.  NGREA funding is not shown here.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Air Force TENCAP is executed by the Space Innovation and Development Center (SIDC) at Schriever Air Force Base, Colorado.  Established by Congress in 1977 as one of a family of service Tactical Exploitation of National Capabilities (TENCAP) programs, AF TENCAP increases warfighter awareness of Space and National capabilities, and promotes cross-domain integration of these systems into military and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) operations through:
1) Exploiting existing Space, National and global ISR, and Non-Traditional ISR (NTISR) for operational and tactical applications by rapidly prototyping projects and demonstrating resulting capabilities (for example Battlefield Airborne Command Node (BACN) Intra-Flight Data Link System (IFDL) project).  Capabilities will be transitioned to warfighters and/or National Intelligence Agencies for operational use, and/or appropriate acquisition organizations for further development.      
2) Influencing the design and operation of future Space, National and global ISR, and NTISR systems  for tactical users.
3) Providing education and training to warfighters and National Intelligence agencies.   

The AF TENCAP Director administers and executes the AF TENCAP program.  The Director coordinates and funds AF TENCAP efforts to provide robust capabilities that enhance support of Joint operations at the tactical level.  

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Projects are selected for development based upon needs identified by the program's customers - DOD Departments, Combatant Commands, Components, MAJCOMs, and/or National Intelligence Agencies.  AF TENCAP projects are approved by the AFTENCAP Director.  Acquisition strategies for projects are chosen on a case-by-case basis for optimum results. Many projects are executed via existing contracts maintained by other agencies; others are executed via Air Force TENCAP contracts established with vendors responding to annual Broad Agency Announcements.  The U.S. government organization sponsoring a project is responsible for assuming acquisition, deployment, logistics, and budgetary responsibilities for the developed capability after it has been successfully demonstrated by Air Force TENCAP.

The Air Force is pursuing a spiral approach to the BIS-MDI segment to rapidly respond to a PACOM  Joint Emerging Operational Need (JEON) capability requirements. Spiral Acquisition utilizes a disciplined systems engineering approach along with a build-test-build-test-deliver which focuses on mitigating cost and schedule risk through a lower risk incremental delivery of mature technologies.

Contracts funded in this program element will be awarded using competitive procedures to the maximum extent possible. Program consists of multiple small projects.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Advanced Targeting Pods (ATPs) provide long-range target acquisition and expanded weapon delivery envelopes for greater aircraft survivability. ATPs feature an infrared (IR) sensor, charged coupled device television (CCD-TV), laser designator, eye-safe laser, laser spot tracker, infrared marker, and real-time video data link for connectivity with ground forces. As non-developmental items, the majority of improvements to ATPs are the result of investments made by industry Internal Research and Development (IRAD).  In addition to operational flight program (OFP) development, this funding provides for the development and integration of capabilities which are either above the capabilities of the industrial base or that require accelerated development timelines in order to meet operational requirements.  It also includes program management support, technical analysis, studies and assessments necessary to support the development and integration of future capabilities.  Data-linking is one such area where there is an identified gap between industrial capabilities and operational requirements. Additional development efforts will be structured to support the documented ATP requirements as well as urgent operational needs (UONs) as they become known.  

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Advanced Targeting Pods (ATPs) provide long-range target acquisition and expanded weapon delivery envelopes for greater aircraft survivability. ATPs feature an infrared (IR) sensor, charged coupled device television (CCD-TV), laser designator, eye-safe laser, laser spot tracker, infrared marker, and real-time video data link for connectivity with ground forces. As non-developmental items, the majority of improvements to ATPs are the result of investments made by industry Internal Research and Development (IRAD).  In addition to operational flight program (OFP) development, this funding provides for the development and integration of capabilities which are either above the capabilities of the industrial base or that require accelerated development timelines in order to meet operational requirements.  It also includes program management support, technical analysis, studies and assessments necessary to support the development and integration of future capabilities.  Data-linking is one such area where there is an identified gap between industrial capabilities and operational requirements. Additional development efforts will be structured to support the documented ATP requirements as well as urgent operational needs (UONs) as they become known.  

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The EC-130H COMPASS CALL is the USAF's wide-area, airborne Command and Control Warfare/Information Operations (C2W/IO) weapon system.   The employment of this system interdicts our adversary's use of the electronic battlespace and is a key active component in the information battlespace and prosecution of overseas contingency operations.  EC-130H COMPASS CALL's sophisticated electronic combat system is capable of surgical denial or disruption of adversary radio frequency (RF) communications systems and sensors.  The system was fielded in 1983 and to date has evolved through the Block 35/Baseline 1 configuration.  Due to the rapid advances in electronic attack technology, the EC-130H COMPASS CALL was designed to be easily modified and must continue to modernize and evolve to keep pace with adversary tactics and emerging technologies.  Continuous system development is required to maintain battlespace superiority.  

The EC-130H COMPASS CALL program employs an incremental development and fielding strategy that puts capability into the warfighters hands as soon as practical and ensures each iteration of the weapon system is effective against the highest priority threats.  To sustain that process requires a steady stream of system development funds.  Development funds are required to accomplish subsystem additions and improvements such as the digital signal analysis and exciter subsystem (AXE), the Special Purpose Emitter Array (SPEAR), Integrated Modern Communication Receiver, the Human-to-Machine Interface (HMI), network centric operations, phased array transmit and receive apertures and other classified hardware and software developments necessary to counter military and commercial communications evolutions, command and control operations enhancements, and new/emerging sensor developments.  Funding in FY 2014 is required to support RDT&amp;E efforts for Baseline 3 (BL3) upgrades to the EC-130H COMPASS CALL fleet.  The BL2 and BL3 programmed requirements have advanced significantly over the two previously fielded baselines.  BL2 and BL3 upgrades will help cover the electronic attack shortfall in the coming years.  Obsolescence and diminishing manufacturing sources (DMS) are addressed with each baseline upgrade as well as annually as part of the sustainment responsibilities.  

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current and future program planning and execution.  

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The EC-130H COMPASS CALL is the USAF's wide-area, airborne Command and Control Warfare/Information Operations (C2W/IO) weapon system.   The employment of this system interdicts our adversary's use of the electronic battlespace and is a key active component in the information battlespace and prosecution of Overseas Contingency Operations.  EC-130H COMPASS CALL's sophisticated electronic combat system is capable of surgical denial or disruption of adversary radio frequency (RF) communications systems and sensors.  The system was fielded in 1983 and to date has evolved through the Block 35/Baseline 1 configuration.  Due to the rapid advances in electronic attack technology, the EC-130H COMPASS CALL was designed to be easily modified and must continue to modernize and evolve to keep pace with adversary tactics and emerging technologies.  Continuous system development is required to maintain battlespace superiority.  

The EC-130H COMPASS CALL program employs an incremental development and fielding strategy that puts capability into the warfighters hands as soon as practical and ensures each iteration of the weapon system is effective against the highest priority threats.  To sustain that process requires a steady stream of system development funds.  Development funds are required to accomplish subsystem additions and improvements such as the digital signal analysis and exciter subsystem (AXE), the Special Purpose Emitter Array (SPEAR), Integrated Modern Communication Receiver, the Human-to-Machine Interface (HMI), network centric operations, phased array transmit and receive apertures and other classified hardware and software developments necessary to counter military and commercial communications evolutions, command and control operations enhancements, and new/emerging sensor developments.  Funding in FY 2014 is required to support RDT&amp;E efforts for Baseline 3 (BL3) upgrades to the EC-130H COMPASS CALL fleet.  The BL2 and BL3 programmed requirements have advanced significantly over the two previously fielded baselines.  BL2 and BL3 upgrades will help cover the electronic attack shortfall in the coming years.  Obsolescence and diminishing manufacturing sources (DMS) are addressed with each baseline upgrade as well as annually as part of the sustainment responsibilities.  

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current and future program planning and execution.  

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Aircraft Engine Component Improvement Program (CIP) provides the only source of critical sustaining engineering support for in-service Air Force engines to maintain flight safety (highest priority), to correct service revealed deficiencies, to improve system operational readiness (OR) and reliability &amp; maintainability (R&amp;M), to reduce engine Life Cycle Cost (LCC), and to sustain engines throughout their service life.  Historically, aircraft systems change missions, tactics, and environments (including new fuels) to meet changing threats throughout their lives.  New technical problems can develop in the engines through actual use and Engine CIP provides the means to develop fixes for these field problems.  Engine CIP funding is driven by field events and types/maturity of engines, not by the total engine quantity.  The program starts with government acceptance of the first procurement-funded engine and continues over the engine's life, gradually decreasing to a minimum level (safety/depot repairs) sufficient to keep older inventory engines operational.  Engine CIP, through "Lead the Fleet" operational use and accelerated mission testing, identifies and fixes engine-related problems ahead of operational impacts.  Engine CIP addresses out-of-warranty usage/life and enables the Air Force to obtain additional warranties when manufacturers incorporate Engine CIP improvements into production engines.  Engine CIP ensures continued improvements in engine R&amp;M, which reduce out year support costs.  Historically, R&amp;M related Engine CIP efforts significantly reduce out year Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) and spares costs.  Without Engine CIP, out year support funding would have to be significantly increased. 

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The F135 Aircraft Engine Component Improvement Program (CIP) supports F-35 propulsion systems.  It provides the only source of critical sustaining engineering support for in-service Air Force propulsion systems.  Engine CIP maintains flight safety (highest priority), to correct service revealed deficiencies, to improve system Operational Readiness (OR) and Reliability &amp; Maintainability (R&amp;M), to reduce propulsion system Life Cycle Cost (LCC), and sustain the propulsion systems throughout the service life.  Historically, aircraft systems change missions, tactics, and environment (including new fuels) and meet changing threats throughout their lives.  New technical problems can develop in the propulsion system through actual use and the Engine CIP provides the means to develop fixes for these field problems.  Engine CIP funding is driven by field events and type/maturity of the propulsion systems, not by the total quantity.  The program starts with government acceptance of the first procurement-funded engine and continues over the propulsion system's life, gradually decreasing to a minimum level (safety/depot repairs) sufficient to keep older inventory propulsion systems operational.  Engine CIP, through "Lead the Fleet" operational use and accelerated mission testing, identifies and fixes propulsion-related problems ahead of operational impacts.  Engine CIP addresses out-of-warranty usage/life and enables the Air Force to obtain additional warranties when manufacturers incorporate Engine CIP improvements into production propulsion systems.  Engine CIP ensures continued improvements in R&amp;M, which reduce out year support costs.  Historically, R&amp;M related Engine CIP efforts significantly reduce out year O&amp;M and spares costs.  Without Engine CIP, out year support funding would have to be significantly increased.  

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) program provides a long range, conventional air-to-surface, autonomous, precision-guided, standoff cruise missile compatible with fighter and bomber aircraft able to attack a variety of fixed or relocatable targets.  There are two variants of the JASSM missile; JASSM baseline and JASSM-Extended Range (JASSM-ER). Both have improved reliability, separate milestone decision points and separate projects within a single program element. Aircraft integration of baseline JASSM is complete on the B-52H, F-16 (Block 50), B-1, B-2 and F-15E.  Objective aircraft include the F-16 (Block 40) and F-35.  Aircraft integration for JASSM-ER is the B-1B.  Objective aircraft is the B-52H, F16C/D (Block 50/52), B-2, F-16C/D(Block25-42), F-15E, and F-35.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because it includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been developed.

This project develops the baseline JASSM missile.  Aircraft integration of the baseline JASSM is complete on the B-52H, F-16 (Block 50), B-1, B-2, and F-15E.  Objective aircraft include the F-16 (Block 40), and F-35.  The government is buying the JASSM system based on a contractor-developed, government-approved System Performance Specification (SPS), this SPS is on contract.  The contractor assumes total system performance responsibility (TSPR) for Lots 1-6 as defined in the SPS; for Lot 7 and beyond, the Government has approval authority of Class I configuration changes. This project also develops improvements to the JASSM and JASSM-ER fuze, including the development of the Electronic Safe and Arm Fuze (ESAF). The program is evaluating Diminishing Manufacturing Sources Material Shortages (DMSMS) and several obsolescence issues.

BA7- This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides a long range (over twice the range of baseline JASSM), conventional air-to-surface, autonomous, precision-guided, low observable, standoff cruise missile compatible with fighter and bomber aircraft.  This project develops the extended range version of the JASSM missile (JASSM-ER).  The threshold integration platform for JASSM-ER is the B-1B.  Objective aircraft is the B-52H, F16C/D (Block 50/52), B-2, F-16C/D Block25-42), F-15E, and F-35.  JASSM-ER provides the capability to attack a variety of high value fixed or relocatable targets with precision, through preplanned missions or target-of-opportunity, deeper into enemy territory than JASSM Baseline while minimizing the threat to launch aircraft.  The Air Force is developing JASSM-ER based on a contractor-developed, government-approved System Performance Specification (SPS) Rev B dated February 28, 2007, which was updated under JASSM-ER development Phase II System Development and Demonstration in FY07, and Milestone (MS-C) in January 2011.  The 16 JASSM-ER OT flights were successfully completed in the 4th quarter of FY12.  JASSM-ER performed at 100% (16/16).  This project develops a Common Telemetry Instrumentation Kit (C-TIK) which will be used during flight testing and will be common to both JASSM Baseline and JASSM-ER.  The ESAF Fuze is partially executed under this project as it is common to JASSM baseline and JASSM-ER. The JASSM program is evaluating Diminishing Sources Material Shortages (DMSMS) and several obsolescence issues.

BA7- This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

AOC Inc 10.2 is PRCP Program Number (PNO) N42.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Air and Space Operations Center Weapon System (AOC WS) program element provides development of Command and Control (C2) capabilities across the entire spectrum of air and space operations from the strategic to the tactical level.  There are four funded projects within the AOC WS program element:
 
Integration Development supports the AOC WS, AN-USQ-163 Falconer, the senior element of the Theater Air Control System (TACS).  AOC WS is the weapon system the Commander, Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR) provides the Combined/Joint Force Air Component Commander (C/JFACC) for planning, executing and assessing theater-wide air and space operations.  In FY 2014, project number 675117, Integration Development, AOC Increment 10.2 efforts transferred to PE 0604458F, AOC Increment 10.2, project number 644945, AOC Increment 10.2, in order to improve transparency for this major program.

Applications Development provides worldwide operational level C2 capabilities, which include: air battle planning, management, and execution; operational level C2 of Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD); as well as personnel recovery C2 in support of DoD, Coalition Partners, and other government agencies.  In FY 2014, the Personnel Recovery Command and Control (PRC2) efforts transferred from project number 675218, Applications Development, to project number 675221, Personnel Recovery Command and Control (PRC2), in order to improve transparency for this Joint use application.

Unit Level (UL) supports two primary mission areas: UL Operations software systems provide both the scheduling and mission preparation activities at the wing and squadron level and the capabilities to report and track the success of each mission and influence decisions on future Air Battle Planning to refine future missions.  UL intelligence capabilities ensure detailed threat, target and imagery information readily available to mission commanders and aircrews planning current flight operations. 

Personnel Recovery Command and Control (PRC2): Provides an adaptive, networked, decentralized and situationally-appropriate personnel recovery command and control system which supports personnel accountability and recovery missions worldwide.  PRC2 delivers a globally accessible, collaborative, interoperable and integrated system to prevent, prepare for and respond to isolating events across the Range of Military Operation in the joint/coalition operating environment.  The system collects, stores and delivers personnel/identity biometric data, emergency locator beacon registrations, isolated personnel reports, evasion plans of action, incident reports and other information management capabilities for predictive, preventive and personnel vulnerability analysis/assessment in support of Personnel Recovery across Department of Defense and other national and international entities.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, these budget activities includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

                            <r2:ProjectNote>In FY 2014, project number 675117, Integration Development, AOC Increment 10.2 efforts were transferred to PE 0604458F, AOC Increment 10.2, project number 644945, AOC Increment 10.2, in order to improve transparency for this major program.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Air Operations Center Weapons System (AOC WS), AN/USQ-163 Falconer, the senior element of the Theater Air Control System (TACS), is the weapon system the Commander, Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR) provides the Combined/Joint Force Air Component Commander (C/JFACC) for planning, executing, and assessing theater-wide air and space operations.  The C/JFACC provides air, space and cyber support to the Combined/Joint Forces Commander (C/JFC) by coordinating, deconflicting and assessing the progress of various weapon systems to advance the C/JFC's campaign.  The AOC WS develops operations strategy and planning documents.  The weapon system also disseminates tasking orders; executes day-to-day peacetime and combat air, space and cyber operations; and provides rapid reaction to immediate situations by exercising positive control of friendly forces. 

The AOC Integration Development program keeps the AOC interoperable, certified, supportable, and compliant through the integration, testing and fielding of new capabilities and sustainment upgrades to the AOC WS baseline.  The program supports mission requirements at Geographic and Functional AOCs, as well as Support and Manpower Augmentation units.  To keep the AOC current and interoperable with the COCOMs, cyber requirements, and fifth generation weapon system/weapons, the AOC WS program plans to evolve the AOC through the integration and test of progressively improving capabilities.  These activities ensure a system of systems engineering perspective for the AOC WS, and include weapon system standardization activities as defined by AOC WS requirements documents.  Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) establishes critical IAMD improvements in the AOC WS to maximize the allocation, planning, and execution of IAMD.  The Modernization contractor, which was awarded the Modernization contract on 25 October 2011, has commenced with AOC 10.2 pre-Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) activities, including a Systems Requirements Review (SRR), an Interim Design Review (IDR), and a delta-Preliminary Design Review (delta-PDR).  In accordance with AOC 10.2 Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) direction (23 Jun 2010), the AOC 10.2 Modernization program will conduct prototyping and Limited Early Install (LEI) activities through an iterative build methodology prior to Milestone B (MS B) to reduce integration risk and improve user feedback in the acquisition process.  AOC 10.2 EMD activities include the design (i.e., Critical Design Review), development, integration of 3rd party capabilities, testing (Contractor in-plant system testing, DT&amp;E, OT&amp;E, Operational Assessment, Test Readiness Review, etc.) of the AOC 10.2 baseline, as well as build-up and fielding of the Help Desk (HD), Formal Training Unit (FTU) and Combined Air Operations Center-eXperimental (CAOC-X) suite.

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution, as well as future program planning.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The acquisition strategy builds on existing capabilities using evolutionary acquisition to standardize, modernize and sustain the AOC.  The AOC Modernization Contract was competitively awarded on 25 October 2011, but due to contract protests and associated delays, the actual start date was 20 December 2011.  The Modernization contractor is using a system of systems perspective, and is following systems engineering rigor, to evolve AOC to a Net-Centric environment, compliant with DoD Services Oriented Architecture (SOA) standards.  </r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>In FY 2014, the Personnel Recovery Command and Control (PRC2) efforts transferred from project number 675218, Applications Development, to project number 675221, Personnel Recovery Command and Control (PRC2), in order to improve transparency for this Joint use application.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This budget activity funds operational development necessary to acquire, modify, and sustain segments of Air Force's Command and Control (C2) capabilities and services.  Applications Development provides worldwide operational capabilities for AF C2 in support of DoD, Coalition Partners, and other government agencies.  These efforts focus on, but are not limited to, support of the Combined/Joint Force Air Component Commander (C/JFACC) that provides air, space and cyber support as presented to the Air Operations Center (AOC) and to other C2 systems.  Applications Development activities include but are not limited to the following: 1) Command and Control Air Operations Suite-Command and Control Information Services Increment I (C2AOS-C2IS Inc I) creates web-enabled information services to expose air operations data using standardized schemas, such as those developed by the Air Operations Community of Interest (AO COI).  C2AOS-C2IS Inc I also develops, matures, fields, and maintains modular net-centric C2 applications for air battle planning, execution, and management functions; 2) Command and Control Air Operations Suite-Command and Control Information Services Increment II (C2AOS-C2IS Inc II) will focus on but not be limited to, the remainder of Theater Battle Management Core Systems-Force Level (TBMCS-FL) functionality not addressed in C2AOS-C2IS Inc I requirements as well as providing new C2 capabilities for planning and execution of 4th &amp; 5th Generation Fighter Platforms, Network Enabled Weapons (NEW), interoperability with other evolving Global Command &amp; Control System Family of Systems (GCCS FoS) and other Service programs, and for Force Level data migration; and 3) Personnel Recovery Command and Control (PRC2) program which develops and delivers tools and services for collaborating, planning and managing search and rescue efforts, and disseminating related information

Core activities for Applications Development include but are not limited to the following: 1) developing capabilities to support planning and replanning of the Air Battle Plan; generation and dissemination of the Air Tasking Order; defense planning and execution; targeting; weaponeering; personnel recovery tasks; other applications and services supporting C2 in the joint environment; 2) providing support to and participating in the AO COI to improve air operations information interoperability among all joint and coalition systems within the AO domain; 3) developing and assessing C2 air, space, intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and cyber technologies that will improve joint and coalition warfighter interoperability, including participation in North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and Coalition interoperability exercises, demonstrations, trials, and activities; 4) transitioning existing C2 capabilities to a net-centric environment; and 5) improving operational level C2 of Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD).  Applications Development efforts include evaluation and maturation of future air, space, and cyber C2 concepts identified through research, risk reduction, prototyping, current operations, exercises, and demonstrations.  

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution, as well as future program planning.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Unit Level / Unit Command and Control (UL/UC2) program develops, integrates, fields, and maintains an evolving sequence of increasing software capabilities that support the execution of the air battle plan and the air tasking order message received from the Air Operations Center (AOC).  UL/UC2 operations software systems provide both the scheduling and mission preparation activities at the wing, group and squadron level, and the capabilities to report and track the success of each mission and influence decisions on future air battle planning.  UL/UC2 intelligence capabilities ensure detailed threat, target and imagery information are made available to mission commanders and aircrews planning current flight operations.  At many bases, UL/UC2 is fielded to the Wing Operations Center (WOC), the Maintenance Operations Center (MOC), the Squadron Operations Center (SOC), and many other work-centers.

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution, as well as future program planning.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

                            <r2:ProjectNote>In FY 2014, project number 675221, Personnel Recovery Command and Control (PRC2) efforts were transferred from project number 675218, Applications Development, in order to improve transparency for this Joint use application.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This budget activity funds operational development necessary to acquire, modify, and sustain a segment of Air Force's Command and Control (C2) capabilities and services associated with Personnel Recovery.  The Personnel Recovery Command and Control (PRC2) program develops and delivers tools and services for planning, collaborating and managing search and rescue efforts, and disseminating related information.  PRC2 provides an adaptive, networked, decentralized and situationally-appropriate personnel recovery command and control system which supports personnel accountability and recovery missions worldwide.  PRC2 delivers a globally accessible, collaborative, interoperable and integrated system to prevent, prepare for and respond to isolating events across the Range of Military Operation in the joint/coalition operating environment.  The system collects, stores and delivers personnel/identity biometric data, emergency locator beacon registrations, isolated personnel reports, evasion plans of action, incident reports and other information management capabilities for predictive, preventive and personnel vulnerability analysis/assessment in support of Personnel Recovery across Department of Defense and other national and international entities.  Future capabilities and upgrades will incorporate several mission threads capable of sharing important data to Recovery Coordinators located in the Air Operations Center (AOC) as well as Area of Responsibility (AoR) which will expedite initial recovery planning processes.

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution, as well as future program planning.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY 2012, Project 5294, Theater Control System Improvement-Radar (TACSI-R) efforts transferred to PE 0604283F, Battle Management Command &amp; Control (BMC2) Sensor Development, Project 6002, Three Dimensional Expeditionary Long Range Radar in order to provide this pre-Major Defense Acquisition Program its own Program Element.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Control and Reporting Center (CRC) program element provides development and modernization of mobile ground-based capabilities.  The CRC is a ground-based theater air control system (TACS) surveillance and battle management command and control (BMC2) element. It consists of facilities, equipment, and people.  It is a tailorable, modular, transportable, sustainable, and persistent weapon system employed at the tactical level to support air and surface operations.   The CRC projects include development of Theater Air Control Systems Improvement (TACSI) capabilities.  Currently USAF CRCs are fully employed in Operations ENDURING FREEDOM, and NOBLE EAGLE.  The TACSI project develops and modernizes software and hardware to ensure the CRC remains a robust BMC2 element.  These efforts include, but are not limited to, the development and modernization of the  AN/TYQ-23 Operations Module (OM) and the AN/TRC-215 Remote Radio Secure Voice System (RRSVS).

AN/TYQ-23 OM is a low source/high demand (LS/HD) rapidly deployable ground-based C2 asset.  This automated, computer-based information system provides operators the real-time battlespace picture necessary to plan, direct, and control tactical air operations and airspace management tasks.  AN/TRC-215 RRSVS is a mobile, vehicle-mounted voice radio and OM-interface unit.  The RRSVS allows real-time, secure voice communication between aircraft operating in the battlespace and ground-based battle management C2 operators located in the OM of the CRC. Activities to include: studies and analysis supporting current and future program planning/future development open system architecture requirements. 

OMs and RRSVS units are currently deployed world-wide in support of ongoing operations.  

Activities also include studies and analysis supporting current and future program planning and future development of open system architecture requirements.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Control and Reporting Center (CRC) program element provides development and modernization of mobile ground-based capabilities.  The CRC is a ground-based theater air control system (TACS) surveillance and battle management command and control (BMC2) element. It consists of facilities, equipment, and people.  It is a tailorable, modular, transportable, sustainable, and persistent weapon system employed at the tactical level to support air and surface operations.   The CRC projects include development of Theater Air Control Systems Improvement (TACSI) capabilities.  Currently USAF CRCs are fully employed in Operations ENDURING FREEDOM, and NOBLE EAGLE.  The TACSI project develops and modernizes software and hardware to ensure the CRC remains a robust BMC2 element.  These efforts include, but are not limited to, the development and modernization of the  AN/TYQ-23 Operations Module (OM) and the AN/TRC-215 Remote Radio Secure Voice System (RRSVS).

AN/TYQ-23 OM is a low source/high demand (LS/HD) rapidly deployable ground-based C2 asset.  This automated, computer-based information system provides operators the real-time battlespace picture necessary to plan, direct, and control tactical air operations and airspace management tasks.  AN/TRC-215 RRSVS is a mobile, vehicle-mounted voice radio and OM-interface unit.  The RRSVS allows real-time, secure voice communication between aircraft operating in the battlespace and ground-based battle management C2 operators located in the OM of the CRC. Activities to include: studies and analysis supporting current and future program planning/future development open system architecture requirements. 

OMs and RRSVS units are currently deployed world-wide in support of ongoing operations.  

Activities also include studies and analysis supporting current and future program planning and future development of open system architecture requirements.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Mission: AWACS is the premier airborne platform providing command and control (C2)/battle management (BM) for Commander In Chief and combatant commander tasking in joint, allied, and coalition operations, humanitarian relief, and homeland defense. AWACS provides a real-time picture of friendly, neutral, and hostile air activity. Its capabilities include all-altitude/all-weather surveillance of the battle space; early warning of enemy actions; a real-time ability to find, fix, track, and assess airborne or maritime threats; and detection, location, and identification of electronic emitters.

This program element funds four areas in support of the AWACS program:  1. AWACS Modernization, 2. AWACS Infrastructure and Support Systems, 3. Material Solutions Development and Analysis, and 4. Program Management and Administration (PMA). The first three areas include studies and analysis to support both current planning and execution, as well as future program planning.

1. AWACS Modernization (RDT&amp;E, AF):

a. Block 40/45 is replacing AWACS 1970's vintage mission systems that are experiencing Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues, are difficult and expensive to upgrade, and limit overall AWACS system performance. The Block 40/45 upgrade will improve integration, quality and timeliness of sensor data to the shooter, improve Combat Identification (CID), improve AWACS contribution to Time Critical Targeting via Data Link Infrastructure (DLI), improve electronic support measures processing and enable more effective, faster upgrades via an open-system, Ethernet-based architecture. The upgrade will also update the ground support infrastructure including training systems.

b. The Next Generation Identification Friend or Foe (NGIFF) Program provides AWACS with enhanced IFF interrogator operation to add a more secure Mode 5 capability. NSA declared IFF Mode 4 unsecure and obsolete on 5 Nov 2003. Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memo 047-07 requires IFF Mode 5 interrogation capability by FY14. The new Mode 5 interrogation capability extends the effective range of the AWACS interrogator, while helping discriminate against closely spaced cooperative targets. NGIFF developed and integrated a basic Mode 5 capability on Block 30/35 starting in FY09 and began developing a full Mode 5 capability on Block 40/45 in FY11. Hardware will be common between the Block 30/35 and Block 40/45 platforms. NGIFF will also integrate Mode S, a civilian air traffic control capability residing in the NGIFF hardware, as funding allows.

c. DMS Replacement of Avionics for Global Operations and Navigation (DRAGON) completes the FAA/International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)/ EUROCONTROL air traffic control mandated safety of flight capabilities. This program will provide the E-3 fleet with the flight instruments and other avionics for the Required Navigation Performance (RNP), and the surveillance and communication capabilities necessary to maintain continued critical unrestricted access to global airspace. Non-compliance will result in airspace restrictions and denials that will impact AWACS ability to support worldwide responses to situations requiring immediate on-scene C2 BM. The DRAGON modifications replace the existing DMS Global Positioning System (GPS) Integrated Navigation System (GINS) with a modern Flight Management System (FMS) that will accommodate new capabilities including Mode 5 IFF and Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS). Also included as part of the modification is the addition of data link communications, voice and data link digital radios, and improved visual displays. Emphasis on employment of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) avionics is expected to lower cost, reduce the tech refresh cycle, and enhance life cycle management. Replacement of critical avionics subsystems that became unsustainable beginning in 2010 is included in the DRAGON program. The Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase of DRAGON is being executed as a Cooperative Program between the US and NATO.

d. The Flight Performance Software (FPS) program automates calculations currently performed manually by the pilot and flight engineer in accordance with the E-3B and C flight manual.  Phase I, automates the Takeoff and Landing Data (TOLD) calculations; Phase II automates the high speed calculation.  Automated calculations, using the original source data used to create the flight manual charts increases safety, improves on time departure/arrival, improves crew efficiency, and reduces tanker support.

e. Electronic Protection (EP): The EP program funds acquisition and retrofit of the E-3 AWACS radar processing capability.  EP will provide improved radar processing in a specific flight environment to meet a classified requirement.  Processing will initially address radar modes comprising 90% of actual operational AWACS radar usage.  EP will install an adjunct processor that works in parallel with the current Radar System Improvement Program (RSIP) system.  The EP-processed radar picture will appear on the operator screen in place of the current RSIP output when the EP radar modes are selected.  The EP program plans for multi-year advanced buys of COTS equipment due to the short life-cycles in high tech components starting in FY17.  The program will buy FY17 and FY18 COTS equipment in FY17 including initial spares.  Equipment non-recurring Group B includes efforts for Tech Refresh, Active DMS and Software Releases.   

2.  AWACS Infrastructure and Support Systems (RDT&amp;E, AF): These efforts synchronize modernization requirements and infrastructure support across the entire weapon system from depot and field test equipment, to maintenance trainers and integration labs.

a.  Training, Support, and Infrastructure (TSI) provides continuing system engineering and management support for AWACS modernization and enhancement. These activities include managing the AWACS developmental infrastructure, AWACS Development Integration Test Support (ADITS), support for equipment concurrency, modernization planning/analysis, trainer/simulator integration and concurrency, as well as the Avionics Integration Laboratory (AIL). The contractor maintained and operated E-3 Radar Systems Integration Lab/Software Development Facility (SIL/SDF) provides US, FMS, and international customers with a functioning E-3 radar configuration to support radar development, production, and sustainment programs.  TSI efforts allow new support equipment technologies and test strategies to be analyzed to ensure concurrent capability to sustain existing, modified, and upgraded E-3 equipment. TSI supports trainer/simulator concurrency analysis and requirements definition to ensure trainers and simulators are kept current with the AWACS baseline. The overall DT&amp;E test infrastructure supports both development and sustainment projects, and maintains facilities to support AWACS aircraft during system and sub-system testing at Boeing Field, WA.  The TSI assets also support multiple international Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&amp;C) projects on a maintenance fee basis, including projects for France, Saudi Arabia, United Kingdom, Japan, and NATO AEW&amp;C efforts.

3.  Material Solutions Development &amp; Analysis (RDT&amp;E, AF): These efforts look toward the future by investigating enhanced capabilities and exploring new mission areas through C2ISR System Development, while advancing the capabilities of the current weapon system through the Support The War Fighter (STWF) effort.

a. C2ISR system improvements investigate and develop future capabilities of the AWACS weapon system, or next C2ISR platform. These efforts also include investigation, analysis and development to ensure that AWACS successfully integrates with joint and coalition forces in a net-centric environment. C2ISR primarily supports pre-systems acquisition in the areas of material solution analysis and technology development. This is accomplished by prototyping and demonstrating capabilities required by the warfighter but also includes developing an E-3 Modernization &amp; Sustainment Roadmap that projects user capability needs, as well as material solutions for the user needs.
 
b. Internet Protocol Enabled Communication (IPEC): IPEC will provide the Block 40/45 E-3 with a wideband communications capability to connect to the Global Information Grid and will support net-centric operations/warfare.  The E-3 lacks an IP-enabled communication capability.  As a result, the E-3 is not able to support a shortened digitized kill-chain of time sensitive targets.  IPEC will provide a roll-on/roll-off IP-enabled communications package supporting warfighter identified requirements for higher bandwidth SIPRNet and multi-domain networks.

                    <r2:SummaryExplanation>1. The increase from FY2013 to FY2014 is primarily due to the use of NATO and US funding on the DRAGON cooperative EMD program.  Under the terms of the co-operative agreement, the US-NATO cost share for the program remains the same but NATO is paying for the majority of 2013 common requirements and the US is paying for the majority of FY14 common requirements.  
2. The increase between the Previous President's Budget and the Current President's Budget in FY14 is due to re-phasing of funds in prior years to better align for the current execution plan ($20M) and a decrease in material solution development and analysis efforts (-$14.123M).  </r2:SummaryExplanation>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Mission: AWACS is the premier airborne platform providing command and control (C2)/battle management (BM) for Commander In Chief and combatant commander tasking in joint, allied, and coalition operations, humanitarian relief, and homeland defense. AWACS provides a real-time picture of friendly, neutral, and hostile air activity. Its capabilities include all-altitude/all-weather surveillance of the battle space; early warning of enemy actions; a real-time ability to find, fix, track, and assess airborne or maritime threats; and detection, location, and identification of electronic emitters.

This program element funds four areas in support of the AWACS program:  1. AWACS Modernization, 2. AWACS Infrastructure and Support Systems, 3. Material Solutions Development and Analysis, and 4. Program Management and Administration (PMA). The first three areas include studies and analysis to support both current planning and execution, as well as future program planning.

1. AWACS Modernization (RDT&amp;E, AF):

a. Block 40/45 is replacing AWACS 1970's vintage mission systems that are experiencing Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues, are difficult and expensive to upgrade, and limit overall AWACS system performance. The Block 40/45 upgrade will improve integration, quality and timeliness of sensor data to the shooter, improve Combat Identification (CID), improve AWACS contribution to Time Critical Targeting via Data Link Infrastructure (DLI), improve electronic support measures processing and enable more effective, faster upgrades via an open-system, Ethernet-based architecture. The upgrade will also update the ground support infrastructure including training systems.

b. The Next Generation Identification Friend or Foe (NGIFF) Program provides AWACS with enhanced IFF interrogator operation to add a more secure Mode 5 capability. NSA declared IFF Mode 4 unsecure and obsolete on 5 Nov 2003. Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memo 047-07 requires IFF Mode 5 interrogation capability by FY14. The new Mode 5 interrogation capability extends the effective range of the AWACS interrogator, while helping discriminate against closely spaced cooperative targets. NGIFF developed and integrated a basic Mode 5 capability on Block 30/35 starting in FY09 and began developing a full Mode 5 capability on Block 40/45 in FY11. Hardware will be common between the Block 30/35 and Block 40/45 platforms. NGIFF will also integrate Mode S, a civilian air traffic control capability residing in the NGIFF hardware, as funding allows.

c. DMS Replacement of Avionics for Global Operations and Navigation (DRAGON) completes the FAA/International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)/ EUROCONTROL air traffic control mandated safety of flight capabilities. This program will provide the E-3 fleet with the flight instruments and other avionics for the Required Navigation Performance (RNP), and the surveillance and communication capabilities necessary to maintain continued critical unrestricted access to global airspace. Non-compliance will result in airspace restrictions and denials that will impact AWACS ability to support worldwide responses to situations requiring immediate on-scene C2 BM. The DRAGON modifications replace the existing DMS Global Positioning System (GPS) Integrated Navigation System (GINS) with a modern Flight Management System (FMS) that will accommodate new capabilities including Mode 5 IFF and Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS). Also included as part of the modification is the addition of data link communications, voice and data link digital radios, and improved visual displays. Emphasis on employment of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) avionics is expected to lower cost, reduce the tech refresh cycle, and enhance life cycle management. Replacement of critical avionics subsystems that became unsustainable beginning in 2010 is included in the DRAGON program. The Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase of DRAGON is being executed as a Cooperative Program between the US and NATO.

d. The Flight Performance Software (FPS) program automates calculations currently performed manually by the pilot and flight engineer in accordance with the E-3B and C flight manual.  Phase I, automates the Takeoff and Landing Data (TOLD) calculations; Phase II automates the high speed calculation.  Automated calculations, using the original source data used to create the flight manual charts increases safety, improves on time departure/arrival, improves crew efficiency, and reduces tanker support.

e. Electronic Protection (EP): The EP program funds acquisition and retrofit of the E-3 AWACS radar processing capability.  EP will provide improved radar processing in a specific flight environment to meet a classified requirement.  Processing will initially address radar modes comprising 90% of actual operational AWACS radar usage.  EP will install an adjunct processor that works in parallel with the current Radar System Improvement Program (RSIP) system.  The EP-processed radar picture will appear on the operator screen in place of the current RSIP output when the EP radar modes are selected.  The EP program plans for multi-year advanced buys of COTS equipment due to the short life-cycles in high tech components starting in FY17.  The program will buy FY17 and FY18 COTS equipment in FY17 including initial spares.  Equipment non-recurring Group B includes efforts for Tech Refresh, Active DMS and Software Releases.   

2.  AWACS Infrastructure and Support Systems (RDT&amp;E, AF): These efforts synchronize modernization requirements and infrastructure support across the entire weapon system from depot and field test equipment, to maintenance trainers and integration labs.

a.  Training, Support, and Infrastructure (TSI) provides continuing system engineering and management support for AWACS modernization and enhancement. These activities include managing the AWACS developmental infrastructure, AWACS Development Integration Test Support (ADITS), support for equipment concurrency, modernization planning/analysis, trainer/simulator integration and concurrency, as well as the Avionics Integration Laboratory (AIL). The contractor maintained and operated E-3 Radar Systems Integration Lab/Software Development Facility (SIL/SDF) provides US, FMS, and international customers with a functioning E-3 radar configuration to support radar development, production, and sustainment programs.  TSI efforts allow new support equipment technologies and test strategies to be analyzed to ensure concurrent capability to sustain existing, modified, and upgraded E-3 equipment. TSI supports trainer/simulator concurrency analysis and requirements definition to ensure trainers and simulators are kept current with the AWACS baseline. The overall DT&amp;E test infrastructure supports both development and sustainment projects, and maintains facilities to support AWACS aircraft during system and sub-system testing at Boeing Field, WA.  The TSI assets also support multiple international Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&amp;C) projects on a maintenance fee basis, including projects for France, Saudi Arabia, United Kingdom, Japan, and NATO AEW&amp;C efforts.

3.  Material Solutions Development &amp; Analysis (RDT&amp;E, AF): These efforts look toward the future by investigating enhanced capabilities and exploring new mission areas through C2ISR System Development, while advancing the capabilities of the current weapon system through the Support The War Fighter (STWF) effort.

a. C2ISR system improvements investigate and develop future capabilities of the AWACS weapon system, or next C2ISR platform. These efforts also include investigation, analysis and development to ensure that AWACS successfully integrates with joint and coalition forces in a net-centric environment. C2ISR primarily supports pre-systems acquisition in the areas of material solution analysis and technology development. This is accomplished by prototyping and demonstrating capabilities required by the warfighter but also includes developing an E-3 Modernization &amp; Sustainment Roadmap that projects user capability needs, as well as material solutions for the user needs.
 
b. Internet Protocol Enabled Communication (IPEC): IPEC will provide the Block 40/45 E-3 with a wideband communications capability to connect to the Global Information Grid and will support net-centric operations/warfare.  The E-3 lacks an IP-enabled communication capability.  As a result, the E-3 is not able to support a shortened digitized kill-chain of time sensitive targets.  IPEC will provide a roll-on/roll-off IP-enabled communications package supporting warfighter identified requirements for higher bandwidth SIPRNet and multi-domain networks.

4.  Program Management and Administration (PMA)(RDT&amp;E, AF): This effort is PMA support for all AWACS Modernizations, AWACS Infrastructure and Support Systems, and Material Solutions Development and Analysis.  

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational Systems Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Joint Terminal Control Training and Rehearsal System (JTC TRS) project, under the Tactical Airborne Control System, funds development necessary to provide a Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) capable, high-fidelity simulator for the Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC), Combat Control Team (CCT) and Air Support Operations Center (ASOC).  JTC TRS is essential to future upgrade and continuation training and currency control requirements due to an increase in USAF JTAC numbers while current and future available air assets to accomplish training are decreasing.  Future JTAC control requirements will exceed the ability of live air to meet, and JTC TRS is the only future capability currently projected to allow USAF JTACs to achieve and maintain minimum required controls for both qualification and proficiency demands.  JTC TRS development will provide the capability to network aircrew full mission trainers and training centers with other trainers including the Personnel Recovery Training and Rehearsal System (PR TRS). This development effort will also integrate ASOCs with the Joint Theater Air to Ground Simulation System (JTAGSS) trainer for Joint Fires. The JTC TRS Project provides research and development to facilitate interoperability with joint and sister Service air-ground simulation using industry standards.   JTC TRS will allow JTAC and CCT to perform Close Air Support (CAS), Call-for-Fire (CFF) and Tactical Air Traffic Control (ATC) missions and allow ASOCs to perform Command and Control (C2) missions in a Live/Virtual/Constructive (LVC) environment.  JTAGSS is a continuation of the ASOC simulation trainer initially funded in 2009 and complements the JTC TRS trainer by providing a total air-ground constructive simulation environment for integrated networked training and mission rehearsal capability that will develop JTAC/CCT and ASOC/SOF (Special Operations Forces) C2 (Command and Control) battle staff skills.  JTAGSS will provide the ASOC, SOF, and TACP (Tactical Air Control Party) with the vertical and horizontal C2 communications and coordination training and mission rehearsal required for mission effectiveness.   JTAGSS is required to train 400 ASOC personnel with limited to no live training opportunities to align with the AF move to using simulation for stand-alone and distributed training.  There are insufficient exercises and live training events available to meet mandated readiness requirements.  The system will include a secure network connection, a constructive simulation environment generator with sharable databases, computer work stations that have synthetic reflex agent applications for every ASOC/SOF crew position, and an instructor/operator station.  PR TRS is envisioned to be a "plug and play" module for the host JTC TRS. PR TRS will provide Para-rescue (PJ) personnel with an immersive LVC environment to plan, train, and rehearse their employment, rescue/recovery, and combat trauma care skills.  JTC TRS will host the network connection for PR TRS to conduct distributed training and rehearsal with other Recovery Forces.  PR TRS will supplement live field training and live tissue training to provide realistic introductory, proficiency, currency, and upgrade training in a simulated battlefield, disaster, or humanitarian relief environment for Air Force PJs.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Joint Terminal Control Training and Rehearsal System (JTC TRS) project, under the Tactical Airborne Control System, funds development necessary to provide a Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) capable, high-fidelity simulator for the Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC), Combat Control Team (CCT) and Air Support Operations Center (ASOC).  JTC TRS is essential to future upgrade and continuation training and currency control requirements due to an increase in USAF JTAC numbers while current and future available air assets to accomplish training are decreasing.  Future JTAC control requirements will exceed the ability of live air to meet, and JTC TRS is the only future capability currently projected to allow USAF JTACs to achieve and maintain minimum required controls for both qualification and proficiency demands.  JTC TRS development will provide the capability to network aircrew full mission trainers and training centers with other trainers including the Personnel Recovery Training and Rehearsal System (PR TRS). This development effort will also integrate ASOCs with the Joint Theater Air to Ground Simulation System (JTAGSS) trainer for Joint Fires. The JTC TRS Project provides research and development to facilitate interoperability with joint and sister Service air-ground simulation using industry standards.   JTC TRS will allow JTAC and CCT to perform Close Air Support (CAS), Call-for-Fire (CFF) and Tactical Air Traffic Control (ATC) missions and allow ASOCs to perform Command and Control (C2) missions in a Live/Virtual/Constructive (LVC) environment.  JTAGSS is a continuation of the ASOC simulation trainer initially funded in 2009 and complements the JTC TRS trainer by providing a total air-ground constructive simulation environment for integrated networked training and mission rehearsal capability that will develop JTAC/CCT and ASOC/SOF (Special Operations Forces) C2 (Command and Control) battle staff skills.  JTAGSS will provide the ASOC, SOF, and TACP (Tactical Air Control Party) with the vertical and horizontal C2 communications and coordination training and mission rehearsal required for mission effectiveness.   JTAGSS is required to train 400 ASOC personnel with limited to no live training opportunities to align with the AF move to using simulation for stand-alone and distributed training.  There are insufficient exercises and live training events available to meet mandated readiness requirements.  The system will include a secure network connection, a constructive simulation environment generator with sharable databases, computer work stations that have synthetic reflex agent applications for every ASOC/SOF crew position, and an instructor/operator station.  PR TRS is envisioned to be a "plug and play" module for the host JTC TRS. PR TRS will provide Para-rescue (PJ) personnel with an immersive LVC environment to plan, train, and rehearse their employment, rescue/recovery, and combat trauma care skills.  JTC TRS will host the network connection for PR TRS to conduct distributed training and rehearsal with other Recovery Forces.  PR TRS will supplement live field training and live tissue training to provide realistic introductory, proficiency, currency, and upgrade training in a simulated battlefield, disaster, or humanitarian relief environment for Air Force PJs.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The acquisition strategy for the development, production, and sustainment of the fixed configuration of the JTC TRS will be executed as a small business set-aside with an evolutionary acquisition approach using incremental development and priced options for production and sustainment. A feasability study for a portable version fo the JTAC Trainer is planned to be an option on the JTC TRS contract. The acquisition strategy for the PR TRS is to be determined. The acquisition strategy for the JTAGSS trainer will be to field advance technology demonstration units to continue to perform proof of concept and technology validation of mission simulations for all ASOC crew positions including detailed communications planning, asset deconfliction, integration of joint fires, and other critical mission areas required for integrated TACP/ASOC C2 mission success.  At the completion of the technology validation, a production contract will be competitively awarded to complete JTAGSS deployment and integration.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) is the Department of Defense (DoD) family of interoperable, modular, software-defined radios that will form the foundation of radio frequency information transmission for Joint Vision 2020. Joint Tactical Radio Systems (JTRS) will link the power of the Global Information Grid (GIG) to the warfighter in applying fire effects and achieving overall battlefield superiority. By developing and implementing an open architecture of cutting-edge radio waveform technology, multiple radio types (e.g., handheld, manpack, ground-mobile, airborne, etc.) are now capable of communicating with one another. JTRS radios are intended to interoperate with existing radio systems and improve Joint warfighting through a series of new, joint networking waveforms enabling communication via voice, data, and video over mobile, adhoc, internet protocol (IP) based networks. Each radio will operate as a node in the network to ensure secure wireless communication and networking services for airborne, mobile and fixed forces. These goals extend to U.S. allies, Joint and Coalition partners, and, in time, disaster response personnel. JTRS will make the Air Force more effective in Joint warfighting through a series of new, joint networking waveforms. These waveforms included the Mobile User Objective System (MUOS), which provides next generation SATCOM beyond-line-of-sight (BLOS) communications, as well as the Wideband Networking Waveform (WNW) and the Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW), which provide interoperability with Army ground forces from the brigade level down to the dismounted soldier. Together these waveforms enable Joint Close Air Support (JCAS), Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR), and other Joint missions. The JTRS program is built around an open Software Communications Architecture (SCA), allowing common software waveform applications to be implemented across the family of radios to provide joint-service, allied, and coalition interoperability. The Enterprise Business Model, incorporating a common set of shared open system standards, promotes competition and reduces procurement costs for
the DoD.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational Sysytem Development because this activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production in the current or subsequent fiscal year</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Joint Tactical Radio Systems (JTRS) will link the power of the Global Information Grid (GIG) to the warfighter in applying fire effects and achieving overall battlefield superiority. By developing and implementing an open architecture of cutting-edge radio waveform technology, multiple radio types (e.g., handheld, manpack, ground-mobile, airborne, etc.) are now capable of communicating with one another. JTRS radios are intended to interoperate with existing radio systems and improve Joint warfighting through a series of new, joint networking waveforms enabling communication via voice, data, and video over mobile, adhoc, internet protocol (IP) based networks. Each radio will operate as a node in the network to ensure secure wireless communication and networking services for airborne, mobile and fixed forces. These goals extend to U.S. allies, Joint and Coalition partners, and, in time, disaster response personnel. JTRS will make the Air Force more effective in Joint warfighting through a series of new, joint networking waveforms. These waveforms included the Mobile User Objective System (MUOS), which provides next generation SATCOM beyond-line-of-sight (BLOS) communications, as well as the Wideband Networking Waveform (WNW) and the Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW), which provide interoperability with Army ground forces from the brigade level down to the dismounted soldier. Together these waveforms enable Joint Close Air Support (JCAS), Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR), and other Joint missions. The JTRS program is built around an open Software Communications Architecture (SCA), allowing common software waveform applications to be implemented across the family of radios to provide joint-service, allied, and coalition interoperability. The Enterprise Business Model, incorporating a common set of shared open system standards, promotes competition and reduces procurement costs for
the DoD.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational Sysytem Development because this activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production in the current or subsequent fiscal year</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>In 2005, the DoD established the Joint Program Executive Office (JPEO) for JTRS.  The JPEO has full directive authority for all JTRS research, development, testing, and evaluation of waveforms, radios, common ancillaries, network management, and associated software.  The JPEO is funded jointly by the Services in PE 0604280N. New PE in FY14 0605030F

Air Force JTRS Program Office will perform system engineering integration, to deliver an interoperable, fully synchronized, deployable JTRS system under various contract awards. The program office will lead the development of common integration hardware and sofware that can be used across multiple Air Force platforms.  The AF JTRS program office will also work with the JPEO, industry, and the platform program offices to develop integration solutions specific to each platform.  This effort will assist various AF platform users in acquiring and integrating the next generation communications system, to include all key documentation (CONOPS, TTPs, ICDs, TRDs, etc.)</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The mission of Combat Air Intelligence Systems (CAIS)  is to process, analyze, and disseminate intelligence for air component and unit operations worldwide by providing key intelligence infrastructure and tactical production capabilities for the Air Force with true backbone type of intelligence support for air operations.  CAIS is focused on providing the “tactical” combat-oriented intelligence infrastructure for Air Force major commands:  providing funding to ACC, PACAF, USAFE, AMC,  AFMC, AFSOC, and AETC to primarily fund Air Intelligence Squadrons and the 480th Intelligence Group.  

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY 2013, Project Number 674802, Deliberate and Crisis Action Planning and Execution Segment (DCAPES), was transferred to PE 0207452F DCAPES, Project Number 674802, Deliberate and Crisis Action Planning and Execution Segment (DCAPES), in order to provide clarity to the effort by providing a singular PE and Project Number.  </r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The TBM C4I Program Element (PE) includes Deliberate and Crisis Action Planning and Execution Segments (DCAPES), which is being developed as the next-generation AF interface to the Joint Operational Planning and Execution System (JOPES).  DCAPES is the Air Force's single system to present, plan, source, mobilize, deploy, account for, sustain, redeploy, and reconstitute forces for contingency and crisis operations.   This system provides a real time, two way interchange of personnel, manpower, logistics, and operational data between the Air Force and the warfighting Combatant Commanders.   It matches people, cargo, and airframes/weapon systems to the Combatant Commander's warfighting requirements.  Acquisition of this system supports the Air Force's expeditionary force concept.

Development activities may also include Logistics Feasibility Analysis Capability (LOGFAC), Logistics Module/Manpower and Personnel Module-Base (LOGMOD/MANPER B), War and Mobilization Planning (WMP), Enhanced Contingency Rotational AEF SchedulingTool (ECAST), Web Enablement, and JOPES Modernization Migration.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning to modify systems to consume authoritative force structure from Global Force Management-Data Initiative (GFM-DI) organizational servers, linking the identifiers to or replacing current identifiers and, as applicable, exposing the data in a net-centric fashion.

This effort is an evolutionary follow-on to the Contingency Operations Mobility Planning and Execution System (COMPES).  DCAPES replaced the operational tasking and priorities functionality of COMPES with modern relational databases, integrated-distributed database, and common and shared data consistent with the joint vision for integrated command and control.  DCAPES is intended to provide a command and control capability by exchanging data with a range of planning support systems to provide a more effective force projection capability for a wider range of operational scenarios and will fully support the force provider function of the AF Forces (AFFOR) commander.  DCAPES along with numerous other war planning support legacy systems are transitioning into a net-centric Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) environment via a War Planning and Execution System (WPES) management construct.

Activities also include studies and analysis to support current program planning and execution, and future program planning.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Tactical Air Control Party-Modernization (TACP-M). TACP-M is a buy-to-budget program with requirements based on ACC's evolving combat needs and the capabilities available in the commercial market. Therefore, requirements are frequently adjusted to accomodate warfighter needs while working within available funding. The TACP-M program acquires capabilities for TACP operations.  TACP members deploy with Army maneuver units and provide a command and control (C2) link for close air support (CAS), airlift, and Air Force surveillance/reconnaissance missions.  TACPs are equipped with various targeting and communications equipment which interfaces with ground maneuver forces, CAS aircraft, joint fire assets, C2 aircraft/agencies, and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) platforms/agencies.  Throughout the performance of their duties, TACPs detect targets and compute precision coordinates to aircraft to ensure pilots track the correct target in the employment of GPS aided weapons.  The actions performed by TACPs not only shorten the kill chain, but also reduce the potential for fratricide and collateral damage in civilian-occupied areas.  

The TACP-M program provides equipment modernization capabilities to TACPs, Air Support Operations Center (ASOC), and Tactical Operations Center (TOC) personnel. The program supports Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) and significantly increased the mission effectiveness of the TACPs and ASOCs during Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation New Dawn.  The TACP-M program continues to be instrumental in providing ground communications for TACPs during federal emergency relief operations and homeland defense initiatives.

The purpose of the TACP-M program is to reduce reliance on voice transmission and replace analog equipment with the latest digital, data link and streaming video (e.g. Streaming Video Receiver) technology.  Upgraded digital communications enable machine-to-machine interface between TACPs and Close Air Support (CAS) aircraft, Army units and other TACP units.  Machine-to-machine communication provides reliable, high speed digital communications, supports joint and multinational interoperability, improves battlefield Situational Awareness (SA), increases targeting accuracy, reduces kill chain decision time, improves data flow/information exchange, and reduces potential fratricide. TACPs use software communication architecture (SCA)-certified, Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS), software programmable radios, and ancillary components for reliable voice &amp; data UHF SATCOM and LOS UHF /VHF communications.  TACP-M is divided into three segments:  software, dismounted and mounted. The mounted segment is further divided into fixed and mobile elements. 

The software segment utilizes a common Close Air Support System Software(CASS) baseline across all TACP systems.  The CASS software provides cross-service interoperability with numerous aircraft (A-10, F-16, F/A-18, etc), helicopters, unmanned air vehicles (Predator), land and naval artillery, network enabled weapons, command &amp; control nodes, and communications systems utilizing numerous messaging systems (such as Variable Message Format (VMF), Situational Awareness Data Link (SADL), and Link-16) to provide maximum flexibility and capability to the TACPs for the execution of joint fire support mission. In addition, TACP-M is working with various contractors and laboratories to conduct demonstrations and risk reduction efforts to assess advanced HMI and interoperability technologies for future fielding. 

The dismounted segment consists of integrated systems and equipment comprised of non-developmental and commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components which are carried by dismounted TACP. These include laser range finders, thermal imagers, laser designators, manpack and handheld radios, ruggedized tactical computers, streaming video receivers, and other required equipment. The dismounted segment also incorporates the development of an advanced Target Location Designation System (TLDS) which is also being managed under the Army-led Joint Effects Targeting System (JETS) program.  TLDS will combine the capability of a laser marker, designator and thermal imagers into a small, lightweight system. 

The mounted (fixed) segment integrates computer and communications equipment into re-locatable vehicle, rack or transit case mounted systems for use in Tactical Operations Center (TOC) or Air Support Operations Center (ASOC) locations.  The TACP mounted (fixed) segment includes the High Mobility, Multi-Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV)-mounted Air Support Operations Center (ASOC) gateway, gateway lite, and the Dismounted Communications Package (DCP).  The TACP-M Mounted (mobile) segment integrates similar equipment into mobile tactical vehicles employed by the Army and provides on-the-move tactical voice and data capability.  

Following the termination of the Vehicular Communications System (VCS) in FY11, the TACP community has capability gaps in vehicle mounted communications systems.  As a result, and based on ACC priorities and available funding, the TACP-M team is working through the JCIDS process with ACC to identify and resolve capability gaps related to vehicle mounted communications, which is referred to as the Mobile Communications System (MCS).  These gaps are being addressed in a stepwise fashion:  an initial implementation of a very limited, PRC-117G-based, voice-only capability in approximately 220 TACP HMMWVs that were originally slated for the VCS.  This limited capability is referred to as the Voice Communications Package (VCP), and replaces the more capable Mobile Communications Package (MCP) that was going to take multiple years to implement.  A more robust capability, implementing voice and data communications through additional PRC-117G and PRC-150 radios, computers, streaming video, and advanced soldier radio waveforms, will follow as the requirement is formalized, funding becomes available and contracts can be awarded to fill the long-term need.

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipated production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Tactical Air Control Party-Modernization (TACP-M). TACP-M is a buy-to-budget program with requirements based on ACC's evolving combat needs and the capabilities available in the commercial market. Therefore, requirements are frequently adjusted to accomodate warfighter needs while working within available funding. The TACP-M program acquires capabilities for TACP operations.  TACP members deploy with Army maneuver units and provide a command and control (C2) link for close air support (CAS), airlift, and Air Force surveillance/reconnaissance missions.  TACPs are equipped with various targeting and communications equipment which interfaces with ground maneuver forces, CAS aircraft, joint fire assets, C2 aircraft/agencies, and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) platforms/agencies.  Throughout the performance of their duties, TACPs detect targets and compute precision coordinates to aircraft to ensure pilots track the correct target in the employment of GPS aided weapons.  The actions performed by TACPs not only shorten the kill chain, but also reduce the potential for fratricide and collateral damage in civilian-occupied areas.  

The TACP-M program provides equipment modernization capabilities to TACPs, Air Support Operations Center (ASOC), and Tactical Operations Center (TOC) personnel. The program supports Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) and significantly increased the mission effectiveness of the TACPs and ASOCs during Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation New Dawn.  The TACP-M program continues to be instrumental in providing ground communications for TACPs during federal emergency relief operations and homeland defense initiatives.

The purpose of the TACP-M program is to reduce reliance on voice transmission and replace analog equipment with the latest digital, data link and streaming video (e.g. Streaming Video Receiver) technology.  Upgraded digital communications enable machine-to-machine interface between TACPs and Close Air Support (CAS) aircraft, Army units and other TACP units.  Machine-to-machine communication provides reliable, high speed digital communications, supports joint and multinational interoperability, improves battlefield Situational Awareness (SA), increases targeting accuracy, reduces kill chain decision time, improves data flow/information exchange, and reduces potential fratricide. TACPs use software communication architecture (SCA)-certified, Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS), software programmable radios, and ancillary components for reliable voice &amp; data UHF SATCOM and LOS UHF /VHF communications.  TACP-M is divided into three segments:  software, dismounted and mounted. The mounted segment is further divided into fixed and mobile elements. 

The software segment utilizes a common Close Air Support System Software(CASS) baseline across all TACP systems.  The CASS software provides cross-service interoperability with numerous aircraft (A-10, F-16, F/A-18, etc), helicopters, unmanned air vehicles (Predator), land and naval artillery, network enabled weapons, command &amp; control nodes, and communications systems utilizing numerous messaging systems (such as Variable Message Format (VMF), Situational Awareness Data Link (SADL), and Link-16) to provide maximum flexibility and capability to the TACPs for the execution of joint fire support mission. In addition, TACP-M is working with various contractors and laboratories to conduct demonstrations and risk reduction efforts to assess advanced HMI and interoperability technologies for future fielding. 

The dismounted segment consists of integrated systems and equipment comprised of non-developmental and commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components which are carried by dismounted TACP. These include laser range finders, thermal imagers, laser designators, manpack and handheld radios, ruggedized tactical computers, streaming video receivers, and other required equipment. The dismounted segment also incorporates the development of an advanced Target Location Designation System (TLDS) which is also being managed under the Army-led Joint Effects Targeting System (JETS) program.  TLDS will combine the capability of a laser marker, designator and thermal imagers into a small, lightweight system. 

The mounted (fixed) segment integrates computer and communications equipment into re-locatable vehicle, rack or transit case mounted systems for use in Tactical Operations Center (TOC) or Air Support Operations Center (ASOC) locations.  The TACP mounted (fixed) segment includes the High Mobility, Multi-Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV)-mounted Air Support Operations Center (ASOC) gateway, gateway lite, and the Dismounted Communications Package (DCP).  The TACP-M Mounted (mobile) segment integrates similar equipment into mobile tactical vehicles employed by the Army and provides on-the-move tactical voice and data capability.  

Following the termination of the Vehicular Communications System (VCS) in FY11, the TACP community has capability gaps in vehicle mounted communications systems.  As a result, and based on ACC priorities and available funding, the TACP-M team is working through the JCIDS process with ACC to identify and resolve capability gaps related to vehicle mounted communications, which is referred to as the Mobile Communications System (MCS).

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Tactical Data Links (TDL), as a subset of the broader airborne network, are used in a combat environment to exchange information such as messages, data, radar tracks, target information, platform status, imagery, and command assignments.  TDLs provide interoperability, local and global connectivity, and situational awareness to the user when operating under rapidly changing operational conditions.  TDLs provide a jam-resistant; secure digital data transfer network capability with new and standardized waveforms and data formats allowing line-of-sight (LOS) and beyond-line- of-sight (BLOS) intra- and inter-flight communications.  TDLs increase mission effectiveness, provide situational awareness, and provide positive identification of aircraft in the network, correlate on- and off-board sensor data sharing, target, and threat information, and provide the datalink to accomplish time critical targeting and other mission update functions.  TDLs are used by all service theater command and control (C2) elements, weapons platforms, and sensors.

TDLs include, but are not limited to:  Link 16, Link 11, Situational Awareness Data Link (SADL), Variable Message Format (VMF), Integrated Broadcast Service (IBS), Intra-Flight Data Link (IFDL), and Tactical Targeting Network Technology (TTNT).  TDL efforts include incorporating changes and additions to the Link-16 message standard (MIL-STD-6016D) and applicable Interface Change Proposals (ICPs), assisting with Air Force and joint interoperability certification testing with the Air Force Command and Control Integration Center (AFC2IC) and Joint Interoperability Test Center (JITC); future development, integration, and verification of Operational Flight Program (OFP) upgrades due to TDL integration; support of data gathering processes; studying and incorporating data link technologies to ensure effectiveness and efficiency of the Global Strike and Global Persistent Attack CONOPS.

This effort provides critical capability and enhancements to the airborne network by creating common development, integration and interoperability among ground and C2 platforms and responds to quick reaction capability integration and demonstration including, but not limited to Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS), Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS), the Air and Space Operations Center (AOC), Global Hawk, Predator, Reaper, Rivet Joint, Combat Sent, and Cobra Ball.  TDLs keep all C2ISR platforms and data linked weapons current/interoperable in the airborne network to enable Global Strike, Global Persistent Attack, offensive and defensive counterair (OCA and DCA) and Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) missions.

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution, as well as future program planning.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, these budget activities include development efforts to upgrade systems currently fielded or has approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Command and Control Constellation (C2C) is the sole Air Force program for defining, developing, and assessing integrated effects of global, theater and tactical level Air Force air, space, and cyber command and control (C2) capabilities in support of the joint warfighter.  The Air Force faces a complex future where conflict will range across a broad spectrum of operations and lethality.  The Air Force requires capabilities with the maximum possible flexibility to deal with the widest possible range of conflict.

The C2C is the enabling program element for C2 Integration/Modernization.  The Air Force is working to establish a C2 framework and architecture to be used as a unifying vision of command and control for each of the services core functions.  C2C will support the defense strategy through: integration of air, space cyber and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) C2, through architectural analysis, prototyping, experimentation and innovation to develop cross-cutting solutions, and enable an improved "sense-to-kill" cycle time.  C2C innovations and experimentation provide strategic, operational, and tactical direction for Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership and Education, Personnel and Facilities (DOTMLPF) solutions to facilitate an integrated mission environment that supports C2 planning and execution for air, space, and cyberspace.  In-depth development and analyses of C2 operational, systems, and technical architectures are geared towards identifying capability gaps, identifying required "to be" information services, and evaluating C2 program planned improvements.  Through prototyping and experimentation, C2C integrates rapidly developing technologies to promote common standards, data sharing, and information services across Air Force and joint warfighting applications to support joint enterprise solutions. 
 
Project 675078, Horizontal Integration (HI) conducts DOTMLPF analyses and assessments to guide cross-cutting, C2 sub-enterprise and cyberspace investment decisions that integrate USAF capabilities into joint and coalition operations.  HI identifies, prioritizes, and develops requirements and horizontally integrated solution recommendations to ensure the latest technologies and information services are integrated into a cross cutting C2 system that enables integrated effects in all warfighter domains.  The HI strategy will be validated by Headquarters, Air Force (HAF) to ensure that initiatives are harmonized with the most urgent warfighter needs described by the C2 Capability Assessment Team (CAT) and C2 Core Function Master Plan (CFMP) and supporting the 2012 Air Force, Joint and Defense Strategies and Operational Concepts. Once validated, HI funds are applied toward identifying the most critical warfighter capabilities and ensuring they are horizontally integrated into both Air Force and joint C2 programs of record.

Project 675140, Joint Expeditionary Force Experiments (JEFX) are agile and frequent innovation-focused experiments which lead to pre-fielded operational and technical assessments.  Constructive, live and virtual, operationally representative warfighter environments are created to support integration challenges which focus on critical C2 areas of interest that support the joint warfighter; including, C2 of ISR innovation that supports the air, space, and cyberspace domains.  JEFX provides the infrastructure and integration initiatives for experimentation with emerging operational concepts and attendant new technologies that fill operational gaps in Air Force capabilities to meet emerging and rapidly changing real world threats.  The JEFX strategy is validated and supported by the Commander, Air Combat Command (COMACC) and coordinated with Headquarters, Air Force (HAF) ensuring initiatives are harmonized with the most urgent warfighter needs and validated requirements described in the AF Core Function Master Plans (CFMP) and supported through MAJCOM Core function Lead Integrator (CFLI).  JEFX initiatives are based on emerging CONOPS and warfighter challenges, important enablers of innovation and transformation, which are designed to support the themes and demonstrate emerging Air Force capabilities to deploy and employ decisive air, space and cyberspace power in support of the Joint Force.  

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development,  these budget activities include development efforts to upgrade systems currently fielded or have approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Horizontal Integration (HI) develops an integrated mission environment that supports cross-cutting solutions across the air, space, and cyberspace command and control (C2) warfighter domain.  HI activities include:  requirements, architecture, systems engineering, technology development, risk reduction, prototyping, and transition.  These activities are required to:  identify, design, develop, experiment, and implement C2 solutions supporting operational requirements for warfighting integration and interoperability needs which are not the sole responsibility of a specific program of record.  

The nature of integrated and interoperable C2 warfighting capabilities span multiple platforms and domains.  These capabilities are routinely being adjusted to meet the changing requirements from the warfighting communities.  The HI project is uniquely designed to look across platforms and domains enabling the Air Force to respond to operator needs across the seams of individual systems.  These horizontal integration initiatives will be prototyped, assessed, appropriately captured in requirements documents and then transitioned to programs of record for production, fielding and sustainment.  

Systems Engineering and analysis is the 'glue' that holds command and control constellation (C2C) elements together and closes the seams in the C2 architectures.  Capability analysis identifies areas where interoperability can be improved within the Air Force, as well as among joint services, and coalition partners.  Once capability issues are identified, they are prioritized and pilot initiatives are developed to provide solutions to the warfighter challenges to resolve the capability gaps.  The HI project also helps to competitively prototype integrated solutions against validated program requirements. 

The benefits of these activities are two-fold:  the operational community is able to weigh the cost, risk, and performance trade-offs between enterprise solutions versus program centric solutions, and it supports competitive prototyping of all acquisition programs.  The synchronization of HI prototyping and program milestone requirements offers an effective environment for increasing interoperability while reducing the impact of this policy on multiple programs.  An infrastructure environment manages a continuous distributed operational environment that supports air, space, and cyberspace C2 and rapid acquisition, prototyping, development, integration, and fielding.  C2 initiatives may use this infrastructure to mature their development status prior to entry into JEFX for operational and technical suitability assessment. 

The HI prototype performances are assessed for operational utility, and the most promising initiatives/technologies will be matured and transitioned into weapon system configuration control baselines.  Requirement documents will be published and revised, and a requirements database and implementation plan identifying the most significant C2C net-centric integration issues will be updated to catalog the activities necessary to accomplish this integration. 

In addition, this project supports concept exploration, program definition/risk reduction efforts, and studies that support continuous improvements in C2. Guided by the MAJCOM-validated C2 capability gaps developed by the HI Capability Assessment Team annual process and the defense strategy to meet the evolving Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2/AD) threats to air, space and cyber C2 operations, these improvements include but are not limited to: integration of airspace and cross-domain synchronized operations,C2 of integrated air and missile defense, C2 of Air Force Forces and agile combat support, dynamic aerial network capabilities, and non-traditional ISR (NTISR), from 4th and 5th generation aircraft through processing and assessment, and interoperability with joint service, allied and coalition systems, C2 of personnel recovery, and air-sea battle. Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution, as well as future program planning.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, these budget activities include development efforts to upgrade systems currently fielded or has approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Joint Expeditionary Force Experiments (JEFX) and supporting Limited Objective Experiments (LOEs) are warfighter integration and validation experiments that address operational challenges and are part of the Air Force (AF) command and control (C2) integration and experimentation enterprise. Activities include: evaluation of innovative solutions for C2 aspects of the AF integrated air and missile defense (IAMD) mission, Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2/AD) threats, dynamic aerial layer networking, 5th to 4th generation aircraft and 5th to 5th generation aircraft disparate tactical datalink (TDL) data translation capabilities Non-Traditional ISR (NTISR), Airspace Integration, Unit Level Agile Combat Support communication processes, as well as C2 Integration and Modernization for existing AF programs of record. JEFX provides continued integration and experimentation efforts across the AF C2 seams and programs in air, space and cyber domains as defined by CORONA, HQ AF, and the AF Command and Control Integration Center (AFC2IC).

JEFX/LOE activities explore significant capability gaps across the range of Air Force command and control (C2) by means of assessing Concept of Operations (CONOPS), tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) and materiel solutions. The activities address critical lessons learned from recent operations and the validated requirements described in the 2012 Air Force, Joint and Defense Strategies and Operational Concepts, the AF Core Function Master Plans (CFMP) and supported through MAJCOM Core Function Lead Integrator (CFLI). JEFX creates or leverages operationally representative-experiment enterprise warfighter environments to address joint and coalition warfighter gaps and shortfalls that demonstrate existing and emerging Air Force capabilities to deploy and employ decisive air, space and cyberspace power for the joint force commander and enable innovation and transformation. These unique missions are the major reason JEFX is an experiment and not simply a demonstration or exercise. Activities also include studies and analyses to support current program planning and execution, as well as future program planning.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, these budget activities include development efforts to upgrade systems currently fielded or has approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY 2013, Project Number 674802, Deliberate and Crisis Action Planning and Execution Segment (DCAPES), efforts were transferred from PE 0207438F, Theater Battle Management (TBM) C4I, Project Number 674802, Deliberate and Crisis Action Planning and Execution Segment (DCAPES), in order to provide clarity to the effort by providing a singular PE and Project Number.  
</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Deliberate and Crisis Action Planning and Execution Segments (DCAPES)Program Element (PE) includes Deliberate and Crisis Action Planning and Execution Segments (DCAPES), a system being developed as the next-generation AF interface to the Joint Operational Planning and Execution System (JOPES).  DCAPES is the Air Force's single system to present, plan, source, mobilize, deploy, account for, sustain, redeploy, and reconstitute forces for contingency and crisis operations.   This system provides a real time, two way interchange of personnel, manpower, logistics, and operational data between the Air Force and the warfighting Combatant Commanders.   It matches people, cargo, and airframes/weapon systems to the Combatant Commander's warfighting requirements.  Acquisition of this system supports the Air Force's expeditionary force concept.

Development activities may also include Logistics Feasibility Analysis Capability (LOGFAC), Logistics Module/Manpower and Personnel Module-Base (LOGMOD/MANPER B), War and Mobilization Planning (WMP), Enhanced Contingency Rotational AEF SchedulingTool (ECAST), Web Enablement, and JOPES Modernization Migration.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning to modify systems to consume authoritative force structure from Global Force Management-Data Initiative (GFM-DI) organizational servers, linking the identifiers to or replacing current identifiers and, as applicable, exposing the data in a net-centric fashion.

This effort is an evolutionary follow-on to the Contingency Operations Mobility Planning and Execution System (COMPES).  DCAPES replaced the operational tasking and priorities functionality of COMPES with modern relational databases, integrated-distributed database, and common and shared data consistent with the joint vision for integrated command and control.  DCAPES is intended to provide a command and control capability by exchanging data with a range of planning support systems to provide a more effective force projection capability for a wider range of operational scenarios and will fully support the force provider function of the AF Forces (AFFOR) commander.  DCAPES along with numerous other war planning support legacy systems are transitioning into a net-centric Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) environment via a War Planning and Execution System (WPES) management construct.

Activities also include studies and analysis to support current program planning and execution, and future program planning.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning to modify systems to consume authoritative force structure from Global Force Management-Data Initiative (GFM-DI) organizational servers, linking the identifiers to or replacing current identifiers and, as applicable, exposing the data in a net-centric fashion.

This effort is an evolutionary follow-on to the Contingency Operations Mobility Planning and Execution System (COMPES).  DCAPES replaced the operational tasking and priorities functionality of COMPES with modern relational databases, integrated-distributed database, and common and shared data consistent with the joint vision for integrated command and control.  DCAPES is intended to provide a command and control capability by exchanging data with a range of planning support systems to provide a more effective force projection capability for a wider range of operational scenarios and will fully support the force provider function of the AF Forces (AFFOR) commander.  DCAPES along with numerous other war planning support legacy systems are transitioning into a net-centric Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) environment via a War Planning and Execution System (WPES) management construct.

Activities also include studies and analysis to support current program planning and execution, and future program planning.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) is the world's premier airborne ground surveillance platform, meeting joint combat capability requirements.  The 707-based E-8C Joint STARS aircraft provides all-weather radar-derived Command and Control, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C2ISR) and targeting information on moving and stationary ground/surface targets to include dismounts, slow moving rotary and fixed wing aircraft, and rotating antennas.  JSTARS provides target information for matching direct attack aircraft, standoff weapons, and ground-based attack assets against selected targets.  It can be cued by other intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) and target acquisition systems.  This capability enables air and ground regional/geographic commanders to effectively make and execute battlefield decisions at the component commander's level to battlefield forces.  It also helps achieve predictive battle space awareness.    

This program element enhances the warfighter's ability to achieve the joint vision of combat operations.  It develops advanced battle management aids and information fusion technologies to enable rapid decisions in tracking and killing time-critical targets.  Concept exploration, program definition/risk reduction efforts, and studies support continuous improvements in C2ISR, network centric operations capabilities, and interoperability with joint service, allied, and coalition systems.

This program element currently comprises: four development programs (JSTARS Modernization, Prime Mission Equipment-Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (PME-DMS), Communications and Networking Upgrades (CNU) and JSTARS Re-engining), as well as Test Infrastructure and Program Management Administration (PMA).  

Activities also include studies and analyses to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.  

I. JSTARS Modernization:

The JSTARS modernization program consists of multiple efforts to develop and integrate platform wide system improvements. Future development efforts will depend on availability of funding. These include, but are not limited to Spiral Development and Avionics-Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (Av-DMS) for cockpit upgrades. These efforts are detailed below.

Spiral Development - The Spiral Development effort includes various technology development/insertion activities to enhance target identification, data processing &amp; transmittal, and weapon control capabilities, such as JSTARS Net Enabled Weapons (JNEW) and Joint Surface Warfare (JSuW), JSTARS Radar Modernization (JSRM),  Blue Force tracker (BFT), Battlefield Airborne Communication Node (BACN), combat identification and future program planning for Analysis of Alternatives recommendations. The JSuW-JNEW activities include participation in the JSuW Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (JCTD) and Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) for Network Enabled Weapons (NEW) which includes, but is not limited to, Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile-Air Surface Warfare-Anti-Surface Warfare (JASSM-ASuW). The JSRM activities apply multi-platform radar technology insertion program (MP-RTIP) technology to JSTARS. The MP-RTIP capability on the E-8C will provide the ability to detect, track, and identify both stationary and moving ground vehicles.  Future program planning activities include, but are not limited to, modular equipment enclosure (MEE), automatic identification system (AIS), analyst support architecture (ASA) software, and common data link (CDL) integration. Spiral development efforts also support requirements for current and future Urgent Operational Needs (UON), quick reaction capabilities (QRCs), top-down directed efforts, requirements definition, capability gap analysis, pre-Milestone A (MS A) technical risk reduction activities, BFT, multi-agency communication capability (MACC) and the Air Force tactical receive system (AFTRS) radio replacement for the integrated broadcast service (IBS) data and other large airborne platform integration efforts including self-defense suite (SDS), and radar &amp; aircraft performance improvements. Equipment developed under spiral development are procured under Kill Chain Enhancement-MN-38203.

Avionics Diminishing Manufacturing Sources - The Av-DMS efforts include, but are not limited to, Aircraft Information Program (AIP), Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS), Communications, Navigation, Surveillance and Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) upgrades, Control and Display Unit (CDU) Replacement, Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT), Flight Data Recorder (FDR), Electronic Flight Bag (EFB), Mode 5 Identification Friend or Foe (IFF), Embedded GPS Inertial (EGI) with Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM)/M-Code GPS, Digital Multi-Function Flight Display (Attitude Direction Indicator, Horizontal Situation Indicator and Attitude Heading Reference System), Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B), a new flight management system (FMS), flight director, Instrument Landing System (ILS) Marker Beacon multi-mode receiver (MMR), and digital engine instruments.

Additional Modernization efforts include interoperability with manned and unmanned platforms; space data links; advanced Battle-Management Command and Control (BMC2) concepts; 8.33/25 kHz VHF Radio with Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS) voice and data communication; ISR Constellation; Air Moving Target Indicator (AMTI); Advanced Radar Modes (ARM); Aided Target Recognition (ATR); Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)/Enhanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ESAR); Network Centric Collaborative Targeting (NCCT); and Beyond-Line-of-Sight (BLOS) Network Architecture Upgrades (BNAU).

Training and support systems upgrade modernization efforts include, but are not limited to: Weapon Systems Trainer (WST); Navigator Training System (NTS); and Mission Crew Trainers to include a Mission Maintenance Trainer (MMT), Prime Mission Equipment-Maintenance Training Device (PME-MTD) and the Mission System Trainer (MST).


II. Prime Mission Equipment-Diminishing Manufacturing Sources:

Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues are categorized as PME-DMS and Av-DMS issues and are top issues for fleet viability. The PME-DMS program will address hardware and software DMS issues and commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) technology refresh for the operator work station (OWS), the central computing subsystem, and the Radar Airborne Signal Processor (RASP) subsystem. 

III. Communications and Networking Upgrades:

The multi-phased CNU program includes, but is not limited to, replacement of the E-8C Link 16 Tactical Data Link (TDL) equipment with National Security Agency (NSA) Cryptographic Modernization Program (CMP) compliant equipment, the Multi-functional Information Distribution System (MIDS) Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS), IBS, the Family of Advanced Beyond-Line-of-Sight-Terminals (FAB-T), Advanced Tactical Data Links integration, airborne networking, and network centric operation enhancements. All development efforts are complete with the exception of a MIDS JTRS advanced capabilities study.

IV. Re-engining:

The JSTARS Re-Engining program is a System Design and Demonstration (SDD) program to replace legacy TF33-P102C engines with JT8D-219 engines.  The JT8D-219 engines are predicted to provide the E-8C aircraft improved performance, including thrust, altitude capability, mission duration, time to climb, critical field length (i.e. takeoff performance), fuel efficiency, noise abatement, emissions, and reliability. It also adds the potential for additional electrical power generation for future system upgrades. SDD efforts include flight test, development of weapon system trainer modification hardware &amp; software, technical orders (i.e. flight and maintenance manuals), technical data development, logistic development &amp; analysis, technical analysis &amp; evaluation, engineering support for MIL-STD airworthiness qualification, flight data analysis &amp; upgrade of the T-3 test aircraft's Propulsion Pod System (PPS), and spare engines including upgrade of used JT8D-219 engines to make them production representative. A PPS consists of engines (4), pneumatic bleed air system, engine build up unit, thrust reversers, nacelles, plyons, exhaust ducts, controls, and instrumentation.

With termination of the re-engining program, the AF completed a modified SDD. This consisted of pneumatic system design, flight manuals, airworthiness certification, and a successful flight test program. The remaining unfunded efforts to complete a full SDD are completion of all logistics development tasks and operational tests.

V. Test and Infrastructure: 

The test infrastructure includes the JSTARS Extended Test Support (JETS), JSTARS Test Force (JTF), and C2 Enterprise Integration Facility (CEIF). All JSTARS efforts rely on the components of the test infrastructure to carry out RDT&amp;E activities.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) is the world's premier airborne ground surveillance platform, meeting joint combat capability requirements.  The 707-based E-8C Joint STARS aircraft provides all-weather radar-derived Command and Control, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C2ISR) and targeting information on moving and stationary ground/surface targets to include dismounts, slow moving rotary and fixed wing aircraft, and rotating antennas.  JSTARS provides target information for matching direct attack aircraft, standoff weapons, and ground-based attack assets against selected targets.  It can be cued by other intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) and target acquisition systems.  This capability enables air and ground regional/geographic commanders to effectively make and execute battlefield decisions at the component commander's level to battlefield forces.  It also helps achieve predictive battle space awareness.    

This program element enhances the warfighter's ability to achieve the joint vision of combat operations.  It develops advanced battle management aids and information fusion technologies to enable rapid decisions in tracking and killing time-critical targets.  Concept exploration, program definition/risk reduction efforts, and studies support continuous improvements in C2ISR, network centric operations capabilities, and interoperability with joint service, allied, and coalition systems.

This program element currently comprises: four development programs (JSTARS Modernization, Prime Mission Equipment-Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (PME-DMS), Communications and Networking Upgrades (CNU) and JSTARS Re-engining), as well as Test Infrastructure and Program Management Administration (PMA).  

Activities also include studies and analyses to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.  

I. JSTARS Modernization:

The JSTARS modernization program consists of multiple efforts to develop and integrate platform wide system improvements. Future development efforts will depend on availability of funding. These include, but are not limited to Spiral Development and Avionics-Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (Av-DMS) for cockpit upgrades. These efforts are detailed below.

Spiral Development - The Spiral Development effort includes various technology development/insertion activities to enhance target identification, data processing &amp; transmittal, and weapon control capabilities, such as JSTARS Net Enabled Weapons (JNEW) and Joint Surface Warfare (JSuW), JSTARS Radar Modernization (JSRM),  Blue Force tracker (BFT), Battlefield Airborne Communication Node (BACN), combat identification and future program planning for Analysis of Alternatives recommendations. The JSuW-JNEW activities include participation in the JSuW Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (JCTD) and Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) for Network Enabled Weapons (NEW) which includes, but is not limited to, Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile-Air Surface Warfare-Anti-Surface Warfare (JASSM-ASuW). The JSRM activities apply multi-platform radar technology insertion program (MP-RTIP) technology to JSTARS. The MP-RTIP capability on the E-8C will provide the ability to detect, track, and identify both stationary and moving ground vehicles.  Future program planning activities include, but are not limited to, modular equipment enclosure (MEE), automatic identification system (AIS), analyst support architecture (ASA) software, and common data link (CDL) integration. Spiral development efforts also support requirements for current and future Urgent Operational Needs (UON), quick reaction capabilities (QRCs), top-down directed efforts, requirements definition, capability gap analysis, pre-Milestone A (MS A) technical risk reduction activities, BFT, multi-agency communication capability (MACC) and the Air Force tactical receive system (AFTRS) radio replacement for the integrated broadcast service (IBS) data and other large airborne platform integration efforts including self-defense suite (SDS), and radar &amp; aircraft performance improvements. Equipment developed under spiral development are procured under Kill Chain Enhancement-MN-38203.

Avionics Diminishing Manufacturing Sources - The Av-DMS efforts include, but are not limited to, Aircraft Information Program (AIP), Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS), Communications, Navigation, Surveillance and Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) upgrades, Control and Display Unit (CDU) Replacement, Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT), Flight Data Recorder (FDR), Electronic Flight Bag (EFB), Mode 5 Identification Friend or Foe (IFF), Embedded GPS Inertial (EGI) with Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM)/M-Code GPS, Digital Multi-Function Flight Display (Attitude Direction Indicator, Horizontal Situation Indicator and Attitude Heading Reference System), Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B), a new flight management system (FMS), flight director, Instrument Landing System (ILS) Marker Beacon multi-mode receiver (MMR), and digital engine instruments.

Additional Modernization efforts include interoperability with manned and unmanned platforms; space data links; advanced Battle-Management Command and Control (BMC2) concepts; 8.33/25 kHz VHF Radio with Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS) voice and data communication; ISR Constellation; Air Moving Target Indicator (AMTI); Advanced Radar Modes (ARM); Aided Target Recognition (ATR); Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)/Enhanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ESAR); Network Centric Collaborative Targeting (NCCT); and Beyond-Line-of-Sight (BLOS) Network Architecture Upgrades (BNAU).

Training and support systems upgrade modernization efforts include, but are not limited to: Weapon Systems Trainer (WST); Navigator Training System (NTS); and Mission Crew Trainers to include a Mission Maintenance Trainer (MMT), Prime Mission Equipment-Maintenance Training Device (PME-MTD) and the Mission System Trainer (MST).


II. Prime Mission Equipment-Diminishing Manufacturing Sources:

Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues are categorized as PME-DMS and Av-DMS issues and are top issues for fleet viability. The PME-DMS program will address hardware and software DMS issues and commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) technology refresh for the operator work station (OWS), the central computing subsystem, and the Radar Airborne Signal Processor (RASP) subsystem. 

III. Communications and Networking Upgrades:

The multi-phased CNU program includes, but is not limited to, replacement of the E-8C Link 16 Tactical Data Link (TDL) equipment with National Security Agency (NSA) Cryptographic Modernization Program (CMP) compliant equipment, the Multi-functional Information Distribution System (MIDS) Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS), IBS, the Family of Advanced Beyond-Line-of-Sight-Terminals (FAB-T), Advanced Tactical Data Links integration, airborne networking, and network centric operation enhancements. All development efforts are complete with the exception of a MIDS JTRS advanced capabilities study.

IV. Re-engining:

The JSTARS Re-Engining program is a System Design and Demonstration (SDD) program to replace legacy TF33-P102C engines with JT8D-219 engines.  The JT8D-219 engines are predicted to provide the E-8C aircraft improved performance, including thrust, altitude capability, mission duration, time to climb, critical field length (i.e. takeoff performance), fuel efficiency, noise abatement, emissions, and reliability. It also adds the potential for additional electrical power generation for future system upgrades. SDD efforts include flight test, development of weapon system trainer modification hardware &amp; software, technical orders (i.e. flight and maintenance manuals), technical data development, logistic development &amp; analysis, technical analysis &amp; evaluation, engineering support for MIL-STD airworthiness qualification, flight data analysis &amp; upgrade of the T-3 test aircraft's Propulsion Pod System (PPS), and spare engines including upgrade of used JT8D-219 engines to make them production representative. A PPS consists of engines (4), pneumatic bleed air system, engine build up unit, thrust reversers, nacelles, plyons, exhaust ducts, controls, and instrumentation.

With termination of the re-engining program, the AF completed a modified SDD. This consisted of pneumatic system design, flight manuals, airworthiness certification, and a successful flight test program. The remaining unfunded efforts to complete a full SDD are completion of all logistics development tasks and operational tests.

V. Test and Infrastructure: 

The test infrastructure includes the JSTARS Extended Test Support (JETS), JSTARS Test Force (JTF), and C2 Enterprise Integration Facility (CEIF). All JSTARS efforts rely on the components of the test infrastructure to carry out RDT&amp;E activities. The infrastructure includes but is not limited to a T-3 test aircraft, laboratories, support facilities, priority level (PL-2) security, information assurance, and range support. Due to the conclusion of developmental programs, the T-3 test aircraft will be put in preservation storage.

VI. Program Management Administration:

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Air Force operates a variety of combat aircraft that carry numerous and varied stores (munitions, missiles, fuel tanks, targeting pods, range pods, electronic countermeasures pods, etc.). Stores are carried in countless different loading combinations determined by operational and training scenarios, missions, tactics, and weapon development programs. Aircraft stores combinations change as operational plans and tactics change and as new stores are developed and fielded. Before operational, training, or test use, the Air Force must certify these configurations for safe loading, carriage, and separation (jettison and normal release), as well as verify ballistics accuracy under the user-certified carriage and employment parameters. The Air Force SEEK EAGLE program completes certification recommendations and recommended flight clearances through any combination of engineering analysis, wind tunnel testing, modeling and simulation, and ground/flight test and evaluation. The SEEK EAGLE effort encompasses eight disciplines: Fit and Function, Flutter, Loads, Stability and Control, Electromagnetic Compatibility/Interference (EMC/EMI), Separations, Ballistics, and Safe Escape.

In support of certification, the program recommends about 1000 aircraft/store combinations for flight each year with analysis and testing, requiring from weeks to years depending on the complexity. Integrated solutions for combat aircrew weapon delivery planning problems are developed and provided to combat forces via Combat Weapons Delivery Software (CWDS) and Joint Safe Escape Analysis Solution (JSEAS).  SEEK EAGLE works in coordination with the Air Force Safety Center to provide Hazards of Electromagnetic Radiation to Ordnance (HERO) analysis and certification recommendations of ordnance systems containing electro-explosive devices. The program is also responsible for inserting new and emerging technologies into the SEEK EAGLE process as well as providing resources for the sustainment of a viable Air Force aircraft/store certification capability.

SEEK EAGLE funds are currently budgeted to support certification testing and analysis for new and inventory stores including, but not limited to: Small Diameter Bomb I &amp; II (SDB), Laser Joint Direct Attack Munitions (LJDAM), Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM), Air Intercept Missile (AIM-9X), Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AIM-120D), Miniature Air-Launched Decoy (MALD), BRU-57 (Smart Bomb Rack), BRU-61 (SDB Bomb Rack), low collateral damage warhead (BLU-129), Wind Corrected Munitions Dispenser (WCMD), Sniper Targeting Pod with video data link, LITENING Targeting Pod with video data link, laser guided bombs, F-22 supersonic tank, B61 (Mod 12), penetrator warhead upgrades (BLU-111/BLU-117), practice bomb and aircraft instrumentation pod modifications.  SEEK EAGLE funds are also used to support certification of other inventory stores on CAF and SOCOM aircraft, assist the F-35 JPO with subject matter expertise in the System Development and Demonstration phase (e.g., development of organic store certifications capability to support F-35 in the Production, Sustainment, and Follow-on Development phases), sustain organic F-22 store certifications capability, and to obtain non-inventory stores and store data for post-integration certification requirements.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>United States Air Force (USAF) Modeling &amp; Simulation (M&amp;S) Program Element (PE) is broken into four thrust areas:  Modeling and Simulation Foundations, Accelerated Acquisition, New and Emerging Warfighting Capabilities, and Warfighter Readiness.  It directly supports Air Force, Joint, Coalition composite training and rehearsal, concept development, and acquisition and testing through model and simulation development as well as the integration of these across and within Live, Virtual, and Constructive (LVC) environments.  This program focuses on support of Department of Defense (DoD) Training Transformation (T2), acquisition excellence initiatives, and foundational capabilities needed for interoperability, accessibility, reuse, and scalability.  It allows the authoritative portrayal of new and emerging Air Force capabilities within Army, Navy, Marines, OSD, interagency, and coalition LVC environments; as well as reciprocating their capabilities within our Air Force LVC environments.  

LVC environments today are used as the most cost effective means to meet mission needs, the most practical means, and sometimes the only way.  In support of the DoD T2 initiative, USAF M&amp;S program thrust areas develop and modernize models and simulations that are the constructive backbone of Air Force and joint training and rehearsal.  Once these models and simulations are developed, they are integrated across training LVC environments for use by Major and Combatant Commands.  This development and integration is imperative to ensure that air, space, and cyberspace training and mission rehearsal activities are supported with realistic, interoperable, and readily available tools, data, and services.  These, in turn, enable joint, coalition, and interagency training required to prepare forces for combat by generating the air and space picture for the Air and Space Operations Center (AOC), Joint Force Air Component Commander (JFACC), and Joint Force Commander in combat exercises; training over 30,000 personnel per year in exercises (e.g., Ulchi Freedom Guardian, Red &amp; Blue Flags, Unified Endeavor, etc).  These programs also provide the current foundational environment that enables warfighters to interact with high-fidelity tactical cockpit simulators, like 5th Generation (5th Gen) and beyond, which replicate high demand/low density platforms that are often unavailable for training due to real-world operations; while simultaneously linking it to warfighters using their current command and control systems 1,000 miles away and the constructive simulations being run from key operational wargaming and simulation centers worldwide. 

USAF M&amp;S is integral to inter-agency Homeland Defense (HLD) exercises chartered to train combat units tasked to protect the Homeland, including the National Capital Region (exercise Amalgam Arrow); generates equipment and manpower efficiencies by using simulations which reduce fuel consumption, aircraft wear and tear, and manpower costs.  In support of the DoD drive to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of its enterprise-wide acquisition business processes, the USAF M&amp;S Program Element develops and supports enhancements to models, simulations, tools, and the LVC infrastructure to provide for system-of-systems M&amp;S capabilities across the lifecycle, reduce developmental costs, and minimize risks. These capabilities support the acquisition process from concept development through test and evaluation.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning. 

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Modeling and Simulation Foundations (MSF) focuses on integrating foundational capabilities needed to improve the usefulness, productivity, scalability and efficiency of Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) capabilities derived from the Warfighter Readiness (WR) thrust, the Accelerated Acquisitions (AA) thrust, and the New and Emerging Warfighting Capabilities (NEWC) thrust.  MSF is the:  standards, policies, procedures, architectures, and tools that enable the rapid and efficient composition of distributed environments to support both the warfighter needs and the US Air Force's (USAF) functional communities of:  acquisition, training, planning, analysis, testing, education, and experimentation requirements.  The efforts supporting the MSF thrust include both concept exploration and development.  

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.  This also funds the USAF in its capacity as the Department of Defense (DoD) Modeling and Simulation Executive Agent (MSEA) for the Air and Space Natural Environment.  MSF's objective is to establish a USAF Live-Virtual-Constructive-Integrated Architecture (LVC-IA) that provides a persistent network of constructive computer simulations, man-in-the-loop virtual simulators, and live forces/resources in an interoperable environment that supports USAF organizations and the functional communities.  This objective will be achieved by MSF providing tools, standards and interfaces to be used by model developers and users to ensure efficiencies and model reuse.  

MSF provides the capability to rapidly and efficiently create realistic and accurate synthetic operational battlespaces to support the full spectrum of activities associated with concept development to acquisition and testing through composite training and mission rehearsal.  This is done by providing appropriate authoritative data and component representations. With the capability generated via MSF, users will readily access available repositories of reusable, validated, and integrated synthetic components.  Synthetic components include representations of operational battlespace entities (such as friendly and enemy assets) and representations of the natural environment that include the terrain, atmospheric and space weather effects; and energy and signal propagation effects.  The rapid composition is based on a durable common architecture framework, policies, and common standards.  MSF capability also supports:  efficient, cost-effective verification, validation, and accreditation activity across all of the M&amp;S functional and organizational communities.   

As the DoD Air and Space Natural Environment Modeling and Simulation Executive Agent (ASNE MSEA), the Air Force coordinates all aspects of DoD M&amp;S related to representations of the air and space natural environment.  The tools developed through this include the Environmental Scenario Generator, the Environmental Data Cube Support System, and the Space Weather Analysis.  ASNE MSEA collaborates with other national partners to provide the USAF and DoD access to authoritative natural environment scenarios necessary for robust "What-if" mission planning and rehearsal and for realistic training, analysis, and acquisition.  ASNE MSEA leads the development and execution of the DoD Integrated Natural Environment Authoritative Representation Process (INEARP) Concept of Operations.

The Information Operations Suite (IOS) provides the authoritative representation of Air Force information operations.  IOS is comprised of models that support training and mission rehearsal for the Air Force, Joint Task Force commanders, and COCOM battle staffs during Joint and Service exercises and experimentations.  Other capabilities, such as the Air Force Synthetic Environment for Reconnaissance and Surveillance (AFSERS) provide for Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) training and exercise support by using virtual simulators and constructive models for command and staff level training.  These capabilities provide commanders, staffs, and operators with common training systems for the employment, tasking, exploitation and dissemination of imagery. 

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>In FY 2012, Project 674991, Accelerated Acquisition, was terminated in order to meet higher Air Force priorities.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>In Fiscal Year 2012, Accelerated Acquisition (AA) focused on fostering M&amp;S tools, data, and infrastructure that enabled high confidence acquisition of capabilities that supported the joint warfighter.  This included Live-Virtual-Constructive (LVC) infrastructure, tools and processes supporting LVC events, and models, tools, data, simulations/stimulation that supported requirements definition, systems engineering and test activities.  Activities also included M&amp;S support for studies and analysis that supported both current program planning and execution and future program planning.  

These efforts enabled more efficient delivery of effective capabilities to the warfighter while reducing the time and resources required for design, development, test and evaluation, maintainability and sustainment.  A key objective was to improve interoperability of weapon systems and platforms through continuing, rigorous interoperability evaluation in a representative Joint Mission Environment.  Additionally, AA activities sought to reduce risk associated with acquisition programs by influencing models, simulations, tools, data and infrastructure linking combat system engineering sites to facilitate concept exploration, development and assessment of systems in a net-centric mission context.  This provided the capability to improve both Service and Joint system performance in a system-of-systems environment.  Connectivity established by the infrastructure built upon existing Service and Joint combat system engineering and test sites, such as Command, Control, Communications, Computer, and Intelligence (C4I) hardware in the loop and computer-program-in-the-loop engineering sites (including design activities, software support activities, test &amp; evaluation facilities and training commands).  

Development included concept of operations, business rules, and procedures that enabled acquisition managers to effectively use LVC capabilities.  These efforts enabled accurately represented C4I networks for capability requirement definition, development, and testing activities to evaluate those systems for interoperability and integration into a joint environment.  This addressed interoperability issues by providing a means for discovering issues early on. 
 
This program was in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, this budget activity included development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>In FY 2012, Project 675004, New and Emerging Capabilities, was completed meeting short-term special Modeling &amp; Simulation (M&amp;S) rapid prototype and fielding needs.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The New and Emerging Capabilities (NEWC) are a collection of short-term, special Modeling &amp; Simulation (M&amp;S) programs requiring rapid prototype and fielding.  These capabilities meet air, space, or cyberspace gaps identified by Air Force Major Commands, U.S. Combatant Commands, or agencies; address Air Force core competencies; ensure Air Force's force structure or power projections are appropriately represented in DoD, joint, and service training, rehearsal, and assessments; ensure interoperability of simulations among weapon system programs; and field initial Air Force capabilities in support of Department of Defense priorities.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Modeling and Simulation support to our Warfighter's Readiness is a United States Air Force (USAF) corporate imperative to ensure air, space, cyberspace training, and mission rehearsal activities are supported with realistic, interoperable, and readily available, tools, data, services and environments.  Warfighter readiness supports Department of Defense (DoD) Training Transformation (T2) and Joint National Training Capability (JNTC) along with the USAF priorities and core functions.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning, execution, and future program planning.  

It includes several complimentary programs, initiatives and areas for investment:  Warfighter and Joint Training Integration supports the Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF) directed Live-Virtual-Constructive (LVC) integration efforts and is a critical piece to the USAF's implementation of the Strategic Plan for Transforming DoD Training.  The goal of LVC training and mission rehearsal is to prepare our warfighters for the full range of military operations and maintain the combat readiness levels required by the Combatant Commands (COCOMs).  This can only be accomplished by training and rehearsing in realistic operational environments.  These environments include live training ranges and virtual simulators enhanced with constructive entities.  Specific training and mission rehearsal events can include some or all of these simultaneously; making the ability to integrate LVC capabilities a necessity.  

The Air, Space, and Cyberspace Constructive Environment (ASCCE) is the USAF's authoritative federation of constructive training models and tools realistically representing the tactical and operational capabilities the USAF brings to the joint fight.  It includes the Air Force Modeling and Simulation Training Toolkit (AFMSTT), which provides the authoritative representation of AF and joint theater-level air and space power and is used to train Air and Space Operations Center (AOC) personnel and Combat Commanders (COCOM) battle staffs.  The primary model in the AFMSTT is the Air Warfare Simulation (AWSIM).  The Joint Training Transformation Initiative (JTTI) is a CSAF and Chief of Staff of the Army initiative to improve air, space, and cyberspace power fidelity to the Battle Command Training Program (BCTP), a US Army training event for senior commanders and their staffs, as well as improving ground component fidelity to AF operational-level exercises. 

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, these budget activities include development efforts to upgrade systems currently fielded or has approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The United States Air Force (USAF) Distributed Mission Operations Center (DMOC) is an Air Combat Command, USAF Warfare Center, 505th Command and Control Wing (505th CCW) organization.  It provides joint interoperability training and testing to geographically separated Live, Virtual, and Constructive (LVC) assets--real-world weapon systems, operator-in-the-loop, and computer-driven simulations.  Responsibilities include:   development and integration of Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) training and test events, networks, scenarios, and databases in support of service, joint, and coalition warfighters.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.  

DMOC is the lead integrator for Air Force DMO and virtual contributions to the Joint National Training Capability (JNTC).  Additionally, DMOC is the lead agency for Virtual Flag (VF) exercises and the DMO Multi-Level Security (MLS)/Cross-Domain Solution (CDS) testbed.  

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The United States Air Force (USAF) Distributed Mission Operations Center (DMOC) is an Air Combat Command, USAF Warfare Center, 505th Command and Control Wing (505th CCW) organization.  It provides joint interoperability training and testing to geographically separated Live, Virtual, and Constructive (LVC) assets--real-world weapon systems, operator-in-the-loop, and computer-driven simulations.  Responsibilities include:   development and integration of Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) training and test events, networks, scenarios, and databases in support of service, joint, and coalition warfighters.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.  

DMOC is the lead integrator for Air Force DMO and virtual contributions to the Joint National Training Capability (JNTC).  Additionally, DMOC is the lead agency for Virtual Flag (VF) exercises and the DMO Multi-Level Security (MLS)/Cross-Domain Solution (CDS) testbed.  

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Distributed Mission Operations Center (DMOC) supports AF/Joint/Coalition DMO and the Joint National Training Capability (JNTC) through the development and integration of DMO training and test events, networks, scenarios, and databases.  Due to ever-changing modeling &amp; simulation technology, the DMOC is an on-going, evolutionary effort to keep pace with those changes by continuously developing/upgrading DMO environment generators, systems, and tools and ensuring integration/interoperability of new systems (i.e. 5th Gen Fighter) into DMO to provide the best warfighter training possible.    
  
DMOC awards full and open contracts that manage the acquisition, development, testing, and integration of DMO standards, training, modeling and simulation, multi-level security testbed, and exercises on Air Force and Joint DMO networks.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>In September 03, the AF/CV directed the establishment of funding to increase participation in joint transformation activities including joint concept development and experimentation and joint Doctrine, Organization, Training, Material, Leadership &amp; Education, Personnel &amp; Facilities (DOTMLPF) recommendations. Air Force A5XS ensures accurate representation of air, space and cyber space capabilities in joint activities, through modeling and simulation and wargaming activities. The primary activity this is accomplished with is the Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force’s Unified Engagement (UE) wargame series. UE is a two cycle of plan, execute, analyze and report of activities that include workshops, seminars, capstone event, senior leader seminar, and Building Partnership Capacity events. The capstone event includes over 400 Joint, other Agency, and coalition partners supported by cutting edge technology. The Wargaming Environment (WIE) evolves with each UE game cycle and is made up of three main parts GamePoint, ViewPoint, and Modeling and Simulation Tools.  GamePoint provides the latest collaboration and information throughout and during the wargame and associated events. ViewPoint provides users a simple method to visually view the information and conduct their own analysis. Modeling and Simulation provides integration of the latest modeling, simulation and analysis tools and also the infrastructure to support the WIE. This program is categorized in Budget Activity (BA) 07 because it supports the development efforts of operational systems.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>In September 03, the AF/CV directed the establishment of funding to increase participation in joint transformation activities including joint concept development and experimentation and joint Doctrine, Organization, Training, Material, Leadership &amp; Education, Personnel &amp; Facilities (DOTMLPF) recommendations. Air Force A5XS ensures accurate representation of air, space and cyber space capabilities in joint activities, through modeling and simulation and wargaming activities. The primary activity this is accomplished with is the Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force’s Unified Engagement (UE) wargame series. UE is a two cycle of plan, execute, analyze and report of activities that include workshops, seminars, capstone event, senior leader seminar, and Building Partnership Capacity events. The capstone event includes over 400 Joint, other Agency, and coalition partners supported by cutting edge technology. The Wargaming Environment (WIE) evolves with each UE game cycle and is made up of three main parts GamePoint, ViewPoint, and Modeling and Simulation Tools.  GamePoint provides the latest collaboration and information throughout and during the wargame and associated events. ViewPoint provides users a simple method to visually view the information and conduct their own analysis. Modeling and Simulation provides integration of the latest modeling, simulation and analysis tools and also the infrastructure to support the WIE.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Unified Engagement (UE) Wargame Information Environment (WIE) support: The WIE is a continually evolving system that is a deployable standalone Local Area Network (LAN) with servers and laptops that host applications to support virtual battlespace collaboration, decision making, and three dimensional visualizations.  Behind these applications are cutting edge technologies and database architectures from both commercial off the shelf and government developed software that assures relevance to the UE Wargame.  The modeling, simulation, and analysis applications allow UE participants, adjudicators, and control team members to effectively and efficiently create UE Report with tested concepts and conclusions to improve our future Air Force to the CSAF biannually.  The current version of the WIE is 2.5 and 3.0 is to be released is Dec 2013 which coincides with Unified Engagement Wargame capstone event which occurs every 2 years.  Risks are low in the research, development, and test of the WIE because of the iterative nature in the design and development of the system. </r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Please refer to the Performance Base Budget Overview Book for information on how Air Force resources are applied and how those resources are contributing to Air Force performance goals and most importantly, how they contribute to our mission.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Mission planning involves the creation of a flight plan based on threats, targets, terrain, weather, aircraft performance capability, and configuration.  It is an essential task that must be completed prior to any fixed or rotary wing aircraft sortie.  The planner must have the ability to plan weapons, cargo, passenger, and/or fuel delivery, calculate fuel requirements, and assess the route based on known enemy threat location and type.  Mission planners must be able to optimize and de-conflict flight routes with other aircraft; review, print, and brief the mission plan; and download pertinent flight information to on-board aircraft avionics.

The Mission Planning Systems (MPS) program is a collaborative program with the Army and Navy to leverage technical solutions and business practices for all Department of Defense (DoD) platforms.  It provides automated mission planning tools and support for fixed and rotary wing aircraft and guided munitions.  It replaced two closed architecture legacy mission planning systems (Unix-based MPS (Unix-MPS) and the PC-based Portable Flight Planning Software (PFPS)), with a single multi-service open architecture system more commonly referred to as the Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS).  MPS will compress the mission planning cycle by providing an improved integrated planning environment, reducing the time required to respond to changing situations and urgent needs such as striking time sensitive/critical targets and conducting combat search and rescue.  The MPS development program will migrate a variety of Air Force aircraft, weapons, and airdrop payload systems from legacy mission planners to MPS.  These systems include, but are not limited to the: A-10, B-1B, C-5, C-17, C-130, E-3, E-8, F-15, F-16, F-22A, RC-135, HH-60, and their associated weapons (e.g. Small Diameter Bomb (SDB), Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM), Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Munitions (JASSM), etc.) and airdrop payloads.  In addition, basic MPS products have the potential to support all DoD fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft and will be shared with other AF programs, as well as the Army and Navy.  MPS will deliver significant benefits to command and control performance by enhancing information superiority for the warfighter and by providing unique capabilities in support of both precision engagement and dominant maneuver.  To meet the unique needs of Air Mobility Command (AMC), the Mobility Air Force Automated Flight Planning Service (MAFPS) component of MPS will provide a centralized/net-centric global mobility mission flight planning capability. This service will provide significant fuel savings through automated flight route optimization utilizing aircraft performance, air traffic management, weather, and other data.  Additionally, elements of Mission Planning Systems will be utilized to continue the development of a Joint Precision Airdrop System (JPADS) in conjunction with the Army.

The JPADS System of Systems (SoS) capability provides a planning and execution capability for DoD airdrop requirements. It is the primary airdrop mission planning and execution system for all ballistic airdrop mission, as well as precision guided airdrops that are required when the mission profile or surface-to-air threat assessment warrants a high-altitude and/or standoff precision delivery.  JPADS enables high-altitude, precise airdrop delivery to forward ground forces, mitigating surface-to-air threats, reducing risk of Improvised Explosive Device (IED), and insurgent attack on ground convoys. JPADS allows the warfighter to consider weather, terrain, aircraft capabilities, threat, etc. to accurately deliver payloads to keep the warfighter supplied and in the fight.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, which includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>Project 673858 was renamed Mission Planning Systems Development from Mission Planning Systems in FY13.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Mission planning involves the creation of a flight plan based on threats, targets, terrain, weather, aircraft performance capability and configuration. It is an essential task that must be completed prior to any fixed or rotary wing aircraft sortie. The planner must have the ability to plan weapon, cargo, passenger, and/or fuel delivery, calculate fuel requirement and assess the route based on known enemy threat location and type. Mission planners must be able to optimize and de-conflict flight routes with other aircraft; review, print and brief the plan; and download pertinent flight information to on-board aircraft avionics.

This project provides for the continuous improvement of mission planning software capabilities that cut across all platforms and systems. It allows for the investigation of new technologies and products that have the potential for improving mission planning systems. This includes the continuous upgrading of the MPS framework. The framework is the underlying baseline for all mission planning systems. It will require continuous upgrades to: 1) reduce timelines for route planning; 2) transmit near real-time intelligence data to the platforms; 3) increase the accuracy of the mapping products; 4) provide a Windows-based, commercial off the shelf-based, user friendly product; and 5) retain compatibility with platform changes to avionics and operational flight programs. Development and modernization activities within this project are as follows:

a. MPS Increment IV: Continues development activities to complete the initial migration of designated Increment IV platforms (from the Combat Air Forces (CAF) and Mobility Air Forces (MAF--includes Special Mission Air Combat Command (SMACC) aircraft) to the new MPS planning capability. This includes the F-22 Mission Planning Environment (MPE) which will support new capabilities for weapons integration, sensor updates, and avionics changes integrated on board the aircraft. Planned updates include transitioning selected platform to the Windows 7 operating system. Additionally, the development effort will also address new and emerging Operational Flight Program (OFP)-generated requirements as identified by the operational users. Maintenance and common component updates will be completed as required.

b. MPS Modernization: Continues the modernization of overarching technologies (including the framework) to support development of Mission Planning Environments (MPEs) for various CAF and MAF platforms. Development funding for these modernization efforts will move to project 675380 in FY14.

c. CAF MPE Modernization: This effort will modernize CAF MPEs originally developed and delivered under MPS Increments II &amp; IV. The modernization effort will provide new and improved mission planning capability for individual OFP requirements, such as new weapons, avionics upgrades, communications systems, etc. The OFPs requiring MPE updates under the CAF Modernization effort include but are not limited to those for A-10 (Suites 8, 9, 10, 11, 12), B-1B (Sustainment Blocks (SB) 15, 16, 16a, 17 and 18), and F-15 (Suites 7, 8, 9, and 10). CAF modernization also includes updates to mission planning capabilities supporting associated weapons, including Small Diameter Bomb (SDB), Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM) and the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM). Finally, CAF modernization will address required improvements to CAF related MPE Common Components (CCs), including Precision-Guided Munitions Planning System (PGMPS), Electronic Warfare CC (EWCC), etc. Development funding for these modernization efforts will move to project 675380 in FY14.

d. MAF MPE Modernization: This effort modifies the common MAF MPE developed and deployed during previous mission planning increments. The modernization activities will provide new and improved mission planning capabilities for the MAF fleet as required to meet evolving OFPs, fuel efficiency, and Global Planning netcentric requirements such as avionics upgrades, communication systems, interfaces with command and control systems, new chute data, etc. for various MAF platforms. The MPE updates under the MAF Modernization effort include but are not limited to those for Air Mobility Command--C-5, C-17, C-27, C-130s (multiple variants), KC-10, KC-46, and KC-135 and Special Mission Air Combat Command--E-3, E-8, E-4, HH-60, and RC-135. MAF modernization will also address required improvements to and integration of MAF related MPE CCs, including the Communications, Navigation Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) CC, Consolidated Airdrop Tool (CAT), Aeronautical Advisory and Notices to Airmen Tool (AANT), and Air Refueling Tool (ART) CC, etc. Development funding for these modernization efforts will move to project 675380 in FY14.

e. Test, Training and Certification: Continues all MPS-related integration, test, and certification activities for CAF and MAF platforms. Funding for these support efforts will be programmed with their associated project/program in FY14 and the outyears.

f. Operational and Technical Support: Continues all program office management operations and support activities to ensure the timely delivery of mission planning systems to the warfighter. 

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production, and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Mission planning involves the creation of a flight plan based on multiple inputs including threats, targets, terrain, weather, aircraft performance capability, and configuration. It is an essential task that must be completed prior to any fixed or rotary wing aircraft sortie. The planner must have the ability to plan weapon, cargo, passenger, and/or fuel delivery, calculate fuel requirement and assess the route based on known enemy threat location and type. Mission planners must be able to optimize and de-conflict flight routes with other aircraft; review, print and brief the plan; download pertinent flight information to on-board aircraft avionics; and, conduct dynamic/in-flight replanning as applicable.  This project continues the development of a Joint Precision Airdrop System-Mission Planner (JPADS-MP) in conjunction with the Army.  The JPADS System of Systems (SoS) capability provides a planning and execution capability for DoD airdrop requirements. It is the primary airdrop mission planning and execution system for all ballistic airdrop mission as well as precision guided airdrops that are required when the mission profile or surface-to-air threat assessment warrants a high-altitude and/or standoff precision delivery.  JPADS enables high-altitude, precise airdrop delivery to forward ground forces, mitigating surface-to-air threats, reducing risk of Improvised Explosive Device (IED) &amp; insurgent attack on ground convoys. JPADS allows the warfighter to consider weather, terrain, aircraft capabilities, threat, etc. to accurately deliver payloads to keep the warfighter supplied and in the fight.

The Joint Precision Airdrop System-Mission Planner (JPADS-MP) program of record (PoR), of which the Consolidated Airdrop Tool (CAT) software is a key deliverable, continues development of CAT to provide precision and conventional airdrop capability for AF and other services (e.g the Army, etc).  Future releases of CAT software concentrate on increasing the accuracy of airdrop mission planning by improving aircraft, payload, and chute specific calculations along with weather analysis visualization tools specifically adapted for airdrop.  In addition, the AFRL led Precision Airdrop (PAD) Flagship Capability Concept (FCC) effort will transition capabilities to the JPADS-MP PoR, specifically into various CAT software release deliverables. The PAD FCC is charged with updating airdrop platforms and airdrop related systems to improve accuracy across all airdrop mission types.

                            <r2:ProjectNote>Project 675380 was renamed Mission Planning Systems (MPS) Modernization from Combat Air Forces (CAF) Planning Systems in FY13.

All MPS Modernization efforts will be centralized in project 675380 starting in FY14, including efforts previously found in project 673858.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Mission planning involves the creation of a flight plan based on threats, targets, terrain, weather, aircraft performance capability and configuration.  It is an essential task that must be completed prior to any fixed or rotary wing aircraft sortie.  The planner must have the ability to plan weapons, cargo, passenger, and/or fuel delivery, calculate fuel requirement, and assess the route based on known enemy threat location and type.  Mission planners must be able to optimize and de-conflict flight routes with other aircraft, review, print and brief the plan; and download pertinent flight information to on-board aircraft avionics.  This project focuses on modernizing MPS to support Combat Air Forces (CAF) and Mobility Air Forces (MAF), including the development, test and sustainment of Mission Planning Environments (MPEs) to support the A-10, B-1B, C-5, C-17, C- 27, C-130, E-3, E-8, F-15, F-16, F-22A, KC-10, KC-46, KC-135, RC-135, other platforms, and all common component (CCs)software tools  currently approved as necessary for mission requirements.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.  MPS modernization efforts are as follows:

a. MPS Increment IV Development: This effort continues update/development activities for platforms that previously transitioned to MPS (e.g. F-15, F-16, A-10, B-1B, and F-22A Increment 3.2A) to provide capabilities in accordance with the Increment IV Capability Development Document (CDD). In addition, it also upgrades several common components (CCs) that are utilized on a variety of CAF platforms. Starting in FY13, all MPS Increment IV Development efforts will reside in Project 673858, Mission Planning Systems (MPS) development.

b. CAF MPE Modernization: These efforts modernize CAF MPEs that were developed and delivered under MPS Increments II and IV. The modernization effort will provide new and improved mission planning capability for individual Operational Flight Program (OFP) requirements, such as new weapons, avionics upgrades, communications systems, etc. The OFPs requiring MPE updates under the CAF modernization effort in Fiscal Years 2011 through 2017 include but are not limited to those for A-10 (Suites 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12), B-1B (Sustainment Blocks 15, 16, 16a, 17 and 18), F-15 (Suites 7, 8, 9, and 10), F-16 Block 30 (System Capability Upgrade [SCU] 8, 9, and 10), F-16 Block 40/50 (M6.1, M6.5, M7.1, and M8.0) and F-22 (Increments 3.2B, 3.2C, and 4.0). CAF modernization also includes updates to mission planning capabilities supporting associated weapons, including small diameter bomb (SDB-II), joint direct attack munitions (JDAM) and the Joint air-to-surface standoff missile (JASSM). Finally, CAF modernization will address required improvements to CAF related MPE CCs, including Precision-Guided Munitions Planning System (PGMPS), Electronic Warfare CC (EWCC), etc.

(Starting in FY14, CAF MPE Modernization is broken out into specific platforms as per the following.)

1) F-15 Modernization:  This modernization program consists of multiple software development efforts driven by OFPs updates for F-15 Suites 7, 8, and 9.  Suite 7 MPE capabilities include, but are not limited to, Digital Transfer Device (DTD) improvements, updates for new features in weapons such as Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM), Small Diameter Bomb (SDB), AIM-9X, AIM-120D, and Network Enable Weapon support elements (e.g. key handling, weapon data link, and Link 16).  It will also include enhancements to the synthetic aperture radar planning tool (SAR-PT) and the global area reference tool as well as radar modernization updates (e.g. combat identification, radar planning tool enhancements).  Development efforts for F-15 Suite 8 include, but are not limited to, integration of B61 Life Extension Program, feature updates for several weapons, and the expansion of Link-16 messages sets.  F-15 Suite 9 MPE updates will include a variety of updates and enhancements for weapons and aircraft systems.

2) F-16 Block 30 Modernization:  The F-16 Block 30 modernization effort will support new aircraft capabilities established in OFPs for the SCU8, SCU9, and SCU10.  The effort will also migrate the F-16 Block 30 Mission Planning Environment (MPE) to the Windows 7 operating system and the current version of the MPS Framework.  SCU8 system capabilities include the addition of Helmet Mounted Integrated Targeting (HMIT), Small Diameter Bomb (SDB), the AIM-120D missile variant and Center Display Unit (CDU) Integration.  SCU9 capabilities include finishing HMIT and CDU integrations, support of Threat Symbology/Correlation (TS/C) file import (commonality with F-16 Block 40/50) and the addition of the Laser JDAM.

3) F-16 Block 40/50 Modernization:  The F-16 Block 40/50 modernization efforts will provide the capability within the MPE to plan/utilize a number or OFP-driven capabilities in the platform.  These capabilities include, but are not limited to, integrating the universal armament interface (UAI) with the most recent version of precision guided munitions planning software (PGMPS) to give the platform the ability to plan missions for any type of network enabled weapon (NEW).  It will also provide for UAI compliance with the small diameter bomb (SDB; GBU-39) and the laser joint direct attack munition (LJDAM; GBU-54).  The modernization effort will also provide for the use of the advanced identification friend or foe (AIFF) Mode 5 capability in the F-16 Blk 40/50.  AIFF will allow use of enhanced authentication and verification of friendly signals, through the incorporation of cryptographically secured signals.  It will also introduce Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) technology and facilitate compliance with standards for the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen).  The development effort will also migrate the F-16 Block 40/50 MPE to the Windows 7 operating environment

4) F-22 Modernization:  F-22 OFP-driven enhancements include, but are not limited to the addition of improved capabilities for the AIM-9X and AIM-120D, the incorporation of additional electronic protection tasks, the small diameter bomb target list manager, combat identification improvements, installation of the auto ground collision avoidance system, and incorporation of the synthetic aperture radar planning tool.  Additionally, other new and emerging OFP-generated requirements will be addressed as identified by the operational user(s).  Other common component updates will also be completed as required.

5) B-1 Modernization:  The B-1 Modernization program includes OFP-driven software updates for Releases 7.0, 8.0, and 9.0.  It will incrementally update the platform MPE and provide for integration with the Reliability and Maintainability Improvement Program (RMIP)/Inertial Navigation System Replacement (INSR), Laptop Computer Targeting Pod Phase 2 (LCTP), Integrated Battle Station elements (including Fully Integrated Data Link/Visual Situation Display Upgrade (VSDU)), Central Integrated Test System Upgrade (CITS), and related follow on enhancements.  Additionally it will migrate the B-1 MPE to the Windows 7 operating system and convert the B-1 Unit Planning Component (UPC) Visual Basic (VB) code to C# .NET.

6) A-10 Modernization:  The A-10 effort will continue to support aircraft OFP-driven capability enhancement for Suite 7B and Suite 8.  Suite 7B capabilities include, but are not limited to, JPEG 2000 Maps, Situational Awareness Data Link (SADL) Crypto Upgrade, Electronic Warfare Threat Table Correlation, pre-planning combat search and rescue parameters and helmet mounted cueing system updates.

The main purpose of the E-3/E-8 v2.0 software is to provide Windows 7 capability to maintain SDC compliance. The purpose of the E-3/E-8 v3.0 development effort is to add requested enhancements, while v3.1 will deliver software that is fully compatible with the E-3 DRAGON avionics upgrade, including CNS/ATM certification. RC-135 v3.0 will include compatibility with potential aircraft avionics upgrades and maintain SDC and Windows compliance. EC-130 v1.0 will be the platform's first release on the JMPS software. Work will also commence on the Phase 2 program for these aircraft.

2) MAF MPS Modernization (AMC Transition): This effort modifies the common MAF MPE developed and deployed during previous mission planning increments. It will provide new and improved mission planning capabilities for the MAF fleet (e.g. C-5, C-130, KC-10, etc.) as required to meet OFP, fuel efficiency, and global planning net-centric requirements. It includes enhanced capabilities to accommodate avionics upgrades, improved communications systems, interfaces with command and control systems, new chutes, etc. for various MAF platforms. Development efforts also include integrating improvements to MAF related Common Components (CCs). Examples of these CCs include the Communication, Navigation, Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) CC, Consolidated Airdrop Tool (CAT), Aeronautical Advisory and Notices to Airmen Tool (AANT), and Air Refueling Tool (ART). This effort also provides the capability to use the new Digital Aeronautical Information File (DAFIF) services-based data structure being produced by NGA.

d.  Mobility Air Force Automated Flight Planning Service (MAFPS):  This effort includes development of a centralized/net-centric global mobility flight planning capability, which will provide significant fuel savings through automated flight route, airspeed, and altitude optimization utilizing aircraft performance, air traffic management, weather, and other data.

e. Test, Training and Certification: Continues all MPS-related integration, test, and certification activities for all CAF and MAF platforms.

f. Program Support: Continues all program office management operations and support activities to ensure the timely delivery of mission planning systems to the warfighter.
 
This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, which includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and, anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY2014, 670374, Tech &amp; Spt efforts, 670374, were transferred to PE 0305221F, Network Centric Collaborative Targeting, 675197, NCCT Core Technology, to better support and align with the Suter Program System (SPS). </r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element funds research and development of strategy, assessment, and information operations (IO) capabilities required in support of Air Operation Center (AOC) command and control processes and supported combatant commanders.  Programs currently supported include the Information Warfare Planning Capability (IWPC) - the Joint Forces Air Component Commander's (JFACC) system of record for strategy, operational assessment and network mapping/network nodal analysis.  IWPC is a full-spectrum, offensive and defensive, planning capability.  IWPC is an AOC weapon system component which enables operators to develop courses of action for the JFACC, create Air Operations Directives (AODs) and Joint Air Operations Plans (JAOPs), and nominate IO "targets" for inclusion into the Master Air Attack Plan and the Joint Integrated Prioritized Target List (JIPTL).  This project funds the development and upgrade, testing and evaluation, and installation and training of an evolving suite of interoperable planning and decision support capabilities comprised of software, hardware, and communications products.  This project will identify and implement an open, scalable system architecture that will accommodate growth as the virtual world grows and cyber operations change.  The project builds functional software modules that are designed to be interoperable with Command and Control (C2) systems such as the Theater Battle Management Core System (TBMCS), Joint Targeting Toolbox, and other AOC tools.  This PE funds development and continued research to identify existing military and commercial efforts which can satisfy unfulfilled operational requirements for IO analysis, targeting, planning, and integration.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.  

FY13 funding also supports the National Technical Nuclear Forensics (NTNF) program.  The NTNF program provides the US Government's framework to identify the source of a nuclear detonation in US or allied territory. AF contributions to this effort, include, but are not limited to collection of airborne particulate material following an incident. Currently, collection would be accomplished via a WC-135 Constant Phoenix aircraft, which is a limited availability asset (only one primary aircraft in the fleet).  The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is developing a harvester pod with the potential of being mounted on an aircraft that will provide additional capacity to conduct this mission.  Funding will provide integration and testing of that pod.  
 
This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

                            <r2:ProjectNote>In FY2014, 670374, Tech &amp; Spt, efforts transferred to PE 0305221F, Network Centric Collaborative Targeting, 675197, NCCT Core Technology, in order to better support and align with the Suter Program System (SPS). </r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Program Element funds research and development of strategy, assessment, and information operations (IO) capabilities required in support of Air Operation Center (AOC) command and control processes and supported combatant commanders.  Programs currently supported include the Information Warfare Planning Capability (IWPC) - the Joint Forces Air Component Commander's (JFACC) system of record for strategy, operational assessment and network mapping/network nodal analysis.  IWPC is a full-spectrum, offensive and defensive, planning capability.  IWPC is an AOC weapon system component which enables operators to develop courses of action for the JFACC, create Air Operations Directives (AODs) and Joint Air Operations Plans (JAOPs), and nominate IO "targets" for inclusion into the Master Air Attack Plan and the Joint Integrated Prioritized Target List (JIPTL).  This project funds the development and upgrade, testing and evaluation, and installation and training of an evolving suite of interoperable planning and decision support capabilities comprised of software, hardware, and communications products.  This project will identify and implement an open, scalable system architecture that will accommodate growth as the virtual world grows and cyber operations change.  The project builds functional software modules that are designed to be interoperable with Command and Control (C2) systems such as the Theater Battle Management Core System (TBMCS), Joint Targeting Toolbox, and other AOC tools.  This PE funds development and continued research to identify existing military and commercial efforts which can satisfy unfulfilled operational requirements for IO analysis, targeting, planning, and integration.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.  

FY13 funding also supports the National Technical Nuclear Forensics (NTNF) program.  The NTNF program provides the US Government's framework to identify the source of a nuclear detonation in US or allied territory. AF contributions to this effort, include, but are not limited to collection of airborne particulate material following an incident. Currently, collection would be accomplished via a WC-135 Constant Phoenix aircraft, which is a limited availability asset (only one primary aircraft in the fleet).  The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is developing a harvester pod with the potential of being mounted on an aircraft that will provide additional capacity to conduct this mission.  Funding will provide integration and testing of that pod.  
 
This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Mission: The US Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) responsibilities include planning, integrating, and coordinating cyberspace capabilities; operational and tactical level planning and day-to-day employment of assigned and attached Offensive Cyber Operations (OCO) forces; integration of OCO forces with Defensive Cyber Operations (DCO) forces and planning and coordination of cyber capabilities that have trans regional effects or that directly support national objectives; providing OCO/DCO support for assigned missions and OCO/DCO planning and integration in support of other Combatant Commanders (CCMD) as directed. Also coordinating Computer Network Operations (CNO) capabilities in order to achieve national security objectives. The capabilities directly support execution of offensive cyber operations against adversary networks, directly support Combatant Commands (COCOMs), and coordinate with defensive operations to defend and protect the Department of Defense (DoD) network. USCYBERCOM's operations provide mission assurance for US Forces while denying the same to national adversaries. 


USCYBERCOM will develop defensive cyber strategies and capabilities to ensure force flow during campaign operations and to expand DoD Offensive Cyber Operations (OCO) capabilities.  USCYBERCOM will research, develop, and test technologies and capabilities that allow Cyber forces to conduct future offensive and defensive cyber operations in support of CCMDs to include title 10 infrastructures, and cross cutting technologies. Activities also include studies and analysis to support current program planning and execution.  USCYBERCOM will also provide the resources for other COCOMs to conduct CNO Offensive Cyber Operations/Defensive Cyber Operations (OCO/DCO) planning. An in-house development team (Special Projects Vulnerability Assessment Team) will perform research, small scale prototyping and integration as required to support the mission. Further detail is classified and can be provided upon request. Additionally, this team will re-tool existing offensive and defensive capabilities to satisfy immediate USCYBERCOM operational needs. Finally, USCYBERCOM will delegate resources to the Army, Navy, and Air Force Cyber Service Components to develop deconflicted offensive cyber capabilities in accordance with USCYBERCOM Operational Directive 12-001.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year. </r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program rapidly develops operations-ready information and cyberspace superiority capabilities from laboratory, industry, and academia via studies, rapid prototyping, technology demonstrations, and other Research, Development, Testing, and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) efforts. This program consists of a portfolio of small programs and projects called the Offensive Cyber Product Line (OCPL). The OCPL establishes a level of effort to support a balanced and rapid acquisition of cyber operational capabilities. OCPL effectiveness comes from consciously balancing funding into four capability areas required for effective operations: Common Mission Framework (CMF), platforms, access, and capabilities. The program office provides advanced OCPL cyber warfare capabilities to the 24th Air Force in direct support of USCYBERCOM, AF major commands (MAJCOMs), unified commands, and national IO agencies. In accordance with AF Policy, the program office develops capabilities in following information and cyberspace superiority core areas: influence operations, electronic warfare operations, and network warfare operations. OCPL efforts also directly support the Joint Network Attack Initial Capabilities Document (ICD), the National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations (NMS-CO), the USCYBERCOM Operational Directive 12-001, and the AF Space Command (AFSPC) Offensive Cyberspace Operations System Flight Plan. Planned areas of study, prototyping, and technology demonstration will be used to provide warfighters access, platforms, Offensive Cyber Operations (OCO) production (e.g. test and budgets), infrastructure (e.g. mission planning, intelligence, Command and Control/Situational Awareness (C2SA)), and tools needed to exploit enemy networks, telephony, Integrated Air Defense Systems (IADS), electronic warfare operations, and Command and Control systems. These advancements will be used to develop and deliver cutting-edge technologies to the warfighter. This capability area utilizes cyber technology investments by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the National Security Agency (NSA), Air Force Research Labs, and DOD national laboratories. Program activities are protected under AF Network Warfare Special Access Program(s).  

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to mature systems to full operational capability or sustain fielded systems.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program rapidly develops operations-ready information and cyberspace superiority capabilities from laboratory, industry, and academia via studies, rapid prototyping, technology demonstrations, and other Research, Development, Testing, and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) efforts. This program consists of a portfolio of small programs and projects called the Offensive Cyber Product Line (OCPL). The OCPL establishes a level of effort to support a balanced and rapid acquisition of cyber operational capabilities. OCPL effectiveness comes from consciously balancing funding into four capability areas required for effective operations: Common Mission Framework (CMF), platforms, access, and capabilities. The program office provides advanced OCPL cyber warfare capabilities to the 24th Air Force in direct support of USCYBERCOM, AF major commands (MAJCOMs), unified commands, and national IO agencies. In accordance with AF Policy, the program office develops capabilities in following information and cyberspace superiority core areas: influence operations, electronic warfare operations, and network warfare operations. OCPL efforts also directly support the Joint Network Attack Initial Capabilities Document (ICD), the National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations (NMS-CO), the USCYBERCOM Operational Directive 12-001, and the AF Space Command (AFSPC) Offensive Cyberspace Operations System Flight Plan. Planned areas of study, prototyping, and technology demonstration will be used to provide warfighters access, platforms, Offensive Cyber Operations (OCO) production (e.g. test and budgets), infrastructure (e.g. mission planning, intelligence, Command and Control/Situational Awareness (C2SA)), and tools needed to exploit enemy networks, telephony, Integrated Air Defense Systems (IADS), electronic warfare operations, and Command and Control systems. These advancements will be used to develop and deliver cutting-edge technologies to the warfighter. This capability area utilizes cyber technology investments by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the National Security Agency (NSA), Air Force Research Labs, and DOD national laboratories. Program activities are protected under AF Network Warfare Special Access Program(s).  

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to mature systems to full operational capability or sustain fielded systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Offensive Cyberspace Operations program office will utilize Concept, Development, Risk Management, or Production and Deployment Plans as part of a phased approach to acquisition planning. All plans will contain sufficient information for the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) to determine readiness to enter into the applicable phase of the acquisition process. Offensive Cyberspace Operations will look at existing vehicles such as Government-Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) vehicles (Alliant, Encore II, Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement IV (SEWP IV), etc), and General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedules.  The use of multiple award vehicles will provide a wide range of commercially-available products and services that should be able to meet many requirements related to Offensive Cyberspace Operations.  These multiple-award vehicles have already met the statutory requirements of the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) and require that Offensive Cyber Operations provide a fair opportunity to all contract holders, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 16.505, unless an exception to fair opportunity applies.  

In addition, OCPL will also use Broad Agency Announcements (BAAs) which allow us to constantly accept, analyze, and acquire promising new commercial capabilities.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY2014, Information  Systems Security Program 667820 RDTE:  Firestarter efforts transferred to PE 0208088F, AF Defensive Cyberspace Operations, 667820, Computer Security RDTE:  Firestarter, in order to align defensive cyber programs and projects.
</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Firestarter program provides new/improved capabilities and technical transition opportunities for Cyber Defense and Information Assurance (IA) technologies and tools needed to defend Air Force Command, Control, Communications, Computer, and Intelligence (C4I) systems from Cyber-attacks, while ensuring recovery in the event of an attack.  Also provides defensive Cyber Command and Control/Situational Awareness (C2/SA), which enables cyber commanders to monitor Air Force network status and execute courses of action to mitigate threats. The emphasis of the program is directed toward defensive cyberspace capabilities; computer and network systems security; damage assessment and recovery; cyber threat recognition, attribution, and mitigation; and active response methodologies in response to evolving threats and changes to cyber environment. These areas of emphasis are realized through research and development, test and acquisition in the areas of: proactive defense, defensive counter cyberspace, cyberspace intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance &amp; situational awareness, persistent network operations, as well as decision support, recovery, and digital forensics.  Current Air Force systems, such as the AFNET NIPRNet Gateways, SIPRNet Modernization program, and Host Based Security System leverage this technology to meet their information assurance and defensive cyberspace needs/requirements. 

This program utilizes cyber and IA technology investments by US Cyber Command, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the National Security Agency (NSA), Director of National Intelligence (DNI), Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA), and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to jump-start its development of solutions to existing Air Force cyber and IA requirements. This program supports AF Space Commands Cyberspace strategic direction in support of Cyber Defense which provides capabilities to 24th AF, as AF component to Cyber Command (CYBERCOM)), Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), National Security Agency (NSA), and other services to ensure Global Information Grid (GIG) cyber and IA requirements are being met. Activities performed include those designed to identify, analyze, test, rapidly acquire, and integrate emerging IA and cyber technology and defensive cyberspace weapons systems and capabilities into all regions of the GIG - terrestrial, airborne, and space systems. Activities include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because it addresses the development and transition of information security, protection, and defensive capabilities and technologies.

</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Firestarter program provides new/improved capabilities and technical transition opportunities for Cyber Defense and Information Assurance (IA) technologies and tools needed to defend Air Force Command, Control, Communications, Computer, and Intelligence (C4I) systems from Cyber-attacks, while ensuring recovery in the event of an attack.  Also provides defensive Cyber Command and Control/Situational Awareness (C2/SA), which enables cyber commanders to monitor Air Force network status and execute courses of action to mitigate threats. The emphasis of the program is directed toward defensive cyberspace capabilities; computer and network systems security; damage assessment and recovery; cyber threat recognition, attribution, and mitigation; and active response methodologies in response to evolving threats and changes to cyber environment. These areas of emphasis are realized through research and development, test and acquisition in the areas of: proactive defense, defensive counter cyberspace, cyberspace intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance &amp; situational awareness, persistent network operations, as well as decision support, recovery, and digital forensics.  Current Air Force systems, such as the AFNET NIPRNet Gateways, SIPRNet Modernization program, and Host Based Security System leverage this technology to meet their information assurance and defensive cyberspace needs/requirements. 

This program utilizes cyber and IA technology investments by US Cyber Command, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the National Security Agency (NSA), Director of National Intelligence (DNI), Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA), and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to jump-start its development of solutions to existing Air Force cyber and IA requirements. This program supports AF Space Commands Cyberspace strategic direction in support of Cyber Defense which provides capabilities to 24th AF, as AF component to Cyber Command (CYBERCOM)), Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), National Security Agency (NSA), and other services to ensure Global Information Grid (GIG) cyber and IA requirements are being met. Activities performed include those designed to identify, analyze, test, rapidly acquire, and integrate emerging IA and cyber technology and defensive cyberspace weapons systems and capabilities into all regions of the GIG - terrestrial, airborne, and space systems. Activities include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because it addresses the development and transition of information security, protection, and defensive capabilities and technologies.
