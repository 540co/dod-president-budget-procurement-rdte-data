                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Advanced IT Services Joint Program Office (AITS-JPO) identifies and integrates new, mature commercial Information Technology (IT) and advanced operational concepts into net-centric battlespace capabilities to:  access and exchange critical information; exploit opportunities to enhance current force capabilities; and project future force IT requirements.  These products provide the Department of Defense (DoD) and National Senior Leaders, (e.g., the President of the United States (POTUS), Secretary of Defense (SECDEF), Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS), Combatant Commands (COCOMs)), as well as inter-agency participants with critical focus on the long-term collaboration, planning and information sharing operations by bringing together technology, security cooperation, and education.  The program components support preparation for future joint and coalition initiatives through development and integration of a full range of data services and advanced IT applications to support practical aspects of approved cooperative activities of the United States and its coalition partners.  These emergent capabilities are technologies that can be rapidly infused into existing tools.  

Program investments in advanced technology benefit strategic and tactical users in the intelligence, warfighting and business domains by providing them with reliable, persistent collaboration, and networking technologies including computing-on-demand to reduce the need to replicate data or services at the point of consumption.  Investments also provide support for virtual end-user environments and semantic search capabilities which enhance the decision-making process.  The goal of the AITS-JPO is to provide the warfighter with technical superiority and to achieve interoperability and integration, while working in concert with joint, allied and coalition forces to effectively counter terrorism and enhance homeland security defense through the confluence of technology, security cooperation, and education.

The program uses three key mechanisms to streamline the process of fielding emergent requirements:  (1) Joint Capability Technology Demonstrations (JCTD) with Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) /COCOM/Service/Agency teaming; (2) Joint Ventures with Combatant Commanders/Program of Record (POR) teaming; and (3) Risk Mitigation Pilots with POR/Community of Interest (COI) teaming.  The JCTD process aligns with the revised Joint Capability Integration and Development System (JCIDS) process, developed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff by adapting technology and concept solutions to meet pressing warfighter needs.  OSD approves new JCTDs annually and on a rolling start basis.  DISA participates in both an operational and transition manager role.  The JCTDs, along with the Joint ventures and risk mitigation pilots, feature teaming with appropriate offices so that funds and skill sets are leveraged across all participants.  The costs are shared, thus reducing the risk to individual organizations.  

The program is further divided into major subprogram areas:  Command and Control (C2) and Combat Support (CS), Information Sharing (IS), Network Infrastructure (NI), Network Operations (NetOps), Cyber Threat Discovery and Program Management Support.

If funds are not provided in FY 2013, DISA will not be able to rapidly deliver high-value capabilities and expose them to the enterprise and warfighter.

                                            <r2:Text>In FY 2011, DISA completed integration work on the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (VCJCS) National Senior Leadership Decision Support Service (NSLDSS) initiative.  The focus of the FY 2011 capabilities included the ability to place global and national level events into context using a contextual reasoning framework and automating and refining outdated business processes in today's national operations and intelligence center. The operational utility assessment included favorable comments from the VCJCS on the delivered NSLDSS framework and technical underpinnings. Further, decision aid tools and infrastructure components were added as a means of providing improved decision making based on improved capabilities to understand an event, visualizing the various courses of action, and understanding the context and ramifications of the actions.  These capabilities expanded user credentialing via personal attribute based access to interface with the Enterprise Identity Attribute Service to securely harvest the personal information that will improve unanticipated user access. Further, initial integration and demonstration of a machine identity capability was successfully demonstrated and will be part of the Local Attribute Store (LAS)/Contextual Policy Decision Point (CPDP) transition. A mediation service for Universal Core and DoD Metadata Standard (CDMS) schemas provided improved data interoperability. The CDMS Mediation Service successfully demonstrated a translation capability using Global Command and Control System-Joint (GCCS-J) Extensible Markup Language (XML) as source and output in a situational awareness schema.  CDMS transitioned to Program Executive Office Command and Control Capabilities (PEO-C2C) on 1 July 2011, three months ahead of schedule.  This provided a mediation service to the Enterprise and fills a gap in core Enterprise services.  Preferred Force Generator (PFG) started on 1 July 2011 following the continuing resolution and congressional approval. PFG was able to leverage portions of the NSLDSS Framework and Net-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES) to help accelerate initial capability and to demonstrate the ability to populate preferred forces in support of Global Force Management. PFG allows secure and reliable access and exposure of C2 data. Rapid Development and Sustainment of Enterprise Mission Services (RDEMS) provided engineering support to Joint Staff, United States European Command (EUCOM), United States Special Operations Command (SOCOM), and other COCOMs-designated data sources exposing new data sources in a NCES-compliant web services. RDEMS delivered a ‘how-to’ guide for engineers to assist in integration of NCES Compliant standards and specifications. RDEMS documentation activities were completed on 31 August 2011.

The components that make up the NSLDSS were transitioned on 31 August 2011.

                                            <r2:Text>For FY 2012, the focus continues on DISA's mission as a concept innovator and rapid enabler of web services and information sources.  Key activities will include dynamic, scenario-based situational awareness designed to support the mission of the senior military advisor to the POTUS and to accelerate the Web 2.0/Web 3.0 capabilities which will provide persistent collaboration and IT-enabling to the warfighter; improvements to Human-Computer interaction, particularly in the area of secure, trustworthy and mobile wireless technologies, web applications, widgets and micro-applications; technologies to improve cyber availability and situational awareness through a semantic cyber state description of resources; and agility to expand the dynamic nature of the networks, technologies, and global security, providing feature-shared situational awareness to leverage a 24x7 persistent Communication Web.  The Communication Web will enable the JCS to provide the best military advice and to rapidly transform information to knowledge.  DISA will provide command and control innovative technology capabilities for fully-informed strategic and tactical decision-making to the military leadership community and coalition forces in support of the initiatives that improve the warfighter's situational awareness and collaboration toolset.

The decrease of -$3.141 between FY 2011 and FY 2012 is due to transitioning JCTDs to PEO-C2C.

This approach allows the rapid implementation of Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) products to gain early user feedback and provide a network-based risk mitigation strategy upon which to make a procurement decision.

The increase of $0.187 between FY 2012 and FY 2013 is due to additional operational assessments with the COCOM user community.
DISA will conduct operational assessments with the COCOM user community and will transition web services supporting Force Generation and Air Emergency (Hijack) to PEO-C2C.

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The program accomplishes its mission through a combination of strategies focused on operations, technical integration, program management, and financial tracking.  Market research during the acquisition process included a review of DISA contracts, other DoD contract vehicles, and other Government agency contracts which were advertised for Government-wide usage.  This market research also included consideration of small business, minority/women owned (8A), Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU), mentor/protégé and other specialized contract vehicles and processes.  It evaluated all contractors available from DISA sources for their ability to deliver the products specifically required for the unique program efforts.  The program works collaboratively with vendors when possible to obtain generic cost data for planning and analysis purposes.  Past and current contract prices for similar work and other government-wide agency contracts provided additional sources of information.  Quotes from multiple sources helped provide averages for more realistic cost estimates.  DISA makes a concerted effort to award many of its contracts to small businesses.  Additionally, many of the DISA contracts were awarded with multiple option periods that have the benefit of fixing labor costs over an extended period and minimizing the administrative costs associated with re-issuing short-term contracts every year or two.  The Advanced Concepts Office (ACO) has reviewed existing contract vehicles and continues to review the number of contracts to minimize administrative overhead.  Instead of three contracts for program management, business line improvement, asset management, and financial management, there is now one small business program services contract that provides services across DISA.  Another acquisition initiative was the creation and publicizing of a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) to solicit a wide range of vendor Research and Development participation and to provide a contracting path that minimizes contract lead time.  The BAA was successful in FY 2010 and ended in May 2011.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Metrics are tracked for each type of technology via In-Progress Reviews (IPRs) and management teams.  Further, AT&amp;L holds program reviews twice per year to review schedule, performance and delivery.  For JCTDs, the program office develops an Implementation Directive, Tactical Transition Agreement, and a Management Plan.  These guidance documents outline the basic objectives, schedule, and funding for the JCTD.  The JCTD model is to build it, allow the user to try it and provide comments, so that fixes can be made rapidly, which enables the capabilities to be delivered to the users earlier.  During the first year, the JCTD develops and documents the detailed objectives against which the Operational Sponsor (a COCOM) will assess military utility, as well as the detailed mechanisms by which military utility will be assessed and results measured.  Regular oversight is maintained through JCTD program managers who are the central point of contact for maintaining cognizance over cost, schedule, and performance and for managing program risk.  The program also incorporates internal processes to enhance financial reporting and track contractor spending.  The program utilizes several web-based financial management tools as well as internal measures to monitor status.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Global Combat Support System-Joint (GCSS-J) is an information technology (IT) application that continues to transition to a service oriented architecture to deliver asset visibility to the joint logistician (i.e., essential capabilities, functions, activities, and tasks necessary to sustain all elements of operating forces in theater at all levels), and facilitates information interoperability across and between Combat Support and Command and Control functions.  In conjunction with other Global Information Grid elements including Global Command and Control System-Joint (GCCS-J), Computing Services, and Combatant Commands/Services/Agencies information architectures, GCSS-J will provide the IT capabilities required to move and sustain joint forces throughout the spectrum of military operations.  The primary beneficiaries of this investment are the joint logisticians.  They are military officers, warrant officers, enlisted personnel, civilians, and contractors that specialize in providing joint logistics support that extends from the national industrial base to the end user.  Joint logisticians are the planners, executors, and controllers of core joint logistic capabilities. They understand tactical, operational, and strategic operations and synchronize efforts to effectively meet joint force requirements.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Global Combat Support System-Joint (GCSS-J), in conjunction with other Global Information Grid (GIG) elements including Global Command and Control System-Joint (GCCS-J), Defense Information Systems Network, Computing Services, and Combatant Commands/Services/Agencies information architectures, will provide the Information Technology (IT) capabilities required to move and sustain joint forces throughout the full spectrum of military operations.  GCSS-J enables the joint logistics warfighter in Combatant Commands and Joint Task Forces to conduct operations in a complex, interconnected, and increasingly global operational environment.  The joint logistic warfighters are responsible for planning, executing, and controlling core logistics capabilities.  The joint logisticians understand the tactical, operational, and strategic support requirements and synchronize the efforts to effectively meet joint force requirements.  GCSS-J provides asset visibility from disparate authoritative data sources to provide the warfighter an integrated picture of the battlespace.  GCSS-J provides web-based capabilities in a net-centric environment to provide information to authorized users regardless of geographic location.

                                            <r2:Text>FY 2012 funding supports development of web services for the National Level Ammunition Capability (NLAC) (i.e., data to enhance munitions logistics planning and management by supporting the Joint Ammunition Community, including ammunition users, managers, and planners throughout the Department of Defense); create new WatchBoards; include Google Earth functionality and capabilities (i.e., provide the ability to render geographically tagged report data, map layers, and WatchBoards in a format that can be consumed and displayed by the Google Earth clients); and enhance the Distribution capability and WatchBoard functions on the NIPRNet.

The increase of +$1.835 million from FY 2011 to FY 2012 accelerates GCSS-J Increment 7 development resulting in rapidly delivering capability (e.g., fuels WatchBoards, Google Earth, web services to support the Combatant Commands, and logistic planning) to joint logisticans.

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The GCSS-J Program Management Office (PMO) uses various contract types, employs large and small contractors, and is focused on achieving agency socio-economic goals and incorporating DoD acquisition reform initiatives in purchasing.  The PMO maximizes the use of performance-based contracts and requires contractors to establish and manage specific earned value data to mitigate risk and monitor deviations from cost, schedule, and performance objectives.  The PMO evaluates performance by conducting thorough Post-award Contract Reviews, monthly Contract Performance Reviews, and bi-monthly In-Process Reviews.  

The PMO uses a Statement of Objectives (SOO) for development efforts rather than the traditional Statement of Work, as it provides potential offerors flexibility to develop cost-effective solutions and the opportunity to propose innovative alternatives to meet GCSS-J requirements.  By stating the requirements in the form of a SOO, the contractor can produce a technical solution methodology to deliver leading edge technology to the warfighter.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>GCSS-J fields capabilities are based on functional priorities of the Combatant Command 129 Requirements as approved and prioritized by the functional sponsor, Joint Staff J4.  These requirements and goals are translated into releases with specific capabilities, which have established cost, schedule, and performance parameters approved by the DISA's Component Acquisition Executive/Milestone Decision Authority.  Metrics and requirements are routinely gathered by the GCSS-J Program Management Office (PMO).  The metrics from the strategic server sites are analyzed by the PMO to ensure that operational mission threads continue to be met and if system enhancement/capabilities are of benefiting the user.  Future capabilities include tools that allow GCSS-J to refine and enhance the type of performance metrics that can be gathered and analyzed.  This becomes increasingly important as GCSS-J continues to integrate additional data sources and external applications.  This postures and allows GCSS-J to continue to transition to a Service Oriented Architecture and directly supports DoD's net-centric vision of exposing and consuming web services.  As GCSS-J usage increases and new capabilities are fielded, performance metrics are kin ensuring that the system is meeting user requirements.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB) includes over 1,084 military, civilian, and contractor personnel and nearly 140,274 square feet of Command, Control, Communications, Computing and Intelligence (C4I)/Global Information Grid (GIG) testing laboratories.   Under DISA’s Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) Executive, the Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC) serves as the only joint element of the Department of Defense’s (DoD’s) MRTFB, which is a national asset that is sized, operated, and maintained primarily for DoD test and evaluation support missions.  

JITC is the sole interoperability certifier for all Information Technology/National Security Systems (IT/NSS) for DoD.  Additional core missions include testing of DoD terrestrial, space, and tactical communications capabilities, supporting warfighters on technical IT/NSS issues, and assisting Combatant Command to Coalition partner interoperability.  JITC, as the only Joint Operational Test Agency (OTA), plans and conducts operational tests and evaluations (OT&amp;E) for DISA, the National Security Agency (NSA), Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), military services, and other DoD agencies.  JITC supports agile acquisition and rapid fielding of net-centric capabilities by improving test, evaluation, and certification (TE&amp;C) processes and gaining efficiencies, investigating innovative methodologies and tools, and continuously enhancing the posture of the T&amp;E infrastructure for its customers.  

In FY 2013, to ensure its relevancy to DoD and the warfighter community, JITC will continue to manage and maintain its current capability base to provide efficient, responsive TE&amp;C services, as well as continue to: 
 
• Integrate evolving web-based, cloud and virtual information technology capabilities and designing, implementing and maintaining the Net-Ready Key Performance Parameters (NR-KPP) as part of the core DoD interoperability certification process.  These serve as pillars to the TE&amp;C methodology and use operationally realistic test concepts which reduce risk and offer efficiencies across the DoD Enterprise. 
•  Expand test infrastructure and operations to allow for rapid, on-demand provisioning, federation across the DoD and integration with enterprise environments by implementing cloud and virtualized computing concepts in support of Joint/Coalition and Service unique certifications at minimum cost.
• Coordinate and manage functional area products required for Joint T&amp;E of Intelligence, Warfighting, and Business capabilities supporting Joint and Coalition warfighting efficiencies and effectiveness.
• Provide consistent, repeatable test methodologies that ensure DISA and other DoD Service/Agency acquired capabilities are operationally effective, suitable, and secure; certifying Joint Warfighter systems are interoperable with each other.
• Provide T&amp;E guidance/oversight to nearly 130 DISA programs, creating synergy and efficiencies across the large IT portfolio within DISA, gaining insight in new technologies and commercial best practices. 
• Operate, manage, and maintain DISA’s state-of-the-art test infrastructure and facility to ensure the DISA and JITC missions are executed, while optimizing support to their Service/Agency/Coalition customers. 
• Evolve IT test policies and processes to proactively support the DoD’s migration towards more agile development and acquisition of IT/NSS capabilities in support of Section 804 Acquisition Reform.  
•  Implement Design of Experiments (DOE) and Science-Based Test Design (SBTD) approaches, concepts, and strategies in T&amp;E methodologies to support the Director, Operational Testing and Evaluation and the Under Assistant Secretary of Defense for Developmental T&amp;E guidance to increase the emphasis on scientific test design and statistical rigor in T&amp;E.

                                            <r2:Text>To advance our existing interoperability certification process, JITC will bring more operational realism to our joint testing services by introducing various mission threads from real life contingencies.  Further, as the entire DoD IT systems and capabilities are developed at the enterprise level, JITC will conduct more assessments at that level, requiring more complex tools and employing more virtualization capabilities.  JITC will strengthen its ability to conduct distributed testing using complex tools and real life scenarios and continue to evolve its test policies and processes to proactively support the DoD’s migration towards more agile development and acquisition of IT capabilities.  

The decrease of -$0.231 in funding between FY 2012 and FY 2013 is the result of an internal Agency re-allocation of the reduction in contracting services to support the SECDEF initiative on improving DoD operations.

The increase of +$1.885 in funding between FY 2011 and FY 2012 is the result of FY11 decreases from execution of funds planned as Project: T30 (Direct)  in Project: T40 (Institutional)  to accommodate civpay adjustments and urgent infrastructure requirements.

                                            <r2:Text>JITC will continue to provide unparalleled support to the warfighter while aggressively accelerating its engagement programs.  These programs will include on-demand rapid response contingency support to Regional COCOMs, enhanced assessment support for the three largest COCOM interoperability exercises across Europe, Africa, and the Pacific, and final development and deployment of the Global Communications Interoperability Program, a cloud-based service that will revolutionize coalition C4 planning.  JITC will continue to improve the velocity at which Hotline requests are successfully resolved in support of customers across the DoD and other federal agencies.  JITC will broaden its support to the Joint Staff and functional COCOMs with a multitude of new value-added consultation and interoperability assessment services providing support across the entire interoperability spectrum.

                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Performance is tracked through measures of support to the warfighter/acquisition communities.  In FY 2011, JITC responded to nearly 300 Hotline calls from across the DoD, other federal agencies and commercial sector.  JITC participated in ten CCIBs; one COCOM sponsored exercise, three contingency operations, two CITs, two NATO tactical data link tests, and provided two on-site liaison officers who supported four COCOMs.  JITC conducted three DICE events, in which annual participation included over 14 systems/capabilities and resulted in approximately nine system/capability assessments or certifications and four support, training and technology demonstrations.  JITC supported 676 test activities involving over 576 DoD systems and 84 ACAT I programs.  JITC issued over 567 interoperability testing and certification related products.  In addition, JITC supported other Joint Staff initiatives, such as the review of over 108 Test Exemption, ISP, and Legacy Waiver requests.  JITC also processed approximately 187 ICTO requests for the MCEB ITP.  Planned success metrics include:  published test methodologies are timely, accurate, readily available, and support the needs of T&amp;E and Program Executive Office (PEO) communities; percentage of test events that are completed with a reduced cycle time while meeting technical rigor requirements; percentage of resolved Hotline calls that meet the warfighters’ technical and timeliness requirements; and percentage of positive responses from customers in terms of cost, schedule, and performance.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Provides institutional funds for the Defense Information Systems Agency’s (DISA’s) Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC).  JITC serves as the only joint element of the Department of Defense’s (DoD’s) Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB), which is a national asset that is sized, operated, and maintained primarily for DoD test and evaluation support missions.  As an MRTFB facility, JITC’s global reach extends to the entire spectrum of the DoD, Federal government, private industry, and allies in support of command and control, intelligence, and defense reform initiatives.  This includes commercial entities, which allows JITC to coordinate directly with vendors to obtain critical pre-acquisition test results.  This early involvement enables rapid delivery of enhanced military capabilities at lower cost.

•  Fully enables JITC mission capability, thus making DISA capable of executing its Information Technology/National Security System (IT/NSS) interoperability test and evaluation (T&amp;E) mission mandated in the Chairman of the Joint Chief of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 6212 and DoD policies.  
•  Provides the necessary test capabilities and facilities infrastructure, process tracking and reporting systems, as well as hardware and software maintenance to enable direct test support to DoD’s major IT/NSS acquisitions (e.g., Net-centric core services, Defense Readiness Reporting System (DRRS), B-52 Combat Network Communications Technology (CONECT), Global Combat Support System (GCSS), etc.) as well as Joint Tactical Data Links (TDL), command and control, global, terrestrial, satellite and tactical communications systems, evolving to hand held and wireless technologies.  Supports DISA’s mandated mission to serve as an MRTFB by providing for and maintaining the DISA/JITC IT infrastructure.  The environments and test tool enhancements allow testing efforts to keep pace with the rapid change in technology and improve the testing methodologies and timelines for DoD IT/NSS acquisitions.
•  From an IT/NSS perspective, DISA acquisition and the T&amp;E support coupled with infrastructure of the Global Information Grid (GIG) serve as the DoD's corollary information technology capability.  
•  Includes working with industry consortiums on best practices, investing in process based modeling and simulation, evolving standards based frameworks to support testing and analysis as a service, and evolving and virtualizing the laboratories to meet future technology changes and enhancements in hardware and testing software with an emphasis on unified communications requirements, and interactive web enabled capabilities.  
•  Enables the DISA MRTFB to continue implementing Net Readiness Capabilities Resources (NRCR), which provide DoD with a lifecycle support capability for DoD’s tactical and strategic networks and their interfaces, as well as build communications and test environments for the current and future Converged Real-time Internet Protocol (IP) Services for voice, data and video, Software as a Service (SaaS), NCES, and core services in preparation to conduct agile, on-demand test services for the department.
•  Continues efforts to provision a Joint Test and Evaluation network through the convergence of current test networks that meets the infrastructure requirements to support the entire spectrum of DoD acquisition process life cycle needs.

Laboratory and testing software enhancements allowed testing efforts to keep pace with the rapid change in technology.  This initiative requires, at a minimum, refreshing on a periodic basis (approximately every two years).  Identified and acquired a power management system to support the Federal Data Center Consolidation Initiative (FDCCI) resulting in a 20 percent non-peak hour power reduction.  These initiatives improved the infrastructure and created efficiencies through the use of virtual and federated concepts to provide optimal flexibility in a dynamic IT laboratory environment.</r2:Text>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Through the Combined Enterprise Regional Information Exchange System (CENTRIXS) and Pegasus (formally GRIFFIN), the Multinational Information Sharing (MNIS) Program enables secure sharing of operational and intelligence information and enhances collaboration amongst United States forces, their most trusted allies and additional multinational partners in the ongoing war.  This effort also increases overall combat effectiveness by leveraging capabilities and information from all partners and reducing the possibility of fratricide.  These coalition information sharing systems are in direct support of the Department of Defense’s (DoD’s) strategic goals to “Win our Nation’s Wars” and “Deter conflict and promote security”.  In addition, they are aligned with DISA’s strategy to “accelerate operational effectiveness and efficiency” and “enable sharing of information while staunchly defending it.”  The MNIS program currently supports five Combatant Commands (COCOMs) with connectivity in 89 nations and North America Treaty Organization (NATO), 11 Bilateral agreements and 150 sites with in excess of 80,000 users worldwide.  The MNIS also evaluates new technologies and develops tactics, techniques and procedures that facilitate the transition of technologies and capabilities into operational multinational information sharing capability enhancements.  This is accomplished through the Combined Federated Battle laboratory Network (CFBLNet) and is in direct support of both CENTRIXS and Pegasus.  

As a planned improvement to the CENTRIXS coalition network, Common Mission Network Transport (CMNT) will provide a distinct and permanent CMNT backbone capabilities; thus enabling NETOPS centers to manage individual networks more efficiently.  CMNT provides a common transport for encrypted traffic to meet mission partner communication requirements and establishes a “black core capable” network to facilitate the movement of Virtual Private Network traffic between segments.  This capability supports DoD instruction 8110.1 guidance of integrating CENTRIXS and other operational networks into existing DoD general service communications infrastructure as a separate network servicing all DoD MNIS requirements.   

The MNIS emerging capability, Unclassified Information Sharing (UISS), extends U.S. information sharing capabilities to its Mission Partners (MPs) and beyond, providing an efficient, effective, enterprise-level solutions that allows Combatant Commands to share unclassified information with other U.S. Government (USG) agencies, host nations (HNs), intergovernmental organizations (IGOs), nongovernmental organizations, and other non traditional partners. The employment concept for the UISS capability is to implement an Internet-based capability (IBC) approach in making its capability available to as broad a community as needed to support Combatant Command mission operations. The UISS Capability will enable multi-lateral exchanges of tangible and intangible value and ad-hoc communications through shared communities of interest and issue-specific groups among and across organizations and individuals using a Web-based, “non-mil”, information sharing and collaboration tool that may be accessed anytime, from anywhere, by any user with an Internet connection, and including web-enabled mobile personal devices.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Multinational Information Sharing (MNIS) Program is a portfolio of four coalition information sharing capabilities designed to enable and improve sharing of operational and intelligence information among U.S. forces and our multinational partners.

-First, Combined Enterprise Regional Information Exchange System (CENTRIXS), supports intelligence and classified operations and information exchange and sharing at the Secret Releasable (REL) level. There are multiple, cryptographically-isolated CENTRIXS enclaves serving various communities of interest (COI) that support multinational efforts to include the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) and counter-narcotics operations. CENTRIXS is regionally focused and combatant command (COCOM) centric. The MNIS Program Management Office (PMO) provides selected centralized services from two Defense Enterprise Computing Centers (DECCs) for five of the 40+ CENTRIXS networks/ COIs, and engineering support for standardized solutions.  The DISA Campaign plan requires cross enclave and cross domain sharing environments that exploit enterprise and web based service capabilities by the end of Fiscal Year (FY) 2014. CENTRIXS does not offer the type and level of functionality required to support cross-COI mission requirements. The CENTRIXS enhancement, Common Mission Network Transport (CMNT), provides a common transport for encrypted traffic to meet mission partner communication requirements and establishe a “black core capable” network to facilitate the movement of Virtual Private Network traffic between segments.  This capability supports DoD instruction 8110.1 guidance of integrating CENTRIXS and other operational networks into existing DoD general service communications infrastructure as a separate network servicing all DoD MNIS requirements.   

-Second, Pegasus, (formerly GRIFFIN)/Improved Connectivity Initiative (ICI), interconnects the national Command and Control (C2) systems of Combined
Communications Electronics Board (CCEB) Nations, (to include Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom and the United States), using Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) security appliances and Cross Domain Solutions (CDS) that enable information sharing to facilitate situational awareness and operational planning/execution. Pegasus has a strategic focus and is member nation centric. The name GRIFFIN/ICI changed to Pegasus in June 2010.

-Third, the Combined Federated Battle Laboratory Network (CFBLNet) provides a controlled coalition Research, Development, Trials and Assessment (RDT&amp;A)
coalition information sharing “sandbox” for the United States, CCEB Nations, NATO, and invited nations. This sandbox is used to evaluate new technologies and to develop tactics, techniques and procedures that facilitate the transition of promising technologies and capabilities into operational multinational information sharing capability enhancements. Its direct customers are the CCEB nations’ military operational and intelligence entities led by their US counterparts at the Combatant Command and Agency levels. It is being used for the Coalition Warrior Interoperability Demonstrations, NATO missile defense initiatives, and by the Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) community to test their capabilities prior to deployment.

-Fourth, the Unclassified Information Sharing (UISS), extends U.S. information sharing capabilities to its Mission Partners (MPs) and beyond, providing an efficient, effective, enterprise-level solutions that allows Combatant Commands to share unclassified information with other U.S. Government (USG) agencies, host nations (HNs), intergovernmental organizations (IGOs), nongovernmental organizations, and other non traditional partners.

A new capability to support enhancements for the Unclassified Information Sharing-All Partners Acess (UISS-APAN) starts in FY 2012.  UISS-APAN migrates existing systems supporting coalition sharing to an enterprise solution hosted on a DISA Defense Enterprise Computing Center.  UISS-APAN capability will satisfy Combatant Commands need for tools and technology to support collaboration with non-traditional partners for humanitarian missions.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The National Military Command System (NMCS), operated by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, provides the President, Secretary of Defense, and other national senior leaders the ability to maintain situational and operational awareness and command and control of military forces in all crisis and/or national emergency contingencies.  DISA's NMCS Engineering program meets the NMCS Systems Engineer responsibilities, per Department of Defense Directive (DoDD) S-5100.44 and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 3280.01B, to provide the Joint Staff with operationally efficient and cost-effective engineering solutions to ensure that components and facilities satisfy operational requirements including emergency messaging, situational awareness, crisis action, and information management.

The NMCS engineering program is vital in supporting the government's ability to safeguard national security and respond to contingencies globally and/or nuclear war.  NMCS Engineering focuses on the implementation of collaborative tools into current and crisis operations areas, the integration of adequate back-up storage and recovery of voice, video and data across the continental United States to support key leaders, transition of nuclear command and control to Internet Protocol (IP)-based networks, migration of data and voice network to NEXT-GEN satellites, implementation of modern crypto-logical devices, and the utilization of wireless networking to support Warning Systems and situational awareness.  In addition, NMCS Engineering continues to maintain the NMCS Reference Guide (NRG) required by DoDD S-5100.44 and to develop engineering and test plans for the installation of hardware and software systems utilized within the NMCS.

                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>The NMCS Engineering Branch conducts regularly scheduled In-progress Program Reviews (IPRs) and Configuration Control Board (CCB) meetings to monitor status of engineering projects/tasks.  Each current project/task is evaluated in terms of how well the technical work is progressing and how allocated resources are being utilized.  Adjustments to resources, schedules, and technical directions are made, as required.  Future projects/tasks are also discussed, thereby ensuring an integrated approach is maintained across all related project/task areas.  To further increase the utility of the IPR/CCB structure, the Joint Staff customer participates in the project/task reviews.  The result of this approach is a truly integrated effort of NMCS Engineering, contractor, and Joint Staff working together to achieve common program goals.  For FY 2011, thirteen major projects were completed.  All thirteen projects met operational/functional requirements and were accepted by their respective NMCS customers.  All thirteen projects were completed within allocated costs/resources.  All thirteen projects were completed within the original schedule.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Global Information Grid (GIG) Enterprise Wide Systems Engineering (EWSE) project resolves near term (1 to 3 years) high-priority technical issues defined by Department of Defense Chief Information Officer (DOD CIO) and DISA, that impact operational capabilities affecting GIG end-to-end (E2E) interoperability and performance.  The Chief Technology Officer (CTO) supports efforts that will strengthen the delivery of critical GIG products, services, and capabilities to the warfighter through the establishment of the DISA Technology Management Framework (TMF).  This Framework provides analysis, strategies, and roadmaps, as well as technology development and insertion into DISA programs of record, while also influencing Service/Agency program technology investments.  As the Science and Technology arm of DISA, CTO projects are critical to providing the venue for technology assessment and insertion in DISA (and DoD) that will result in more efficient and effective technology investments and ultimately improved global, net-centric operations.  

The Modeling and Simulation project provides architecture, systems engineering and end-to-end analytical functions for DISA and its customers, ensuring integrated capabilities to fulfill warfighter mission requirements.  Ongoing beneficiaries of these capabilities include DOD CIO, the DISA Network Services Directorate, Program Executive Office-Mission Assurance (PEO-MA), the DISN Command Center (DCC), Joint Communications Simulation System (JCSS) users in DoD, and other DISA programs/projects such as Net-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES), CENTRIXS Cross Enclave Requirement (CCER) (PEO-C2C), etc.  

FY 2013 funding will provide DISN Internet Protocol (IP) and Transport Capacity Planning models, to include FY 2013 technology refresh and new user requirements, DoD Internet traffic models and analyses for capacity planning and IA initiatives, Voice and Video over IP (VVoIP) modeling tools supporting the Unified Capabilities Requirements (UCR) Document and end-to-end security goals of the evolving DISN, enhanced modeling and instrumentation techniques for net-centric applications planning and tuning and  JCSS modeling tools supporting the combatant commands. 

As the Science and Technology arm of DISA, CTO projects are critical to rapidly providing the venue for technology assessment and insertion in DISA (and DoD) that will result in more efficient and effective technology investments and ultimately improved global, net-centric operations.  Further, as the Department of Defense Global Information Grid (DoD GIG) Chief Technologist, the CTO provides analysis of industry standards and specifications and advises the DoD/CIO on ensuring the framework for information sharing across DoD and the federal community is provided.  The CTO provides rapid integration of emerging commercial technologies to gain immediate user feedback, provide risk mitigation, and support enhancements of concept of operations and tactics, techniques, and procedures for initiatives addressing the Chairman's capability gap. 

The Interoperability Enhancement Process (IEP) supports the resolution of Tactical Data Enterprise Services (TDES) through issues resolution, the developing TDES capability, and TDES verification and certification.  The overarching objective of the IEP will be to support the realization and maintenance of interoperable Net-Centric weapons, sensors, and Command and Control (C2) systems at the tactical edge.

The EWSE project will provide technical solutions to addresses unique end-to-end interoperability and performance in DoD and GIG areas of concern.  Enterprise-level technical requirements are undefined for a significant number of GIG end-to-end issues.  EWSE provides end-to-end system documentation that defines functional, performance, and interface guidelines that programs can use but is often unavailable.  Through the EWSE program, no single entity will resolve technical, policy, or programmatic issues on proposed end-to-end solutions.  Without defining enterprise requirements, networks would only interface effectively at Tier 0, effectively defeating the transformational advantages of many next generation GIG components.

                    <r2:SummaryExplanation>The FY 2011 increase of +$18.255 is due to an increase of +$20.000 for the Cyber Security Program and a decrease of -$1.745 realigned to higher Agency priorities.

The FY 2012 increase of +$6.813 is due to an increase of +$7.500 for the Cyber Security Pilots Program and a decrease of -$0.687 for higher headquarter priorities.

The FY 2013 increase of +$6.144 is attributable to two factors.  The major increase of +$6.000 is due to analysis of industry standards, specifications and rapid integration of emerging commercial technologies to gain immediate user feedback, provide risk mitigation, and support enhancements of concept of operations and tactics, techniques, and procedures for initiatives addressing the Chairman's capability gap.  A second increase of +$0.144 is an inflation adjustment.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Modeling and Simulation project provides architecture, systems engineering and end-to-end analytical functions for DISA and its customers, ensuring integrated capabilities to fulfill warfighter mission requirements.  Modeling and Simulation performs a broad spectrum of activities for the DoD communications planning and investment strategy, including:  application assessments, contingency planning, network capacity planning and diagnostics, and systems-level modeling and simulation.  Modeling and Simulation develops across-theater information awareness for Combatant Commands through application solutions for integrated networks, to include DoD’s missions in Iraq and Afghanistan and the Defense Information Systems Network (DISN), by:  (1) supporting the development and implementation of GIG EWSE processes essential to evolving the GIG in a manner that enables interoperability and end-to-end performance for critical GIG programs; (2) developing standardized DISA systems analyses and integration processes to improve systems integration across DISA for all DISA developed communication systems and services; and (3) providing the underlying modeling and simulation and analytical support for end-to-end DISA and DoD systems engineering and assessment.  These operations provide DoD decision makers, with services and a suite of tools capable of identifying key points of impact on DoD command and control information systems and recommending tradeoffs within the GIG configuration with regard to prioritized performance, availability, and security.  This effort will reduce the risk in products deployment to the warfighter through improved network performance and traffic analysis, and an efficient means of troubleshooting and subsequent redesign. 

The Interoperability Enhancement Process (IEP) supports the Tactical Data Enterprise Services (TDES) implementation and issues resolution, the development of TDES capability, and TDES verification and certification.  The overarching objective of the IEP will be to support the implementation and maintenance of interoperable Net-Centric weapons, sensors, and C2 systems at the tactical edge.  The IEP will use jointly defined and developed interoperability tool set to determine the TDES interoperability capabilities of systems. Interoperability shortfalls will be identified for each system.  The gaps will be based on weapon, sensor or C2 system capabilities analyzed with respect to current policies, architectures, operational concepts, Joint Mission Threats (JTMs) and other criteria that collectively form the standard view of the TDES Architecture.  

The interoperability gaps will be documented to provide each system a common format implementation specification for TDES Interoperability.  This requirements process will be updated consistent with the maintenance/upgrade cycle for each system.  For emerging systems, the IEP will be conducted prior to Milestone “C” of the platform.  DISA will support this process through:  the establishment and maintenance of the IEP databases that contain platform system interoperability capabilities; the jointly approved standard view of the TDES Architecture; and the implementation specification(s) for TDES Interoperability.  The Services will be responsible for development of the material solutions that provide system compliance with their respective implementation specification(s) for TDES Interoperability.  The Services will update the DISA IEP databases with system interoperability capabilities as validated by flag level review.  Validated data will include capability deviations and schedules for “full” Joint certification.  A second component of the IEP will provide warfighters operationally relevant information to maximize net-enabled systems.  Services have agreed upon common capability characteristics to identify system performance in a joint environment.  The collection of these efforts, when synchronized across the services and available to joint warfighters through net-centric capabilities is called Joint Capabilities and Limitations.

                                            <r2:Text>Funds supported EWSE efforts to resolve near and mid term high-priority technical issues impacting GIG end-to-end interoperability and performance. Six technical tasks were completed in FY11: Federated SOA Architecture for GIG Services; Hosting Applications and Data in a Virtual Computing Environment, End-to-End Service and Performance &amp; SLA Management; Common Radio Interface to IP Layer; Global Access Control; and GIG Multicast Network Architecture.  GIG Technical Profiles (GTP) were developed and delivered under these tasks. GTPs are used by the DoD Programs of Record for NR-KPP compliance. EWSE also continued to technically manage Integrated SATCOM Operations Management JCTD; develop DoD level GIG NetOps Technical Architecture; and evolve DISA Unified Communications and Collaboration Architecture. In partnership with DoD standards management office, EWSE coordinated DoD WiMAX Secure Profile RFI with the industry and adjudicated vendor comments. Four technical tasks were initiated in FY11: Secure Federated GIG Core Architecture and Routing Services; GIG VPN Services and Architecture; Service-Orientation in DIL; and DoD Enterprise User Initiative-Directory Services. All tasks directly support customers within DISA and stakeholder in the DoD community. Preliminary results from the Service-Orientation in DIL task were used for Enterprise Engineering Technical Track at the DISA Customer Conference.

Funds supported development of GIG Convergence Master Plan  Vol. I which defines the DISA technical strategy and articulates the near-term target technical architecture and Vol. II which consists of the complete service offering to service capability mapping, and the complete DISA technical baseline.  Modeling and Simulation funds provided enhanced modeling and instrumentation techniques for Enterprise Email end-to-end performance assessment; enabled continued, enhanced, modeling capabilities to prepare for   the FY 2013  Technology Refresh and to meet new user requirements in each theater;  provided DoD Internet traffic models and analyses for capacity planning and IA initiatives, for DISA Director, CYBERCOM, and Network Services; enhanced modeling tools and techniques to provide inputs to network planning in support of Unified Communications and end to-end security goals of the evolving DISN, to ensure timely support of the plans/stages in the DISN Technical Evolution Plan and GIG Convergence Master Plan; and supported modeling  for customer needs in DISA program/project decisions and planning.

DISA EE3 successfully tested, verified, validated, and fielded in DECC operational environment the GIG Technical Guidance federation (GTG-F) to allow for "data-centric" Interoperability and Supportability analysis of Joint Information Support Plans by the Services.  Established a program entry point through the Enhanced Information Support Plan (EISP) application to transparently tag data as it is entered or imported in to a structured template with Extensible Markup Language (XML).  In addition, the Interoperability Assessment Module (IAM) was developed within the GTG-F to perform assessment of the data tables to alert the Joint assessment community of potential interoperability gaps.  The introduction of this new "data-centric" analysis capability is a positive paradigm shift from document driven reviews to data architecture analysis to continuously improve system level interoperability for the Joint Warfighter.

DISA EE3, as the DoD Executive Agent for IT Standards, merged  the process that determines DoD IT standards applicability and utilization with the emerging standards management processes developed within the Intelligence Community.  This change will improve interoperatbility and enterprise information sharing among the DoD and the IC.

                                            <r2:Text>Funds continue EWSE efforts to resolve near term (1 to 3 years) high-priority technical issues impacting operational capabilities affecting GIG end-to-end (E2E) performance in transport, computing services, applications, information assurance (IA), NetOps and Enterprise Services.

Modeling and Simulation funding continues, enhanced, modeling capabilities that provide:  DISN IP and Transport Capacity Planning models, to include addressing FY 2013 Technology Refresh and new user requirements in each theater;  DoD Internet traffic analyses for capacity planning and IA initiatives, supporting DISA Director, CYBERCOM, Network Services, and PEO-MA projects; enhanced modeling tools and techniques to provide inputs to network planning in support of Unified Communications and end to-end security goals of the evolving DISN, to ensure timely support of the plans/stages in the DISN Technical Evolution Plan and GIG Convergence Master Plan; enhanced modeling and instrumentation techniques for net-centric applications planning and tuning, to include Enterprise services, and modeling support for customer needs in DISA program/project decisions and planning.

The decrease of -$13.144 between FY 2011 and FY 2012 is attributable to a decrease of -$10.000 for the One-Time Congressional Add for the Cyber Security Pilots Program and a decrease of -$3.144 is due to the expected closeout of the IEP Project in FY 2011.


Primary execution of FY11 Cyber Security Pilot funds in support of the overall objective of more rapid introduction of commercial information assurance products and technologies into DoD operations.  Specifically, planned and ongoing pilots will be executed to explore and evaluate the viability of commercial solutions in the areas of non-signature-based detection products at both the host and network levels, enclave security policy evaluation, data center attack detection and diagnosis, securing managed and unmanaged mobile endpoints, end-to-end cloud security, and cryptographic tagging for data loss prevention.  DISA’s involvement in overseeing and managing these pilots is to ensure the objectives and metrics associated with the pilots are optimized to facilitate enterprise deployment and sustainment.  Another key aspect of the cyber pilot funding for FY12 is the advancement of the cyber accelerator concept as an innovative mechanism for identifying and incubating promising information assurance technologies and products for the DoD.

                                            <r2:Text>Funding will continue EWSE efforts to resolve near term (1 to 3 years) high-priority technical issues impacting operational capabilities affecting GIG end-to-end (E2E) performance in transport, computing services, applications, information assurance (IA), Network Operations (NetOps) and Enterprise Services.  EWSE will continue to investigate leading edge technologies and technology gaps such as Cloud Computing Services, WiMax technologies, and the provision of Enterprise Services in the Disconnected, Intermittent, and Limited (DIL) communications environment, as identified in the GIG Convergence Master Plan (GCMP).  The EWSE Team will continue to develop GIG Technical Profiles (GTP) for these leading edge GIG enterprise services and will expand the GCMP process to encompass DoD-wide technical issues. The cost per project/effort is $0.875 million.

Modeling and Simulation funding will continue FY 2012 efforts to enhance, modeling capabilities that will provide  DISN IP and Transport Capacity Planning models, to include addressing FY 2013 Technology Refresh and new user requirements in each theater when identified,  DoD Internet traffic models and analyses for capacity planning and IA initiatives, for DISA Director, Cybercom, and Network Services, Enhanced modeling tools and techniques to provide inputs to network planning in support of Unified Communications and endto-end security goals of the evolving DISN, to ensure timely support of the plans/stages in the DISN Technical Evolution Plan and GIG Convergence Master Plan, Enhanced modeling and instrumentation techniques for net-centric applications planning and tuning, to include Enterprise services, and  Modeling support for customer needs in DISA program/project decisions and planning.

The decrease of -$7.171 from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is comprised of two adjustments: a decrease of -$7.500 for a one-time Congressional add for the Cyber Security Pilot Program and an increase of +$0.329 for leading-edge technologies in DISN IP and Transport Capacity Planning models.

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The GIG EWSE project uses contractors for technical IPT support, and piloting and validation support.  Booz Allen Hamilton, and Lockheed Martin are the main providers for this support.  These companies are uniquely qualified to provide the necessary level of technical support needed to address GIG end-to-end performance issues.

Modeling and Simulation uses a range of contractors for modeling support to the various projects.  Contractors range from small to large business, predominantly using open competition methods and Firm Fixed Price (FFP) tasks, and seeking multi-year (base plus option years) contracts as possible.  Support includes network modeling tool and processes development to adapt to ever-evolving OSD/DISA programs and projects, analyses, capacity planning, and network redesign using the models.  Some specific support (e.g., integration with proprietary OPNET software) will require contracting with OPNET (e.g., sole source).  Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC) are also considered depending upon the task.

The Interoperability Enhancement Process funds are executed by Military Inter-departmental Purchase Requests (MIPR) with associated Service Level Agreements to Air Force and Navy IAW the execution of IEP Management Plan.

                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Modeling and Simulation performance measured by DISN core bandwidth sufficiency tied to transport and IP capacity planning and activation of bandwidth in the DISN core to keep at least 25 percent spare capacity to allow for provisioning of unforeseen requirements and rerouting under outages.

The IEP utilizes the joint set of Net-Ready Key Performance Parameters (NR-KPPs) as the metrics for interoperability assessment.  These NR-KPPs are applied to all legacy or new weapons, sensors and C2 systems. The iSmart tracking matrix measures data reuse, and data validation process with feedback loops to validate data based upon JITC testing results.

The IEP will capture and assess standard RAM performance metrics such as Operational Availability (Ao), Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF), and Mean Time To Repair (MTTR).  Additionally, Customer Usage Reports will be generated to ascertain peak usage periods, potential latency/quality of service issues, and most used/least used of the sub-application capabilities. 

The EWSE projects will be measured by the number of intermediate and final GTGs and/or GTPs that are published to support interoperability of DISA C2 programs and the number of engineering/technical solutions that are adopted by programs/initiatives across DoD, COCOMs, and the services. These solutions will be coordinated with the stakeholder/user, to ensure EWSE has the right solution to the right problem.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Chief Technology Officer (CTO) supports efforts to deliver critical GIG products, services, and capabilities to the warfighter through the establishment of the DISA TMF.  This framework provides analysis, strategies, and roadmaps, as well as technology assessment and insertion into DISA products and services, while also influencing Service/Agency program technology investments.  As the Science and Technology arm of DISA, CTO projects are critical to rapidly providing the venue for technology assessment and insertion in DISA (and DoD) that will result in more efficient and effective technology investments and ultimately improved global, net-centric operations.  

•Capability 1 supports end-to-end technology analysis, assessments, and reviews of all solutions, products, services, and capabilities to ensure all are consistent with GIG architecture and standards. These projects provide direct support to Services, COCOMS, OSD, and the Joint Staff as well as the DoD business and acquisition communities and the intelligence community (IC).  The end result is more efficient and effective technology investments and ultimately improved global, net-centric operations which are delivered through GIG products, services, and capabilities to the Services, COCOMS, OSD, and the Joint Staff as well as the DoD business and acquisition communities and the IC.  

•Capability 2 supports various aspects of evolving the GIG, including developing enterprise system architecture constructs for the GIG and components, providing engineering guidance for system and component evolution, including incorporating new technology from industry.  Engineering and technical support of the DISA programs implementing the GIG involves technical research and analysis of state-of-the-art and emerging technologies, architectures, and data communication and application frameworks.  This involves the identification and recommendation of innovative engineering techniques, practices and methodologies that are critical to the DISA in its role of instantiating the GIG architecture; the support of information exchanges with the Services, OSD, the COCOMS, and the Joint Staff to identify opportunities, issues, and solutions to improve the DISA products; and, facilitation and harmonization of cross-corporate programs relative to the DISA programs and the GIG.

The other mission in this exhibit is performing classified work.  All aspects of this project are classified and require special access.  Detailed information on this project is not contained in this document.

                                            <r2:Text>FY 2011 funding of $4.700 million was used to evolve the TMF and continue support of the Technology Readiness Assessments (TDA).  TDA is an essential capability supporting several key DISA programs of record as well as supporting the close-out of the Enterprise thin-client effort.  DISA has successfully developed an initial technology environment, including the infrastructure and methodologies necessary for technology evaluation and analysis.  A streamlined, Department of Defense Architecture Framework (DoDAF)-compliant Multi-level Security (MLS) Enterprise Architecture (EA) was published that fuses the architecture with recognized, dependent enterprise services such as directory and domain name system while supporting vendor agnostic enterprise and local virtual domains.  The design of the Enterprise Identity Management System (EIMS) was completed, using detailed use-cases and work flows abstracted from the recently completed Joint Staff MLS thin-client pilot and leveraging evolving/emerging IA policies/practices and best-in-class products that are MLS certified.  The resulting architectural “blue-print” can serve as the building-code for architecture design and service integration/interoperability among domain and/or mission-level architectures with the EIMS, targeted for a 2QFY12 proof-of-concept, validating that the architecture is viable and can support GIG 2.0 goals of improved information sharing, security, and resiliency. 

The remaining $4.094 supported classified work.

The Strategic Technology Plan is being updated to better align with the technologies that were identified in the Technology Watch List and the Technology Environment will be expanded to include venues such as DoD test ranges and the non-DoD Federal sector and peering with DoD and national laboratory assets.  The Enterprise Architecture and Infrastructure effort continues to defining/refining technology gaps and mitigation of identified deficiencies through technology innovation activities and focused investments which will translate into piloting activities in support of GIG optimization resulting in improved information sharing, information security, and network performance of the GIG.   

The decrease of -$6.561 between FY 2011 and FY 2012 is due to the completion of DAMA-C and thin client projects.

                                            <r2:Text>FY 2013 funding of $2.723 million will be used for CTO Engineering Support to refine several elements of the TMF reflecting lessons-learned and customer/user feedback and metrics measurements/results from the application of the TMF to technology management challenges within DISA (and the CTO), with other DoD organizations, the intelligence community, and initial use with non-DoD external entities in the Federal Government (e.g. Department of Homeland Security (DHS)). The funding will also be used to continue support of the Technology Readiness Assessment, an essential capability supporting several key DISA programs of record with a greater leveraging of venues such as DoD test ranges and the non-DoD Federal sector and peering with DoD and national laboratory assets to more fully realize cross-domain, cross enterprise end-to-end system testing, further realizing and resulting in improved information sharing, information security, and network performance of the GIG.

Funding of $6.000 million will be used to provide analysis of industry standards and specifications to advise the DoD/CIO on making the framework for information sharing is available to the DoD and the federal community.  Provide rapid integration of emerging commercial technologies to gain immediate user feedback, provide risk mitigation, and support enhancements of operations and tactics, techniques, and procedures for initiatives addressing the Chairman's capability gap.

The increase of +$6.490 between FY 2012 and FY 2013 is comprised of two factors.  + $6.000 is for rapid integration of emerging commercial technologies to gain immediate user feedback, provide risk mitigation for initiatives addressing the Chairman's capability gap.  + $0.490 will be used for performing an in-depth capability analysis of near term and future DoD cloud service offerings and the participation and establishment of a new standards group for inter-cloud communication and existing cloud standards bodies.

                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>The CTO has developed different sets of metrics to ensure that whichever metrics are applied, they are relevant and have meaning to the project’s purpose and projected outcome, consistent with DISA mission objectives, POR technology requirements and gaps, and CTO technology themes.  Performance is measured by achievement of project milestones and the acceptance/transition of these technologies/services/capabilities into programs of record or as a new, separate program/service offering to the DoD and IC communities.  Specific and measurable metrics that will be introduced and used include number and percentage of emerging and mature technologies adopted and/or adapted by DISA and/or the Department to address/satisfy the documented technology and service gaps identified in capstone enterprise environment architectures, program/project needs statements, and other key technology planning and guideline documents; and the number and percentage of technology research and development initiatives and investments in the Department, peering organizations, and/or industry partners that are attributable to technology research, investments and evolution plans in DISA and promoted via the technology watch-list and outreach activities used to identify, promote, channel and aligning technology research and investments to reduce time to field new/emerging technologies to satisfy warfighter requirements. 

In FY 2011, Program Management Support provided managers with project management, financial management, contract management assistance, information assurance technical expertise, knowledge management, outreach, and transition engineering.  Program management resources continued to support the growth in all key mission areas of technology analysis, assessment, evaluation, and integration.  Additionally, DISA will need continued civilian pay funding to cover salaries and benefits for Government civilian personnel assigned to CTO; training, professional development and travel for CTO personnel; and supplies and services for CTO operations.  

In FY 2012 and FY 2013, there will be a continued need for core program management support to the technology analysis, assessment, evaluation, and integration activities to manage financial accounts, oversee information assurance activities, assist in contract administration, and provide technical advice and assistance through the use of subject matter experts.  Program Management support will also provide asset management, quality assurance and business line improvement, information assurance oversight, technical oversight and assistance, web support, and application hosting fees.  Technology integration support, including knowledge management expertise, outreach, transition engineering expertise, and scenario and/or capability-based demonstrations, will continue for all the program managers in each of the mission areas.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Information Systems Network (DISN) is the Department of Defense (DoD) consolidated worldwide telecommunications capability that provides secure, end-to-end information transport for DoD operations.  It also provides the warfighter and the Combatant Commands (COCOMs) with robust Command, Control, Communications, Computing, and Intelligence (C4I) infrastructure to support DoD netcentric missions and business requirements.  The Defense Red Switch Network (DRSN) is a DoD Secure Voice, Command and Control Network that is controlled and directed by the Joint Staff and the Office of the Secretary of Defense.  It provides multilevel secure, rapid, ad hoc, voice calling and conferencing capability to senior leaders including the President, Secretary of Defense, Services, COCOMs, subordinate organizations (military and civilian) and allies.  DRSN also supports the National Emergency Action Decision Network (NEADN)/Presidential and National Voice Conferencing (PNVC) and the Enhanced Pentagon Capability/Survivable Emergency Conferencing Network (EPC/SECN).

DISN Systems Engineering Support:  This effort includes:  engineering for Internet Protocol (IP) and Optical transport capabilities to ensure the essential operations of a robust and secure DISN; refreshment of operational systems and network operating systems that instrument and automate the operations, administration, maintenance and provisioning functions and creating a single DISN-wide view for network managers and operators; and the peripheral and component design in support of the DRSN to sustain continued highly classified, critical senior leadership communications capabilities.   In addition, Integrated SATCOM-GIG Operations &amp; Management (ISOM): The ISOM is a JCTD project that includes all activities necessary to develop a scalable and policy-based management system that enables dynamic allocations and provisioning of satellite communications (SATCOM) resources.  Project activities include developing system architecture, producing and conducting a functional evaluation of the ISOM prototype.  

Integrated Waveform (IW): The IW program consists of the development, testing, fielding, and initial operations of the IW system.  

NEADN/PNVC:  The NEADN provides selected system engineering for continued development and testing of the Presidential and National Voice Conferencing (PNVC) equipment for senior leaders.  The PNVC system provides a military satellite-based, survivable, secure, and near toll-quality voice conferencing capability for the President, Secretary of Defense, Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff, and other senior national/military leaders anywhere in the world as needed.  Specifically, the project funding supports the acquisition activities for the PNVC baseband equipment, including critical and essential engineering required to develop new vocoder and cryptographic and audio-summing equipment.  Lack of sufficient funding will significantly impact the implementation of an enhanced, survivable voice conferencing capability to the President and other decision makers. 
 
Distributed Tactical Communications System (DTCS):  The DTCS is a variation of the Iridium Satellite Phone used by the warfighter under the Enhanced Mobile Satellite Service.  The variation improves Iridium’s capability to network and sub-network users to improve performance, reduce end-to-end latency and improve data handling to the handset.  New handsets and software modifications will be required to utilize the improved service and allow Iridium satellites to “relay” information between the satellites.  A separate Network Management capability will be required because the new service cannot leverage the standard commercial Iridium Network Manager.  Funding provides engineering, development and testing resources for continued improvement to the Naval Surface Weapons Center’s (NSWC) Technology Prototype to a fully fielded operational capability.  Handsets are already fielded as part of a Central Command (CENTCOM) Joint Urgent Operational Needs Statement.  Follow-on Research and Development effort includes two additional Handset Variants (Command and Control and Secret Command and Control), Network Management System, User Control Interface, and Satellite Software Modifications.  Failure to fully fund would have severe negative impacts on the warfighter in the field in the Southwest Asia area of responsibility (SWA AOR).

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The National Emergency Action Decision Network (NEADN) provides system engineering, development and testing of the Presidential and National Voice Conferencing (PNVC) equipment for senior leaders.  The PNVC system provides a military satellite-based, world-wide, survivable, secure, and near toll-quality voice conferencing capability for the President, Secretary of Defense, Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff, and other senior national/military leaders.  By implementing new technology capabilities (e.g. Ethernet-Framing and higher data rate), this project provides improved performance to the survivable voice conferencing capability.  This project supports the acquisition activities for the PNVC baseband equipment, including engineering required to develop new vocoder and cryptographic and audio-summing equipment.  PNVC baseband development and production schedule is synchronized with the fielding of military Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) satellite communications (SATCOM) terminals.  

PNVC is STRATCOM's highest priority for the NC2 mission and lack of sufficient funding will significantly delay DISA's delivery of the baseband equipment leaving the enhanced, survivable voice conferencing capability for the national decision makers at risk.

These new technologies provide protected and assured services for mobility; high-quality information sharing and collaboration capabilities provide critical support to the warfighter as well as other DoD and federal customers.

Element Management System (EMS):  Provides operational and network operating systems that instrument and automate the operations, administration, maintenance and provisioning functions creating a single DISN-wide view for network managers and operators.  EMS is a component of the DISN Operational Support Systems (OSS).

Secure Voice Switches:  This equipment satisfies unique military requirements for multilevel security (i.e., extensive conferencing/conference management capabilities and features, and gateway functions) that are not available in commercial products.  Due to the proprietary multi-level security and conferencing solutions embedded in Secure Voice Switch equipment, the only alternative to wholesale replacement is the Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) process which is used to identify and manage the development of replacement parts and peripherals necessary to ensure the continued support of the system.

Distributed Tactical Communications System (DTCS):  This system is a tactical and scalable over-the-horizon, on-the-move, and beyond line of sight voice communications system for the small unit disadvantaged user.

•  Phase 1 supported CENTCOM Joint Urgent Operational Needs CC-0278 by fielding 500 radios with basic functionality for 100 mile communications in an austere environment.  This provided basic functionality with the initial development and fielding of the Radio Only handset. 

•  Phase 2 supported basic CENTCOM Joint Urgent Operational Needs CC-0368 requirements by fielding more than 5,000 handsets to the CENTCOM Area of Operation.  Improvements to DTCS were increased in range from 100 miles to 250 miles, improved network capacity from 250 to 16,000, user operated management tool, color screen command and control handset with NSA approved encryption, and tactical vehicle integration.  

•  Phase 3 supports improving CENTCOM Joint Urgent Operational Needs CC-0368 requirements.  DTCS improvements include architecture that enables self management and monitoring, alternate supplier development, interoperability interfaces, and internet protocol infrastructure.

The Integrated SATCOM-GIG Operations &amp; Management (ISOM) JCTD project will include all activities necessary to develop a scalable and policy-based management system that enables dynamic allocation and provisioning of satellite communications (SATCOM) resources.  Project activities will include developing system architecture, producing and conducting a functional evaluation of the ISOM prototype.

The Integrated Waveform (IW) program consists of the development, testing, fielding and initial operations of the IW systems necessary to update technical capabilities.

Major Range and Test Facility funding for test facility equipment and installation.

This will adversely affect the mid and long term viability of the DRSN and other systems (EPC/SECN) that use these switch systems.  To the extent that funding is reduced, these efforts will take longer to complete and development costs are likely to increase as work would be stretched out over a longer period.

The increase of +$1.125 from FY 2011 to FY 2012 is due to a  minor change in the rate of development of the DNI card.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:Text>FY 2013 funding will continue the DNI replacement development effort and the Console User Interface update effort initiated in FY 2012.  Due to the level of funding, it is expected that these efforts will occur over several years.  Depending on final costs and funding availability, an ECP for refresh of other components or peripheral that have obsolete parts or EOL software issues would be initiated.  

The increase of +$.113 from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is due to a change in the mix of items being developed. </r2:Text>

                                            <r2:Text>OCO:   Funding of $10.500 million is for Phase 3 implementation and completion of JUON CC-0368.  This includes the fielding of the secure command and control handset, web compatible architecture that expands network management functionality, and an increased response time for push-to-talk from ~ 2 seconds to ~ .7 seconds. 

The decrease of -$12.625 between FY 2011 and FY 2012 is due to several of the system development tasks being completed and the amount of the development dollars being lowered as the system approaches completion. </r2:Text>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Minimum Essential Emergency Communications Network (MEECN) provides the Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3) engineer with plans and procedures; systems analysis; operational assessments; systems engineering; and development of concepts of operation and architectures.  The NC3 System provides connectivity from the President and the Secretary of Defense through the National Military Command System (NMCS) to nuclear execution forces integral to fighting a “homeland-to-homeland,” as well as theater nuclear war.  MEECN includes the Emergency Action Message (EAM) dissemination systems and those systems used for integrated Tactical Warning/Attack Assessment (TW/AA), presidential decision-making conferencing, force report back, re-targeting, force management, and requests for permission to use nuclear weapons.  Efforts assure positive control of nuclear forces and connectivity between the Secretary of Defense, strategic and theater forces, and an informed decision-making linkage between the President, the Secretary of Defense, and the Combatant Commands.  MEECN ensures our national leadership has proper command and control of our forces during times of national emergency, up to and including nuclear war.  Reduction or elimination of funding would seriously degrade DISA’s ability to perform the systems engineering functions supporting the maintenance and evolution of MEECN.  DISA would not be able to provide nuclear C3 planning assistance to the Joint Staff, nor perform assessments of the nuclear C3 system.  </r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports the mission of the NC3 Systems Engineer to the Joint Staff and provides Executive Leadership and NC3 support for the Department of Defense (DoD) Chief Information Officer (CIO) National Leadership Command Capability (NLCC) Management Office.  Systems Analysis supports long range planning and vulnerability assessments to ensure the Nuclear C3 System is adequate under all conditions of stress or war and recommends investment strategies to evolve the Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS) to achieve desired capabilities.  Operational Assessments of fielded systems and weapon platforms provides the sole means for verification of nuclear C3 systems’ performance in support of plans and procedures, operation orders, training, equipment, and end-to-end system configuration.  Assessments provide strategic and theater level C3 interfaces into the nuclear C3 System.  Supporting efforts assure positive control of nuclear forces and connectivity between the Secretary of Defense and strategic and theater forces.  Systems Engineering provides the Senior Leadership C3 System (SLC3S) with technical and management advice, planning and engineering support, and Test &amp; Evaluation (T&amp;E).  Leading Edge Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) technology is assessed for all communication platforms supporting Executive Travelers and Senior Leaders to include the interoperability of hardware and operational procedures.  These elements support the President's and other DoD command centers and aircraft (e.g., Air Force One and the National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC)).  Reduction or elimination of funding would seriously degrade DISA’s ability to perform the systems engineering functions supporting the maintenance and evolution of MEECN.  DISA would not be able to provide nuclear C3 planning assistance to the Joint Staff or NII, nor perform assessments of the nuclear C3 system.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Performance is measured by compliance with contract deliverables schedules for specifically included products, such as: operational assessment plans, operational reports; revisions to the EAP-CJCS Volumes VI and VII; Nuclear C3 System Description documents, and Nuclear C3 Architecture Diagrams.  In addition, performance of the Nuclear C3 System is directly measured by the operational assessments funded by this program element.  These periodic assessments evaluate the connectivity used for the five functions of NC2: Situation Monitoring, Planning, Decision Making, Force Execution, and Force Management.  Assessment results are used by the Joint Staff to direct changes in system engineering and integration, programmatic execution, and training.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Community Data Center (CDC) provides research, designs, builds, tests, demonstrates, and evaluates an innovative system to analyze a significant portion of the DoD’s and associated network traffic for anomalous network behavior using unique techniques and processes.  This unique capability, that addresses the massive data overload associated with analyzing network traffic and raw data, significantly improves the ability of the DoD to operate, defend, and protect its networks.  The CDC research achieves this goal by using augmented and sessionized network traffic, non-traditional approaches, advanced IT algorithms, and the compiled expertise of cyber operators, analysts, investigators, and defenders to develop a near-real-time “top down” ability to view and analyze the network for the discovery, identification, and analysis of anomalous patterns of activity not humanly detectable, that could represent illegal or improper behavior, and are significant threats to the network.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:Text>Funding will improve CDC data aggregation and analytics to help reduce the risk of “insider threats”.  The funds will design and develop information exchange and system interfaces to existing data feeds, design, develop and implement a capability for detecting pre-defined malicious insider activities performed by users or administrators in near real time by using attack patterns based on log and log like data.  It supports analysis of available data access to personnel and provide limited support for analyzing how the data is used. 

The designed solution works with current DISA collection systems, particularly HBSS and SenSage.  The funds provide enhancements to these systems for identity management and tracking capabilities to associate network attributes (e.g. – IP addresses) with individuals and organizations in DoD, detection capabilities by creating models or normal user behavior which can be fed into the expert system or used by operational analysts for forensics, and developing an expert system to correlate suspicious events with identity measures for generating a gauge of suspicion.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Based on the termination of the Net Enabled Command Capability (NECC) Program and the renewed focus on the existing Global Command and Control System – Joint (GCCS-J), this submission reflects the shift in the GCCS-J program from funding only the GCCS-J Program Management Office (PMO) activities to sustaining a portfolio of Joint command and control (C2) activities within DISA in support of the overall Department.  These Joint C2 activities include GCCS-J, Joint Planning and Execution Services (JPES), and the support to the development and sustainment of the Joint C2 architecture.  

GCCS-J.  The GCCS-J suite of mission applications/systems provides critical joint warfighting C2 capabilities by presenting an integrated, near real-time picture of the battle space for planning and execution of joint military and multinational operations.  GCCS-J is used by all nine combatant commands (COCOMs) at sites around the world, supporting joint and coalition operations.  Additionally, through the continued evolution of the GCCS Family of Systems (FoS), the Services are also utilizing components of the GCCS-J infrastructure to build their Service unique variants thus reducing the number of unique components.  Funding will be used to evolve existing capabilities within the GCCS-J operational baselines with the goal of reducing cost to the field through the use of enterprise hosting and increasing data sharing through the availability of common services, while enhancing the existing functionality available to the user today.  GCCS-J entered into sustainment with the closeout of Block V in August 2009.

JPES.  JPES is a set of capabilities that address components of the DoD's Adaptive Planning Roadmap (13 Dec 2005) and Adaptive Planning II (5 Mar 2008).  JPES produces enhancements to the Joint Operations Planning and Execution System (JOPES), focused adaptive planning capabilities, and provides a set of core infrastructure services necessary to provide the warfighter an interoperable environment where functionality can be easily added as mission needs dictate.

Joint C2 Architecture.  The Joint C2 Architecture is a foundational element of the Joint C2 capabilities for the Department, containing a set of net-centric tenets associated with data, functional service and the C2 infrastructure that is based on a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) design pattern.  Each year, the DISA architecture team produces a transitional architecture that documents the current state of C2 capabilities and anticipated changes/enhancements either in progress or planned by the C2 community.  The yearly updates document the use of enterprise services and standards in the development, integration and implementation of Joint C2 capabilities across the Department.

The GCCS-J Overseas Contingency Operations for Integrated Imagery and Intelligence (I3) provides operational enhancements to the existing GCCS-J I3/Common Operating Picture (COP) baseline in direct support of United States Central Command (USCENTCOM) identified requirements.  This includes access to additional data sources or tracks, ensures visualization of this intelligence data on the COP, and enhancements to capabilities unique to the USCENTCOM Area of Responsibility (AOR).

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Global Command and Control System – Joint (GCCS-J) is DOD’s Joint Command and Control (C2) system of record and provides the foundation for migration of service-unique C2 systems into a Joint, interoperable environment.  GCCS-J incorporates the core planning and assessment tools required by combatant commanders and their subordinate the Joint Task Force (JTF) Commanders while meeting the readiness support requirements of the Services.  Adaptive Planning and Execution Joint Planning Services are being developed to modernize the adaptive planning functions in a net centric environment.  GCCS-J is focused on funding a portfolio of C2 activities within DISA in support of the overall Department.  Additionally, DISA continues to provide support for the operational system to ensure continued access to information integration and decision-support capabilities that enable the exercise of authority and direction over assigned and attached forces, while operating in a net-centric, collaborative information environment.  DISA, through its Joint C2 entities, continues to provide critical C2 capabilities to the Commander-in-Chief, Secretary of Defense, National Military Command Center, Combatant Commands (COCOMs), Joint Force Commanders, and Service Component Commanders.  The DISA portfolio includes funding in support of GCCS-J, Joint Planning and Execution Services (JPES), and the development and sustainment of the Joint C2 Architecture.
  
Based on the termination of the Net Enabled Command Capability (NECC) Program and the renewed focus on the existing Global Command and Control System – Joint (GCCS-J), this budget submission reflects the shift in the GCCS-J program element from funding only the GCCS-J Program Management Office (PMO) activities to sustaining a portfolio of Joint Command and Control (C2) activities within DISA in support of the overall DoD.

Continued integration, testing and fielding of technical refresh activities in support of the GCCS-J baselines (Global &amp; JOPES) required to maintain the security posture of the system and provide critical operational support for the combatant commands.  Continued support for the interoperability between GCCS-J and the FoS to ensure access of joint command and control data by the combatant commands, external interfaces and Services who are now using the Global infrastructure components to put Service unique applications on top of.   This includes software fixes, integration and testing necessary to maintain interoperability between GCCS-J and the FoS.  Provide integration of Global Force management Data Initiative (GFM DI) to support creation of authoritative data sources for all authorized Department of Defense (DoD) force structure data, facilitating the unique identification of organizations, billets, crews, and chain of command links within the GCCS-J system for display and consumption.

The increase of +$8.872 from FY 2011 to FY 2012 will support technical refreshment of the GCCS-J system; FoS interoperability between GCCS-J and the Service GCCS systems and external applications; and implementation of GFM DI data within the GCCS-J system to support operational needs to access and view enhanced mission tracks and operational information updates.  

If not funded for FY 2012, critical C2 mission enhancements supported by the Joint Staff and validated by the Combatant Commands will not be achieved.  Failure to fund these enhancements especially impact USCENTCOM, USEUCOM, and USSOUTHCOM who are using agile client to conduct operations and field exercises.  It would result in limited data access and impair their ability to share and visualize data residing on different security domains.  These domains were requested by mission operators to support emerging and unanticipated operational needs such as coalition tracks to help reduce friendly force fratricide incidents.  </r2:Text>

The decrease of -$2.958 from FY 2012 to FY 2013 will be transferred to operations and sustainment to maintain system reliability at a mission acceptable level.  GCCS-J RDT&amp;E modernization efforts are targeted to identify replacement of expensive, legacy COTS products with more cost effective open source COTS hardware and software alternatives, and client consolidation.  They will also enable the GCCS-J Family of Systems (FoS), and the Services to leverage components of the GCCS-J infrastructure to build their Service-unique variants. This effort also includes activities necessary to effectively transition the FOS in synch with GCCS-J to accelerate development, integration and test of GCCS-J modernization efforts specifically related to JC2CUI, Agile Client, Enterprise COP, and infrastructure components necessary to shift C2 automated support to the enterprise level for increased efficiency and cost avoidance.

JPEC uses these capabilities to monitor, plan, execute mobilization, deployment, employment, and sustainment, redeployment, and demobilization activities associated with joint operations. At full maturity, the JPES capabilities will be integrated with other adaptive planning and execution systems to facilitate the rapid development and sustainment of plans and a seamless, dynamic transition to execution in a net-centric environment.   The JPES program consists of a core set of infrastructure services referred to as the JPES Framework (JFW)  and a variety of mission applications to include the Rapid TPFDD Builder (RTB), the Interactive Gaming System (IGS), Joint Force Protection (JFP) and the Joint Capabilities Requirements Manager (JCRM).

                                            <r2:Text>In FY 2012, the JCRM application will transition to DISA from the Joint Staff.  Funding will cover development, testing and release of enhancements identified by the Adaptive Planning community.  

The increase of +$21.625 between FY 2011 and FY 2012 is associated with increased acceleration of development activities for the JPES Capabilities.  This funding will accelerate development of the Rapid Force Flow Development and Analysis Tool (RFFDAT).  RFFDAT is a redefined version of RTB with additional features and capabilities not currently present in RTB.   Funds will also support the enhancements of IGS services that will be merged with RFFDAT.  Enhancements will be made to the Joint Force Projection (JFP) tool and to support the accelerated development of the JPES Framework (JFW) to broaden its mission and scope in support of the broader Adaptive Planning Community.

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>All development, integration, and migration efforts within the portfolio are primarily supported through Cost Reimbursable Task Orders issued under competitively awarded contracts.  Use of performance-based contract awards is maximized while use of Time and Material (T&amp;M) contracts is minimized to those providing programmatic support versus software development, integration, or testing.  Acquisition Strategies are structured to retain contractors capable of satisfying cost, schedule, and performance objectives.  Contract awards incorporate provisions requiring contractors to establish and manage specific earned value data.  This strategy mitigates risk by requiring monthly Contract Performance Reviews (CPRs) and utilizing award fee contracts where appropriate to incentivize performance.  Both GCCS-J and JPES apply formal acquisition rigor to include reporting requirements, as appropriate, by acquisition program designation.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Global Command and Control System-Joint (GCCS-J) assesses performance using the sustainment and synchronization activities in FY 2011 – FY13.  Each activity addresses outstanding high priority requirements, while continuing to implement enhancements to fielded capabilities.  These enhancements may modify existing mission applications, new candidate solutions provided by executive agents, technical refresh actions to minimize COTS end-of-life issues, and/or interfacing with additional high value data sources. 

Cost &amp; Schedule Management:  The GCCS-J program employs a tailored subset of earned value concepts that fit within American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Standard 748.  Contractors are required to plan, budget, and schedule resources in time-phased “planned value” increments constituting a cost and schedule measurement baseline.  This approach encourages contractors to use effective internal cost and schedule management control systems.  The PMO evaluates performance by conducting thorough Post-award Contract Reviews (PCRs) and monthly CPRs.  The GCCS-J Program Manager (PM) also conducts weekly critical path reviews of the GCCS-J release schedules to ensure tasks are on track and to mitigate risk across the entire program.  Management structure for JPES and the Joint C2 architecture are similar to the standards identified above for GCCS-J.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Defense Spectrum Organization’s (DSO) Joint Spectrum Center (JSC) designs, develops, and maintains DoD automated spectrum management systems, evaluation tools, and databases.  The JSC databases are the prime sources of information for DoD use of the Electromagnetic (EM) spectrum.  The JSC provides technical measurement and analysis in support of DoD spectrum policy decisions to ensure the development, acquisition, and operational deployment of systems are compatible with other spectrum dependent systems operating within the same EM environment.  Additional focus is centered on improving future warfighter EM spectrum utilization through technological innovation accomplished by researching, studying, and steering the direction of research and development (R&amp;D) emerging technology efforts from a spectrum perspective.  

DSO’s Global Electromagnetic Spectrum Information System (GEMSIS) is a net centric capability that will provide commanders with an increased common picture of spectrum situational awareness of friendly and hostile forces while transparently deconflicting competing mission requirements for spectrum use.  This capability will enable the transformation from the current preplanned and static assignment strategy into autonomous and adaptive spectrum operations. </r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The E3 Program also supports the development of the Joint Ordnance E3 Risk Assessment Database (JOERAD) and Hazards of Electromagnetic Radiation to Ordnance (HERO) electromagnetic environmental effects (EME) surveys in support of the COCOMS and Joint Task Forces (JTF). JOERAD develops algorithms and provides analytical capabilities to perform real-time risk assessments to evaluate platform/system safety and identify equipment limitations in the operational EM environment. JOERAD enables operators to make critical decisions about the hazards associated with the use of ordnance within complex EM environments. A Spectrum Supportability Risk Assessment (SSRA) is performed by program managers (PMs) and materiel developers (MATDEVs) on all programs that are acquiring or incorporating spectrum-dependent (S-D) systems or equipment per DoDI 4650.1.  The assessment is accomplished with due consideration to regulatory, technical, and operational spectrum and E3 issues and assigned risks.  FY 2012 funds will initiate establishment of a software tool to evaluate electromagnetic environmental effects (E3) and assess spectrum supportability risks of spectrum dependent systems in a realistic operational environment.</r2:Description>

The decrease of -$0.158 between FY 2011 and FY 2012 is the result of administrative effieciences being realized. 

This funding supports DSO initiation of development of the Initial Operational Capability (IOC) version of the E3 Evaluation and Spectrum Supportability Risk Assessment Tool.  This will provide acquisition program managers with the ability to identify and assess an acquisition’s potential to affect the required performance of the newly acquired system or other existing systems within the operational EME.  The IOC version of the SSRA tool is based on Release 3.x of the spectrum modeling and simulation testbed developed under the Spectrum Technology Testbed Initiative (STTI).  These improvements will include developmental efforts focusing on improving the Graphical User Interface (GUI) and the ease of use, improving the mapping tools, and enhancing system performance. </r2:Text>

                                    <r2:Description>DSO has the responsibility to investigate emerging spectrum related technologies and evaluate their applicability to improve future warfighter EM spectrum utilization through technological innovation.  The goal of the EST program is to identify the opportunities and risks associated with emerging spectrum-related technologies in the early stages of the technology development, influence and lead technology development in order to maximize DoD spectrum utilization, and ensure that spectrum policies incorporate optimal technology to meet DoD mission requirements.  Within EST there has been an increased focus on Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA).  DSA is realized through wireless networking architectures and technologies that enable wireless devices to dynamically adapt their spectrum access according to criteria such as policy constraints, spectrum availability, propagation environment, and application performance requirements.</r2:Description>

There is no comprehensive automated tool or service available today that allows decision makers to set priorities with the benefit of a common display of timely and relevant spectrum information.  The proposed capability would provide operational and tactical planners and commanders in the field with a comprehensive layered picture of spectrum use through a Service Oriented Architecture-based web service tied to a GIS driven by robust, accurate information.  Current manual and time intensive data gathering, correlation and visualization methods are not responsive to operational requirements and place undue risk to warfighters and mission accomplishment. SCOP will substantially reduce analysis and presentation time, from weeks/days to minutes/seconds.  That situational awareness will enable real time decisions based on the area of operation and mission planning factors, resulting in more effective mission planning for the spectrum management community as well as for operations planners, electronic warfare planners, and intelligence collection.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Program Executive Office (PEO) for Global Information Grid (GIG) Enterprise Services (GES) provides a portfolio of enterprise level services that enable communities of interest and mission applications to make their data and services visible, accessible, and understandable to other anticipated and unanticipated users.  The PEO GES portfolio supports 100 percent of the active duty military and Government civilians; 258 thousand embedded contract personnel; 75 percent of the active Guard and Reserve; and 25 percent of the Guard and Reserve users.  This meets the Department’s requirement to support 2.5 million users on the Non-Classified Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNet) and 300 thousand users on the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet).  The PEO GES portfolio of services continues to expand through the transition of local services to the DoD enterprise and providing enhanced functionality that allows DoD personnel to go anywhere in the DoD, login, and be productive, the implementation of an access control infrastructure that enables secure information sharing throughout the DoD, and the integration of pre-planned product improvements to existing enterprise services keeping them relevant to the end-users’ missions.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Program Executive Office (PEO) for Global Information Grid (GIG) Enterprise Services (GES) continues to expand their portfolio of services that currently includes the capabilities delivered by the Net-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES) Program, a resilient and flexible access control infrastructure that enables secure information sharing in the DoD, and the transition and operationalization of local services into the larger Department of Defense (DoD) enterprise.  Critical Warfighter, Business, and Intelligence Mission Area services within the PEO GES portfolio include an enterprise Collaboration capability supporting over 500,000 DoD users, User Access (Portal) supporting two million users, Enterprise Search that exposes data sources throughout the DoD, and Service Oriented Architecture Foundation (SOAF).  The PEO GES portfolio also includes the Strategic Knowledge Integration Web (SKIWeb) providing decision and event management support to all levels of a widespread user-base that ranges from the Combatant Commanders to the Joint Staff to Coalition partners on the SIPRNet and DoD Visitor that allows personnel to “go anywhere in the DoD, login, and be productive.”  The individual suite of capabilities within the portfolio of services provides the user with the flexibility to couple the services in varying ways to support their mission needs.  This flexibility provides unprecedented access to web and application content, critical imagery, intelligence and warfighter information, and stores critical data in a secure environment. The PEO GES portfolio of enterprise services delivers tangible benefits to the Department by providing capabilities that are applied by U.S. Forces, Coalition forces, and Allied forces to produce Net-Centricity and support full spectrum joint and expeditionary campaign operations.  These benefits include:
•	Enhanced collaborative decision-making processes;
•	Improved information sharing and integrated situational awareness;
•	Ability to share and exchange knowledge and services between enterprise units and commands;
•	Ability to share and exchange information between previously unreachable and unconnected sources;
•	Ability to “go anywhere in the DoD, login, and be productive;
•	Knowledge exchange to enable situational awareness, determine the effects desired, select a course of action, the forces to execute it, and accurately assess the effects of that action; and
•	Improved ability to effectively operate inside the most capable adversaries’ decision loop.

The portfolio contains capabilities that are also key enablers to the Defense Information Systems Agency’s (DISA) mission of providing a global net-centric Enterprise infrastructure in direct support of joint Warfighter, National level leaders, and other mission and coalition partners across the full spectrum of operations.  This support is outlined in the DISA Campaign Plan as “Enhance core Application Level Services”.

                     assess the effects of that action; and
•	Improved ability to effectively operate inside the most capable adversaries’ decision loop.

The portfolio contains capabilities that are also key enablers to the Defense Information Systems Agency’s (DISA) mission of providing a global net-centric 
enterprise infrastructure in direct support of joint Warfighter, National level leaders, and other mission and coalition partners across the full spectrum of operations.  </r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:Text>FY 2012 funding supports the final development and operational testing required to complete the transition and enhancement of SKIWeb into an enterprise service.  In addition, the funding will supports operational testing required for enhancements, upgrades, or added functionality to operational enterprise services.

The decrease of -$1.675 from FY 2011 to FY 2012 is attributable to completing the development and testing required for the transition of SKIWeb to enhanced the baseline capability (-$0.911 million) and the expected reduction in operational testing (-$0.764 million) required for enhancements, upgrades, or added functionality to operational enterprise services.

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The PEO GES portfolio of services is leveraging portions of the acquisition approach approved for the NCES Program.  Based on the approved NCES acquisition strategy, PEO GES will adopt proven specifications, best practices, and interface definitions to buy new network-based services or applications that are delivered, hosted, and managed in accordance with Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and that ensure available, reliable, and survivable services to support the warfighter’s mission.

The PEO-GES is using a streamlined acquisition approach to ensure that the required acquisitions contain only those requirements that are essential to meet the warfighter mission and that they can be acquired in a cost effective and time constrained manner that meets the defined mission need.  This strategy will enable PEO GES to rapidly field low to moderate risk capabilities to meet end-user operational needs through an agile requirements collection and engineering process that can support the acquisition, testing, and fielding of needed requirements in minimum time.  The benefits of this acquisition approach include:
•	Satisfy time-urgent needs of the warfighter or theater commander.
•	Provides early and continual involvement of the user.
•	Evaluate the portfolio to determine optimum funding approach to rapidly deploy urgently needed services within the funding profile.
•	Effective control processes that lower cost and maintains schedule.
•	Provides multiple, rapidly executed increments or releases of capability.
•	Early dialogue between the requirements and acquisition communities to expedite technical, programmatic, and financial solutions.
•	Enabling “insight” not “oversight” to identify and resolve problems early and ensure both the acquisition process and deployed service meets performance goals.
•	Enabling agility in selecting modular, open-systems approach.

The PEO GES business strategy will strike a balance between ensuring accountability using acquisition best practices and deploying urgently needed services to the warfighter on a schedule that will support their mission requirements.  The goal is to facilitate the DoD net-centricity vision where users and Programs of Record easily access enterprise services from maritime, airborne, and land-based locations worldwide.  PEO GES will work with the user community to understand how their portfolio of services must evolve to remain relevant to the Warfighter, Business, and Intelligence Mission Area mission requirements.  By partnering with the DoD Components and Mission Areas, PEO GES will rapidly deliver functionality and capability at the lowest possible cost and risk in the shortest possible timeframe.
</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>PEO GES uses continuous monitoring to ensure the portfolio of services they deliver and manage meets the users’ needs, is delivered in a cost effective manner, and is responsive to evolving mission requirements.  This ensures the services meet the mission needs of the stakeholders, are delivered, improved, and sustained in a cost effective manner, and continues to add functionality that keeps the capability relevant to the missions supported.  These continuous monitoring areas include:

Activity:
•	Customer Perspective (Determine the customers’ (Warfighter, business, and DoD Portion of the Intelligence Mission Area) needs and provide available, reliable, and survivable services that support evolving missions; solicit continual feedback from the customer on the utility, effectiveness, suitability, and relevancy of all delivered services)

Expected Outcome:
Receive an overall customer satisfaction rating of three or better on a scale of 1 to 5 where 1 is “no mission effectiveness” and 5 is “maximum mission effectiveness”.

Activity:
•	Financial Perspective (Satisfy Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, DISA and DoD Cost Strategic Goals, determine if PEO GES funding is sufficient to deliver services that support the customers’ mission needs, effectively support preplanned product improvements (P3I), and reduce sustainment costs; use feedback from the customer perspective to determine when a service is no longer relevant to their mission requirements)

Expected Outcome:
Usage of the portfolio of core and shared enterprise services continue to expand to support anticipated and unanticipated user demand; investment in duplicative services declines; additional POR/COIs reduce development costs through reuse of enterprise services; maintenance of an overall return on investment (ROI) that is ≥ 1 or the capability provides a significant mission benefit from the customer perspective that  the lower ROI is offset.

Activity:
•	Requirements Satisfaction (Continue to expand, modernize, and add new functionality to the user and machine facing portfolio of deployed services; identify, transition, and operationalize local services that can satisfy new mission requirements or supplement an existing service that has lost market share and is not cost effective to update; periodically re-validate service requirements with the user community to identify enhancements required to support evolving mission needs).

Expected Outcome:
Continue to improve the performance of the portfolio of services while adding functionality, integrating local services into the enterprise infrastructure, and extending access to additional unanticipated users.

The management areas are designed to ensure that problems can be identified rapidly for resolution, while providing maximum support to the Warfighters’ mission.  These metrics associated with these management areas provide quantitative data that show the portfolio of services delivered by PEO-GES are secure, interoperable, and responsive to current and future Warfighter missions in a cost-effective manner.  The management areas and metrics will be used to continuously evaluate the value of services to the Warfighter.  They will be used to determine the right time to scale and update services to keep them relevant to the warfighter’s mission.  Also, when necessary, they provide the necessary artifacts to make decisions to continue, shutdown, or place in caretaker status capabilities that are not performing as expected or where the user demand has slipped or never grew to the level of keeping the service cost effective.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Department of Defense (DoD) Teleport system is a Satellite Communications (SATCOM) gateway that links the deployed warfighter to the sustaining base.  It provides high-throughput, multi-band, and multi-media telecommunications services for deployed forces.  The system provides centralized integration capabilities, contingency capacity, and the necessary interfaces to access the Defense Information System Network (DISN) in a seamless, interoperable, and economical manner.  The Teleport system is an upgrade of satellite telecommunication capabilities at selected DoD gateways indentified as Standardized Tactical Entry Point (STEP) sites.  Each Teleport investment increases the warfighters’ ability to communicate with a worldwide interconnected set of information capabilities, which is vital for the DoD to maintain a persistent presence among its adversaries.

The Teleport program began fielding system capabilities incrementally using a multi-generational, evolutionary development approach.  Generation 1 fielded capabilities for C, X, Ku, Ultra High Frequency (UHF)-band, Extremely High Frequency (EHF) (Low Data Rate [LDR] &amp; Medium Data Rate [MDR]) band, and integrated military Ka-band into the Teleport system.  Generation 1 added Commercial Satellite Communication (COMSATCOM) and expanded the Military Satellite communication (MILSATCOM) terminal, baseband equipment, and serial circuit based network services segment capabilities to six Standard Tactical Entry Point (STEP) sites.  Generation One (FY2002 – FY2010) fielded capabilities in four Full Deployment Decision (FDD) events.  FDD 1 completed in March 2004 and implemented C, X, and Ku band capability at six sites.  FDD 2 completed in November 2006 and implemented UHF-band capability at four sites.  FDD 3, completed in March 2007, implemented additional C, Ku, and UHF band capabilities, and added EHF and limited Internet Protocol (IP) capabilities.  FDD 4 completed in August 2010 integrated military Ka-band SATCOM capabilities into Teleport. Generation Two (FY2006 – FY2010) added additional military Ka band and legacy capability and implemented IP Net-Centric communications to increase capacity at the Teleport sites.  A Full Deployment was recommended by DISA on 23 December 2010. 

A Teleport Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) dated March 2, 2010 approved the Materiel Development Decision (MDD) for the next increment of Teleport, Generation 3.  The current Teleport Generation 3 Production APB was signed 13 September 2010.  The baseline is based on the three Gen 3 phases, satellite availability, and user availability for testing.

Phase 1:  Gateway Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) [Extended Data Rate (XDR)] terminals.  This enhancement provides the President, Secretary of Defense, and Combatant Commanders with survivable, anti-jam communications through all peacetime and combat operations. 
 
Phase 2:  Gateway Wideband Global SATCOM X/Ka-band terminals.  This enhancement provides deployed commanders with sufficient bandwidth to rapidly transmit the largest video and data products to the battlefield warfighter, including Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) streaming video, digital imagery intelligence, and mapping and weather products and services.

Phase 3:  Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) to Legacy ultra high frequency systems interoperability.  This enhancement allows tactical warfighters using the most capable and cost effective narrowband capabilities to communicate with users possessing outdated technology until those legacy systems are replaced.

Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) Legacy Gateway Component (MLGC):  The MLGC program will provide the capability to interconnect all services between legacy UHF satellite systems and the MUOS.  To sustain the current UHF SATCOM constellation capabilities, the MUOS satellites will also offer a legacy UHF communications payload that will provide capabilities to existing deployed UHF terminals.  This will provide the warfighter the voice and data communications bridging between these satellite systems supporting maritime, airborne, and ground mobile tactical operations.  

Mobile User Objective System to Defense Switched Network (DSN):  The MUOS to DSN project will allow MUOS users the ability to place secure but unclassified calls within the DSN network.  Currently, MUOS users can only place secure classified calls to DSN users which only make up approximately 3% of the DSN users.  The MUOS to DSN project will enable the Warfighter to place a secure but unclassified call to any DSN user.  A reduction in funding would impact design and development efforts.  Without this capability, warfighters in the field environment will have limited communication ability with the DSN network.  Specifically, warfighters using the MUOS radio will be limited to placing calls to DSN users with auto secure cryptographic telephones.  

Generic Discovery Server Enclave:  The purpose of the Generic Discovery Server (GDS) Enclave effort is to provide a dynamic discovery service capability for non-secret security enclaves (Cipher Text and Plain Text addresses).  Presently, dynamic discovery services are only being provided for Secret-US only enclave.  A decrease in funding will impact project initiation and procurement of required hardware and software.  Without the GDS capability, the warfighters ability to communicate will be impacted.  Specifically, a significant burden will be placed on communication planners and limit the flexibility of swapping terminals with users in the field.  Static address tables will have to be used for thousands of unclassified users, reducing the flexibly to reach a user in a dynamic environment.

                            <r2:ProjectNote>Total RDT&amp;E line includes Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) funding in FYs 2011 through 2014.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Department of Defense (DoD) Teleport system is a Satellite Communications (SATCOM) gateway that links the deployed warfighter to the sustaining base.  It provides high-throughput, multi-band, and multi-media telecommunications services for deployed forces.  The system provides centralized integration capabilities, contingency capacity, and the necessary interfaces to access the Defense Information System Network (DISN) in a seamless, interoperable, and economical manner.  The Teleport system is an upgrade of satellite telecommunication capabilities at selected DoD gateways indentified as Standardized Tactical Entry Point (STEP) sites.  Each Teleport investment increases the warfighters’ ability to communicate with a worldwide interconnected set of information capabilities, which is vital for the DoD to maintain a persistent presence among its adversaries.

A Teleport Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) dated 2 March 2010 approved the Materiel Development Decision (MDD) for the next increment of Teleport, Generation 3.  The ADM approved using a three phased approach to decouple the dependencies between the enhancements and minimize risk to the overall program.  

Phase 1:  Gateway Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) [Extended Data Rate (XDR)] terminals.  Teleport Generation 3 Phase 1 will provide AEHF XDR capability to warfighters worldwide, by installing terminals from the Navy Multiband Terminal (NMT) program at Teleport and other gateway sites. To realize this capability, the TPO will procure 19 terminals from the NMT program, installing one terminal at the Teleport test bed, and fielding 18 terminals at Teleport/gateway sites in the FY10-15 timeframe.
 
Phase 2:  Gateway Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) X/Ka-band terminals. Teleport Generation 3 Phase 2 will provide enhanced WGS X/Ka capability to warfighters worldwide, by installing terminals from the Modernization of Enterprise Terminal (MET) program at Teleport and other gateway sites. This gateway enhancement allows Teleport to refresh end-of-life Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS) terminals and remain interoperable with tactical WGS X/Ka-band users. Additionally, it enables the Teleport system to maintain operational availability consistent with Generation 2 requirements and reduce the overall life-cycle cost of X/Ka capabilities across the DoD. To realize this capability, the TPO will procure and field 14 METs at Teleport/gateway sites beginning in FY12.
 
Phase 3:  MUOS to Legacy Ultra High Frequency (UHF) systems interoperability.  Teleport Generation 3 Phase 3 will provide interoperability between MUOS users and Legacy UHF users by installing MUOS-to-Legacy UHF SATCOM Gateway Component (MLGC) suites of equipment at Teleport/gateway sites. The equipment suites from the MLGC program will enable translation between the two UHF waveforms, duplex operating modes, crypto algorithms, and vocoders. To realize this capability, six MLGC suites will be fielded at Teleport/gateway sites in the FY10-15 timeframe. The equipment suites will be fielded in accordance with a planned Generation 3 Phase 3 CDR architecture. 

The Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) is the next generation Department of Defense (DoD) Ultra High Frequency (UHF) SATCOM system that will provide the warfighter with modern worldwide mobile communication services, utilizing the Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) waveform for use in the military UHF SATCOM band.  The MLGC program will provide the capability to interconnect all services between legacy UHF satellite systems and the MUOS. This will provide the warfighter the voice and data communications bridging these satellite systems supporting maritime, airborne, and ground mobile tactical operations.

Without Phase 1, the warfighter will not have reachback to DISN services using the higher data rate capabilities of the AEHF satellite constellation providing DoD’s most secure and interoperable SATCOM capability. Warfighters will be forced to lower data rate modes of operation over AEHF that would constrain applications and services requiring the increased data rates provided with the XDR mode.  

Without Phase 2, Teleport and other gateway sites will have insufficient capacity to fully utilize the advance WGS capabilities.  The current complement of enterprise terminals are approaching end of life and without a replacement program, warfighters will be forced to conduct operations with limited assets resulting in possible mission failure.  

Without Phase 3, MUOS will not be interoperable with existing UHF SATCOM equipment and Tactical users deployed in harm’s way will be unable to efficiently communicate with one another and their commanders through existing legacy systems.  Without the MLGC program, warfighters utilizing the current UHF satellite systems and services will not be able to communicate with the warfighters equipped with the MUOS capable services.  This means that all military forces operating with legacy radios will be unable to communicate to military forces operating with MUOS radios.  The direct impact of this and based on the mission of the warfighter will force the warfighter to carry two separate terminals depending on their specific mission and network requirements.  Further, the warfighter will be forced to continue operating in their existing environment (either Legacy UHF or MUOS), delaying the phase out/end of life for UHF legacy terminals and delaying the planning for the fielding, training and transition of the MUOS capability.  The warfighter will be forced to standup separate networks based on the deployed terminals.  This results in a lack of coordination, risk to forces, and risk to mission success in tactical missions globally.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The TPO utilizes the DoD preferred evolutionary acquisition approach to acquire COTS and modified COTS equipment when possible.  The two TPO procuring agencies, Program Manager Defense Communications and Army Transmission Systems (PM DCATS), and the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) provide direct contracting support.  Required assistance from other Departments including Army, Navy, and Air Force is acquired via Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request (MIPR) for both organic and contracted support.  The TPO maximizes the use of performance-based contracts and requires contractors to establish and manage specific earned value data to mitigate risk and monitor deviations from cost, schedule, and performance objectives.  Performance is evaluated thorough Post-award contract reviews, performance assessment during quarterly program reviews.  The MUOS to Legacy Gateway Component (MLGC) program will use various contract types to employ the vendor best suited to deliver the program’s capabilities to the warfighter.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Tech Refresh and Generation 3 Cost and Schedule Performance Metrics: 
Teleport manages and tracks its cost and schedule performance parameters using a tailored Earned Value Management System (EVMS) process, integrating the program plan, the program schedule, Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and financial data.  Progress is monitored/documented monthly showing percentages complete for schedule and cost.  Formal updates with changes to the schedule are documented against the program baseline.

Tech Refresh and Generation 3 Program Metrics:
Performance metrics have been established in four measurement areas: 1) customer results, 2) mission and business results, 3) processes and activities, and 4) technology.  Specific measurement indicators and units of measure vary by measurement area, and metrics in each of the aforementioned areas are measured annually.  In FY2011, all targets have been met.  Teleport will use the same measurement areas for performance metrics in FY2012 and FY2013.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>As the sole joint interoperability certification agent, the Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC) established and maintains a Distributed Development and Test Enterprise (DDTE) for the Department of Defense (DoD) Distributed Common Ground/Surface System (DCGS) program, as directed by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) (OUSD(I).  JITC chairs the DCGS Test &amp; Evaluation (T&amp;E) Focus Team, provides test &amp; evaluation for assessing DCGS systems, and engineers and operates the DDTE network.  JITC evaluates the DCGS systems’ compliance with the DCGS Enterprise Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) and elements of the Net-Ready Key Performance Parameter (NR-KPP) to assess the information needs, timelines and assurance as well as net-ready attributes required for both the technical exchange of information and the end-to-end operational effectiveness of that exchange.  DCGS is an integral and critical component of the overall DoD Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) interoperability and data integration strategy which provides world-wide ground/surface capabilities to receive, process, exploit, and disseminate data from airborne and national reconnaissance sensors/platforms and commercial sources.  The key tenets of network-centric operations and the future of DCGS operations lie in the ability for any user to discover, access, and understand the data.  

The FY 2012 funding of +$3.154 million supports the DDTE, which provides the DCGS Community of Interest (COI) an operationally relevant environment by establishing and maintaining connectivity between National Agency, Coalition partners and Service facilities at unclassified, collateral, Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI), and coalition levels.  It will also support the DCGS Enterprise assessment, as directed by OUSD(I), and DCGS Governance.

This effort provides the basis for the DCGS Enterprise Assessment, allowing the OUSD (I) to determine the validity and maturity status of the DCGS Enterprise during its development.  Rigorous testing and evaluation is required to ensure the DCGS Systems do not bring vulnerabilities to the networks.  The DCGS Service Programs of Record end-state domain is the SIPRNet, the C2 network for the entire Department.  DCGS, as a whole, is a critical element of the Defense Intelligence Information Enterprise (DI2E).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC) coordinates with the Military Services and Defense Intelligence Agencies on performing Joint/Distributed Common Ground/Surface System (DCGS) testing and analysis to include event coordination, configuration, instrumentation and integration functions on the Distributed Development and Test Enterprise (DDTE) as part of the DCGS Governance.  Under the DCGS Governance, this effort is referred to as the DCGS Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) Focus Team and is composed of three parts:  The DDTE Focus Group, providing and sustaining a distributed development network; the Strategy Focus Group, looking at current and future net-enabled enterprise testing and evaluation methods; and the Execution Focus Group which leverages the Strategy Focus Groups methodologies in execution of test events such as the annual DCGS demonstration, EMPIRE CHALLENGE.  These program components enable improved systems engineering and test and evaluation throughout all phases of the DCGS life-cycle culminating in the DCGS Enterprise becoming a contributing member of the Defense Intelligence Information Enterprise (DI2E).

DCGS Programs of Record (PoRs) and Coalition partners use the DDTE network to integrate architecture, standards, and capabilities for implementation of the DCGS Integration Backbone (DIB) and supports the migration to net-centricity, including DCGS Enterprise services for the following PoRs: DCGS-Army (DCGS-A), DCGS-Navy (DCGS-N), Air Force DCGS (AF DCGS), DCGS-Marine Corps (DCGS-MC), DCGS-Special Operations Forces (DCGS-SOF) and the DCGS Intelligence Community (DCGS-IC).  Net-enabled enterprise testing is designed to more closely simulate the complexities of an actual combat environment.  JITC engineered the DDTE network to support the assessment of the DCGS Enterprise under the DCGS Governance.  National Agency capabilities supporting DCGS include Imagery Intelligence (IMINT), Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), Measurement and Signature Intelligence (MASINT) and Human Intelligence (HUMINT), which are integrated and tested in the DDTE domain. 

JITC operates the DDTE, providing DCGS PoRs a virtual operationally relevant environment maintaining connectivity between national agency, coalition partners and Service facilities.  DDTE allows robust integration of modeling and simulation T&amp;E capabilities across Joint/DCGS events without bringing vulnerabilities to the operational Command and Control (C2) network known as Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET).  DDTE has enabled vast improvements in systems engineering, instrumentation and test and evaluation throughout all phases of the DCGS life cycle.  </r2:ProjectMissionDescription>
