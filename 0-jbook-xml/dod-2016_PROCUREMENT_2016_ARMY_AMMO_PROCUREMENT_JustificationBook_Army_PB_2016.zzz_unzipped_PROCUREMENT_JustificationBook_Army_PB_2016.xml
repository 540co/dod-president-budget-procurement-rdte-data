DESCRIPTION:

(E96105) CTG 9MM MARKING, M1041 (BLUE) is used for force on force training engagements.  The cartridge can be fired with existing M9/M11 pistols with use of a conversion kit.  The M9 kit consists of a replacement barrel only.  The M11 kit consists of a replacement barrel and recoil spring guide.  A blue enameled portion of the M9 and M11 barrels is visible through the ejection port of the weapons.  The projectile leaves a mark upon impact (similar to paintball), enabling after action evaluation of training scenarios.  It differs from paintball in that it is a full complete cartridge with projectile and cartridge case containing a propulsion system for a low velocity launch.  The M1041 is required to hit targets accurately out to 12 meters.  The cartridge has been safety certified to be fired in close proximity at properly protected human subjects.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E96107) CTG, 9MM MARKING, M1041 (RED) is used for force on force training engagements.  The cartridge can be fired with existing M9/M11 pistols with use of a conversion kit.

            <proc:Description>This budget line includes 40MM ALL TYPES:

(E11800) The 40mm M430A1 is a High-Explosive Dual Purpose cartridge (HEDP), and is fired from a MK19 Grenade Machine Gun at a max range of 2,200 meters.  It is capable of penetrating three inches of steel armor and inflicting personnel casualties in the target area.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.    

(E12502) The 40mm M385A1 practice cartridge is a fixed round of ammunition consisting of a one-piece solid aluminum projectile body with copper rotating band and is fired from a MK19 Grenade Machine Gun at a max range of 2,200 meters.  The cartridge is used as training ammunition.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.  

(E12601) The 40mm M433 is a High Explosive Dual Purpose impact type round designed to penetrate lightly armored targets and perform an anti-personnel mission, and is compatible with the M203, M320, and M79 Grenade Launchers.  Upon impact, the detonator triggers the spitback shaped charge and produces a jet blast that detonates the high explosive bursting charge.  Detonation of the bursting charge forms an armor-piercing jet of molten metal and fragmentation of the projectile body.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.  

(E74200) The 40mm Practice M781 is a training cartridge for the M203, M320, and M79 Grenade Launchers.  It is a fixed round of ammunition consisting of zinc-alloy projectile body with a rotating band and cartridge case assembly.  A hollow polystyrene ogive is filled with high visibility yellow-orange dye.  A .38 caliber blank cartridge is press-fitted into the base of the cartridge case and provides gas pressure needed to propel projectile through the launcher barrel.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.    

(E74315) The 40mm Practice M918/M385A1 Mixed Belt cartridge configuration for the MK19 Grenade Machine Gun is a high velocity training projectile with realistic signature effects providing sufficient flash, smoke and sound upon impact to be seen/heard out to 1,200 meters.  In addition to providing audible/visual signature for day or night firing, the mixed belt for MK19 Grenade Machine Gun will minimize hazards to troops in the training area.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.   

(E05611) The 40mm M918E1 High Velocity Day Night Thermal cartridge is a training cartridge for the Mk19 Grenade Machine Gun.  This is a fixed round of ammunition consisting of a projectile assembly and cartridge case assembly.  The projectile ogive is filled with a signature material that provides a signature upon impact that can be seen, day or night with unaided eye, thermal and night vision weapon sights.  The cartridge does not contain any fuzing or explosives, eliminating unexploded ordnance issues on the training ranges due to non-functioning training ammunition.  This item is code B, not approved for service use.

(E05610) The 40mm M781E1 Low Velocity Day Night Thermal cartridge is a training cartridge for the M203, M320 and M79 Grenade Launchers.  This is a fixed round of ammunition consisting of a projectile assembly and cartridge case assembly.  The projectile ogive is filled with a signature material that provides a signature upon impact that can be seen, day or night with unaided eye, thermal and night vision weapon sights.  The cartridge does not contain any fuzing or explosives, eliminating unexploded ordnance issues on the training ranges due to non-functioning training ammunition.  This item is code B, not approved for service use.

(E71700) The 40mm Dummy M922 is an inert round.  It physically mimics the M430A1 cartridge.  It is used to check weapon function and for crew training.  This cartridge is used as a drill round to train users in handling ammunition and loading the Mk19 series automatic grenade launcher.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>(E89600)60MM Mortar, All Types
This line includes 60mm Mortar Ammunition, All Types.

The 60mm Mortar cartridges are designed for use with the M224A1 Lightweight Company Mortar System (LWCMS) in all light infantry battalions including Airborne, Air Assault and Ranger. The short minimum range of the M224 makes the 60mm mortar ammunition well suited for close protective fires against an assaulting enemy, for block-to-block fighting in cities, and combat over close terrain with restricted visibility.  

(E72199)CTG, MORTAR 60MM HE EnFrag M1061 (IM) W/M734A1 MOF
The M1061, 60mm High Explosive Enhanced Fragmentation (EF) cartridge with multi-option fuze is used against personnel and a higher category of materiel target sets providing both fragmentation and blast effect.  This round uses the insensitive main charge explosive PBNX-110.  Lethality is maintained by an enhanced fragmentation warhead.  The M1061 EF uses the highly reliable and countermeasure resistant M734A1 multi-option fuze.  When the fuze is set in the proximity mode, it functions at a height over the target that is optimized for lethality.  
The M1061 is Code A, approved for service use.

(E92900)CTG MORTAR 60MM HE M768 W/PD FUZE
The 60mm High Explosive Cartridges are Insensitive Munitions (IM) enhanced, HE rounds. The M786 High Explosive cartridge (Range 70 meter minimum to 3,400 meter maximum) is used with the new M783 dual safety, point detonating/delay fuze, tail fin assembly, and high fragmentation steel (HF-1) shell body loaded with approximately 2lbs. of an IM explosive. This round is used primarily in training because it is significantly less expensive than the M720A1, the preferred war fighting round. However, the M768 is lethal and can be used in combat.
This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E92200)CTG Mortar 60MM FRPC M769 SERIES W/PRACTICE FUZE
The M769 is a low-cost, full range, practice round that will replace a percentage of the standard HE rounds used in 60mm mortar training. The M769 FRPC (Range 70 meter minimum to 3,500 meter maximum) has been designed to provide the user with realistic training at a fraction of the cost. It is identical in shape, size and weight to the M720/M720A1 HE cartridges. The flash, bang and smoke signature provided by the M775 fuze is channeled to exhaust holes in the rear of the cartridge through the use of a center vent tube.
This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E98600)CTG, Mortar, 60MM WP SMOKE M722 SERIES W/PD FUZE
The M722A1 60mm Smoke cartridge is designed as a spotting/marking round. The steel projectile is bulk loaded with white phosphorous. When the fuze functions, it detonates the M85 burster, which ruptures the projectile and disperses the white phosphorus. The M722A1 WP Smoke ((Range 200 meter minimum to 3,200 meter maximum) replaced the M745 mechanical point-detonating fuze with the reliable, safe, and cost effective electronic M783 Point Detonating (PD) and Delay (DLY) fuze.
This item is Code A, approved for service use.</proc:Description>

            </proc:ResourceSummary>
            <proc:Description>This budget line includes 81mm Mortar Ammunition, All Types.
The 81mm Mortar cartridges are designed for use with the M252 Mortar Weapon System used by the Stryker Brigade Combat Teams as well as light infantry battalions including Airborne, Air Assault and Ranger.  

(E18403)CTG, MORTAR, 81MM HE M821 W/MOFM 
The 81mm High Explosive Cartridges are Insensitive Munitions (IM) enhanced, HE rounds. The 81mm HE Cartridges consist of a fuze, a threaded plastic fuze adapter, a HF-1 steel projectile body loaded with approximately 3lbs. of IMX-104 explosive, a plastic obturating ring, a M24 Fin, the M220 Propelling Charges, and a M299 Ignition Cartridge. The M821A2 HE (Range 70 meter minimum to 5,859 meter maximum) also incorporates the highly reliable and countermeasure resistant M734A1 multi-option fuze. When the fuze is set in the proximity mode, it functions at a height over the target that is optimized for lethality.
IM features of this cartridge reduce the vulnerability to unplanned stimuli, e.g. fire/heat, shock and impact, while maintaining or exceeding the same level of effectiveness in combat.
These items are Code A, approved for service use.

(E18404)CTG, MORTAR, 81MM HE M889 SERIES W/PD FUZE 
The 81mm High Explosive Cartridges are Insensitive Munitions (IM) enhanced, HE rounds. The 81mm HE Cartridges consist of a fuze, a threaded plastic fuze adapter, a HF-1 steel projectile body loaded with approximately 3lbs. of IMX-104 explosive, a plastic obturating ring, a M24 Fin, the M220 Propelling Charges, and a M299 Ignition Cartridge. The M889A2 HE (Range 70 meter minimum to 5,859 meter maximum) is used with the new M783 dual safety, point detonating/delay fuze.  This round is used primarily in training because it is significantly less expensive than the M821A2, the preferred war fighting round. However, the M889A2 is lethal and can be used in combat.
IM features of this cartridge reduce the vulnerability to unplanned stimuli, e.g. fire/heat, shock and impact, while maintaining or exceeding the same level of effectiveness in combat.
These items are Code A, approved for service use.

(E69600)CTG, MORTAR, 81MM FRPC M879 SERIES W/PRACTICE FUZE
The M879 is a low-cost, full range, practice round that will replace a percentage of the standard HE rounds used in 81mm mortar training. The M879 FRPC (Range 70 meter minimum to 5,800 meter maximum) has been designed to provide the user with realistic training at a fraction of the cost. It is identical in shape, size and weight to the M889A2/M821A2 HE cartridges. The flash, bang and smoke signature provided by the M751 fuze is channeled to exhaust holes in the rear of the cartridge through the use of a center vent tube.
This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E76100)CTG, MORTAR, 81MM VL ILLUM M853 SERIES W/MTSQ FUZE
The M853A1 cartridge is a fin stabilized, mortar cartridge that consists of a M772 Mechanical Time Super Quick (MTSQ) fuze, a thin wall aluminum body tube and aluminum tail cone that contains the payload (parachute and canister), and a fin assembly that contains the ignition cartridge and propelling charges. The payload is base ejected and upon ignition produces visible light illumination. This visible light illumination allows for monitoring of enemy activities and adjustment of fire at greater observation distances during night operations. It also provides a means for day/night signaling. It is particularly useful in combined operations with allies who may not have night vision devices (NVDs). This round illuminates to the full range of the HE round, which allows adjustment of fire at any distance out to the maximum range. The M853A1 (Range 300 meter minimum and 5,050 maximum) is range-matched to the 81mm High Explosive (HE) and smoke cartridges.  
This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E76200)CTG, MORTAR, 81MM RP SMOKE M819 SERIES W/MTSQ FUZE
The M819 Cartridge is a fin stabilized thin wall steel body tube containing 28 palletized red phosphorous (RP) wedges; it uses the highly reliable M772 Mechanical Time Super Quick (MTSQ) fuze. After a set time delay, the RP wedges are ejected and dispersed on the target to quickly produce an obscuring smoke screen. A full screen can be developed with 3 rounds as opposed to 15 rounds with the M375 series WP cartridge that is used to create smoke screens to cover movement of troops and/or disrupt visibility of enemy forces.
This cartridge was modified to include Gas Absorbent Modules (GAMS) that absorb the phosphine gas emitted by the RP to keep the round stable.  The M819 (Range 300 meter minimum and 4,900 maximum) is range-matched to the 81mm High Explosive (HE) and Illum cartridges.  
This item is code A, approved for service use.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>This budget line item includes 120mm Mortars, All Types.
The 120mm Mortar Cartridges are designed for use with the M120, 120mm Towed Mortar System and the M121, Carrier Mortar System. As well as use with the Brigade Combat Team Mortar System.

(E25502)CTG, MORTAR, 120MM HE M933 SERIES W/PD FUZE
The M933A1 120mm High Explosive (HE) cartridge with the M783 Point Detonating/ Delay (PD/DLY) Fuze is used against personnel, bunker and light materiel targets. It consists of a Steel Shell Body with Composition B fill, and aluminum M31 Fin Assembly. The propulsion system utilizes the M1020 Ignition Cartridge and four horseshoe-shaped, water- resistant M234 Propelling Charges. The M933A1 HE (Range 200 meter minimum to 7,200 meter maximum) is used with the new M783 dual safety, point detonating/delay fuze.  This round is used primarily in training because it is significantly less expensive than the M934A1, the preferred war fighting round. However, the M933A1 is lethal and can be used in combat.
This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E25507)CTG, MORTAR, 120MM FRPC M931 SERIES W/PRACT FUZE
The M931 is a low-cost, full range, practice round that will replace a percentage of the standard HE rounds used in 120mm mortar training. The M931 FRPC (Range 200 meter minimum to 7,200 meter maximum) has been designed to provide the user with realistic training for 120mm Mortar crews at a fraction of the cost. It is identical in shape, size and weight to the M933A1/M934A1 HE cartridges.  The M931 is equipped with M781 PD Practice Fuze. The M781 PD Practice Fuze produces a flash, bang, and smoke signature that provides audio/visual feedback to the mortar crew and forward observer.
This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E91300)CTG, MORTAR, 120MM WP SMOKE M929 SERIES W/MOFM
 The M929 White Phosphorous (WP) Smoke Cartridge is used to provide smoke, with some incendiary effect for various screening missions. The cartridge is filled with 5 lbs of WP. The M929 uses the highly reliable and countermeasure resistant M734A1 multi-option fuze when functions, detonates the burster, which disperses the felt pads which are soaked with WP over the target.  The smoke obscuration is generated by a spontaneous reaction between the WP and oxygen.  The M929 (Range 200 meter minimum and 7,200 maximum) is range-matched to the 120mm High Explosive (HE) and Illum cartridges
This item is Code A, approved for service use.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>This budget line includes CARTRIDGE, TANK, 105MM and 120MM ALL TYPES:

(E22125) The M724A1E1 Cartridge will replace the (E22100) M724A1 Cartridge and provide the Army with a range limited (7,000 meters, maximum) round which can be safely fired at all training sites.  The Cartridge, M724A1E1, 105mm Target Practice Discarding Sabot with Tracer (TPDS-T) is used for gunnery training in the Army's 105mm Stryker Brigade Combat Team (SBCT) Mobile Gun System (MGS).  This discarding sabot round is similar in external appearance and is ballistically similar out to 2,000 meters with the M900, Armor Piercing Fin Stabilized Discarding Sabot w/Tracer Cartridge.  It is used as a training surrogate for the M900 Cartridge used by the MGS.  The M724A1E1 Cartridge consists of a deep drawn steel cartridge case, electric primer, propellant and a projectile consisting of a sub-projectile (steel core, windshield, fin and tracer) and aluminum sabot.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E73201) The Cartridge, 120mm, Target Practice Multi Purpose-Tracer (TPMP-T) M1002 is a target practice cartridge that simulates the size, weight, ballistics and the loader's function of setting the nose switch of the High Explosive Multi-Purpose cartridge M830A1.  This round is fired from the M256 120mm smoothbore cannon on the M1A1/M1A2 Abrams Tank.  The projectile is inert and composed of an aluminum body, steel nose with dummy plastic switch, aluminum tailcone, aluminum sabot, nylon obturators and tracer.  The tailcone imparts spin to the projectile in flight for stabilization and provides the mechanism to limit the projectile's maximum range.  The M1002 replaces the M831A1 cartridge.  Tank crews will conduct live fire training with the cartridge to achieve and maintain gunnery proficiency. This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E73400) The 120mm M865 Target Practice Cone-Stabilized Discarding Sabot with Tracer (TPCSDS-T) is a target practice round that simulates the ballistics of the 120mm M829 Series Armor Piercing Fin-Stabilized Discarding Sabot with Tracer (APFSDS-T) round. This round is fired from the M256 120mm smoothbore cannon on the M1A1/M1A2 Abrams Tank.  The projectile is inert and is composed of a steel core, aluminum fin, aluminum sabots, nylon obturator and tracer.  The fin imparts spin to the projectile in flight for stabilization and provides the mechanism to limit the projectile's maximum range.  Tank crews will conduct live fire training with the cartridge to achieve and maintain gunnery proficiency. This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E88106) The 120mm M829E4 Armor Piercing Fin Stabilized, Discarding Sabot with Tracer (APFSDS-T) cartridge is the follow on to the M829A3 APFSDS-T cartridge.  The M829E4 is the most effective anti-armor kinetic energy cartridge fired from the M256 120mm smoothbore cannon on the M1A1/M1A2 Abrams Tank.  This cartridge has been designed to defeat advances in armor protection, specifically advancement in explosive reactive armor (ERA).  The cartridge incorporates advancements in propulsion, using a temperature insensitive propellant, novel penetrator design, and an advanced composite sabot.  The projectile system consists of a depleted uranium penetrator mated to a drag reducing windshield and flight stabilizing multi-bladed fin, all secured for launch with a composite sabot.  The M829E4 captures several new technologies along with components previously used on previous APFSDS-T cartridges, but incorporates technology advancements to yield significant improvement in performance over previous fielded cartridges.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>(E15101)Artillery Cartridges, 75MM And 105MM, All Types
This budget line includes Cartridge, Artillery, 75mm &amp; 105mm, All Types.

(E15200)CTG, ARTY, 75MM BLANK, M337A1
The 75mm M337A2 is a non-tactical blank cartridge fired from a M116 Howitzer that is used in burial, retreat ceremonies and VIP Salutes.  It consists of a cartridge case containing loosely packed black powder and a press-fitted percussion primer. A fiberglass wad is inserted over the black powder and a polystyrene closing cup is cemented in place with a polyester resin adhesive. When the firing pin of the weapon strikes the primer, a flash is generated which ignites the black powder charge producing flash, smoke, and a loud report to simulate weapon firing.
This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E21200)CTG, ARTY, 105MM BLANK M395
The 105mm M395 blank cartridge is a non-tactical cartridge fired from a M119 Series Towed Howitzer that is used in burial, retreat ceremonies and VIP Salutes as well as simulation of battlefield noise used for training exercises.  It is assembled with a loose 770 gram black powder charge retained by a glass-fibre closing wad and a polystyrene closing cup glued in place by an epoxy resin. The base of the case is fitted with an M61 percussion element and a primer. Detonation of the case contents creates sound, flash and smoke.
This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E21501)CTG, ARTY, 105MM HE, M1 W/O FUZE
The 105mm M1 High Explosive (HE) cartridge contains a HE fill and is used primarily for training although some cartridges are expended in combat operations for fragmentation and blast.  The cartridge is loaded with an M67 propellant charge, consisting of seven numbered increment bags sewn together in numerical order. Projectile function is dependent upon the fuze used and may function on impact (instantaneous or delay), above ground at a predetermined height or in proximity to the target area. Fuze function detonates the HE projectile filler resulting in projectile fragmentation and blast.  Range varies from 3.5 to 11.3 kilometers, depending on the number of charge bags used.  The program remanufactures/recapitalizes the remaining unserviceable cartridges through replacement of M67 Prop Charge and Primer at a reduced cost over new production to provide a cost effective training cartridge. This item is Code A, approved for service use.
Funding for the 105MM HE, M1 program in FY2015 and FY16 is for recapitalization. 

(E21610)CTG, ARTY, 105MM HE-BB PFF M1130A1 W/O FUZE
The 105mm M1130A1 High Explosive (HE) cartridge fired from a M119 Series Towed Howitzer contains a HE fill and is primarily used in combat operations for missions that are fired at long range (maximum range is 17.5 kilometers) and high quadrant elevation.  Firing rounds at high quadrant elevation is required to engage targets beyond the tall crests of mountainous terrain.  The projectile warhead is composed of natural fragmenting steel with an inner liner that provides increased lethality against personnel and soft targets as well as increased accuracy due to its aerodynamic shape.  The cartridge also consists of insensitive munition (IM) explosive filler that reduces vulnerability to unplanned stimuli.  The M1130A1 Cartridge is compatible with the M782 MOFA and the M767ETSQ series fuzes. The program upgrades current M1130 cartridges by replacing the M67 propellant with the M350 propellant that extends the range an additional 4 kilomieters.  
This item is Code B, not approved for service use.

(E21705)CTG, ARTY, 105MM IR ILLUM M1064 W/O FUZE
The 105mm M1064 Infrared (IR) Illuminating Cartridge is compatible with the M762 series ET fuze, M67 propelling charge, and is packaged in the PA117 Shipping Container. The XM1064 consists of a 40 gram expelling charge, illuminant canister and parachute assembly. Upon fuze function, the expelling charge simultaneously ignites the illuminate while ejecting it from the projectile. Once dispensed, fins on the canister assist in reducing the spin rate while the parachute provides a descent rate of 12 m/s. The Infrared Illumination greatly enhances the effectiveness of night vision devices providing front line units with temporary battlefield infrared illumination to observe the movements and maneuvers of enemy forces under the cover of darkness.
The item is Code A approved for service use.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>(E89500)ARTILLERY PROJECTILE, 155MM, ALL TYPES
This budget line includes Projectiles, Artillery, 155mm, All Types.  

(E21618)PROJ, ARTY, 155MM EXT RANGE MARKING RD M110A3
The 155mm Smoke White Phosphorous (WP) M110A3 Artillery Round utilizes projectile bodies generated from the current M483 Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munition (DPICM) demilitarization program and incorporates a more producible WP Bulk-filled Canister with 15.0 lbs of WP that provides smoke spotting capability to a maximum range of 22.5 kilometers providing increased operational effectiveness and improved training .  
This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E26904)Proj, Arty, 155MM IR ILLUM M1123
The 155mm M1123 Infrared Illumination projectile is used with night vision devices to illuminate a designated target area to a maximum range of 17.5 kilometers.  The projectile has a hollow, steel-forged body containing an illumination canister, a canister expelling charge in the nose and a drogue parachute in the base.  The illumination canister contains the main parachute and lines, the illumination candle assembly and secondary expelling charge and a delay element holder.  The outer shell of the canister is fitted with four longitudinal fins.  The projectile uses an Electronic Time Fuze.  When the fuze functions, the primary expelling charge ignites forcing the drogue parachute and canister assembly against the base plate, rupturing the base pins and expelling the canister and parachute.  The drogue parachute deploys and the canister fins extend.  The expelling charge also ignites the delay element in the canister nose.  The delay element ignites the secondary expelling charge within the canister after 8 seconds igniting the candle and expelling the main parachute.  With the main parachute open, the illuminate candle descends at 15 feet per second and burns for 120 seconds.  The M1123 Provides Infrared battlefield illumination that is 2.4x larger in diameter than the M1066 Infrared Illuminating projectile.
This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E26904)PROJ, ARTY, 155MM VL ILLUM M1124
The 155MM Visual Light Illumination M1124 fired from 155mm howitzers is used to illuminate the battlefield to a maximum range of 17.5 kilometers.  The projectile has a hollow, steel-forged body containing an illumination canister, a canister expelling charge in the nose and a drogue parachute in the base.  The illuminate canister contains the main parachute and lines, the illuminate candle assembly and secondary expelling charge and a delay element holder.  The outer shell of the canister is fitted with four longitudinal fins.  The projectile uses a Mechanical or Electronic Time fuze.  When the fuze functions, the primary expelling charge ignites forcing the drogue parachute and canister assembly against the base plate, rupturing the base pins and expelling the canister and parachute.  The drogue parachute then deploys and the canister fins extend.  The expelling charge also ignites the delay element in the canister nose.  The delay element ignites the secondary expelling charge within the canister after 8 seconds igniting the candle and expelling the main parachute.  With the main parachute open, the illumination candle descends at 15 feet per second and burns for 120 seconds producing approximately 1,000,000 candlepower.  
This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E27603)PROJ, ARTY, 155MM HE IM TRAINING M1122
The 155mm M1122 High Explosive (HE) projectile will be the primary HE round used for training. The M1122 is a lower cost HE training round. The M1122 will replace the M804A1 and M107 Projectiles for training.  It utilizes M483A1 DPICM metal parts from an ongoing M483A1 demil effort, is filled with high density concrete to simulate the weight of the M795 HE Projectile, and incorporates several Insensitive Munitions (IM) technologies (IMX-101 explosive fill, PBXN-9 Supplementary Charge, Meltable Fuze Well Liner and Meltable Fuze Plug) to increase survivability and safety.  The M1122 will replicate the flight characteristics of the wartime M795 HE projectile with a maximum range of 22.5 kilometers.
This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E66800)PROJ, ARTY, 155MM HE, M795
The M795 High Explosive (HE) Projectile is the primary HE round used for warfare operations with maximum range of 22.5 kilometers.  The M795 incorporates Insensitive Munitions (IM) technologies that reduces vulnerability from unplanned stimuli e.g. fire/heat, shock and impact, while maintaining or exceeding the same level of effectiveness in combat.  The 155mm M795 has a high fragmentation steel (HF1) body projectile filled with 23.8 pounds of IMX101 Explosive fill, PBXN-9 Supplementary Charge, and Meltable Fuze Plug.  The projectile can use several different fuzes (impact, mechanical time, electronic time and short intrusion proximity).  It is used for conventional fire support for harassment and interdiction, fragmentation and blast effect.  The M795 projectile is employed against personnel, trucks, electronic surveillance and target acquisition devices, supply points, command and control and communications (C3) installations, and mechanized and armored forces.
This item is Code A, approved for service use.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>This budget line item includes the Excalibur family of munitions for the use in the M777A2 Lightweight 155mm Howitzer (LW155), the M109A6 Paladin Howitzer, the M109A7 paladin PIM Howitzer and the Swedish Archer Howitzer.

Excalibur is a Precision Guided Extended Range 155mm Artillery projectile providing Brigade Combat Teams an organic precision fires capability. Additionally it provides improved fire support capability due to its increased range of 40.5 kilometers and demonstrated accuracy of &lt;3 meters radial miss distances, which enables a first round effect on target reducing the number of rounds required while reducing collateral damage. Excalibur is compatible with the M777A2 Lightweight 155mm Howitzer (LW155), the M109A6 Paladin Howitzer, the M109A7 Paladin PIM Howitzer, and the Swedish Archer Howitzer. Excalibur provides a 35% range increase over current Rocket Assisted Projectiles with a &lt;10 meter circular error probable requirement at all ranges. Excalibur is also highly resistant to Global Positioning System (GPS) jamming. This item is Code A, approved for service use.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.

Excalibur Increments Ia-1 and Ia-2 are currently fielded and in use by units throughout Afghanistan and deployed globally to support other Military Contingency Operations. Excalibur is an International Cooperative Development program, teamed with the Kingdom of Sweden (KoS), which contributed resources towards the development in accordance with an established Project Agreement. Excalibur Increment Ia-1 was initially fielded to units in Iraq and Afghanistan in response to an urgent need request in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (as of September 2010 re-named to Operation New Dawn) and Operation Enduring Freedom. Increment Ia-2 was fielded in early FY 2012 and greatly increases range from 25.2 kilometers to 40.5 kilometers. The Excalibur guided projectile program is using an incremental development approach to provide a combat capability to the Soldier as quickly as possible while delivering advanced capabilities at lower costs. Excalibur Increment Ib will provide further performance improvements while significantly lowering unit costs. 

Increment Ib completed a successful Initial Operational Test and Evaluation in February 2014 as well as a Full Rate Production Decision Review in June 2014. The Excalibur Increment Ib projectile was Type Classified and Full Material Released in June 2014.

This is a war reserve item currently being used in combat. The FY 2016 request builds a war reserve inventory in accordance with the Army procurement goals. FY 2016 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $45.518 million supports the procurement of 476 Increment Ib projectiles.</proc:Justification>

(E62208)ARTY, FUZE PD M739A1
The M739A1 Point Detonating (PD) and Delay Fuze is the Army's preferred, primary fuze for 105mm and 155mm projectiles to address point detonating/delay artillery functions. The M739A1 fuze contains an Impact Delay Module (IDM) assembly.  The IDM provides fuze initiation delay based upon the completion of mechanical actions caused by projectile deceleration and will function immediately after passing through the target.
This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E63000) ARTY, 155MM PRIMER PERCUSSION M82 SERIES
The M82 Percussion Primer is intended for use with all United States 155mm cannon field artillery systems.  The M82 Series Percussion Primer is used to initiate the burning of propellant charges and consists of a cylindrical brass case with an extraction flange which contains a base plunger, an ignition element which contains Primer #34 and a container loaded with 22 grains of black powder.

(E99250)ARTY, FUZE, PRECISION GUIDANCE KIT (PGK)
The Precision Guidance Kit (PGK) is a Global Positioning System (GPS) guidance kit with point detonating and height of burst fuzing functions. PGK provides near precision accuracy and efficiency for 155mm M795 and M549A1 high explosive (HE) projectiles. Using an integrated GPS receiver, the PGK corrects the inherent errors associated with ballistic firing solutions and reduces the number of projectiles required to execute fire missions. This item is Code A, approved for service use.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2016 Base Budget supports critical Army Title 10 war reserve/operational, training, and test requirements IAW DoD Instruction 3000.04 (Munitions Requirements Process) and AR 5-13 (Total Army Munitions Requirements Process and Prioritization System).  War reserve requirements support OSD-approved Combatant Commander Operational Plans, Homeland Defense, and other OSD-directed missions.  Training requirements support individual and collective training of Active and Reserve Component forces at Army schools, home station, and the combined training centers.  Test requirements support the development, fielding, safety, and quality assurance of Army munitions and equipment throughout their life-cycle.

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.

FY 2016 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $78.024 million supports production of 229,261 propellant, primers and fuzes. FY 2016 OCO procurement dollars in the amount of $2.000 million suppports production of 24,612 M739A1 PD Artillery Fuzes.  Funds are required to replenish munitions expended in combat operations in theater.

E62208 - ARTY, FUZE PD M739A1 
This is a training standard item used in training and combat.  The FY 2016 supports annual training and a builds a war reserve inventory in accordance with the Army procurement goals.  
TYPE CLASSIFICATION:  1982
FY 2016 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $20.700 million supports production of 229,261 cartridges.  
FY 2016 OCO procurement dollars in the amount of $2.000 million supports production of 24,612 cartridges.  Funds are required to replenish munitions expended in combat operations in theater.

E63000 - ARTY, 155MM PRIMER PERCUSSION M82 Series 
Material Change Program (MCP) was approved in FY14 to address known reliability issues because the M82 was originally designed to withstand maximum pressures up to 45,000-psi but 155mm propelling charges developed after the 1980's can generate pressures up to 60,000-psi at top-charge where the primer can remain stuck in the cannon's breech after firing.  The M82E1 (strengthen existing design) is the first spiral improvement with ECP date of 4QFY15 and estimated price of $15 each (per Engineering Estimate).  The M82E2 (incorporate combustible case technology) is the second spiral improvement with ECP date of 2QFY17 and estimated price of $20 each (per Engineering Estimate).
Procurement will be dual-purpose to fulfill War Reserve and to support Training as needed.

ER8021 - ARTY, 155MM PROP CHG, MACS M232 SERIES
This item is a training standard item used in both training and combat.  Request supports annual training and builds a war reserve inventory in accordance with the Army procurement goals.

            <proc:Description>This budget line procures all Hydra-70 rocket types in support of operational, training and war reserve requirements.  The system provides combat overmatch capability and ensures the availability of munitions to support combat operations.  This system of aerial rockets is used by Army aircraft (AH-64A/D Apache, OH-58D Kiowa Warrior and Special Operations aircraft) to perform a number of roles including anti-materiel, anti-personnel, air-to-ground suppression and illumination.  This Hydra-70 rocket funding supports the entire Hydra-70 Rocket System to include resolution of obsolescence, safety, reliability, weapon integration activities, potential test sets, engineering changes, production issues and guidance section repair kits.

            <proc:Description>Includes Cartridge Actuated Devices (CAD) and Propellant Actuated Devices (PAD) all types. 

CAD/PAD are used in various escape and jettison systems on all types of Army aircraft.  They are required to support aircraft escape, safety, and jettison systems and mission essential needs.  Items are subject to shelf and service life restrictions and, therefore, require replacement at specified intervals.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2016 Base Budget supports critical Army Title 10 war reserve/operational, training, and test requirements IAW DoD Instruction 3000.04 (Munitions Requirements Process) and AR 5-13 (Total Army Munitions Requirements Process and Prioritization System).  War reserve requirements support OSD-approved Combatant Commander Operational Plans, Homeland Defense, and other OSD-directed missions.  Training requirements support individual and collective training of Active and Reserve Component forces at Army schools, home station, and the combined training centers.  Test requirements support the development, fielding, safety, and quality assurance of Army munitions and equipment throughout their life-cycle.

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.

The FY 2016 program is required to assure availability of replacement items when needed and avoid grounding aircraft or rendering aircraft partially mission capable.</proc:Justification>

The M112 Demolition Block is used for general demolition and, in particular, for destruction of captured enemy ammunition.  The block demolition charge consists of 1-1/4 pounds of composition C-4 plastic explosive packed in a Mylar-film bag.  Pressure sensitive adhesive tape is provided on one of the rectangular surfaces, allowing quick emplacement by the individual soldier on the object to be destroyed.  The explosive may be cut and/or removed from its wrapper and hand molded into a desired shape suited to the target.  Upon detonation, the shock wave destroys the target by cutting, breaching or cratering.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E51300) Charge Demolition Block Cratering 40 pound is a demolition charge designed to destroy roads, bridge abutments, runways, buildings, fortifications and other concrete structures.  It uses a low velocity explosive which destroys by a lifting and heaving motion rather than the cutting action of high velocity charges.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E51400) Charge Demolition Sheet 50 Foot Roll, M186 is a flexible explosive.  It is 3 inches wide and 1/4 inch thick.  It can be easily cut and formed into various shapes and is primarily used as a cutting charge.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E52500) Cap Blasting Electric M6 is used to initiate high explosives.  It is initiated by an electrical charge from a blasting machine or other source of electric power.  Blasting cap M6 consists of a base charge of RDX, an intermediate charge of lead azide and an ignition charge of smokeless powder, potassium chlorate and lead salt of dinitro cresol in an aluminum alloy cup.  Two 12-foot lead wires, connected by a bridge wire in the ignition charge, extend through a rubber plug assembly in the open end of the cup.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E53200) Charge Demolition Shaped M3 40 pound is used to blast craters in paved and unpaved roads and to bore holes in metals, masonry or concrete.  It contains a 15-inch stand-off, 29.5 pound Comp B main charge and a 0.11 pound Comp A3 booster.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E54100) Detonating Cord is used to prime and detonate explosive charges.  Unlike the time fuze, which burns slowly, detonating cord burns almost instantaneously.  It is used to link a series of near simultaneous charges.  The Type 1, Class E detonating cord consists of a core of high velocity explosive in a seamless textile tube.  The tube is covered with a thin layer of asphalt and sheathed in an outer cover of plastic coated textile.  The plastic outer cover is smooth and colored olive drab.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E59100) The Cartridge Impulse Electrically Initiated is used in Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) tools and equipment.  It is an electrically initiated, gas producing device.  It is initiated with an MK1-2 squib in place of the percussion primer.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E60200) Cutter Cartridge Actuated 2 Second Delay M21 is a cartridge actuated device that is used in aerial delivery systems for cargo.  It severs a reefing line which allows a parachute to fully deploy.  The cutter is installed in a mounting bracket which is attached to the parachute.

(E76728) MK 788-0, Main Charge Disrupter is a device used to render-safe unexploded ordnance (UXO).  Upon initiation, the device attacks and neutralizes the main charge explosive by generating reactions up to and including low-order detonations. It is a non-developmental item (NDI) consisting of an energetic tool (ET), a demolition material interface adapter, and an emplacement stand.   The MCD provides EOD with an improved neutralization capability in situations where the use of more traditional methods (attacking the fuzing mechanism or high-order detonation) is not possible or desired.  This item is Code B, not approved for service use.

(E78201) The M980 Demolition Charge is a 20 pound, 38 foot roll of flexible explosive.  It is 10 inches wide and .083 inches thick.  It can be easily cut and formed into various shapes and is primarily used as a cutting charge.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E81302) Cap Blasting Non-Elec, W/30 ft Shock Tube is part of the family of Modern Demolition Initiators (MDI).  It consists of a blasting cap which is factory sealed to a length of shock tube.  The tube is activated using an M81 igniter.  A shock wave travels the length of the tube, with a delay measured in milliseconds, and ignites the blasting cap which in turn initiates the main charge.  The MDI is not susceptible to electrostatic discharge or Radio Frequency (RF) jamming.  The 30 foot length is generally used as a linking charge for a series of demolitions.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E81307) Igniter, Time Fuze and Shock Tube, M81 is a device, hand held by the individual Soldier, with a small primer charge that will activate the M700 Time Fuze as well as a shock tube.

(E49100) Flare, AC Countermeasure, M206 Magnesium Teflon IR
The M206 flares are part of a family of advanced IR decoy flares designed for use by Army helicopters and fixed wing aircraft to meet advanced threats in current and future operational environments.  This flare is a Magnesium Teflon Viton flare.  When used together with the M212, a spectrally matched flare, and the M211, a pyrophoric alloy material payload that reacts with air to emit intense IR radiation, it provides protection against a wide range of surface to air threats.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E88900) Flare AC Cntermeasure M211 Pyrophoric Msl IR Decoy
These flares are part of a family of advanced infrared (IR) decoy flares designed for use by Army helicopters and fixed wing aircraft to meet advanced threats in current and future operational environments.  The M211 uses a special high surface area metal foil, which rapidly oxidizes when exposed to oxygen.  When one of the flares is dispensed from the host aircraft, the special pyrophoric material payload reacts with air to emit intense IR radiation that is not visible to the naked eye.  The IR radiation diverts heat-seeking missiles away from the aircraft.  When used together with the M212, a spectrally matched flare, and the M206, a Magnesium Teflon Viton flare, the flares provide protection against a wide range of surface to air threats.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.

Using this item, the soldier can determine if he is using the gas mask properly and gain confidence in the use of his gas mask.  The capsules are packaged in cans of 50 capsules each.  Extra packing dunnage is added to the cans in order to keep the capsules from moving and breaking in transport.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.

(E99101)SPECIAL TRAINING AMMO includes Special Training Ammo.  

(EA0600) AMMUNITION PROGRAM SUPPORT includes ammunition program support.

            <proc:Description>The Ammunition Peculiar Equipment (APE) program provides support for ammunition operations including surveillance, demilitarization (demil), maintenance, renovation, modification, packaging, and preservation per Army Regulation 700-20, Ammunition Peculiar Equipment.  APE is developed, acquired, and supervised through the Single Manager for Conventional Ammunition per DoD Instruction 5160.68.  APE provides unique, low-density equipment items specifically designed, fabricated, procured, tested, and adopted for use in worldwide United States (US) military ammunition depot operations on conventional ammunition.  APE maintains a central source of standard, modern, safe, efficient, reliable, and environmentally acceptable equipment for ammunition operations.  This equipment is different from production line plant equipment as it disassembles ammunition items into components, sorts and removes hazardous materials to reduce human interaction and improves personnel safety.  Maintenance APE is also designed to perform cleaning and renovation functions on ammunition subjected to deterioration effects (rust, corrosion, weathering, etc) during its storage life.  APE supporting surveillance is key to stockpile sampling and functional testing of the items to assure readiness for combat or training.  Demilitarization APE is similar to maintenance APE, but must go further in disassembly to destroy hazardous components, sort and reclaim salvageable parts or metals.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2016 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $17.811 million will support APE that must be on-hand to perform ammunition depot operations for conventional ammunition.  These operations cannot be accomplished if the required APE is not supplied in a timely manner.  The equipment is loaned to worldwide locations for the accomplishment of depot-type operations based on the ammunition requirements.  APE is required to support the Ammunition Stockpile Reliability Program, Surveillance Program, equipment for worldwide maintenance and demil, prepositioned ships, and Government-Owned, Contractor-Operated plants as Government Furnished Equipment for ammunition depot operations at those locations.  The APE assets maintain and verify the quality of the ammunition stockpile, thereby saving the cost of purchasing new replacement ammunition.  APE proficiently executes the ammunition demil mission to safely perform or support disassembly, destruction, or removal processes with an emphasis on recycling, re-utilization and preserving demil assets in a manner that supports ammunition sustainment, safety and environmental compliance.

The APE program provides essential major parts and equipment upgrades at the Demilitarization Facility (DEFAC) in the Republic of Korea (ROK).  A Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) was signed on 4 November 2011 by US Forces Korea and the ROK Ministry of National Defense, which permits the demilitarization of US titled munitions at this facility.  The DEFAC provides an environmentally safe means of demil for both US and ROK titled munitions, and the demil of US titled munitions at the DEFAC avoids significant retrograde shipment costs.  Current DEFAC operations involve the meltout/demil of US titled munitions for one year from July 2014 to June 2015, and demil ROK titled munitions the following year switching back to US assets in July 2016.

The program provides global support to the US Military Services for ammunition sustainment and demil operations, including deployment, operations and support of the Ammunition Supply Point (ASP) suites.  The ASP suites include APE, which will increase the efficiency of the receipt, inspection and issuance of ammunition to the warfighter.  Deployment of APE to support ASP suites will increase efficiencies for ammunition sustainment operations by reducing logistics burdens and related risks.  This allows for better primary mission readiness, enhanced hazardous operations safety and more efficient operating conditions requiring less ammunition retrograde/demil by providing capability to preserve ammunition assets.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>This budget line provides funding for modernization efforts at Government-Owned, Contractor-Operated Army Ammunition Plants and commercial facilities, including replacement of obsolete or worn production equipment, correction of deficiencies and upgrade of infrastructures.  The Provision of Industrial Facilities (PIF) budget line also establishes, augments and improves ammunition production capabilities through strategic modernization efforts, expands production capacity, maintains environmental compliance, and improves quality of work environment and safety at ammunition plants, as well as emergency modernization and associated construction to address production disruptions at various sites.

This budget line provides funding for preservation, storage and movement of real property facilities and equipment required for anticipated future requirements at active and inactive Army ammunition installations, also known as Layaway of Industrial Facilities (LIF) activities.  Funding will also support consolidation of laid-away production equipment and redistribution of production equipment that cannot be stored on-site.  Laid-away efforts will also include retaining critical operational and technical knowledge of production equipment, such as engineering designs, process data and control manufacturing practices.  Efforts will also include safety-related decontamination, disposal and demolition of production equipment and facilities, and environmental site assessments.

Procurement funds will also support the Maintenance of Inactive Facilities (MIF) to include utilities, buildings, plant equipment, special tooling, and special test equipment being retained to support future production requirements.  Additional efforts include support of associated MIF costs such as grounds maintenance, fire protection, equipment security, and administrative support.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2016 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $221.703 million support modernization projects to include construction of a Nitric Acid Concentrator/Sulfuric Acid Concentrator (NAC/SAC) facility at Holston Army Ammunition Plant (AAP), upgrades to the small caliber production lines at Lake City AAP, continued procurement and installation of necessary equipment supporting the central fire alarm/mass warning system at Iowa AAP, upgrades to critical containment dikes at Radford AAP, and modernization upgrades at Scranton AAP.  Funds will support critical work environmental projects, including improvements for personnel safety and health, and efforts to maintain environmental compliance at the ammunition plants.  Funds will also provide engineering support of industrial facilities, pre-design efforts for future-year modernization projects and procurement efforts at Aberdeen and Yuma Test Centers to include production acceptance tests for various ammunition end items.

FY 2016 Base procurement dollars also support the protection and preservation of industrial facilities at active and inactive Army ammunition installations and equipment that is no longer required for current production but must be retained for future peacetime or emergency production needs to include the first phase of the stabilization and layaway of Area A at Holston AAP.  LIF efforts also include reducing the industrial base footprint by demolishing facilities and disposing equipment no longer required at the Army ammunition installations.

FY 2016 Base procurement dollars also support MIF efforts at active and inactive ammunition installations.</proc:Justification>

This facility will recover the spent acid used in IM Explosives (IMX)-101, IMX-104 manufacturing and other Dinitroanisole and Nitrotriazalone IMX bases.  This project will provide Holston AAP with the capability to reconcentrate spent nitric acid in order to avoid ammonia nitrate waste disposal costs.  Additionally, the new facility mitigates a critical supply chain issue in the production of strong nitric acid within the National Technology and Industrial Base.</proc:NarrativeExplanation>

Bulk storage tanks vary in age and several existing tanks were installed in the 1940s.  Bulk storage capacity is required to handle sulfuric acid, oleum, strong nitric acid, weak nitric acid, and processed (pyro) acid.  The safe and reliable storage of acids is critical for nitrocellulose operations.  Containment dikes surrounding these bulk storage tanks have deteriorated and repairs are required to contain an acid release in the event of a catastrophic failure.</proc:NarrativeExplanation>

The effort will design and build a new centering machine, along with upgrading three existing centering machines.  The relay logic control system will be replaced with a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC).  Numerous pieces of equipment supporting the projectile metal parts production lines will be upgraded, allowing multiple operations to be performed simultaneously.  This modernization effort will result in energy savings, reduce maintenance costs due to leaks and contamination, and make troubleshooting safer due to the separation of high and low voltage components.</proc:NarrativeExplanation>

The current waste treatment facility is approximately 20 years old and replacement parts are difficult to produce or not available.  The sand filter is ineffective which reduces the system efficiency.  A new sewer permit has reduced the effluent limit for Zinc, and the existing system has problems maintaining proper levels when less than three bonderizer systems are running.

The majority of the instrumentation being upgraded or replaced is obsolete and has met or exceeded its economic life.  This instrumentation is required to ensure complete and accurate test data is collected and safety and environmental hazards are minimized.  Benefits of this project include increased test efficiencies and decreased costs and risks to Army Program Managers.</proc:NarrativeExplanation>

            <proc:Description>The Conventional Munitions Demilitarization Program provides for the demilitarization (demil) and disposal of Single Manager for Conventional Ammunition (SMCA) conventional ammunition for all Military Services per DoD Directive 5160.65 and DoD Instruction 5160.68 that is unserviceable, obsolete, unsafe, or excess to requirements.  The program accomplishes demil using open burning/open detonation (OB/OD) processes or closed disposal technologies (CDT) with primary emphasis on resource recovery and recycling (R3).  This program also provides for operations and technical support and services; packaging, crating, handling, and transportation (PCHT) of ammunition for demil projects at United States Army depots, plants and activities; commercial contracts that provide CDT demil support and services, and international operations, which include the European and Pacific Theatres.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2016 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $113.250 million will support the demilitarization of conventional ammunition as well as missile and missile components (msl/comp) for all Military Services.

FY 2016 funds will support the US demil operations of conventional ammunition in both Continental United States (CONUS) and Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS).  CONUS demil operations are performed by a combination of Government Owned, Government Operated (GOGO) depots, Government Owned, Contractor Operated (GOCO) depots as well as commercial contractors.  OCONUS demil operations are performed at Demilitarization Facilities (DEFACs) in the Republic of Korea and Japan as well as commercial contractors in the European Union. 

As of the end of September 2014, the conventional ammunition demil account contained 537,679 tons of ammunition in CONUS wholesale storage locations: 492,433 tons of conventional ammunition and 45,246 tons (369,361 eaches) of msl/comp.  As of the end of September 2014, 73,612 tons of conventional ammunition were demilitarized.  As of the end of September 2014, 11,602 tons (94,714 eaches) of msl/comp were demilitarized.  

Stockpile growth and generations: An estimated 70,204 tons of conventional ammunition will be generated into the SMCA Resource, Recovery and Disposition Account (B5A) in FY 2015.  For FY 2016 through FY 2020, 533,917 tons of conventional ammunition are forecasted to be added into the B5A.  For missile demil, an estimated 6,143 tons (40,199 eaches) of msl/comp are planned for generations into the B5A in FY 2015.  For FY 2016 through FY 2020, 48,872 tons (319,819 eaches) msl/comp are forecasted to be added into the B5A.

Stockpile growth factors: The demil stockpile is expected to grow as a result of Military Services generations as well as other factors such as cluster munitions, land mine policies and the disestablishment of War Reserve Stocks Allies (WRSA) accounts at OCONUS locations.  Currently, there are approximately 221,502 tons of cluster munitions in the demil stockpile.  An additional 250,224 tons are expected to be added into the B5A no later than FY 2018 to ensure compliance with the Cluster Munitions Policy.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>The Armament Retooling and Manufacturing Support (ARMS) program reuses idle capacity at active and inactive Government-Owned, Contractor-Operated (GOCO) Army Ammunition Plants and GOCO Army Depots through commercialization.  Congress enacted this program in the FY 1993 Defense Authorization Act (Public Law (PL) 102-484) and codified in FY 2000 (10 U.S.C. 4551-4555).  ARMS resources are used for facility strategic reuse plans, marketing plans, building renovation and recapitalization, equipment purchase, relocation, or consolidation, and environmental baseline studies to encourage commercial use of underutilized Army assets.  The ARMS objectives include sustaining critical manufacturing capabilities and critical skills; reducing facility operating and maintenance costs; decreasing product cost; providing opportunities for small business; and accelerating private sector economic development, employment and investment.  The ARMS program allows the Army to manage portions of the ammunition infrastructure as a commercial business.  This management concept has allowed the Army to apply overhead costs across multiple commercial contracts to reduce operating costs.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2016 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $3.575 million support financial and marketing investments to attract revenue-producing tenants to locate on GOCO Army Ammunition Plants and GOCO Army Depots.  The ARMS Program reduces Army cost of ownership and maintains critical munitions industrial base skills.  Revenues collected will be utilized to reduce overhead and total annual operating costs, improve and maintain existing buildings for current tenants, and perform improvements to other vacant buildings to entice potential tenants.</proc:Justification>
