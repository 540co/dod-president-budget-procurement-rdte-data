                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project matures and demonstrates equipment and innovative techniques for precision aerial delivery of cargo and personnel.  Aerial delivery is a key capability for rapid force projection and global precision delivery. These efforts are designed to advance state of the art precision delivery technologies such as parachutes, guidance and navigation and control components and subsystems, tracking sensors, software algorithms, and safety rigging which integrates with currently equipped aircraft, unmanned aerial systems (UAS) and advanced rotary wing aircraft.  These efforts provide the Warfighter with highly accurate, timely cargo/payload delivery and resupply in all terrain and weather conditions.  Precision delivery/resupply reduces vulnerability of ground soldiers, aircraft and crew. Precision aerial delivery supports remote warfare with activities such as placement of battlefield sensors, reduction of Soldier load and initial delivery of key expeditionary base camp assets.  Demonstrated technologies transition to Product Manager (PM)-Force Sustainment Systems (PM FSS), PM-Soldier Clothing and Individual Equipment (PM-SCIE) as well as other Army PMs.

Efforts in this program element support the Army science and technology Soldier portfolio.

Work in this project is fully coordinated with PE 0602786A (Warfighter Technology).

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project matures and demonstrates technologies for military combat feeding systems and combat rations.  Areas of emphasis include: enhanced nutrient composition to maximize cognitive and physical performance on the battlefield; cutting edge food stabilization and preservation techniques that increase the variety and quality of rations used by the Joint Services; novel ration packaging solutions to minimize degradation of combat rations during storage; field portable biosensors for food borne pathogen detection and identification as well as predictive modeling tools to protect the Warfighter from food borne illnesses. This project demonstrates combat feeding equipment with reduced logistics (in component parts, weight, volume, fuel, and water) and labor requirements, while improving the quality of food service. The project, a Department of Defense (DoD) program for which the Army has Executive Agent responsibility, provides technology development for Joint Service Combat Feeding. The DoD Combat Feeding Research and Engineering Board provides oversight for this project.  Demonstrated field feeding equipment transition to Product Manager (PM)-Force Sustainment Systems (PM FSS).

Efforts in this program element support the Army science and technology Soldier portfolio.

Expeditionary Base Camp (EBC) systems (or remote command outposts) provide an operational capability for Small Combat Units (battalion and below) and Soldiers which are rapidly deployable/re-locatable and require no Military Construction and limited materiel handing support.  The need for this technologically enabled capability has arisen as a result of new tactics, techniques and procedures used in austere, remote, and challenging environments in which stability operations, counterinsurgency operations and peace keeping missions are conducted.  This project integrates mature technologies to create mission specific lab demonstrators and evaluates the performance capabilities using metrics and methodologies developed under PE 0602786//Project VT4.   

Efforts in this program element support the Army science and technology Soldier portfolio.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element (PE) maturates and demonstrates advanced medical technologies including drugs, vaccines, medical devices, and diagnostics and developing medical practices and procedures to effectively protect and improve the survivability of US Forces across the entire spectrum of military operations.  Tri-Service coordination and cooperative efforts are focused in four principal medical areas: Combat Casualty Care, Military Operational Medicine, Militarily Relevant Infectious Diseases, and Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine. 
 
Promising medical technologies are refined and validated through extensive testing, which is closely monitored by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), as part of their processes for licensing new medical products.  The FDA requires medical products to undergo extensive preclinical testing in animals and/or other models to obtain preliminary efficacy and toxicity information before they can be tested in humans (clinical trials).  Clinical trials are conducted in three phases to prove the safety of a drug, vaccine, or device for the targeted disease or medical condition, starting in Phase 1 with a small number of healthy volunteers.  Each successive phase includes larger numbers of human subjects and requires FDA cognizance prior to proceeding.  Work conducted in this PE primarily focuses on late stages of technology maturation activities required to conduct Phase 2 human expanded safety and efficacy clinical trials. Some high risk technologies may require additional maturation with FDA guidance prior to initiating these clinical trials.  Such things as proof of product stability and purity are necessary to meet FDA standards before entering later stages of testing and prior to transitioning into a formal acquisition program and conducting Phase 3 trials for licensure.  Activities in the PE may include completion of preclinical animal studies and Phase 1 and 2 clinical studies involving human volunteers according to the FDA and EPA requirements.  Promising medical technologies that are not regulated by the FDA are modeled, prototyped, and tested in relevant environments.

Blast research efforts in this PE are fully coordinated with the United States Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center.  This coordination enables improved body armor design and rations for Soldiers.  Additionally, the activities funded in this PE are externally peer reviewed and fully coordinated with all Services as well as other agencies through the Joint Technology Coordinating Groups of the Armed Services Biomedical Research Evaluation and Management (ASBREM) Committee.  The ASBREM Committee serves to facilitate coordination and prevent unnecessary duplication of effort within DoD?s biomedical research and development community, as well as their associated enabling research areas.

Project 810 matures and demonstrates US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulated medical countermeasures such as drugs, vaccines, and diagnostic systems to naturally occurring infectious diseases and wound infections of military importance, as identified by worldwide medical surveillance and military threat analysis.  The project also supports testing of personal protective measures such as repellents and insecticides regulated by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). This project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Program.
Project 840 validates studies on safety and effectiveness of drugs, biologics (products derived from living organisms), medical devices and medical procedures intended to minimize immediate and long-term effects from battlefield injuries; advanced technology development and clinical studies for treatment of ocular and visual system traumatic injury; and restoration of function and appearance by regenerating skin, muscle, and bone tissue in battle-injured casualties.  Additionally, this project develops and realistically tests improved occupant protection systems through medical research to characterize mechanisms of injuries sustained by occupants of ground-combat vehicles subjected to underbody blast events, determine human tolerance limits to underbody blast forces, and develop tools to predict injuries to ground-combat vehicle occupants exposed to underbody blast forces.
Project FH4 matures, validates, and supports enhanced Force Health Protection of Soldiers against threats in military operations and training.  Health-monitoring tools are matured to rapidly identify deployment stressors that affect the health of Joint Forces.  These databases and systems enhance the Department of Defense's (DoD's) ability to monitor and protect against adverse changes in health, especially mental health effects caused by changes in brain function.  Force Health Protection work is conducted in close coordination with the Department of Veterans Affairs.  The program is maturing the development of global health monitoring (e.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project matures and demonstrates U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulated medical countermeasures such as drugs, vaccines, and diagnostic systems to naturally occurring infectious diseases that are threats to U.S. military deployed forces.  The focus of the program is on prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases that can adversely impact military mobilization, deployment, and operational effectiveness.  Prior to licensure of a new drug or vaccine to treat or prevent disease, the FDA requires testing in human subjects.  Studies are conducted stepwise: first to prove the product is safe in humans, second to demonstrate the desired effectiveness and optimal dosage in a small study, and third to demonstrate effectiveness in large, diverse human populations.  All test results are submitted to the FDA for evaluation to ultimately obtain approval (licensure) for medical use.  This project supports studies for safety and effectiveness testing on small study groups after which they transition to the next phase of development for completion of studies in larger populations.  The project also supports testing of personal protective measures that can reduce disease transmission from biting insects and other vectors to include products such as repellents and insecticides which are regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 
 
Research conducted in this project focuses on the following five areas: 
(1) Drugs to Prevent/Treat Parasitic (symbiotic relationship between two organisms) Diseases
(2) Vaccines for Preventing Malaria
(3) Bacterial Threats
(4) Viral Threats
(5) Diagnostics and Disease Transmission Control 
 
Research is conducted in compliance with FDA regulations for medical products for human use and EPA regulations for insect control products that impact humans or the environment (e.g., repellents and insecticides).

Work is managed by the Walter Reed Institute of Research (WRAIR), U.S. Army Medical Institute of Infectious Disease (USAMRIID), and coordinated with Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC).  The Army is responsible for programming and funding all DoD naturally occurring infectious disease research requirements, thereby precluding duplication of effort within the Military Departments.    

Promising medical countermeasures identified in this project are further matured under PE 0603807A, project 808.
 
The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.    
  
Work in this project is performed by the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring, MD, and its overseas laboratories; the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, Fort Detrick, MD; and the Naval Medical Research Center, Silver Spring, MD, and its overseas laboratories. 

Efforts in this project support the Soldier Portfolio and the principle area of Military Relevant Infectious Diseases.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>This one-year effort supports research to enable the Live-Fire Test and Evaluation (LFT&amp;E) community to conduct realistic survivability testing of ground-combat vehicles subjected to underbody blast (UBB) threats, with a primary emphasis on assessing potential occupant casualties, as well as to enable the development and testing of improved occupant protection systems.  UBB creates injurious forces on occupants of ground-combat vehicles that are more violent and that act in directions not normally encountered in civilian automotive accidents.  Injury prediction tools that were developed to assess occupant safety in automobile crashes are not adequate for assessing occupant survivability in ground-combat vehicles exposed to UBB threats.  Accurately predicting the spectrum of injuries caused by UBB forces in live-fire tests of ground-combat vehicles presents a unique challenge for the DoD.  A UBB medical research program is being initiated to understand the human tolerance limits and injury mechanisms needed to accurately predict injuries to ground-combat vehicle occupants caused by UBB events.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project matures, demonstrates, and supports enhanced force health protection of Soldiers against threats in military operations and training.  Health-monitoring tools are matured to rapidly identify deployment stressors that affect the health of Joint Forces.  These databases and systems enhance the Department of Defense's (DoD's) ability to monitor and protect against adverse changes in health, especially mental health effects caused by changes in brain function.  Force Health Protection work is conducted in close coordination with the Department of Veterans Affairs.  The program is maturing the development of global health monitoring (e.g., development of neuropsychological evaluation methodologies), and validating clinical signs and symptoms correlating to medical records, diagnosed diseases, and mortality rates.  The key databases supporting this program are the Millennium Cohort Study and the Total Army Injury and Health Outcomes Database.  These databases allow for the examination of interactions of psychological stress and other deployment and occupational stressors that affect Warfighter health behaviors.  

This project contains no duplication with any effort within the Military Departments and includes direct participation by other Services. The cited work is fully coordinated with Natick Soldier Research Development Engineering Command (NSRDEC), Natick, MA.

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. 

Work in this project is performed by the U.S. Army Center for Environmental Health Research (USACEHR), Fort Detrick, MD; the U.S. Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine (USARIEM), Natick, MA; and the Naval Health Research Center (NHRC), San Diego, CA.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project matures and demonstrates advanced technologies for future High Energy Laser (HEL) weapons technology.  The major effort under this project is the phased approach for mobile high power solid state laser (SSL) technology demonstrations that are traceable to the form, fit, and function requirements for a HEL weapon.  At entry level weapon power of around 10 kW, SSL technology has the potential to engage and defeat small caliber mortars, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), surface mines, sensors, and optics.  At full weapon system power levels of around 100 kW, SSL technology has the potential to engage and defeat rockets, artillery and mortars (RAM), UAVs, and anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs), as well as surface mines, sensors, and optics at tactically relevant ranges.  HELs are expected to complement conventional offensive and defensive weapons at a lower cost-per-shot than current systems and without the need to strategically, operationally, or tactically stockpile ordnance.  This effort utilizes a modular building block approach with open systems architecture to ensure growth, interoperability, and opportunity for technology insertions for maturation of laser, beam control, sensor/radar, integration of power and thermal management subsystems, as well as Battle Management Command, Control, and Computers (BMC3). 

This project supports Army science and technology efforts in the Ground portfolio.

                                    <r2:Description>This effort matures and integrates devices to protect occupant's eyes, vehicle cameras and electro-optic fire control systems against anti-sensor laser devices as well as reduce the sensor's optical signature. Anti-sensor laser devices can deny vision either temporarily or permanently, by flooding the sensor with too much light (jamming) or by damaging the sensor. These jamming or damaging effects can slow our battle tempo, disrupt fire control solutions, or prevent vehicles from completing their mission entirely. This effort focuses on optical systems that protect sensors to maintaining fire control capability, situational awareness and protect Warfighter vision from pulsed, continuous wave and future laser threats.

Currently, less than 1/3 of the total available energy from the fuel is converted into usable mechanical work (propulsion). This effort also researches and matures thermal management technologies and systems including heat energy recovery, propulsion and cabin thermal management sub-systems to utilize waste heat energy and meet objective power and mobility requirements on all ground vehicles. Lastly, this effort maximizes efficiencies within propulsion and thermal systems to reduce burden on the vehicle while providing the same or greater performance capability.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project matures, integrates, and demonstrates vehicle electronics hardware such as computers, sensors, communications systems, displays, and vehicle command/control/driving mechanisms as well as vehicle software to enhance crew performance, increase vehicle fuel efficiency, reduced Size, Weight, and Power (SWAP) burdens and reduce vehicle maintenance costs. This project also advances open system architectures (power and data) for military ground vehicles to enable common interfaces, standards and hardware implementations. Additionally this project matures integrated condition based maintenance technologies that reduce the operation and sustainment costs of vehicle electronics and electrical power devices. Technical challenges include: increased levels of automation for both manned and unmanned systems, secure data networks, interoperability of intra-vehicle systems, and advanced user interfaces. Overcoming these technical challenges enables improved and increased span of collaborative vehicle operations, efficient workload management, commander's decision aids, embedded simulation for battlefield visualization and fully integrated virtual test/evaluation.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project matures and demonstrates Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) technologies including sensor technologies, perception hardware and software, and robotic control technologies that enable UGV systems to maneuver on- and off-road at militarily significant speeds with minimal human intervention, thereby enabling the Soldier to perform other mission tasks. Challenges addressed include: obstacle avoidance, overcoming perception limitations, intelligent situational behaviors, command and control by Soldier operators, frequency of human intervention, operations in adverse weather, and robots protecting themselves and their surroundings from intruders. Mature technologies are incorporated in UGV technology demonstrators so that performance can be evaluated for tactical maneuver and sustainment applications.  

The approach builds upon, complements, and does not duplicate previous and ongoing investments conducted under the Joint Robotics Program Office, in program element (PE) 0602601A, project H91 (Ground Vehicle Technology) and by the Army Research Laboratory (ARL) PE 0602120A (Sensors and Electronic Survivability). 

Work in this project supports the Army S&amp;T Ground Portfolio.

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.  

Work in this project is performed by Tank Automotive Research, Development, and Engineering Center (TARDEC), Warren, MI, in collaboration with the Army Research Laboratory (ARL), Adelphi and Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This project element (PE) matures and demonstrates advanced behavioral and social science technologies that enhance performance to ensure that the Warfighter keeps pace with the transformations in systems, weapons, equipment, and mission requirements to meet the goals of the future force.  These technologies provide key capabilities through training methods and techniques that prepare Soldiers and leaders to effectively operate in complex digitized, networked environments; enable the use of embedded training technologies envisioned for future command and control (C2) systems; as well as foster cognitive, behavioral, and psychological flexibility, adaptability, and mission readiness.  Project 792 evaluates new selection measures, refines performance metrics, assesses innovative training techniques, and analyzes methods and tools to better adapt training to meet goals and requirements. Increased funding in FY12 for this PE is based on work shifted from PE 0602785A due to need for increased focus on maturation and demonstration of selection techniques and tools as well as training methods.

Work in this project complements and is fully coordinated with 0603015A (Next Generation Training &amp; Simulation Systems), 0602308A (Advanced Concepts and Simulation), PE 0602716A (Human Factors Engineering Technology) and PE 0602785A (Manpower/Personnel/Training Technology.)
The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy

Work in this PE is performed by the US Army Research Institute (ARI) for the Behavioral and Social Sciences in Arlington, VA.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project matures and demonstrates next generation training and simulation systems that integrate virtual threats, asymmetric warfare concepts, network-centric operations, and embedding training capabilities as well as technologies into operational go-to-war future force systems to include dismounted warrior systems.  The synergy between these embedded training capabilities and the immersive training advanced technology development in PE 060315/project S28 provides Army units with a set of complementary embedded as well as deploy-on-demand systems that provide just-in-time, dynamic, realistic training, and mission rehearsal capabilities.  Demonstrations include technologies that form a framework for future training applications for the range of future force operations such as robotic control and other sensor operations; mission planning and rehearsal; command, control, and maneuver; Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) network analysis to support distributed simulations; and vehicle system interface requirements.  This project creates a joint environment by synchronizing virtual and constructive simulated forces with the next generation and current training systems from the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine forces.   

Efforts in this program element support the Army science and technology Soldier portfolio.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project researches, matures, and demonstrates a distributed Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) environment referred to as the Modeling Architecture for Technology, Research, and Experimentation (MATREX).  MATREX researches and develops a robust M&amp;S environment wherein a collection of multi-fidelity models, simulations and tools can be integrated as well as mapped to an evolving architecture for conducting multi-scale (time and spatial resolution) M&amp;S activities to provide M&amp;S data and information to multiple users for decision-making.  MATREX provides a unifying M&amp;S architecture and supporting structure that synchronize and integrate multi-resolution (time and space) modeling applications such as Live, Virtual, and Constructive experimentation.  It also exploits applications, operational studies of Network-Centric Operations concepts and technologies, or the modeling of Battle Command operations with elements of advanced communications, information flow, data fusion, decision-making, and information warfare.  MATREX also works to address M&amp;S issues of model scalability, network design, enterprise services, and third party software compatibility issues.  MATREX ultimately comprises a portfolio of one or more year's efforts focused on researching cutting edge M&amp;S methods to enable the Army and DoD to perform critical System of Systems (SoS) analysis, experimentation, technology tradeoffs, capability assessments, concept development, testing, and training. 
 
Funding increase in FY13 reflects the use of MATREX to support development of enterprise architectures for holistic modeling and simulation of dismounted soldier protection, lethality with cognitive and physical performance.

Efforts in this program element support the Army science and technology Soldier portfolio.

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element (PE) matures and demonstrates advanced technology of candidate human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) vaccines, prepares and conducts human clinical studies to assess safety and efficacy of candidate HIV vaccines, conducts research to control HIV infection in military environments, protects the military blood supply from HIV, and protects military personnel from risks associated with the HIV infection.  All HIV technology development activities are conducted in compliance with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations.  FDA requires thorough testing in animal models (preclinical testing) to ensure safety and efficacy prior to approving controlled clinical evaluation of drugs, vaccines, and medical devices in humans.  Normally, clinical trials are conducted in three phases to prove safety and effectiveness of the drug, vaccine, and device for the targeted disease or condition.  An increasing number of test subjects are used in each subsequent phase.  All results are submitted to FDA for evaluation to ultimately obtain approval (licensure) for routine medical use.  This program is jointly managed through an Interagency Agreement by the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (MRMC), the National Institutes of Health, and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).

This project contains no duplication with any effort within the Military Departments or other government organizations.   
 
Work is fully coordinated with work funded in program element PE 0602787A, project 873 (HIV Exploratory Research). 
 
The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project funds research to develop candidate human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) vaccines, assess their safety and effectiveness in evaluation with human subjects, and protect the military personnel from risks associated with HIV infection.  In addition, it is designed to find ways to protect the blood supply from contamination with the virus.  All HIV technology development is conducted in compliance with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations.  Evaluations in human subjects are conducted to demonstrate safety and effectiveness of candidate vaccines, as required by FDA regulation.  Studies are conducted stepwise: first, to prove safety; second, to demonstrate the desired effectiveness of the drug, vaccine, or device for the targeted disease or condition in a small study; and third, to demonstrate effectiveness in large, diverse human population trials.  All results are submitted to the FDA for evaluation to ultimately obtain approval (licensure) for medical use.  This project supports studies for effectiveness testing on small study groups after which they transition to the next phase of development for completion of effectiveness testing in larger populations.  

This program is jointly managed through an Interagency Agreement by the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (MRMC) and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).  This project contains no duplication with any effort within the Military Departments or other government organizations.

Work is fully coordinated with work funded in program element PE 0602787A, project 873 (HIV Exploratory Research) are further matured under PE 0603807A, project 811.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project demonstrates technologies with high payoff potential to address current technology shortfalls or future force capability gaps. Efforts include hybrid electric power technologies to reduce use of fossil fuel generators and identifying, accelerating, and improving rapidly deployable force protection technologies to enable troops at small, remote bases or integrated in with local communities (e.g., villages) to detect, assess,and defend against a range of enemy threats since they generally do not have the organic assetts or levels of protection like that at larger bases.  

This project supports the Command Control and Communications and Ground portfolios. Work in this project is complementary to and is fully coordinated with PE 0602105A (Materials Technology), PE 0602303A (Missile Technology), PE 0602601A (Combat Vehicle and Automotive Technology), PE 0602618A (Ballistics Technology), PE 0602705A (Electronics and Electronic Devices), PE 0602784A (Military Engineering Technology), 0603005A (Combat Vehicle and Automotive Advanced Technology), PE 0603710A (Night Vision Advanced Technology), and PE 0603734A (Military Engineering Advanced Technology).

Possible demonstration scenario: an individual EW asset acquires three threat signals but is only able to address and defeat one of them due to constraints (e.g., power, bandwidth, or etc.). Because all three detections are reported to the network, other EW assets can address and defeat the two outstanding signals.</r2:Text>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element (PE) demonstrates and provides high performance computing hardware, parallel software, wide area networking services, and expertise that enable the Department of Defense (DoD) Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) community to investigate and understand physical phenomena and behavior of systems through large scale computational simulation. DoD users of these services work in a diverse variety of science and technology areas including structural mechanics, fluid dynamics, material science, chemistry, biology, electromagnetics and acoustics, weather, ocean modeling, signal/image processing, forces modeling and simulation, environmental quality, electronics/networking/systems/C4I, and space and astrophysical sciences.  The computational expertise and resources (massively parallel, networked, multi-core computers, advanced software applications and secure connectivity) provided by this Program enable DoD researchers and engineers to analyze complex problems and phenomena and develop novel solutions using state-of-the-art, physics-based and discrete event simulations.  The combined capabilities of the HPC centers and the Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN) enable massive calculations to be completed more efficiently and at reduced cost than if each DoD research organization were to duplicate the necessary resources. For example, DoD personnel use High Performance Modernization Program (HPCMP) resources to do such things as improve the performance of manned and unmanned aircraft, validate design concepts and establish expected performance of new armor and penetrator designs, speed the development of new ship designs, and demonstrate the viability of weapons systems performance. The HPCMP supports the requirements of DoD scientists and engineers in three major areas of effort: DoD Supercomputing Resource Centers (DSRCs), the Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN), and support for software applications. Dedicated HPC project investments (DHPIs) augment the DSRCs to form the total HPCMP computational capability. In 2011 the HPCMP provided approximately 1.4 billion processor hours to a user community representing requirements from all three services and the agencies of the DoD. The bulk of this capability is provided via 14 supercomputers (including systems for classified processing) located in the 5 DSRCs across the country providing a total of approximately 180,000 processors and 1.8 quadrillion floating point operations per second (1.8 petaFLOPS). DoD users store their results in 16 petabytes (16,000,000,000,000 bytes) of storage archival distributed across the centers and duplicated for backup (for a total storage capability of 32 petabytes). The DREN interconnects HPCMP resources and users nationwide via a research infrastructure that provides an aggregate network capacity of 25 billion bits per second to 36 user sites, 5 DSRCs, and 4 smaller affiliated resource centers (ARCs). Individual user site speeds range from 45 to 622 million bits per second, ARC speeds range from 155 to 2488 million bits per second, and DSRC speeds range from 622 to 3110 million bits per second. Mission-critical DoD applications across the spectrum of DoD activities are supported by the software component of the Program through training in advanced computational methods, the development of productive application development environments, tools, and methodologies, and through the direct provision of computational scientists and engineers to improve the performance, accuracy, and relevance of physics-based computational models.

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

The HPCMP transferred from the Office Secretary of Defense to the Department of the Army in FY12.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project enables the Defense research, development, test and evaluation (RDT&amp;E) community to resolve critical scientific and engineering problems more quickly, and with more precision, using advanced, physics-based computer simulation supported by high performance computing (HPC) technology. The computational expertise and resources enable DoD personnel to analyze phenomena that are often impossible, not cost effective, too time-consuming, or too dangerous to study any other way.  The High Performance Modernization Program (HPCMP) supports the requirements of the DoD's scientists and engineers in three major areas of effort: supercomputing resource centers, the Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN), and support for software applications. DoD Supercomputing Resource Centers (DSRCs) provide extensive capabilities and demonstrate new technologies that address user requirements for hardware, software, and programming environments. Efforts of the DSRCs are augmented by dedicated HPC project investments (DHPIs) that address near real-time and real-time HPC requirements. The total aggregate computational capability is roughly 1.8 quadrillion floating point operations per second (1.8 petaFLOPS); this capability is expected to double by 2013. All sites in the HPC Modernization Program are interconnected to one another, the user community, and major defense sites via the DREN, a research network which matures and demonstrates state of the art computer network technologies. The DREN interconnects 45 user and center sites at network speeds of up to 3 gigabits per second. The Software Application Support (SAS) effort optimizes and improves the performance of critical common DoD applications programs to run efficiently on advanced HPC systems, matures and demonstrates leading-edge computational technology from academic and commercial partners, and provides collaborative programming environments.     

Work in this project supports the Army S&amp;T Enduring Portfolio.

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

The HPCMP transferred from the Office Secretary of Defense to the Department of the Army in FY12.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This increase in computing capability will be supported by an expected increase in storage capability to over 60 petabytes (60,000,000,000,000 bytes). This expansion in computational capacity will be supported by advanced computational expertise that will ensure the resources are available and configured to support the DoD's most challenging problems, provide analysis of the massive and complex datasets resulting from the simulations, and develop optimized applications for rapidly evolving computer technology.</r2:Text>

                                    <r2:Description>This effort matures, fabricates and evaluates lab demonstrators based on two different technologies to improve dismounted forces' capability to detect IEDs and landmines. This effort develops an illumination capability and modifies target detection algorithms for integration into current prototype digital goggles. This will be a helmet mounted capability to aid the dismounted forces as they execute route clearance missions by improving detection of command initiation wires, trip wires, and indicators of IED emplacement such as disturbed earth. A next generation handheld explosive hazard detector technology will also be developed and matured with improved IED detection capabilities and SWaP characteristics.  The next generation handheld detector technology may be inserted into the current AN/PSS-14 Mine Detector as an upgrade or may be a new handheld detector.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>This effort demonstrates caseless and case telescoped ammunition technologies for specific weapon systems and missions with goals to reduce the weapon and ammo weight, and to reduce training and maintenance costs.  Cased telescoped ammunition is a 100% polymer cylindrical shaped case, inside of which are the projectile (i.e., telescoped inward) and the propellant, with a standard mechanical primer located at the base.   The caseless cartridge also uses a telescoped bullet arrangement. A specialized High Ignition Temperature Propellant (HITP) provides not only the propulsive energy, but also serves as the cartridge structure and exterior surface.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>FY 11 Increase attributed to Congressional addition of 23.1 million of Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding for Aviation Night and Limited Visibility Sensor Demonstration</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element (PE) matures and demonstrates sensor technologies that increase Warfighter survivability and lethality by providing sensor capabilities to acquire and engage targets at longer ranges in complex environments and operational conditions (e.g. day/night, obscured, smoke, adverse weather).  Project K70 pursues technologies that improve the Soldier's ability to see at night, provide rapid wide area search, multispectral aided target detection (AiTD), and enable passive long range target identification (ID beyond threat detection) in both an air and ground test-beds. Project K86 matures and evaluates sensors and algorithms designed to detect targets (vehicles and personnel) in camouflage, concealment and deception from airborne platforms, and provides pilotage and situational awareness imagery to multiple pilots/crew members independently for enhanced crew/aircraft operations in day/night/adverse weather conditions.  

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.  

Work in this PE is fully coordinated with efforts in PE 0602120A (Sensors and Electronic Survivability), PE 0602270A (Electronic Warfare Technology), PE 0602709A (Night Vision and Electro-Optics Technology), PE 0602712A (Countermine Systems), PE 0603001A (Warfighter Advanced Technology), PE 0603003A (Aviation Advanced Technology), PE 0603005A (Combat Vehicle and Automotive Advanced Technology), PE 0603606A (Landmine Warfare and Barrier Advanced Technology), PE 0603774A (Night Vision Systems Advanced Development) and PE 0604710A (Night Vision Systems Engineering Development).

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element (PE) matures and demonstrates technologies that assist Army installations in becoming environmentally compatible without compromising readiness or training critical to the success of the future force.  Project 002 demonstrates tools and methods for compliance with environmental laws by control, treatment, and disposal of hazardous waste products; and conservation of natural and cultural resources while providing a realistic environment for mission activities. Project 025 demonstrates pollution prevention tools and methods to minimize the Army's use and generation of toxic chemicals and hazardous wastes.  Project 03E focuses on restoration of sites contaminated with toxic and/or hazardous materials (such as unexploded ordnance) resulting from Army operations. This program demonstrates technological feasibility, assesses the technology as well as its producibility, and transitions mature technologies from the laboratory to the user.  Technologies developed by this program element improve the ability of the Army to achieve environmental restoration and compliance at its installations, at active/ inactive ranges and other training lands, and at its rework as well as production facilities.  Technologies demonstrated focus on reducing the cost of treating hazardous effluents and remediating Army sites contaminated by hazardous/toxic material.    

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy and supports the Army Strategy for the Environment.  

This program is fully coordinated and complementary to PE 0602720A (Environmental Quality Technology).

Work in this PE is performed by the US Army Engineer Research and Development Center, Vicksburg, MS, and the US Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project matures and demonstrates technologies transitioned from PE 0602720A (Environmental Quality Technology), Projects 048 and 896, that assist Army installations in achieving environmental compliance.  These technologies reduce the cost of treating hazardous effluents from Army installations, including forward operating bases, to satisfy increasingly stringent waste, wastewater and air pollutant discharge requirements.  Army facilities are subject to fines and facility shutdowns for violation of federal, state, and local environmental regulations.  This technology is essential to control and reduce the generation of waste to satisfy hazardous waste reduction goals and to avoid future environmental costs as well as liabilities to the Army.  Efforts under this project enable the Army to reduce environmental constraints at installations while complying with the myriad of federal, state, and host country environmental regulations and policy.  Technologies demonstrated also reduce the cost of resolving training noise compliance issues for the Army, avoid reductions in availability of training facilities, and sustain the viability of testing and training ranges as well as protect the critical resources, i.e., land, air, and waters of the Army.

Advanced development activities address the management/mitigation of materials released to the natural environment and residual environmental effects of military training and operations.  The emphasis of this effort includes restoration of legacy materials, e.g., traditional explosives energetics, and unexploded ordinance; management of new materials, e.g., nanomaterials and emerging contaminants; and mitigation of residual impacts from implementation of sustainable technologies and processes.  Technologies matured within this project enable the Army to cost effectively address current and future environmental liabilities resulting from the use of militarily relevant materials in the environment and implementation of the new family of sustainable technologies for energy production.  Current and planned efforts enable the Army to efficiently characterize, evaluate, assess, and remediate soil and water at installations, ranges, facilities, and during operations in the face of changing weather and climatic conditions.  Efforts also identify ways to economically comply with the myriad of federal, state, and host country regulations dealing with contaminated soil and water.  A key aspect of this work is the enhancement of risk assessment and life cycle analysis techniques that can more accurately display the environmental liabilities associated with fielding new systems and technologies.  This program includes pilot scale field studies to establish technological feasibility and assess performance and productivity of the risk assessment techniques.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project matures and demonstrates software and architectures for geospatial mapping applications and decision aids for the Warfighter; components, systems, system of systems and decision aids to enable ground vehicle mobility (freedom of movement), including force projection, countermobility to impede movement of threat forces; survivability and force protection to protect personnel, facilities and assets through design and reinforcement of structures, and deployable force protection to detect, assess, and defend against threats for troops deployed at smaller bases (such as bases being compromised or overrun). Work is in support of current and future ground force operations.  Software and architectures for geospatial projects mature and validate geospatial decision tools in support of operations planning and decision making to advance utility for geospatial capability and techniques across the Army, services and coalition and to advance and mature the information architecture that supports the total Army's discovery and access to data, geospatial information and analytical tool suites.  Deployable Force Protection (DFP) activities are focused on filling critical gaps in protecting forces operating at smaller, remote bases and include maturation, integration, and demonstration of components, systems and systems of systems for rapidly deployable threat detection in direct line-of-site and non-line-of-site environments; situation assessment to help reduce false alarms and decrease manpower required to monitor the environment; passive protection to mitigate blasts, direct, and indirect fire effects; and active defense to suppress or eliminate threats and threat systems.  Work in survivability and force protection also includes maturing and demonstrating software to characterize blast effects generated from explosive events, such as improvised explosive device detonation in soils, and support design and decision aids.  Work in mobility and force projection includes maturing and demonstrating software and hardware to assess and improve freedom of movement for ground forces.

                                    <r2:Description>This effort matures, integrates and demonstrates rapidly deployable threat detection, situation assessment, passive protection and active defensive technology-enabled capabilities to meet critical capability gaps for troops operating remotely at smaller bases or integrated with local communities. The needs at these smaller bases (less than 300 persons, not all U.S. troops) are unique based on constraints in transportability, manpower, organic resources, lack of hardening of structures, resupply, and training for example. Moreover, lack of interoperability and scaleability consume manpower and take away from time needed to perform missions. Threats include bases being overrun by hostiles; direct fire; rockets, artillery and mortars; and improvised explosive devices. Force protection challenges at these remote, smaller bases include providing increased standoff detection, blast and ballistic protection, and kinetic technologies subject to the constraints mentioned above.  This effort begins to fill a significant gap in force protection capabilities. This work is fully coordinated with PE0602784A/T40, Deployable Force Protection; PE 0602786A; PE0603313A/G03; and PE 0603125A.
