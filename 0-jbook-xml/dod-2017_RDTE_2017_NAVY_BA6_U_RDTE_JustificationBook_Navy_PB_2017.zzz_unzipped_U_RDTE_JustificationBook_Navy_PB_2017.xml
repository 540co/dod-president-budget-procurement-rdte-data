                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The objective of this project is development of necessary simulation facilities and approaches to allow determination of the effectiveness of Electronic Warfare (EW) in real world engagement situations and to support the introduction of modern, effective systems into Naval Aviation. The heavy use of test resources by all Services demonstrates the importance of these assets. The Navy has been very successful in executing all of its major programs, and to date has had no major technical problems.

The Electronic Warfare Environment Simulation project is unique because it is the only program within the Department of Defense which develops and provides Naval anti-air warfare threat assets for Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E).

This project directly supports the T&amp;E resource requirements for all Naval Air EW development programs, to include multi-spectral situational awareness and countermeasures. Programs in development and future programs include: ALR-67(v) 3, Integrated Defensive Electronic Countermeasures Suite ALQ-214, the AAR-47 (v) 3, AVR-2, ALQ-144A, Joint Strike Fighter, EA-18G, LR700, Low Band Transmitter, P-8A, and the Next Generation Jammer.

This project provides for the development of an Integrated Air Defense T&amp;E capability to be fielded at each of the three sites comprising the Navy's Tri-Center complex: Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, China Lake and Point Mugu in CA, and Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Patuxent River, MD.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Funding decrease from FY15 to FY16 because the majority of material purchases for radio frequency beam measurement capability are complete. 

Funding decrease from FY16 to FY17 due to the completion of the laboratory simulators of foreign radars upgrades and the
remaining material purchases for radio frequency beam measurement capability are complete and system integration and test is under way.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The objective of the Effectiveness of Navy Electronic Warfare (EW) Systems (ENEWS) Project is the development and application of necessary simulation assets to determine the effectiveness of EW for Navy ships in simulated real-world engagement situations.  The project primarily supports the introduction of modern, effective shipboard and off-board EW systems, and tactics for the Surface Navy.  The heavy use of ENEWS resources by Naval Sea Systems Command, Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&amp;E) Force, Special Operations, and other EW Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) agencies speaks to the overall importance of this project.  The project provides support for EW system design, Engineering Test (ET), Development Test (DT), Operational Test (OT), and the development of utilization tactics.  In the past ENEWS quick reaction capabilities have had great impact on crisis situations such as the Libyan crises, Iran threat, Persian Gulf crisis, and Operation Desert Shield/Storm.  Simulation Display (SIMDIS) is an ENEWS modeling tool that was developed to support T&amp;E.  SIMDIS has been adopted by most Department of Defense (DoD) T&amp;E and training ranges to provide visualization of T&amp;E and training scenarios.  One of the primary threats to surface ships is Anti-Ship Capable Missile systems.  The ENEWS Project is unique in that it is the only project within DoD dedicated to developing and providing realistic Anti-Ship Capable Missile assets to test and evaluate the effectiveness of shipboard EW systems and tactics against these type threats.  The ENEWS Project is a critical part of the Office of the Secretary of Defense Test Resource Master Plan.  This plan employs many of the ENEWS assets for planning, analysis, testing, and verification of shipboard and off-board EW systems techniques and tactics.  As part of its normal activities, ENEWS provides Development Test and Evaluation (DT&amp;E), OT&amp;E, and Follow-on Operational Test and Evaluation (FOT&amp;E) support to the surface Navy for all ship classes.  DT, OT and FOT&amp;E support includes AN/SLQ-32 Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program (SEWIP),  Nulka, Rapid Anti-ship Integrated Defense System, all MK245 Giant tests, advanced InfraRed (IR) decoys, decoy placement, ship IR signature and radar cross section measurement of DDG-51, LPD-17, DD-21 and PC class ships, High Power Microwave program, and other ship self-defense initiatives, including T&amp;E of Future Naval Capability process.  In addition, ENEWS assets are regularly employed to test the effectiveness of North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) ships' EW systems in joint allied exercises. ENEWS assets also support Joint EW exercises that are conducted with Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) nations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Provide technical management functions in support of the ENEWS project; engineering and technical support requirements for the ASCM simulators and upgrades to meet DT/ OT testing requirements, development of detailed test resource requirements and provides an interface between OPNAV N2/N6, Office of Naval Research, and ENEWS oversight activities.

The decrease between FY 2015 and FY 2016 is due to the termination of the simulator validation effort. Beginning in FY 2015 the simulator validation effort was terminated and no more validation reports will be published. ENEWS will continue to develop simulator documentation reports that will include a simulator description with a comparison to the threat it represents.

Formerly know as "SIMULATION VALIDATION AND REQUIREMENTS" is now titled "SIMULATION CHARACTERIZATION, VERIFICATION AND REQUIREMENTS" effective FY 2017.</r2:Description>

                <r2:SummaryExplanation>Decrease in Target Systems Development by $1.500M as required for the Department of the Navy to comply with the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015.  

FY15 was increased by a $0.862 million to GQM-173A Multi-Stage Supersonic Target (MSST) as additional funds were required to support the GQM-173A RDTEN range extension activities for integration of a new booster intended to significantly reduce technical and schedule risk in Development Testing efforts. 

In FY16, Aerial Target System Development  was decreased by $37.4M for termination of the MSST program and ASW Target was reduced by $4.054M for Parrotfish program termination. All associated MSST investment funding has been removed from Aerial Target System Development in FY 2017 ($56.025M) and future years for the program termination by the Department of the Navy.  

In FY17 Wpn Sys T&amp;E Trng Dev/Proc (Full-Scale Aerial Target (FSAT) QF-16 and FSAT/QF-4 programs) was reduced by $6.4 million for underexecution &amp; ASW Target was reduced by $1.505 million to cancel the program.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The mission of the Aerial Target Systems Development program is the design and development of threat representative subsonic and supersonic aerial targets that simulate threat weapon systems.  In addition to representative air vehicles, this includes development of Target Control (TC) systems, and associated Target Augmentation and Auxiliary Systems (TA/AS) which are used to replicate specific threats.  Targets are developed to support test and evaluation of combat systems required to defend fleet surface and air units in a hostile environment. As to specific hardware development, this project includes:

 - Supersonic Targets: GQM-163A Supersonic Sea-Skimming Target (SSST) and GQM-173A Multi-Stage Supersonic Target (MSST) . Supersonic targets represent supersonic anti-ship cruise missile threats. The design and development of GQM-163A SSST capabilities provide threat representative targets that are used in direct support of Developmental Test and Evaluation, Operational Test and Evaluation, and Live Fire Test and Evaluation of major combat weapons programs and, to a lesser degree, support fleet training. GQM-163A is a non-recoverable supersonic sea skimming aerial target, capable of speeds in excess of Mach 2.5 and cruise altitudes from 15 to 66 ft. The GQM-163A has also demonstrated a capability to perform a higher altitude diving threat profile. Funding is also provided for closing out the GQM-173A MSST development effort.

 - Subsonic Targets: BQM-177A Subsonic Aerial Target (SSAT) development primarily represents subsonic anti-ship cruise missile threats, replacing legacy BQM-34 and BQM-74 targets with a modernized subsonic target with increased capabilities. The BQM-177A SSAT provides threat representation for developmental and operational Test &amp; Evaluation events of major combat weapons systems programs and in support of fleet training events. Specifically, the BQM-177A provides critical live-fire Test and Evaluation events for AEGIS, SM-6, SM-2, RAM, and ESSM.

 - TTSP and TC and TA/AS development: The Target Threat Simulation Program (TTSP) provides the payload equipment required to electronically enhance aerial/surface targets to provide threat representative Radio Frequency signatures, specifically the Electronic Attack and Threat Radar Emissions (Active Emitters). TC provides command and control of targets to enable the execution of threat-representative mission profiles. The mission also includes the design, development and qualification of various Target Mission Support Systems including but not limited to: Scalar Scorers, Scoring Ground Station, Telemetry Antennas, Radar and Locator Beacons, Identification, Friend or Foe, and associated Test Sets. TA/AS enables each target to be uniquely configured for specific mission profiles and provide high fidelity simulation of foreign threats. TA/AS-configured targets are used for radar acquisition test, electronic countermeasures (jamming) evaluation, infrared measurement and testing, radar cross section evaluation, decoy-effectiveness testing, maneuver analysis, electronic warfare evaluation, warhead-effectiveness testing and evaluation of fleet tactics. TA/AS scoring capabilities include both surface and airborne scalar and vector scoring systems. 

In addition to the design and development of target hardware and software, funding supports studies performed by a University Affiliated Research Center (UARC) to specify and verify needed target performance for future target development. For the design and validation of targets under development, the UARC will provide engineering studies in areas such as structures, controls, guidance, and propulsion. For those hardware and software items presently under development by commercial vendors, the UARC will provide oversight and validation of vendor design and development approach.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides for the development and procurement of aerial targets and associated systems used exclusively for test and evaluation of naval weapons systems which closely represent current and projected threats to fleet units in the joint strike and the littoral warfare environments. These representations must include characteristics related to size, performance envelope, and electromagnetic and infrared signatures. As threats change, changes must be made to keep the targets threat representative in response to changes in the test requirements of the developers of naval weapons systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

These sonar and torpedo systems are being fielded on the P-8, SH-60R, and AN/SQQ-89 capable surface ships and the MK54 Mod 0 and MK48 Mod 7 Torpedoes. Dynamically the target needs to emulate both low and high speed ends of threat submarines performance envelope to provide required training realism.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports detailed mission, capability, and technical analysis of future naval warfighting requirements.  This work provides the analytical basis for integration and prioritization of overall military capability requirements and acquisition programs in support of executing the Naval Capability Development Process and development/delivery of Mission Capability Packages, Naval Capability Packages, and Integrated Strategic Capability Plans for Chief of Naval Operations. The Resource Allocation Model (RAM) is an analytic Portfolio Management Methodology used to aid Navy leadership with both investment and divestment programming decisions. This methodology provides an assessment process that fosters informed, understandable, repeatable investment decisions with consistent, pedigreed, and retrievable information. The focus of this work adds fidelity to the system through the inclusion of Mission Technical Baselines and Integrated Capabilities Technical Baselines data to identify program of record integration and interoperability dependencies to inform investment/divestment decisions. It provides leadership and resource sponsors with a starting point for their offset decision process as well as an issue ranking capability. RAM will include linkage of programs to strategic imperatives, programs mapped to warfare areas, program interdependencies annotated, and balance factors that can be adjusted to reflect Navy Leadership Priorities. The effort expands on Portfolio Management Decision Support System by capturing and mapping issues/funding adjustments, and providing a system capable of identifying fiscal interdependencies and consideration to risk in order to increase accuracy in calculating programmatic risk.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Chief of Naval Personnel has a continuing need for studies and analysis of Manpower and Personnel (M&amp;P) policies and programs and critical M&amp;P issues that have Navy-wide implications.  This project provides an essential management tool to: (a) assess the effectiveness of existing M&amp;P policies and programs; (b) identify needs for new policies and programs; (c) determine the required manpower and training mix relative to changing demographic, societal and legislative/regulatory actions, and to evolving strategic and geopolitical factors; (d) study the impact of M&amp;P programs on Navy accession, attrition, retention, and performance; and, (e) to develop, validate and/or refine a broad range of M&amp;P forecasting models. The program permits Navy to more effectively utilize Research and Development expertise to respond to emergent M&amp;P issues on a continuing basis.  This program is funded under RDT&amp;E operational systems development because it encompasses engineering and development of new end-items prior to production approval decision.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>This PE provides funding to support continuing need for studies and analysis of issues critical to decisions required by the Chief of Naval Personnel and his staff regarding manpower, personnel, training and education policies, and programs that have far-reaching implications to service members and the Navy budget.  This PE supports research of both Naval Postgraduate School faculty and students, and in FY10 began the formulation of focused economic research, to include behavioral economics.  This focus will provide continuing analysis and research to facilitate the data gathering and synthesis to provide consistent and timely update to economic indicators to use in the numerous models that support management decisions within the MPTE arena that have significant impact on the efficient use of the nearly $27B Manpower &amp; Personnel, Navy budget.  The economic research will consolidate the data necessary to perform elasticity estimations and maintain this data for subsequent estimations.  To gather the data necessary to perform such estimations, would conservatively cost more than $300K on each such occasion.  The MPTE enterprise uses dozens of models, most of which require elasticity updates.  Consolidating the data repository to support this analysis will result in a cost avoidance of more than $1M and this does not include any of the actual model revisions.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Funding supports Naval aviation pre-Milestone B developmental activities to include the conduct and integration of systems engineering activities. This project unit provides information, automated tools, and decision aids necessary to perform acquisition planning in support of warfighter capability requirements. This project unit also supports research, development, and analysis efforts to include various studies, joint requirements analysis, and cost analysis requirements in support of systems engineering activities, analyses of alternatives, and development of the 30-Year Aviation Plan a Congressionally mandated product. Due to high turnover and end of service life of several Naval aircraft set against increasing threat capabilities, DOD 5000 series mandates documentation of capability requirements and mechanisms to obtain these capabilities. This project unit allows Naval aviation the means to properly identify capability gaps and potential solutions required to maintain maximum warfighting capability realizing (or achieving) reductions to technical risks and overall program costs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Center for Naval Analyses (CNA) is the Department of the Navy's (DoN) only Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC). CNA provides independent, objective, and expert analyses based on its unique access to sensitive data and hands-on exposure to fleet operations gained through its world-wide field program. CNA's research program is centrally funded by this program element and is primarily concentrated along one Marine Corps category and thirteen Navy categories of study called product areas. These product areas are structured to enhance CNA's focus of research and analysis upon the major present and future needs and issues of the Navy and the Marine Corps. Because of rapid advances in technology, changes in the fleet, the increasing complexity of weapon systems, and reductions in manpower, force structure, budgets, the current security environment, and Department of Defense (DoD) transformation, the Navy and Marine Corps have a greater need for analyses that are sophisticated, relevant, and timely. CNA conducts research and analysis at all security classification levels, to include Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) and Special Access Programs (SAP).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

- Continued support current operations to include: weapons and systems programs, MAGTF training and exercise assessments, amphibious shipping capabilities, and reductions to naval operations and strategic commitments.  Analysis and solutions relating to support and sustainment in terms of equipment readiness, training, responsiveness and maintaining squadron readiness, development of facilities sustainment and service life programs save the Marine Corps valuable time and resources.  Manpower, force structure, aviation recruiting and retention, and valuations of recruiting, retaining and retiring Marines analyses provide viable personnel solutions in times of shrinking resources.  Intelligence capabilities assessments, analyses of threat assessments from known and unknown enemies, i.e. Al-Qaeda, Northern Africa and Iran, and Joint Irregular Warfare Analytic Baseline (JIWAB) development provide valuable information to assist Marine Corps Intelligence organizations in keeping the force educated and safe.
- Initiated high priority study and analysis projects approved in FY15 Marine Corps Studies System Management Plan (MCSSMP).
- Initiated research analysis, and survey support efforts associated with development and implantation of the Marine Forces Integration Plan (MCFIP) Women in Infantry.</r2:Text>

The Marine Corps' portion of the CNA program is executed via the Marine Corps Studies System (MCSS) Annual Plan which is reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis. The MCSS maintains a comprehensive listing of all CNA studies performed for the Marine Corps.  The MCSS ensures there are no duplicate analytical efforts within the Marine Corps.  Additionally, the Operations Analysis Division of Combat Integration Division (CD&amp;I, MCCDC) provides analytical review of all CNA products for the Marine Corps and integrates the results and recommendations into a quarterly newsletter for research and analysis.  

Other evaluation processes are as follows: 
A) Contract Status Meetings: The Marine Corps participates in contract status meetings. The Contracting Officer chairs monthly meetings with the Marine Corps, and members of the CNA Business Support Group to provide guidance regarding contract management to include reviewing the Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC) database requirements to emphasize the contractual requirement that all ongoing research be submitted to DTIC to ensure against duplication to reviewing CNA's cost effectiveness and efficiency.

B) Marine Corps Three-Star Flag Officer Review: The Commanding General, CD&amp;I, MCCDC and the Director, Operations Analysis Division (OAD) frequently to review the current research program and provide guidance to CNA regarding future research requirements. Meetings are essential to provide CNA to ensure that research conducted is of the greatest value to the Marine Corps. The meetings serve as a roadmap for future projects. The Marine Corps' research plan is consolidated with the DoN's Annual Plan that is submitted to the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Integration of Capabilities and Resources (N8) for final review and acceptance.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>CNA is reviewed throughout the research year on several different levels to ensure that research produced is not duplicated elsewhere. The primary (and most effective) method of review for duplication is the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) review and approval of each and every project proposal submitted by CNA. This method is highly effective in providing the necessary oversight to ensure that duplication of effort does not occur. The Marine Corps Studies System (MCSS) maintains a comprehensive listing of all CNA studies performed for the USMC. The MCSS ensures that there are no duplicate analytical efforts within the USMC. Additionally, the Studies and Analysis Division of the Marine Corps Combat Development Command (MCCDC) provides analytical review of all CNA products for the USMC and integrates the results and recommendations into a quarterly newsletter and an annual plan for research and analysis. 
Other evaluation processes: 
A) DoN Contract Status Meetings: As part of the CNA oversight process, the Office of Naval Research Contracting Officer chairs a monthly meeting with the COTR, the USMC, and the CNA's Chief Financial Office to provide guidance regarding contract management. 

B) Two-Star Flag Officers and VCNO Corporate Board Meetings: DoN Two-Star and their equivalent civilian counterparts meet several times a year to review the current fiscal year's research and provide guidance to CNA regarding their future research for DoN. These high level meetings are essential to provide CNA with DoN's guidance to ensure that the research conducted is of the greatest value to DoN. The meetings also serve as the catalyst for the formation of the CNA Annual Plan, CNA's roadmap for research during the upcoming fiscal year. The CNA Annual Plan is then submitted to VCNO/N8 for final review and acceptance. 

C) CNA Comprehensive Review: Prior to contract renewal, CNA, as an Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC), must be evaluated to ensure that the DoN wants to renew CNA's contract for an additional five year period. DoN completes an exhaustive review of sponsors' technical needs and mission requirements; DoN's consideration of other sources; CNA's efficiency and effectiveness; CNA's management and cost effectiveness; as well as the FFRDC establishment criteria and sponsorship agreement. The CNA Comprehensive Review is approved by ASN (RDA) and accepted by OSD (AT&amp;L).</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Small Business Research and Development Reauthorization Act of 2011 as amended (15 U.S.C. 638) requires each Federal agency that has an extramural budget for R/R&amp;D inexcess of $100,000,000 must participate and shall expend with small business concerns (SBC) not less than 2.6% in FY 2012 for specific small business research initiatives awarded
through a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) solicitation. For FY 2013 through FY 2016 this increases annually by 0.1% and in FY 2017 increases by 0.2%. The Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program requires each Federal agency that has an extramural budget for R&amp;D in excess of $1,000,000,000 to set aside 0.35% for STTR in FY 2012, and increases 0.05% every two years beginning in FY 2012 through FY 2016.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program requires each Federal agency that has an extramural budget for R&amp;D in excess of $100,000,000 to set aside 2.9% for SBIR in FY 2015.  This funds  Research and Development (R&amp;D) at small businesses.  The program goals are to stimulate technological innovation; increase small business participation in federally funded R&amp;D; foster participation by minority and disadvantaged firms in technological innovation; and increase private sector commercialization of federal R&amp;D.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>Phase 1 and Phase II's awarded based on solicitations issued three times a year for SBIR describing R&amp;D needs and inviting proposals from small companies.

Phase I Feasibility:
Phase I awards determined the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of the proposed effort and quality of
performance by the small business concerns (SBC).

Phase II Technology Development:
Phase II awarded based on the SBC's Phase I results and potential of the Phase II proposal to address the Navy's needs.  These awards further developed the technology, maturing the Technology Readiness Level(TRL) and providing prototypes  or other sources validating the technology.

Phase III - The ultimate goal of the SBIR program is to grow small businesses and meet war-fighter requirements.  Phase III contracts awarded to those efforts that were ready to be commercialized or integrated into a Program of Record (POR). The DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000 in order to track the success of the SBIR program. The Navy generally awards more Phase III contracts than the rest of the DOD combined. Although no government SBIR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and/or private sector. The target is to transition a company's SBIR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program requires each Federal agency that has an extramural budget for R&amp;D in excess of $100,000,000 to set aside 2.9% for SBIR in FY 2015. This funds R&amp;D at small businesses. The program goals are to stimulate technological innovation; increase small business participation in federally funded R&amp;D; foster
participation by minority and disadvantaged firms in technological innovation; and increase private sector commercialization of federal R&amp;D.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>Phase 1 and Phase II's awarded based on solicitations issued three times a year for SBIR describing R&amp;D needs and inviting proposals from small companies.

Phase I Feasibility:
Phase I awards determined the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of the proposed effort and quality of
performance by the small business concerns (SBC).

Phase II Technology Development:
Phase II awards are based on the SBC's Phase I results and potential of the Phase II proposal to address the Navy's needs.  These awards further developed the technology, maturing the Technology Readiness Level(TRL) and providing prototypes  or other sources validating the technology.

Phase III - Since the DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000, the Navy continues annually to award
more in Phase III contracts then the rest of the DOD combined and continues to be called out in studies and Congressional language as the premier DOD SBIR program. Although no government SBIR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and/or private sector. The target is to transition a company's SBIR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community.</r2:Text>

Phase I Feasibility:
Phase I awards determined the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of the proposed effort and quality of
performance by the small business concerns (SBC).

Phase II Technology Development:
Phase II awards are based on the SBC's Phase I results and potential of the Phase II proposal to address the Navy's needs.  These awards further developed the technology, maturing the Technology Readiness Level(TRL) and providing prototypes  or other sources validating the technology.

Phase III - Since the DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000, the Navy continues annually to award more in Phase III contracts then the rest of the DOD combined and continues to be called out in studies and Congressional language as the premier DOD SBIR program. Although no government SBIR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and/or private sector. The target is to transition a company's SBIR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program requires each Federal agency that has an extramural budget for R&amp;D in excess of $100,000,000 to set aside 2.9% for SBIR in FY 2015.  This funds  Research and Development (R&amp;D) at small businesses.  The program goals are to stimulate technological innovation; increase small business participation in federally funded R&amp;D; foster participation by minority and disadvantaged firms in technological innovation; and increase private sector commercialization of federal R&amp;D.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>Phase 1 and Phase II's awarded based on solicitations issued three times a year for SBIR describing R&amp;D needs and inviting proposals from small companies.

Phase I Feasibility:
Phase I awards determined the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of the proposed effort and quality of
performance by the small business concerns (SBC).

Phase II Technology Development:
Phase II awards are based on the SBC's Phase I results and potential of the Phase II proposal to address the Navy's needs.  These awards further developed the technology, maturing the Technology Readiness Level(TRL) and providing prototypes  or other sources validating the technology.

Phase III - Since the DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000, the Navy continues annually to award
more in Phase III contracts then the rest of the DOD combined and continues to be called out in studies and Congressional language as the premier DOD SBIR program. Although no government SBIR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and/or private sector. The target is to transition a company's SBIR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program requires each Federal agency that has an extramural budget for Research and Development (R&amp;D) in excess of $1,000,000,000 to set aside 0.40% for STTR in FY 2015. This funds cooperative R&amp;D between small businesses and research institutions. The program goals are to create vehicles from
moving ideas from research institutions to market; enable researchers to pursue commercial application of technologies; and bridge funding gap between basic research and commercial product.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program requires each Federal agency that has an extramural budget for R&amp;D in excess of $100,000,000 to set aside 2.9% for SBIR in FY 2015. This funds R&amp;D at small businesses. The program goals are to stimulate technological innovation; increase small business participation in federally funded R&amp;D; foster participation by minority and disadvantaged firms in technological innovation; and increase private sector commercialization of federal R&amp;D.

This project provides funding for the pilot administrative program authorized by the FY 2012 National Defense Authorization Act (SEC. 5141. PILOT TO ALLOW FUNDING FOR ADMINISTRATIVE, OVERSIGHT, AND CONTRACT PROCESSING COSTS.)</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>International Cooperative RDT&amp;E: provide program management, execution, and support to implement a broad range of cooperative Naval Research and Development, Test and Evaluation initiatives to improve coalition interoperability, harmonize US Navy requirements with allied and friendly nations, and identify cooperative international opportunities, and improve coalition interoperability.  In addition, it develops coherent approaches, coordinating with partner nations, to sea-based missile defense, command, control, communications, computers and intelligence (C4I), and cooperative acquisition programs while also identifying technology to support the Global Maritime Partnership initiative.

Naval War College Strategic Studies Support:  Provides research, analysis and gaming activities which serve as a focal point, stimulus, and major source of strategic and operational thought within the Navy, joint and interagency communities.  These efforts generate strategic and operational alternatives, quantitative analysis, war gaming and political military assessments, and provide recommendations regarding the formulation and execution of maritime options .  The War Gaming Department plans, designs, executes, analyzes and reports on the Navy's Title 10 war games.  These war games provide analytical input to the Navy's Strategic Plan, assessments of future concepts, and recommendations to the Navy's Quadrennial Defense Review, force design, and strategy process.  The War Gaming Department also designs, executes and analyzes war games for theater security cooperation plans and operational war fighting issues.  

Assessment Program: The Navy Assessment Program provides capability-based planning assessment for Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS), conducts analysis to affect war fighting capability trades and enterprise resources, identifies needs, gaps, and overlaps, and assesses alternative solutions to Joint needs.  The program supports both the development and use of modeling, simulation and analytically-based warfare and provides business analyses and analytic tools that provide the basis for decision making with respect to concepts of operations (CONOPS), Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) Systems (Information Dominance); warfare systems (Sea Strike, Sea Shield, and Sea Basing) and analytical underpinnings/basis for programmatic decisions of the Navy's top leadership regarding their architectures, force structure, and the Navy's core "organize, train, and equip mission" (the warfare and provider Enterprises).  The program provides overarching Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution System (PPBES) analyses and guidance for PPBES which provides gap analysis and investment strategy and total obligation authority allocation.  It provides independent capability analysis and assists in structuring follow-on Navy analyses.  The program coordinates Navy's position for the enhanced planning process and conducts net assessments.  It serves as the lead campaign analysis to approve Navy warfare and support requirements.  The program supports "A Cooperative Strategy for 21st Century Seapower 21" as modified by the Maritime Strategy which charts a course for the Navy, Coast Guard and Marine Corps to work collectively with each other and international partners to prevent crises from occurring or reacting quickly should one occur to avoid negative impact to the United States.  It serves as an independent assessor providing a broad-view perspective across the Navy staff apart from resource sponsors, with an integrated look at both war fighting and war fighting support programs.  The program supports the world class modeling efforts to attain a level of Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) capability that is world class and establishes the Navy as a leader in the Department of Defense (DoD) M&amp;S community.  It provides Navy alternatives in assessing the implications embedded within resource decisions in a quantified context of costs versus capability versus risk.  The program provides independent analytic support to Navy leadership in conjunction with various executive level decision forums.  It develops tools and analytical methodologies that assist in evaluating Navy programs and provides technical leadership for the analysis functional area of Naval Modeling and Simulation.

Mid-Range Financial Improvement Plans: This project supports the Research Development Test &amp; Evaluation, Navy (RDTEN) portion of the larger DoD and Navy-wide effort to implement the financial improvement plan.  Funding is for the sustainment of clean and auditable statements for RDTEN.

Operations Integration Group:  Classified

CHENG: Develops and implements architecture-based systems engineering processes, methods and tools that assure integrated and interoperable systems are delivered to the fleet.  This project provides the mission-oriented technical basis for implementing capability-based acquisition management within the Navy to engineer and field Navy and Marine Corps combat systems, weapon systems, and command, control, communications, computers and intelligence (C4I) programs that must operate as  family-of-systems (FoS) or system-of-systems (SoS).  The focus of this project is on identifying the functions, relationships, and connections between systems at both the force and unit level and across warfare mission areas, and encompasses three key elements:  Systems Engineering to provide the framework for making engineering decisions by war fighting capability at the FoS/SoS level and supports consistent engineering and investment decision-making across Navy and Marine Corps programs within capability-based acquisition portfolios.  Naval Collaborative Engineering Environment development and implementation as a DON enterprise resource for Naval integration and interoperability information to enable collaboration and decision support among Fleet organizations, Program Executive Offices, Program Managers, Systems Commands, prime contractors, Resource/Warfare Sponsors and Comptroller organizations.  Standards, Policies and Guidelines engineering and technical staff to implement DoN, Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and Joint integration and interoperability and Anti-Tamper initiatives.

Naval Research Laboratory (NRL)Facilities Modernization: This program has been established to provide a systematic and planned approach to improve vital in-house science and technology (S&amp;T) laboratory facilities which are reaching or have reached critical stages of deterioration.  The program includes restoration and modernization (R&amp;M) initiatives for about 350,000 net square feet, where the average age of the buildings is 67 years old.

The Joint Information Environment (JIE) initiative provides the supporting IT capability framework comprised of shared information technology infrastructure, enterprise services, interoperability with coalition partners and a single security architecture that enables mission commanders to execute mission partnered operations.  JIE provides the U.S. configuration controls necessary for enterprise capabilities.  By utilizing a U.S enterprise-wide secure Identity and Access Management system, JIE ensures that authorized users at the right classification level gain access to only the data and services they are entitled.  The continued development and refinement of a Joint Information Environment will provide for a significant improvement in data sharing within, and between, coalition maritime elements.

MTMD - Maritime Theater Missile Defense Forum:

This project funds participation in Maritime Integrated Air and Missile Defense projects with other nations. Included is participation in the Maritime Missile Defense Projects Framework Memorandum of Understanding of 2004 (as amended 2009). Known as the Maritime Theater Missile Defense (MTMD) forum, it promotes interoperability with the Navies of ten participating nations (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, United Kingdom and the United States). This project funds participation in several Project Arrangements and includes maritime contribution to the NATO Active Layered Theater Ballistic Missile Defense (ALTBMD) project, now known as NATO Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD). Engineering analysis and recommendations from MTMD activities are provided to European, Pacific and Central Combatant Commands to influence present day operations. Specifically, the MTMD Forum is addressing challenges with "Maritime Allied Air Defense in Support of Ballistic Missile Defense Operations" that face the Combatant Commanders during present day operations.

The MTMD forum provides protection against the proliferation of short, medium and long-range Ballistic Missile (BM) and Advanced Anti-Ship Cruise Missile (ASCM) threats through the creation of an interoperable sea-based Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) capability among coalition nations. This includes protection across the full spectrum of these threats through the enhanced utilization of existing sea-based systems to protect against current threats while progressively improving and developing systems and system-of- systems to effectively counter evolving threats.

This project supports USN participation in several Maritime IAMD related Project Arrangements and Working Groups including:

(1) Battle Management Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (BMC4I) to define and develop architectures as well as to perform engineering to address coalition capability gaps.
(2) Modeling &amp; Simulation (M&amp;S) to establish and maintain a maritime coalition M&amp;S testbed and to perform legacy and future systems simulation testing.
(3) Coalition Distributed Engineering Plant (CDEP) to establish and maintain a maritime coalition Hardware-in-the Loop Testbed and to conduct CDEP testing.
(4) Open Architecture (OA) to develop Interface Standards and Data Models.
(5) Test Planning and Execution (TPEX) to develop Test Plans, oversee exercise participation and conduct post event data analysis and reporting.
(6) Operational Requirements (OR) to develop a Coalition Maritime Missile Defense Operational Concept Document and to identify operational constraints and tactical constructs surrounding coalition maritime missile defense activities.
(7) Reciprocal Use of Test Facilities agreements with other nations to support Maritime IAMD and MTMD related demonstrations.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Provides program management, execution, and support to implement a broad range of cooperative naval Research and Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) initiatives to improve coalition interoperability, harmonize US Navy requirements with allied and friendly nations, identify cooperative international opportunities, and improve coalition interoperability.  In addition, it develops coherent approaches in coordination with combatant commanders (COCOMs), and appropriate partner nations, to sea-based missile defense, command, control, communications, computers and intelligence (C4I), and cooperative acquisition programs while also identifying technology to support the Global Maritime Partnership Initiative.

The project scope supports the strategic shift to the Pacific Region with emphasis on Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) and Coalition Interoperability.  Relationships have been, and are being initiated with a greatly expanded and diverse group of maritime countries, particularly those with nascent and littoral navies.  The project was restructured internally to both maintain ongoing international relationships and projects, while preparing to facilitate support for a global network of maritime nations under MDA and Coalition Interoperability requirements. 

Ongoing cooperative RDT&amp;E programs, projects and exchanges are pursued to identify cooperative acquisition programs, enhance OCO efforts and MDA development, fill capability gaps, improve US/coalition interoperability, and set standardization with international partners. Such efforts have resulted in:
1. Negotiating and developing approximately 57 international RDT&amp;E Agreements annually with allied and friendly nations;
2. Executing approximately 300 Information Exchange Annexes (IEAs) with foreign partners;
3. Improving IEA information dissemination with allied and friendly countries and within Department of the Navy (DoN);
4. Coordinating Navy inputs to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (OUSD) Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (AT&amp;L) Foreign Comparative Test (FCT) Program, and Coalition Warfare Program (CWT) as well as the DoN Technology Transfer Security Assistance Review Boards (TTSARB). 
5. Represent the US Navy in Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) directed Armaments Cooperation Forums, including the Conference of NATO Armaments Directors' groups {NATO Naval Armaments Group (NNAG)}, and Senior National Representative-Maritime (SNR-M);
6.  Funding of various international RDT&amp;E support databases including Technical Project Officer (TPO), International Agreement Generators, Information/Data Exchange Agreements, and Project Agreements/Memorandums of Understanding;
7.  Leading the Engineering and Scientist Exchange Program (ESEP).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Navy Assessment Program provides capability-based planning assessment for Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS), conducts analysis to affect war fighting capability trades and enterprise resources, identifies needs, gaps, and overlaps, and assesses alternative solutions to Joint needs.  The program supports both the development and use of modeling, simulation and analytically-based warfare and provides business analyses and analytic tools that provide the basis for decision making with respect to concepts of operations, Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Systems (Information Dominance); warfare systems (Sea Strike, Sea Shield, and Sea Basing) and analytical underpinnings/basis for programmatic decisions of the Navy's top leadership regarding their architectures, force structure, and the Navy's core "organize, train, and equip mission" (the warfare and provider Enterprises).  The program provides overarching Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution System (PPBES) analyses and guidance for PPBES which provides gap analysis and investment strategy and total obligation authority allocation.  It provides independent capability analysis and assists in structuring follow-on Navy analyses.  The program coordinates Navy's position for the enhanced planning process and conducts net assessments.  It serves as the lead campaign analysis to approve Navy warfare and support requirements.  The program supports "A Cooperative Strategy for 21st Century Seapower 21" as modified by the Maritime Strategy which charts a course for the Navy, Coast Guard and Marine Corps to work collectively with each other and international partners to prevent crises from occurring or reacting quickly should one occur to avoid negative impact to the United States.  It serves as an independent assessor providing a broad-view perspective across the Navy staff apart from resource sponsors, with an integrated look at both war fighting and war fighting support programs.  The program supports the world class modeling efforts to attain a level of Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) capability that is world class and establishes the Navy as a leader in the Department of Defense M&amp;S community.  It provides Navy alternatives in assessing the implications embedded within resource decisions in a quantified context of costs versus capability versus risk.  The program provides independent analytic support to Navy leadership in conjunction with various executive level decision forums.

Beginning in FY 2014, this project also includes funding for Concept Formulation (CONFORM) efforts.  This is a shift of funding from PE 0605152N, Studies and Analysis Support, Project 2092, Naval Warfare Studies.  CONFORM for ships, boats and unmanned maritime vehicles must be continuously exercised to remain viable. It takes years to train competent practitioners, and knowledge currency is quickly lost without practice. Evolving threats and technologies drive concepts (and the tools, processes, and skills needed to produce them) towards obsolescence without constant attention. Capability Based Assessments and Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) timelines are insufficient for establishing potential material solution cost versus capability relationships without significant concept formulation work beforehand. Active collaboration between the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations requirement sponsors, Program Offices, and the various System Command (Naval Sea Systems Command, Naval Air Systems Command and Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command) engineers is critical for fully exploring the trade space by conducting analysis for affordability, effectiveness and risk.  
The majority of Total Ownership Cost (TOC) is locked into a design before it is even a program. In the later stages of a program it becomes much more costly to make changes that will significantly impact TOC. Investment up front in concept design can have a high payoff in TOC reduction over the life of a platform class.
This project funds concept development engineering, mission effectiveness analysis, and other analyses for formulation of future surface ship and associated platform force structure along with development of the tools to accomplish these efforts. Advanced platform concept studies and systems technology assessments will be conducted as will the development and upgrade of concept design and engineering tools, methods, and criteria.
Outputs include concept costing and performance parameterization for comparative assessment against capability objectives and synthesis to quantify overall (Fleet) capabilities. These products (expressions of cost vs. capability) will serve as the basis of requirements and Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System analysis, define the trade space for AoA efforts, and underpin discussion of force architecture/structure during Quadrennial Defense Review, Long Range Shipbuilding Strategy builds, and Joint Requirements Oversight Council reviews.

Capabilities-Based Assessment (CBA) is the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) analysis process that includes three phases: Functional Area Analysis (FAA), Functional Needs Analysis (FNA), and Functional Solution Analysis (FSA). The results of the CBA are used to develop a joint capabilities document (based on the FAA and FNA) or initial capabilities document (based on the full analysis). CBA funding provides the resource sponsors the means to develop the analytic underpinning required by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 3170.01G to support the determination of Naval warfighting capabilities and force structure needed to support the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC)/JCIDS requirements validation process and to inform Program Objective Memorandum programming decisions. This analysis includes evaluation of integration and
interoperability gaps of current weapons systems.

-Collaborate with Warfare Systems design experts to perform continuous Warfare Systems analysis at the ship and fleet level.  Warfare Systems effectiveness assessment tools will be continually developed and enhanced as required to address future concepts and to incorporate improvements in information technology systems.  Additionally, collaboration with aircraft, C4ISR, and networks by continuing dialog and collaboration between NAVSEA, NAVAIR, and SPAWAR systems commands will refine fleet level requirements.
-Refine platform concept stage cost analysis tools to predict costs better in areas where weight-based algorithms may not be appropriate.  It will continually enhance tools to estimate total ownership costs more accurately at the ship and weapons system concept development stage.  Conduct cost estimates in support of future concept design exploration, CBA, and AoA efforts.  Further develop Cost Estimating Relationships (CERs) to accommodate emerging technologies incorporated in future platforms.  Develop cost estimating tools which incorporate emerging technologies applicable to future platforms.
-Conduct future force structure concept formulation.  Fleet synthesis and analysis will be conducted, which includes capabilities requirements, platform design and cost and quantitative tracking of the long-term evolution of the fleet as new platforms are introduced and old ones are retired.  Among the areas to the examined are interoperability concepts, force architecture impact studies, Long Range Shipbuilding Schedule (LRSS) support, and operational employment concept studies.
-Complete CBA's for undergraduate flight training and surface connector replacement, and commence CBA's for candidate systems such as neutralization of sea mines in the near-surface zone and the active RF free-fall expendable decoy.  Expand warfighting gap assessments to address interaction of mission area kill chain platforms, sensors, and weapons in a system-of-system construct.

                                <r2:Description>CBA - The CBA is the JCIDS analysis process that includes three phases: the FAA, the FNA, and the FSA. The results of the CBA are used to develop a joint capabilities document (based on the FAA and FNA) or initial capabilities document (based on the full analysis). CBA funding provides the resource sponsors the means to develop the analytic underpinning required by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 3170.01G to support the determination of Naval war fighting capabilities and force structure needed to support the JROC/JCIDS requirements validation process and to inform Program Objective Memorandum programming decisions.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>The overall goal is to conduct analysis to support the Navy decisions needed to turn strategy and guidance into the Fleet needed within acceptable risk. The May 2007 revision of the Joint Chiefs of Staff's Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) instruction (CJCSI 3170.01F) requires a Capabilities-Based
Assessment (CBA) to assess new requirements. A CBA instruction has been developed by the Chief Navy Office's warfare integration office that prescribes a procedure and structure to this warfighting requirements generation process (JCIDS). A CBA is required to address and validate capability shortfalls or gaps as defined by combatant commanders. It is an analytical process that includes three phases: the Functional Area Analysis, the Functional Needs Analysis, and the Functional Solution Analysis. This process is designed to address future warfighting requirements and analysis needs and improve the quality of Analysis of Alternatives. CBA supports Navy programming decisions and provides the means to develop the analytic underpinning to support the determination of Naval capabilities and force structure recapitalization investments required to fulfill the Maritime Strategy.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>One of DoD's and Navy's priority goals is to gain a clean and auditable financial statement.  The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Comptroller, in his 8 August 2003 memorandum, directed the Military Departments and Defense Agencies, in coordination with the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS), to prepare a comprehensive mid-range financial improvement plan to identify measurable steps to ensure each material line is auditable, and ensure all major deficiencies are resolved.  

This project supports the Research, Development, Test and Evaluation, Navy (RDT&amp;E,N) portion of the larger DoD and Navy-wide effort to implement the Financial Improvement Plan (FIP).  Corrective actions required to resolve known deficiencies and determine resource requirements (people and systems) are being identified.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>Mission Assurance Division (MAD) will conduct vulnerability assessments for the Combatant Commanders (CCMDs), Services, and Agencies as directed by Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Homeland Defense (OASD HD) and in coordination with the Joint Staff. For the performance period, the MAD will support the Joint Mission Assurance Assessment Pilot (JMAAP) assessments as well as other critical infrastructure assessments based on OASD HD priorities. These on-site assessments of DCI are required to meet annual policy requirements and to ensure assets nominated as Defense Critical Asset (DCA) are fully vetted and validated. Assessment teams will normally consist of a mission analyst and four infrastructure analysts, but team composition may be modified based on the site and assessment requirements. The assessments include pre-site work, on-site work, and post-site report writing. The final assessment report will include collected research such as Baseline Elements of Information (BEI), Benchmarks and Standards, characterizing infrastructure / identifying vulnerabilities to missions, and completing the vulnerability portion of the Risk Decision Package. The MAD will work with U.S. Air Force Criticality and Risk Assessment (CARA) and other service teams to supplement data evaluation for Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) offices as negotiated between OASD HD's MA Director, the Joint Staff J34 and Service CIP offices</r2:Text>

They will work with CCMDs, Services, Sectors, and Agencies to conduct deep-dive infrastructure research and develop web services to transfer data between DCIP Systems. The MAD will provide reachback desktop analysis support of regions and/or specific countries across CCMD areas of responsibility (AORs), with focus in U.S. Central Command (USCENTCOM), U.S. Pacific Command (USPACOM), and U.S. Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM) AORs in the upcoming period. 

In addition, the MAD will provide analytical and on-site assistance, as required, to look at the defense continuity aspects of MA. Additional tasks can include on-site analysis based on OASD HD and CCMD prioritization of needs / requirements. Tasks can range between full infrastructure analysis across particular countries for operational planning, to specific infrastructure analysis involving telecommunication assets, the Global Information Grid (GIG), and electric power infrastructure security. The MAD will assist Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Policy, Acquisition Technology and Logistics Installations and Environment (AT&amp;L I&amp;E) and AT&amp;L Operational Energy in developing and refining Energy Security documents, presentations, plans, and procedures, and refining lists of potential mitigation options for energy-related vulnerabilities. They will serve as an integrating function by providing a source for historical and ongoing DCIP analysis information / assessment research data and feedback, geospatial information, and threat and hazard mapping. They will update and revise MA benchmark standards in conjunction with Joint Staff, Defense Thread Reduction Agency (DTRA), and selected assessment service teams. They will continue to update the DCIP benchmarks and standards data / information to support MA program execution requirements.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Standards, Policy, and Guidelines: - Alignment of SPGs across the Naval Enterprise and with OSD and Joint organizations will support standard acquisition implementation and improve compatibility and interoperability thereby lowering development and maintenance costs across programs												
- Aggregating systems for the purpose of conducting certification and accreditation and consolidating mandatory documentation for aggregations versus individual systems will optimize (cost tradeoffs and focus on high priority issues) certifications, reduce paperwork and associated costs, and put attention on systems engineering, IA, and ISPs for systems in their aggregated operational state vice just the individual system development state.   Document costs for major programs are $1 to $3.5 Million per system.  An aggregation may include 15 or more systems with four or more being major systems.  Aggregation presents a high potential for Return on Investment.												
- NR-KPP processes will clarify requirements and capabilities (including their metrics) that acquisition programs need to develop systems.  This clarification will eliminate guesses in terms of operational needs, thereby reducing the risk of program failure and reducing program and life-cycle costs.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project funds participation in Maritime Integrated Air and Missile Defense projects with other nations.  Included is participation in the Maritime Missile Defense Projects Framework Memorandum of Understanding of 2004 (as amended 2009).  Known as the Maritime Theater Missile Defense (MTMD) forum, it promotes interoperability with the Navies of ten participating nations (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, United Kingdom and the United States).  This project funds participation in several Project Arrangements and includes maritime contribution to the NATO Active Layered Theater Ballistic Missile Defense (ALTBMD) project, now known as NATO Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD). Engineering analysis and recommendations from MTMD activities are provided to European, Pacific and Central Combatant Commands to influence present day operations.  Specifically, the MTMD Forum is addressing challenges with "Maritime Allied Air Defense in Support of Ballistic Missile Defense Operations" that face the Combatant Commanders during present day operations.

The MTMD forum provides protection against the proliferation of short, medium and long-range Ballistic Missile (BM) and Advanced Anti-Ship Cruise Missile (ASCM) threats through the creation of an interoperable sea-based Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) capability among coalition nations.  This includes protection across the full spectrum of these threats through the enhanced utilization of existing sea-based systems to protect against current threats while progressively improving and developing systems and system-of- systems to effectively counter evolving threats. 

This project supports USN participation in several Maritime IAMD related Project Arrangements and Working Groups including:

(1)  Battle Management Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (BMC4I) to define and develop architectures as well as to perform engineering to address coalition capability gaps.
(2)  Modeling &amp; Simulation (M&amp;S) to establish and maintain a maritime coalition M&amp;S testbed and to perform legacy and future systems simulation testing.
(3)  Coalition Distributed Engineering Plant (CDEP) to establish and maintain a maritime coalition Hardware-in-the-Loop Testbed and to conduct CDEP testing.
(4)  Open Architecture (OA) to develop Interface Standards and Data Models.
(5)  Test Planning and Execution (TPEX) to develop Test Plans, oversee exercise participation and conduct post event data analysis and reporting.
(6)  Operational Requirements (OR) to develop a Coalition Maritime Missile Defense Operational Concept Document and to identify operational constraints and tactical constructs surrounding coalition maritime missile defense activities.
(7)  Reciprocal Use of Test Facilities agreements with other nations to support Maritime IAMD and MTMD related demonstrations.

Starting in FY17, funding for MTMD is realigned from Program Element 0603582N Combat System Integration.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>Critical Science and Technology research cannot be sustained or succeed in deteriorated facilities.  World class research can only be accomplished in facilities that are at a minimum "adequate", but preferably "state-of-the-art."  Due to their advanced age and deterioration, funds are planned to restore/modernize various laboratory facilities at the Naval Research Laboratory.  

The FY16 and FY17 funding increases will support the restoration/modernization of Naval Research Laboratory, the Navy's world class corporate research laboratory, to ensure they can meet future technological threats.  Due to advanced age and deterioration of the facilities, the increase in funding is needed to update various laboratory facilities to further the critical science and technology research for the Navy.</r2:Description>

The funds will be used for specific studies, evaluations, and the special handling of highly critical and sensitive laboratories that will be relocated into refurbished buildings. This includes planning, consolidating and relocating of over 100 laboratories into less than 80 laboratories; careful disassembly of one-of-a-kind facilities and equipment by in-house scientists and experts and contractor support with specialized skills to devise unique plans to disassemble, transport, and reassemble the facilities; and the recalibration and specialized reassembly of the highly specialized equipment (e.g., solid-state electronic devises, lasers, vacuum tubes, electrical connections, reactors, gas sensors and chambers, and chemical connectors and distribution systems).</r2:Text>

The primary deliverable from this effort will be a PrCB and Interconnect Technology Roadmap, or strategic plan, identifying domestic technology gaps, future research and development needs, and any policy changes required to ensure that the DoD has access to PrCB manufacturing capabilities and technical expertise necessary to meet future military requirements.  As mandated, the EA will also address DoD PrCB supply chain issues, including diversity and vulnerabilities, and develop trustworthiness requirements for PrCBs used in defense systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>In 2005, the National Academies national research council (NRC) conducted a study and subsequently issued a report relating to manufacturing trends in printed circuit technology.  Within that report, the NRC detailed four critical issue areas that needed to be addressed in the interest of national security.  Those issue areas included; Trust, Supply Chain, Organic (DoD) Capability Sustainment, and Technology Development.  

Intense global competition in the Printed Circuit Board (PrCB) industry has resulted in a significant reduction in the number of United States PrCB companies, leaving the domestic PrCB industrial base "fragile" and progressively declining in capability and health.  Implementation of the strategies developed by the EA for PrCB Technologies will proactively ensure that the U.S. PrCB industry is capable of supporting future DoD electronics requirements.  The strategic plan is expected to indentify technology gaps and research and development needs, as well as identify and recommend policy changes.

In addition to benefiting DoD by ensuring access to leading edge PrCB technology, it is expected that the EA program will help the struggling domestic PrCB industry by indentifying future technology research and development needs and securing the domestic military market.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports ONR leadership, management and direction for the Naval S&amp;T program. This project funds ONR HQ salaries, communications, and other fixed costs.  In FY16 and out, the Mid-Range Financial Improvement Plan effort will be transferred into this project from PE 0605853N Project 3025 to support ONR's goal of attaining a clean and auditable financial statement. ONR sponsors scientific advances, which lead to Future Naval Capabilities (FNCs), supporting the Fleet's ability to operate from a position of technological superiority. Functions performed include (1) scientific and technical direction of the nationwide 6.1 basic research program with colleges, universities, non-profit organizations and Naval Laboratories and Warfare Centers; (2) scientific and technical direction of the 6.2 applied research program through the Naval R&amp;D laboratories and Warfare Centers and industry; (3) scientific and technical direction of the Naval 6.3 advanced technology development program through the Navy's R&amp;D laboratories, Warfare Centers and industry; (4) management, resource formulation, program assessment, and contract negotiation/administration of the Navy basic research, applied research and advanced technology development program; and (5) coordination of the Navy's Technology Base program within the context of total DoD/Government (e.g., National Science Foundation, National Academy of Sciences) R&amp;D initiatives in order to maximize scientific advances. This project also supports ONR management and direction for the following Navy-wide programs:  Small Business Innovation Research, Naval Research Advisory Committee, Navy Patent Program, Historically Black Colleges and Universities/Minority Institutions Program, Navy Manufacturing Technology Program and the Ballistic Missile Submarine Nuclear (SSBN) Security Technology Program. 

Additionally, this project funds ONR field salaries, communications, and other fixed costs.  Functions performed support ONR's Navy-wide responsibilities in the negotiation and establishment of indirect cost rates for DoD-assigned universities and performance of contract administration for all DoD contracts/grants at all colleges and universities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Title>S&amp;T MANAGEMENT SUPPORT</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>This project provides for basic costs of ONR Headquarters in support of the entire Navy S&amp;T program. Most all the funds in this project are fixed costs, such as salaries and communications. Specifically, it pays the salaries of Scientific and Engineering and corporate business personnel who direct the execution of the Navy's basic research, applied research, and advanced technology development programs at the nation's universities/colleges, Navy laboratories, Warfare Centers, and private industry.

This project also provides for basic costs of ONR's field activities to include fixed costs, such as salaries and communications.

The increase from FY 2015 to FY 2016 reflects a transfer of the Mid-Range Financial Improvement Plan funding from PE 0605853N Management, Technical and International Support, an increase in the FERS Employer Contribution Rate, and management, communications, and other fixed costs required to support the Navy S&amp;T program.

Effective in FY 2017, ONR realigned costs associated with Management Headquarters Activity (MHA) salaries into PE 0605898N Management HQ - R&amp;D.  The reduction in FY 2016 to FY 2017 reflects that realignment.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This continuing program provides support for ships and aircraft required to accommodate Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) of new systems. The RDT&amp;E ship and aircraft inventory is required to adequately test new and improved weapon systems, stay current with threats, and increase warfighting capability of the fleet. The program provides integrated logistics support for aircraft at selected field activities; provides depot-level rework of aircraft, engines, and components for the Navy inventory of RDT&amp;E aircraft; and provides support for ships and aircraft bailed to contractors for Navy RDT&amp;E projects. Costs covered under this element include aircrew training and proficiency, fuel, supplies, equipment, repair, Aviation Depot Level Repairables, overhaul of ships and aircraft, as well as organizational, intermediate, and depot maintenance of ships and aircraft in the Navy RDT&amp;E inventory.

JUSTIFICATION FOR BUDGET ACTIVITY: This program is funded under RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, TEST and EVALUATION MANAGEMENT SUPPORT because it supports efforts directed toward sustaining or modernizing installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:SummaryExplanation>In FY 2015, the T&amp;E Enterprise project was reduced by -$9.999 million due to schedule shift of DDG1000 equipment installation and checkout (INCO) on the Self Defense Test Ship (SDTS) from a 2015 industrial availability to an FY16-FY17 industrial availability.

The FY 2017 request was reduced by -$1.6 million due to the availability of prior year execution balances and by -$2.7 million as required for the Department of the Navy to comply with the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015.

The funding increase from FY 2016 to FY 2017 for RDT&amp;E Aircraft Support supports an increase in Phased Depot Maintenance (PDM) costs.  The increase in PDM costs are associated to multiple KC-130T's and P-8A's that are scheduled for depot maintenance in FY17.  

The funding increase from FY 2016 to FY 2017 for Self Defense Test Ship (SDTS) supports the work package development and purchase of long lead items for the SDTS drydock scheduled for FY19.  Planned work includes ultrasonic testing of the hull, stern tube seal repair, main propulsion shafting repair/replace, fuel oil tank refurbishment and a myriad of other HM&amp;E systems repair or upgrades

Technical: TECP-1 development efforts were added to PU 3206 in 2016-2019.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) Aircraft Support. This continuing project funds costs associated with RDT&amp;E fixed and rotary wing aircraft which accommodate test and evaluation of aircraft/weapon systems. Testing aboard these platforms reduces the number of fleet units required to support RDT&amp;E efforts.  Included in these costs are Aviation Depot-Level Repairables (AVDLR), which are spare and replacement aircraft parts and components to support overhead maintenance related flight operations, aircrew training, and proficiency flight hours. This project also funds airframe Standard Depot Level Maintenance (SDLM), the Integrated Maintenance Concept (IMC) and Phased Depot Maintenance (PDM), in-service repairs, emergency repairs, and engine repairs, as well as aircraft material condition and field inspections. Additionally, it funds Aircraft Structure Periodic Adjustments (ASPA), Individual Material Readiness List (IMRL) tools and support equipment, and other systems for application to and compatibility with RDT&amp;E requirements.

JUSTIFICATION FOR BUDGET ACTIVITY: This program is funded under RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, TEST and EVALUATION MANAGEMENT SUPPORT because it supports efforts directed toward sustaining or modernizing installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The T&amp;E Enterprise consolidates all Air Warfare (AW) Ship Self Defense (SSD) at-sea testing across multiple class ships, beginning with LHD 8, LSD 50, LHA 6, DDG 1000, CVN 78, and Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) versions 7 and 8. This consolidated AW SSD test and evaluation approach meets the Probability of Raid Annihilation (PRA) (PRA is defined as a required surface ship defense against Anti-Ship Cruise Missiles), Self Defense Test Ship (SDTS) testing requirements as outlined in Air Warfare Ship Self Defense Enterprise T&amp;E Master Plan (TEMP) 1714, and lead/operational ship testing requirements for Extended Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM) TEMP 1471, Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM) Blk 2 TEMP 286-2, DDG 1000 TEMP 1560, CVN 78 TEMP 1610, Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) TEMP 1415, SSDS TEMP 1400, LHA 6 TEMP 1697, AN/SPQ-9B TEMP 1463, Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program (SEWIP) TEMP 1658 (Block 1A), and LCS TEMP 1695.

Enterprise Cost elements:
a) SDTS Acquisition includes the direct procurement costs of major Combat Systems (CS) elements which will be installed on the Self Defense Test Ship (SDTS).

b) SDTS Summary includes installation, check-out and stage testing of the major combat systems elements on the SDTS.

c) SDTS Test includes tracking and firing exercises versus single and dual, subsonic and supersonic Anti-Ship Cruise Missile (ASCM) threat surrogates for ship classes in the Enterprise TEMP from the SDTS including:  LHA 6, LSD 50, DDG 1000, LCS 7, LCS 8 and CVN 78.

d) Lead Ship Test includes tracking and firing exercises versus single and dual, subsonic and supersonic ASCM threat surrogates for ship classes in the Enterprise TEMP from the Lead Ship including:  LHA 6, LSD 50, LCS 7, LCS 8 and CVN 78.

e) Testbed includes all modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) costs required to create OT-quality digital representations of shipboard combat system performance including infrastructure, distributed secure network, common environmental services for Developmental Test (DT) and Operational Test (OT).

f) Enterprise Testing and Planning includes the contractor and government costs to administer the Enterprise, collect and distribute data from live events, maintain Information Assurance (IA) certifications, and financial management.

g) Maintenance of CS includes the costs for the routine preventive maintenance and repairs of the Combat Systems elements on the SDTS.

The T&amp;E Enterprise merges common ship, element, and system requirements into the least number of test events while leveraging planned Combat System Ship Qualification Trials (CSSQTs) to accomplish Developmental Testing (DT) and Operational Testing (OT) requirements. All tests on the SDTS require the sharing of infrastructure, missile range allocations, execution time and underway time to eliminate duplicative testing.  T&amp;E Enterprise preserves end-to-end mission Operational Testing in a realistic operational environment, capitalizing on Probability of Raid Annihilation Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) data validated with results of that Operational Testing, and ensuring a consistent approach across ship classes. Applicability of all test events is beneficial across multiple ship classes with the same variation under test.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>As a detachment of Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Division Newport, the mission of the Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center (AUTEC) is to provide the US Navy an underwater range facility for full-spectrum test and evaluation of Undersea Warfare systems and for Fleet training and readiness assessment.  The AUTEC Program Office is headquartered at Newport, RI.  AUTEC's administrative offices are located at West Palm Beach, Florida.  Test facilities are located at Andros Island, Sites 1 through 4, and the Berry Islands in the Bahamas.  AUTEC aircraft make scheduled daily flights between West Palm Beach and Andros Town Airport.  

AUTEC manages and, under service contract, maintains and operates a 500 square nautical miles deep-water and a 100 square nautical miles shallow-water range; air-target tracking capabilities; sonobuoy simulation systems; electronic warfare threat simulation systems; rotary wing aircraft; aircraft ground support facilities; acoustic targets; torpedo retrieval and flushing capabilities; open-ocean range craft; marine support facilities; and data processing and analysis capabilities.  

Major test facilities on Andros Island are located at Site 1.  The Command Control Building houses the range tracking displays and replay centers, the computer center, operations support functions, communications center, and the central timing system. The Range Support Facility houses a torpedo post-run workshop, Mark 46 /Mark 50 lightweight torpedo Intermediate Maintenance Activity (IMA), a Mark 30 undersea target IMA, a Mark 48 heavyweight torpedo Research and Development Turnaround facility and related technical facilities. The complex includes electrical and physical calibration labs, a complete electronics maintenance shop, a dive locker, a precision machine shop, and logistics support areas.

AUTEC has a 285-foot concrete pier with a controlling depth of 17 feet (5.2 meters) at mean low tide. An adjacent wharf is approximately 240 feet in length (72 meters) with a controlling depth of 15 feet at mean low tide.  Power is available at both locations.  Facilities at the pier/marine area include fully equipped machine /fabrication and marine overhaul shops.  Also at Site 1, six Range User Buildings are maintained  for assembling test equipment and equipment check-out during test mobilization or dockside periods. These staging areas are equipped with a variety of power sources, gantry cranes, compressed air and security features. A fully equipped range user hanger for ground maintenance and storage of helicopters is located at the AUTEC helicopter airstrip.  Sites 2, 3, and 4 are small instrumented areas located south of Site 1 used to extend tracking of sonobuoys, communications, and air target track.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project provides continuing maintenance and operational support for the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) capabilities.  These capabilities include the Pacific Ranges and Facilities, consisting of China Lake Ranges and the Point Mugu Sea Range, aerial and surface targets, test instrumentation, and T&amp;E aircraft.  The Pacific Ranges use China Lake's 1.1 million acres of land and 17,000 square miles of military restricted (R-2508) airspace together with Point Mugu's 125,000 square miles of instrumented sea range and 36,000 square miles of controlled overlying airspace, and airfield and test instrumentation at San Nicolas Island to perform its T&amp;E mission.  Included in the China Lake ranges is the Electronic Combat Range (ECR), which provides outdoor free space development and operational testing of airborne electronic warfare systems and tactics against shipboard and land based air defense systems. These ranges perform metric radar, multilateration and optical  tracking of test objects; command, control,  and destruct for range safety purposes; communications; frequency interference control and analysis; collection processing and display of telemetered data; real-time data processing and display; and the operation of a sub scale aerial target launch capability.  Other test capabilities include sled tracks, measurement facility; propulsion, warhead, environmental, rocket motor, and other missile component test facilities; and gun ranges.

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element (PE) provides Commander, Operational Test and Evaluation Force (COMOPTEVFOR) general support funding for headquarters annual operating costs and ensures COMOPTEVFOR compliance with Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) and Secretary of the Navy (SECNAV) directives to conduct independent operational testing and evaluation. Funding supports planning, conducting, and reporting on the operational effectiveness and suitability of new and improved systems and recommending fleet usage to the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO). Funding also supports ongoing development and implementation of new requirements relative to integrated testing. The CNO, as well as acquisition executives and managers at all levels, have a continuing need for expeditious and efficient conduct of Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&amp;E) by COMOPTEVFOR in support of training and equipping fleet forces.  To this end, this funding supports COMOPTEVFOR's continued pursuit of a variety of senior management initiatives aimed at increasing efficiencies in T&amp;E; these senior management initiatives include IT database and decision making technology upgrades, implementation of Integrated Testing and Mission Based Test Design across all programs, and improved staffing and expertise in the areas of DON acquisition processes, Modeling and Simulation, Statistical Studies, Cost Analysis, Information Assurance, and similar disciplines. All of these senior management initiatives are aimed at improving the quality of testing and evaluation, thus ensuring delivery to fleet units of fully tested and capable combat systems.  OT&amp;E issues have direct long term Navy-wide implications on the Fleet's readiness and war fighting capability. Rapid advances in technology, changes in fleet tactics, and increased complexity of weapons systems and platforms, combined with reductions in manpower, force structure, and budgets have created an increased need for technical and operational analyses that are sophisticated and timely in order to ensure an optimal return on investment of Navy resources. Funding is also provided for Navy support of the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) sponsored Joint Test and Evaluation (JT&amp;E) program.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>As indicated in section A above, funding provides for core headquarters operations and support (O&amp;S) costs related to required operational testing and evaluation (T&amp;E) conducted in support of Navy acquisition programs. The preponderance of funding provides for the annual O&amp;S costs for day to day operations of the staff/headquarters of COMOPTEVFOR, located in Norfolk, Virginia. (Pursuant to DoD Financial Management Regulations and Navy financial policy guidance, as a T&amp;E activity, COMOPTEVFOR's annual support costs are funded via RDTEN vice OMN; hence, and unlike most RDTEN programs, these funds provide for O&amp;S costs typical of military field commands/activities). Within this project, over 1/2 of the funding supports salaries of assigned civilian personnel. The remaining funds provide for other routine support costs such as travel, IT support, supplies, and other overhead/administrative support costs. The primary metric used within the project involves support for scheduled Navy acquisition program testing and subsequent analysis and reporting of results of testing to appropriate senior Navy acquisition officials and to the Navy chain of command directly to the CNO and various OPNAV/SECNAV staff offices. The performance goal is met when all assigned/scheduled testing and reporting is supported each year. Specific test program success is measured through analytic results of testing conducted throughout the year and constant interaction with program offices, acquisition decision makers, OPNAV staff resource sponsor offices, OSD and other service T&amp;E offices/activities, and miscellaneous other customers/stakeholders. This project also supports testing and evaluation of various Joint/multi-service programs in which the Navy shares responsibilities in support of the acquisition community. The following metrics relate directly to the funding provided and are applicable to current operations.                            
                              
Number of Tests Conducted - FY15 = 105; FY16 = 103; FY17 = 104
Number of Programs Supported - FY15 = 425; FY16 = 422; FY17 = 424</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) and Radio Frequency (RF) Management Program. This project develops tools, processes, and algorithms to identify and mitigate EMI sources for Navy systems and platforms. 

(a) It will support the Afloat Electromagnetic Spectrum Operations Program (AESOP), an automated spectrum Fleet operational capability. The application will be enhanced to comply with fleet operational requirements and streamline Strike Force frequency management processes. It will provide automated Spectrum Management (SM) tools for development of operational task communication and radar/weapon plans to support fleet deployments, exercises, and contingency operations. It will provide identification and mitigation of EMI in Navy, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Allied, Ashore and Joint Combat Operations.  It will provide analysis related to spectrum reallocation proposals to assess impacts on Navy operations and systems.

(b) It will support the Shipboard Electromagnetic Compatibility Improvement Program (SEMCIP) to identify, engineer, and evaluate effectiveness of potential EMI corrections. The program also characterizes and quantifies the operational impact of EMI problems on system's mission performance.

(c) It will support the Nuclear Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) Survivability Program. The program assesses the EMP survivability of all mission critical systems and funds development of a hardness assurance and maintenance program. It will develop improved modeling capability to reduce hardness validation costs at delivery and over the lifetime of the system/platform. The program develops new and updated design criteria, test methodology, test limits, and survivability validation procedures for all Navy systems, ships, submarines and shore facilities.

(d) It will support the Real-Time Spectrum Operations Program.  The program investigates Electromagnetic (EM) Environmental effects between shipboard transmitters/receivers and develops EM and spectrum techniques with Commercial off the shelf (COTS)  technologies to provide the ability to monitor EM spectrum usage and system EM degradation on all ships in a given strike group.  The program will investigate technologies to build an EM Spectrum Common Operational Picture (COP) to detect and assess operational capabilities in real-time.  Additional investigations will be performed to develop processes and procedures to predict the EM environment for planning purposes.  In the out-years, these capabilities will be used to build the next generation combat system with inherent spectrum agility and self-awareness capability, further enhancing the Navy's ability to perform Command and Control (C2) of the EM Spectrum warfighting domain.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>(U) Link Crimson (Navy Tactical Exploitation of National Capabilities (TENCAP) is a congressionally directed program to rapidly develop (12-18 months) systems, processes, and training that leverages and exploits National Technical Means (NTM) and Intelligence Community (IC) resources to meet fleet tactical warfighting gaps.  This is done through innovative research and development of capabilities aligned with Navy Programs of Record (PoR), while influencing national systems support and development.  These efforts include advanced sensors, platform and ground processing, and integrated national-to-tactical information fusion capabilities. Link Crimson supports all Navy mission areas, including Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), Integrated Air and Missile Defense, Mine Warfare (MIW), Power projection/Precision Strike, Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA), and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR), in support of the Navy's Information Dominance pillars: Assured Command and Control (AC2), Battlespace Awareness (BA) and Integrated Fires (IF). 

(U) This program is funded under Budget Activity 6 because it supports the operations and installations required for general research and development. Program baseline addresses research and development on specific capabilities to support these mission areas such as signals collection and exploitation, acoustic and electronic signal detection, countering Unmanned Air Systems, Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (PED) processes, Commercial Maritime Navigation Radar (CMNR) detection and exploitation, open-ocean surveillance, and hostile threat geo-location.  Link Crimson fields both prototypes to demonstrate new capabilities in real world environments in coordination with operational users, and develops warfighting capabilities for insertion into Navy, joint, and national agency programs of record.   Additional detailed information is available at higher levels of classification.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The Navy must assure its ability to command and control forces. This requires capabilities that enable commanders to: 1) Exchange orders and responses with subordinates; 2) Understand the disposition of friendly forces; 3) Target and conduct strikes as part of the joint force; and 4) Assess the result of those strikes. Sensing the environment, understanding our adversaries and operating and defending our communications and networked systems are inextricably linked to the assurance of C2.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Marine Corps Requirements Oversight Council (MROC), has established Operations Analysis Division (OAD), as the sole operations research, analytic support, and studies management program for the Marine Corps Study System (MCSS). OAD provides Senior Military Leadership with a comprehensive understanding of operations and advanced analytic and statistical support. In compliance with Executive Order #13589 OAD's major focus is achieving greater efficiency, productivity, and innovation through operations research methodologies such as: statistical analysis, multi-objective decision methods, optimization, cost analysis, and a wide range of computer-based models and combat simulations. Division analysts are credited with innovations in analysis of amphibious operations and Irregular Warfare (IW) that have expanded state-of-the-art operations research methods across DOD. OAD quantifies resource allocation decisions pertaining to weapon systems, strategic personnel,training management, and equipment acquisition. Efforts are guided by the Commandant's Strategic Plan and Planning Guidance. 

Future studies support Marine Air-Ground Task Forces (MAGTF's) and Marine Expeditionary Units (MEU's) with research analysis and modeling and simulation focused on aviation, amphibious, and ground operations enhancing the ability of the Marine Corps to increase operational, logistical and equipment efficiencies and capabilities and provide a unique, well trained, equipped and educated force.  

This program element supports four specialized analytical groups within OAD: (1) Current Operations Analysis and Support Team (COAST) - responsible for providing deployed on site professional operations analysis support to: Special Purpose MAGTFs in CENTCOM and AFRICOM; (2) Analysis Branch (AB) responsible for executing a select portfolio of studies for senior leadership; (3) Mission Area Analysis (MAA) responsible for capability analysis and support to the JCIDS process; and (4) Joint External Analysis Branch (JEA), the Marine Corps' sole representative in the Joint modeling arenas. 

The increase from FY16 to FY17 ($6.618M) reflects funding to support projected operations research, modeling and simulation, analytic support, to the OPFORS, HQMC, and the Joint community, JCIDS Support and studies management. The funding will support a significant increase in studies, operations research and analyses, and modeling and simulation to support the Commandant's Planning Guidance (CPG), Defense Planning Guidance, Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), Chairman's Joint Force Assessment, Chairman's Strategic Seminar Series Wargames, Annual Joint Staff Force Sufficiency Assessments, and POTUS.  Anticipate 55+ studies to include follow on Phase II and Phase III efforts. Focus areas of concentration: Manpower/Personnel; Intelligence, Information and Networks; Plans, Policy, and Operations; Infrastructure and Readiness; Resources, Programs, and Assessments; Capability Integration; Research, Development and Acquisition; General Concept Development; and Weapons Systems analysis.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>- Continued - Efforts in the following areas of interest:
  * Gender Integration: Coordinated and conducted analytical support to the Marine Corps Force Integration Program (MCFIP) Women in Infantry as directed by Annex D to the Marine Corps Force Integration Campaign Plan Logistics/Combat Service Plan.
  * Energy: Multi-functional area tasks which supported: continued refinement, alignment and application of Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) Power and Energy Model (MPEM) and the Operational Energy Capabilities Improvement Fund (OECIF).
   * Current Operations: Total Force Structure Process (TFSP); Human Resources Development Process (HRDP); Global Force Management (GFM); Weapons Systems; Equipment Requirements and Resources; Irregular Warfare; Information Operations; Cyber Warfare; Live vs. Simulation Ground Based Training; and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR).   

- Completed: (examples)
  * CH-53K Requirements Analysis determined procurement quantity for heavy lift helicopters in response to DOD Inspection General Inquiry (IG) suggesting the USMC was procuring excess aircraft. Impact: the acquisition objective was validated preserving 44 CH-53K aircraft in the aviation program of record affecting $22.2B of planned expenditures.
  * Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear Defense Equipment and Medicant Study produced a tool used by commodity managers to reduce USMC storage cost saving the USMC $18M per year for chemical warfare defense equipment.  
  * Guam Combat Ready Storage Point (CRSP) Analysis Study saved $60M in MILCON by justifying cancellation of the building of a $60M facility not needed or desired by the Operating Forces and the Installation based requirements and the actual capabilities of the facility.
  * Medium Lift Helicopter Requirements Analysis Ground Based Air Defense. Analysis examined the ability of planned medium lift force structure to meet operational demands for Major Combat Operations and forward deployed forces. Impact: detailed analysis of force structure, operational demands, and acquisition plans provided a firm analytic basis for MV-22 requirements, potentially affecting the program of record by $1.6B 
  * USMC Search and Rescue (SAR) study found that SAR is a necessary capability to maintain and a Joint SAR option should be pursued given its low cost. Impact: study found the cost difference between the lowest cost option and the most expensive option for maintaining SAR is over $10 Million annually. 
  * Ground Based Air Defense (GBAD) Weapons Systems Phase I determined the non kinetic option (High Power Microwave, High Energy Laser, and Electronic Warfare) were not as cost effective as kinetic rockets and gun systems.

- Initiated: MCSS accepted 52 new studies which provided analysis, wargaming scenarios and modeling and simulation to address Marine Corps issues and alternatives concerning organizations, tactics, doctrine, policies, force plans, strategies, procedures, intelligence, weapon selection, systems programs and resource allocations. IT technologies and included: Digital Electronic Jammers, maneuvering Surface to-Surface Missiles, Directed Energy Weapons. Focus areas include Space, Irregular Warfare, Information Operations, Cyber warfare and evolving war fighting techniques and support operations required new exploration and development.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Marine Corps Operational Test and Evaluation Activity (MCOTEA) supports the material acquisition process by managing the Marine Corps Operational Test (OT) programs for Acquisition Categories (ACAT) I through ACAT IV (less OT of manned aircraft) and performs other functions that may be directed by the Commandant of the Marine Corps. The primary purpose of Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&amp;E) is to provide information to the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) regarding the Operational Effectiveness (OE) and Operational Suitability (OS) of the system addressed at a decision point. MCOTEA must ensure that the Marines in the Operating Forces receive the very best possible equipment and support. MCOTEA must also ensure each system proposed for acquisition is tested adequately, evaluated objectively and reported independently.

Marine Corps Operational Test and Evaluation Activity (MCOTEA) is the only unit that provides the Marine Corps with required operational test and evaluation (OT&amp;E) capability, ensuring the Marine Corps is compliant with laws and regulations, and ensuring that training and equipment are operationally effective, relevant, and suitable.  Additionally, MCOTEA's early involvement, coordination, and oversight in developmental testing and evaluation of new combat and combat support systems ensures that our Marines are the best trained, and have the best equipment, with the lowest test costs for taxpayers. Finally, MCOTEA's support of rapid acquisitions ensures that Marines in the fight are supported with the newest and most advanced equipment and that the Marine Corps is compliant with regulations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Family of Incident Response Systems (FIRS) consists of equipment, systems, and services designed to provide Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) incident response forces the capabilities needed to effectively respond to a terrorist attack using Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High-Yield Explosives (CBRNE). FIRS meets the mission requirements for the detection; mass casualty decontamination; force protection; responder inter-agency interoperability; Command, Control, Communications, Computers &amp; Intelligence (C4I); urban search and rescue; medical and general support requirements needed by these forces to mitigate the effects of a CBRNE terrorist attack. FIRS relies primarily on Commercial Off-The-Shelf/Non-Developmental Items (COTS/NDI) equipment and systems that meet the particular mission requirements of Consequence Management (CM). Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical (NBC) systems are adopted if they meet the CM mission requirements. FIRS Research &amp; Development effort allows the program to keep abreast of emerging technologies in the commercial sector and address operational capability gaps that cannot be met by commercial items.

The increase in funding from FY16 to FY17 ($1.745M) reflects the increase of additional testing efforts required to maintain chemical and safety standards.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>1. The Fleet Experimentation (FLEX) program examines the doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel, facilities, and policy (DOTMLPF-P) solutions to identified warfighter capability gaps within the FYDP. The FLEX program considers warfighting gaps identified in: Integrated Prioritized Capability Lists (IPCL) generated by Warfighting Development Centers (WDC); USFF/CPF's Integrated Priorities Letter (IPL) delivered annually to the CNO; USFF/CPF's Commanders' FLEX Guidance; and Navy and Joint Urgent Operational Needs Statements. In addition, FLEX addresses innovative concepts, and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP), and Fleet Concepts of Operation (CONOPS) that collectively mitigate Fleet-identified warfighting capability gaps as defined by Commander, U.S. Fleet Forces' (CUSFF)/Commander, Pacific Fleet's (CPF) annual FLEX guidance. Through experimentation activities such as workshops, system or seminar war games, live at-sea events, and experimentation campaigns, the FLEX program examines potential materiel and non-materiel tangible solutions that will enhance the Fleet's ability to execute assigned missions. FLEX events and campaigns are comprised of all facets of experimentation including design, planning, systems engineering and integration, execution, data collection, analysis, assessment, and the delivery of tangible products to the fleet. While Naval-centric, FLEX efforts include joint, coalition, Science and Technology (S&amp;T), academia, and industry partners.

	Experimentation is vital to continuously improving naval warfighting capabilities. As such, the FLEX program directly supports four of the five elements outlined in the Secretary of the Navy's Innovation Vision: Build the Naval Innovation Network, Improve the Use of DON Information, Accelerate Emerging Operational Capabilities to the Fleet, and Develop Game-Changing Warfighting Concepts.

                                <r2:Description>Request a new Project Number for this Classified Project:  Expeditionary SFOC Communications

The Expeditionary Submarine Fiber Optic Cable (SFOC) Communications project is developing and experimenting innovative concepts designed to validate both material and non-material methodologies to provide resilient command and control within the maritime domain.  The project focus is to demonstrate capabilities that leverage existing DOD investments and infrastructure using non-traditional means to move data and information.  The key deliverable will be a demonstration using maritime assets, experimental methodologies, and current backhaul architecture to validate C2 data movement in the maritime domain.  Continue the development and refinement of advanced networking and communication capabilities in a maritime environment that promote C2 interoperability in Satellite Communications (SATCOM) - Restricted and SATCOM - Denied environments, and support the defeat Anti-Access Area Denial (A2/AD).  Solutions will address higher bandwidth technologies across the Radio Frequency (RF) and Optical spectrum.

D. Acquisition Strategy:

Expeditionary SFOC Communications is a non-acquisition program that promotes DoD interoperability to achieve resilient C2 data flows by facilitating maritime architectures in both processes and communications systems, including emerging capabilities, to counter growing high-end asymmetric threats, and is a key enabler of the Combatant Commanders C2 functionality.

E. Performance Metrics:
 Expeditionary SFOC Communications will employ laboratory testing and at-sea demonstrations to assess specific technologies, operational concepts, and integrated Doctrine, Organization, Training, Material, Leadership, Personnel and Facilities (DOTMLPF) solutions pertaining to C2 communications and other aspects of Information Dominance (ID).  These assessments will report on identified capability gaps, link capability gaps to technology/DOTMLPF gaps, identify technologies and DOTMLPF solutions considered ready for deployment, transition to a program of record to enhance war fighting capability and enhance interoperability.</r2:Description>
