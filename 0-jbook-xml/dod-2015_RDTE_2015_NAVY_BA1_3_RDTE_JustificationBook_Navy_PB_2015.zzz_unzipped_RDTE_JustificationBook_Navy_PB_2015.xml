                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program includes support for multidisciplinary basic research in a wide range of scientific and engineering disciplines that enable the U.S. Navy to maintain
technological superiority, and for university research infrastructure to acquire research instrumentation needed to maintain and improve the quality of university
research important to the Navy. Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative (MURI) efforts involve teams of researchers investigating high priority topics and
opportunities that intersect more than one traditional technical discipline. For many military problems this multidisciplinary approach serves to stimulate innovation,
accelerate research progress and expedite transition of results into Naval applications. The Defense University Research Instrumentation Program (DURIP) supports
university research infrastructure essential to high quality, Navy-relevant research. The instrumentation program complements other Navy research programs by
supporting the purchase of high cost research instrumentation that is necessary to carry out cutting-edge research. The program supports Presidential Early Career
Awards for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE), single investigator research efforts performed by outstanding academic scientists and engineers early in their research
careers. This program provides the knowledge base, scientific concepts, and technological advances for the maintenance of Naval power and national security.


Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Title>DEFENSE UNIVERSITY RESEARCH INSTRUMENTATION PROGRAM (DURIP)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>DURIP funds are provided to universities to purchase relatively high cost research instrumentation that is normally not included in single-investigator type research grants. Individual grants range from $50K to $1.5M. The DURIP program is an Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) interest item and OSD directs that funding for the DURIP efforts be awarded after OSD announces the awardees, which typically takes place towards the second half of the fiscal year. In turn, universities need to purchase the instrumentation and take delivery before any billings are generated. It frequently takes several months for delivery and billing to be completed.  DURIP is a one year program.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Title>MULTIDISCIPLINARY UNIVERSITY RESEARCH INITIATIVE (MURI)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>Research efforts include high priority topics that intersect more than one traditional discipline. MURI topics are selected to address Naval Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Focus Areas as described in the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan. 
The MURI program is an OSD interest item and OSD directs that funding for the MURI efforts be awarded after OSD announces the awardees, which typically takes place towards the second half of the fiscal year. Since the MURI program funds academic researchers, execution of the efforts typically ramps up during the summer academic break months. MURI projects make significant contributions to Navy and DoD objectives by; speeding up scientific programs by cross-fertilization of ideas, hastening the transition of basic research to practical applications, and training students in cross-disciplinary approaches to science and engineering research of importance to DoD. MURI is a five year program.

FY 2014 increased in funds to accommodate the increased number of new starts in FY 2014.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element (PE) sustains U.S. Naval Science and Technology (S&amp;T) superiority by providing new technological concepts for the maintenance of naval power and national security, and by helping to avoid scientific surprise while exploiting scientific breakthroughs and providing options for new Future Naval Capabilities (FNCs).  The Department of Navy (DON) component responds to S&amp;T directions of the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan for long term Navy and Marine Corps improvements and is in consonance with future warfighting concepts and doctrine developed at the Naval Warfare Development Command and the Marine Corps Combat Development Command.  It enables technologies that significantly improve the Joint Chiefs of Staff's Future Joint Warfighting Capabilities.  The In-house Laboratory Independent Research (ILIR) program also adds increased emphasis to the revitalization of the scientist and engineer workforce component at the Navy's Warfare Centers and Laboratories by attracting superior candidates and retaining our best members through the provision of exciting and meaningful work.

This PE addresses DON Basic Research, which includes scientific study and experimentation directed toward increasing knowledge and understanding in national-security related aspects of physical, engineering, environmental, and life sciences, and is the core of Discovery and Invention.  Basic research projects are developed, managed, and related to more advanced aspects of research in some hundred-plus technology and capability-related 'thrusts', which are consolidated in thirteen research focus areas: Power and Energy; Operational Environments; Maritime Domain Awareness; Asymmetric and Irregular Warfare; Information, Analysis and Communication; Power Projection; Assure Access and Hold at Risk; Distributed Operations; Naval Warfighter Performance and Protection; Survivability and Self-Defense; Platform Mobility; Fleet/Force Sustainment; Affordability, Maintainability and Reliability.  

This portion of the DON Basic Research Program provides participating Naval Warfare Centers and Laboratories with funding for: basic research to support the execution of their assigned missions; developing and maintaining a cadre of active researchers who can distill and extend results from worldwide research and apply them to solve Naval problems; promoting hiring and development of new scientists; and encouragement of collaboration with universities, private industry, and other Navy and Department of Defense laboratories.  

ILIR efforts are selected by Naval Warfare Centers/Lab Commanding Officers and Technical Directors near the start of each Fiscal Year through internal competition.  Efforts typically last three years, and are generally designed to assess the promise of new lines of research.  Successful efforts attract external, competitively awarded funding.  Because the Warfare Centers and Labs encompass the full range of naval technology interests, the scope of ILIR topics roughly parallels that of PE 0601153N, Defense Research Science.

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

- Completed research for Control and Dispersion of Electromagnetic Energy Using Metamaterials, where the dispersion and control of electromagnetic (EM) waves in the microwave (RF) region, using fabricated metamaterial structures, were demonstrated. Six metamaterial structures were modeled using in-house programs, DOD supercomputer resources, and High Frequency Structure Simulation (HFSS) software, and fabricated use photolithography, vapor deposition, and chemical and reactive ion etching.

- Continued research on the microbial biosynthesis of critical energetic ingredients.
- Continued research for accelerated quantum chemistry simulations of energetics using a novel metadynamics approach.
- Continued research for convergent synthesis of high performance heterocycles via late amination.
- Continued research to investigate the dispersion and control of electromagnetic (EM) waves in the microwave (RF) region using fabricated metamaterial structures.
- Continued ILIR projects that are intended to be approximately three years in length. Projects selected for FY 2012 will focus on supporting Naval Battlespace Awareness and Intelligent Naval Sensors, Innovative Naval Prototype initiatives in Persistent Surveillance and Sea Basing, and the National Naval Responsibility in Undersea Weaponry.
- Completed FY 2011 initiated ILIR projects during FY 2013.
- Completed the research on the Microbial Biosynthesis of Critical Energetic Ingredients which investigated new methods of microbial synthesis in the production of feedstocks for energetics. Microbial synthesis is the controlled harvesting of organic molecules from biological factories such as E. coli. It is hypothesized that large scale control and manipulation of these efficient microbial factories could lead to increased availability of traditionally rare feedstocks, enhanced sustainability due to the reduced need for organics from non-petroleum-derived feedstocks, and the significant reduction of hazardous waste.
- Completed the research for Accelerated Quantum Chemistry Simulations of Energetics using a Novel Metadynamics Approach, the goal of which is to develop methods based on a metadynamics approach that can predict important chemical properties of energetic materials and additives that are normally inaccessible to first-principles simulation. The main properties used to evaluate the method are uni- and bimolecular decomposition barriers, oxidation reactions, accelerated aging studies, and crystalline density predictions. The focus will be on complex or
novel systems that have previously been difficult to simulate, such as polymer chains, novel high-nitrogen explosives, and organometallic compounds.
- Completed the research for Convergent Synthesis of High Performance Heterocycles via Late Amination, which focuses on convergent synthesis of energetic, high nitrogen CHNO heterocycles using novel energetic synthons to provide increased performance to Navy ordnance.
Designing higher heats of formation and higher densities into novel energetic CHNO compounds, while retaining good kinetic stability and safety properties, requires new structural motifs. The 1,2,3,4-tetrazine 1,3-dioxide structural motif, first described by Tartakovsky et al. in the
1991 synthesis of benzo tetrazine dioxide, remains an undeveloped energetic synthon. Although furazano tetrazine dioxide has been known for the last decade, its energetic properties are still unknown. The synthetic routes chosen are expected to permit ready transition to the pilot level and offer reasonably priced materials.

                                            <r2:Text>- Continued ILIR projects that are intended to be approximately three years in length. Based on historical trends, approximately 30% of ILIR projects will turn over each year.
- Continued research for characterization of decision making behaviors associated with Human Systems Integration (HSI) design tradeoffs.
- Continued research for Localization of human spatial processing using dense-array Electroencephalography.
- Continued Integration of an implantable potentiostat for continuous monitoring of Nitric Oxide (NO) into a rat model of Hyperbaric Oxygen (HBO) toxicity.
- Continued research to characterize the naturalistic decision making processes used in Naval Aviation acquisition programs to assess cost, schedule and performance tradeoffs within and between Human Systems Integration (HSI) domains. Content analysis will be performed to identify knowledge, skills, abilities, heuristics, and biases associated with HSI decision making.
- Continued ILIR projects that are intended to be approximately three years in length. Projects selected for FY 2012 will focus on supporting Naval Battlespace Awareness and Intelligent Naval Sensors, Innovative Naval Prototype initiatives in Persistent Surveillance and Sea Basing, and the National Naval Responsibility in Undersea Weaponry.
- Completed FY 2011 initiated ILIR projects during FY 2013.
- Completed research for Characterization of Decision Making Behaviors Associated with Human Systems Integration (HSI) Design Tradeoffs,
where analysis is performed to identify knowledge, skills, abilities, heuristics, and biases associated with HSI decision making. This incorporates a coding study to gauge inter-rater reliability as part of the content analysis. The results will be used to (a) generate assessment test materials for a follow-on decision making experiment, and (b) create a summary of the recorded HSI tradeoff case studies, including key learnings and a description of tradeoff decision requirements.
- Completed research for Localization of Human Spatial Processing using Dense-array Electroencephalography. Aviation mishap statistics
confirm that in-flight spatial disorientation (SD) poses one of the greatest human factor problems for military aviators. The impact of this cognitive threat costs the DoD an average of 20 aircraft and 25 flight personnel annually. Recent animal research has identified specialized neural structures involved in spatial orientation. The objective of this research is to determine if spatial neural mechanisms found in animal
studies and in human functional magnetic resonance imaging tests can be further localized and defined by introducing limited ranges of normal
human motion.
- Completed Integration of an Implantable Potentiostat for Continuous Monitoring of Nitric Oxide (NO) into a Rat Model of Hyperbaric Oxygen (HBO) Toxicity. The U.S. Navy has long used oxygen breathing for covert underwater operations. The major limitation to HBO is the risk of HBO-induced pulmonary and central nervous system toxicity. NO is a critical second messenger involved in the pathophysiology of HBO-induced toxicity. The study examines an implantable NO sensor in conjunction with both traditional and experimental implantable potentiostats. This work will lead to the development of new research capabilities to measure NO production in vivo.

- Continued research for the numerical analysis and design of methods for Partial Differential Equations (PDE) constrained optimization.
- Continued research for framework for collaborative robotic asset management.
- Continued research to develop a theory of Systems-of-Systems (SoS) network engineering and analysis based on the theory of time series of attributed graphs to understand how such systems can be mathematically formulated, simulated, analyzed, and tested.
- Continued ILIR projects that are intended to be approximately three years in length. Projects selected for FY 2011 will focus on supporting Naval Battlespace Awareness and Intelligent Naval Sensors, Innovative Naval Prototype initiatives in Persistent Surveillance and Sea Basing, and the National Naval Responsibility in Undersea Weaponry.
- Completed FY 2011 initiated ILIR projects during FY 2013.
- Completed research for the Numerical Analysis and Design of Methods for Partial Differential Equations (PDE) Constrained Optimization.PDE Constrained Optimization problems arise in many areas of science and engineering, and include problems such as optimal shape design and parameter estimation. While advanced methods for general, non-linear optimization have existed for over a half century, the existence of PDE constraints in optimization problems make the existing optimization methods at best inefficient, and often times infeasible. The goal is to design and analyze new methods which build on previous efforts developed over the last decade, and enable these new methods to be used on
problems currently seen in the analysis of naval systems.
- Completed research for Systems-of-Systems (SoS) Network Analysis where the design of Systems-of-Systems (SoS) requires careful analysis of not only the subsystems, but also the interconnections between the subsystems. These interconnections could possibly correspond to dependencies, communications, shared information, joint operation, or other relationships. This research seeks to develop a theory of SoS engineering and analysis based on graph theory, in particular the theory of time series of attributed graphs, in which the vertices and edges may have attributes (such as readiness levels or communication throughput). This theory will involve both a mathematical formulation of the SoS
problem, but also a consideration of how such systems can be simulated, analyzed, and tested.
- Completed research for Framework for Collaborative Robotic Asset Management where a formalized and extensible approach for discovering,modeling, monitoring, and managing a distributed collection of disparate unmanned systems is defined. This framework will support near real-time system modeling, resource appraisal, and brokering functionalities while using scalable, abstract representations of mission, job,and resource capabilities to provide new levels of intelligent resource utilization to the Navy. The proposed work directly supports research initiatives in the areas of underwater communication networks, minimal operator intervention, intelligent decision-making, and promotes
increased situational awareness. This project will present the design of a hierarchical architecture of software components and definition of the elements that comprise the framework Knowledge Representation Scheme in order to provide deliberative management capabilities for a system of collaborating robotic assets.

- Continued research for high fidelity, Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) cavitation simulation.
- Continued research for development of a new vehicle dynamics-based motion planning and control algorithm into the motion planning process.
- Continued research for wall pressure fluctuation measurements in high Reynolds number turbulent pipe flow.
- Continued research to characterize the biaxial fatigue behavior of carrier-based aircraft in a corrosive environment, identify the
basic mechanism of environment assisted biaxial fatigue cracking, develop an accurate model for corrosion fatigue crack growth under biaxial loading, and demonstrate and validate the model in the application to aircraft structure.
- Continued ILIR projects that are intended to be approximately three years in length. Projects selected for FY 2012 will focus on supporting Naval Battlespace Awareness and Intelligent Naval Sensors, Innovative Naval Prototype initiatives in Persistent Surveillance and Sea Basing, and the National Naval Responsibility in Undersea Weaponry.
- Completed FY 2011 initiated ILIR projects during FY 2013.
- Completed Optical Propagation Studies for Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) Underwater Laser Communications. This project's objective investigated the fundamental propagation characteristics of "broad beam", or diffused, light sources for N-LOS optical links. N-LOS links provide the benefits of decreased pointing-and-tracking complexity, increased time for link closure, and decreased sensitivity to obstructions.
This project studied how the spatial distribution of light caused by scattering, or shaping of the initial source beam distribution, affects the
propagation of modulated light in water and optimal source distributions matched to particular undersea environments.
- Completed research for Turbulent Wake Characterization, where understanding the details of complex turbulent flows around a submerged body is critical for analysis of a propulsor operating in its wake. The inflow characteristics to the propulsor have a significant impact on its performance. This project focuses on predicting the turbulent wake characteristics of a submerged, appended, model-scale body using Large
Eddy Simulation (LES) techniques. Because the propulsor impacts the pressure field, it has an effect on its own inflow; therefore, the ultimate goal of this project will be to model a propulsor and an appended body in the same domain using LES.
- Completed research for Surface Piercing Strut Wake Signature Reduction. Surface piercing struts in motion relative to water generate a fairly complex wave, producing a rising bow wave in the front of the strut, a cavity on the sides and a wake behind. The size of this white water wake is a function of the strut shape, Reynolds number (Re), Froude number (Fr), water salinity, surfactants, etc. The objective of this effort is to understand the bubble generation and transport phenomena, ideally minimizing the bubble entrainment visual detection to a level comparable to the strut itself. Two approaches are investigated: 1) an experimental method that provides insight into the physics of the flow field; and 2) a computational method that validates the existing results and tests new concepts.

                                            <r2:Text>- Continued ILIR projects that are intended to be approximately three years in length. Based on historical trends, approximately 30% of ILIR projects will turn over each year.
- Continued optical propagation studies for Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) underwater laser communications.
- Continued research for turbulent wake characterization
- Continued research for surface piercing strut wake signature reduction.
- Continued research to assess the effects of Mid-Frequency Active (MFA) sonar on the movement of fish species in a natural environment, to compare the behavior and movement of fish prior to exposure to sonar, during exposure, and for a significant amount of time post-exposure to provide valuable data on fish behavior, movement, and survival following exposure to highintensity,tactical MFA sonar.
- Continued ILIR projects that are intended to be approximately three years in length. Projects selected for FY 2012 will focus on supporting Naval Battlespace Awareness, Innovative Naval Prototype initiatives in Persistent Surveillance and Sea Basing, and National Naval Responsibility initiatives in Ocean Acoustics and Undersea Weaponry.
- Completed FY 2011 initiated ILIR projects during FY 2013.
- Completed Optical Propagation Studies for Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) Underwater Laser Communications. This project's objective investigated the fundamental propagation characteristics of "broad beam", or diffused, light sources for N-LOS optical links. N-LOS links provide the benefits of decreased pointing-and-tracking complexity, increased time for link closure, and decreased sensitivity to obstructions.
This project studied how the spatial distribution of light caused by scattering, or shaping of the initial source beam distribution, affects the propagation of modulated light in water and optimal source distributions matched to particular undersea environments.
- Completed research for Turbulent Wake Characterization, where understanding the details of complex turbulent flows around a submerged body is critical for analysis of a propulsor operating in its wake. The inflow characteristics to the propulsor have a significant impact on its performance. This project focuses on predicting the turbulent wake characteristics of a submerged, appended, model-scale body using Large Eddy Simulation (LES) techniques. Because the propulsor impacts the pressure field, it has an effect on its own inflow; therefore, the ultimate goal of this project will be to model a propulsor and an appended body in the same domain using LES.
- Completed research for Surface Piercing Strut Wake Signature Reduction. Surface piercing struts in motion relative to water generate a fairly complex wave, producing a rising bow wave in the front of the strut, a cavity on the sides and a wake behind. The size of this white water wake is a function of the strut shape, Reynolds number (Re), Froude number (Fr), water salinity, surfactants, etc. The objective of this effort is to understand the bubble generation and transport phenomena, ideally minimizing the bubble entrainment visual detection to a level comparable to the strut itself. Two approaches are investigated: 1) an experimental method that provides insight into the physics of the flow field; and 2) a computational method that validates the existing results and tests new concepts.
- Initiated research for Littoral Mine Detection and Avoidance.
- Initiated research for Compact Broad Band Low Frequency Sonar.
- Initiated research for Advanced Obstacle Avoidance for Unmanned Systems.
- Initiated ILIR projects that are intended to be approximately three years in length. Projects selected for FY 2013 will focus on supporting Naval Battlespace Awareness and Intelligent Naval Sensors, Innovative Naval Prototype initiatives in Persistent Surveillance and Sea Basing, and the National Naval Responsibility in Undersea Weaponry.</r2:Text>

                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>The ILIR initiative seeks to improve the quality of defense research conducted predominantly through the Naval Warfare Centers/Laboratories.  It also supports the development of technical intellect and education of engineers and scientists in disciplines critical to national defense needs through the development of new knowledge in a military laboratory environment.  Initial research focus is often conducted in an unfettered environment since it is basic research, but many projects focus on applying recently developed theoretical knowledge to real world military problems with the intention of developing new capabilities and improving the performance of existing systems.  Individual project metrics then become more tailored to the needs of specific applied research and advanced development programs.  The National Research Council of the National Academies of Science and Engineering's Congressionally directed "Assessment of Department of Defense Basic Research" concluded that the DoD is managing its basic research program effectively.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element (PE) sustains U.S. Naval Science and Technology (S&amp;T) superiority, provides new technological concepts for the maintenance of naval power and national security, and helps avoid scientific surprise.  It is based on investment directions as defined in the Naval Science &amp; Technology Strategy approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (Sep 2011).  This new strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It exploits scientific breakthroughs and provides options for new Future Naval Capabilities (FNCs) and Innovative Naval Prototypes (INPs).  

This PE addresses basic research efforts including scientific study and experimentation directed toward increasing knowledge and understanding in national security related aspects of physical, engineering, environmental and life sciences.  Basic research efforts are developed, managed, and related to more advanced aspects of research on the order of a hundred technology and capability-related 'thrusts', which are consolidated into about fifteen research areas.  These in turn support the major research areas of the Navy and Marine Corps: Autonomous Systems; Command, Control, Communications and Computers (C4); Marine as a System; Information Analysis and Decision Support; Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance; Logistics; Materials; Operational Environments; Platforms; Power and Energy Technology; Sensors and Electronics; Warrior Performance and Protection; Weapons and Support (Education and Outreach).

S&amp;T investment in basic research also includes the National Naval Responsibilities (NNRs), fields upon which a wide range of fundamental Naval capabilities depend.  There are currently five NNRs.

S&amp;T investment in basic research also includes the Basic Research Challenge program which was established to competitively select and fund promising research programs in new areas not addressed by the current basic research program.  The Basic Research Challenge Program stimulates new, high-risk basic research projects in multi-disciplinary and departmental collaborative efforts, and funds topics that foster leading edge science and attracts new principal investigators and organizations.  Basic Research Challenge awards are for a period of four years.

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>The ONR Basic Research Challenge (BRC) program was established in 2008 to competitively select and fund promising research programs in new areas not addressed by the current basic research program.  In the past, the Basic Research Challenge Program has been integrated into the legacy R2 Activities to illustrate its alignment with the mainstream Naval research disciplines, but with this update BRC is being identified as its own R2 Activity to call attention to the significance it provides to new areas of Naval importance.  The program stimulates new, high-risk basic research projects in multidisciplinary and departmental collaborative efforts, and funds topics that foster leading edge science and attract new principal investigators and organizations. Basic Research Challenge awards are for a period of four years. Topics are submitted by ONR program officers and are selected for BRC awards by ONR's director of research. Basic Research Challenge award topics are then issued as a broad agency announcement.

In FY 2014 the BRC is being identified under its own Research Activity to highlight its more prominent role in stimulating competitive multidisciplinary research between ONR departments. BRC research by its nature will likely cross the traditional Research Activity boundaries and produce standout results worthy of specific focused attention.  

Funding decrease in FY 2015 due to normalization of annual investment following initial emphasis in program research.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Defense Basic Research seeks to improve the quality of defense research conducted predominantly through universities and government laboratories.  It also supports the education of engineers and scientists in disciplines critical to national defense needs through the development of new knowledge in an academic environment.  Initial research focus is generally conducted in an unfettered environment because of the nature of basic research, but as more is learned and applications emerge, individual research projects take on a more applied focus.  Individual project metrics then become more tailored to the needs of specific applied research and advanced development programs.  Example metrics include a biporous wick structure for thermal management of power electric modules capable of removing 900 watts per square centimeter which was recently developed by an academia/industry team.  The National Research Council of the National Academies of Science and Engineering's congressionally directed "Assessment of Department of Defense Basic Research" concluded that the DoD is managing its basic research program effectively.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>FY 2013 funding associated with Future Naval Capability (FNC) efforts were transferred to a new Program Element titled Future Naval Capabilities Applied Research (PE 0602750N).  This is to enhance the visibility of the FNC Program by providing an easily navigable overview of all 6.2 FNC investments in a single location.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (Sep 2011).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare.

This PE supports both advanced technology research and near to mid-term transition opportunities.  The advanced research focus is primarily on high energy lasers, Electromagnetic Railgun (EMRG) development, Hyper Velocity Projectiles (HVP), high speed weapon propulsion, and electro-optic/infrared (EO/IR) sensor technologies. 

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>The goal of this activity is to develop Directed Energy (DE) technology for Navy applications. The DE program addresses the requirements of future Navy combatants to provide ship defense against the emerging threats that are proliferating throughout the Navies of the world. The Directed Energy portion of this activity consists of two elements. The first element involves applied research and development of technologies supporting advanced accelerators with applications to directed energy weapons. This activity also includes the Free Electron Laser (FEL) Innovative Naval Prototype (INP) which will deliver multi-mission capability. 

 
FY 2013 to FY 2014 and FY 2014 to FY 2015 increases in funding are due to increased work on the Solid State Laser (SSL) program. The SSL-QRC program was initiated during FY 2013 and is planned to complete during FY 2015 with plans to demonstrate the system at sea in CY 2014.</r2:Description>

                                            <r2:Text>Directed Energy and Accelerator Research:
- Continued to develop the most promising component technologies such as normal conducting and super conducting RF electron beam injectors, advanced high power cathode technologies, high power compact amplifiers, and advanced mirrors, coatings and optical components capable of handling the significantly higher energies. Consider analysis of smaller FEL system designs.

Applied Electromagnetics for High Power Weapons:
-Completed the development of Gallium Nitride as an advanced nonlinear optic material. 
-Completed applied research into applied electromagnetics as it relates to lasers, high power microwaves, and advanced sensors for Directed Energy Weapons. 

Solid State Laser - Technology Maturation (SSL-TM):
-Initiated the development of technologies suitable for a solid state laser weapon system, including technologies for maritime beam director, targeting and laser subsystems, which are capable of supporting future Navy missions to defeat small boat swarms, UAV swarms, and provide potential ISR disruption and/or defeat.  This work supports future prototype developments and will include laser subsystem (potentially both slab and fiber solid state systems) and required beam director scientific studies. The focus of the effort will be to support the development and advancement of future Navy Solid State Laser prototypes, including the development of lethality studies and atmospheric characterization. These scientific studies are critical to understand and support missions identified for a layered defensive capability, in the maritime environment, which shall include robust modeling and simulation of atmospheric absorption and turbulence.
-Conducted lethality testing for notional solid state laser designs. This will include scientific studies of laser erosion, pitting, and ablation of various target materials for improved modeling and simulation, that will support development of the governing technical requirements for a beam director and targeting system capable of performing Navy surface ship self defense missions.  
-Initiated and conducted studies of atmospheric absorption and turbulence, suitable to evaluate notional maritime beam director subsystems, and including studies in adaptive optics for improved lethality performance in low altitude, maritime surface conditions. These scientific studies are critical to understanding the impact of boundary layer and sea-water-air turbulent mechanics on future laser weapons systems and interfaces.
-Initiated and conducted trade studies on innovative solid state laser subsystems designs, based off industry available technologies or those technologies identified by the High Energy Laser Joint Technology Office (HEL JTO). These investments will be considered "break through" type of investments, which require additional scientific study to determine their potential for  near term capability improvements in a future naval prototype system.
-Initiated and conducted scientific studies on laser subcomponents, including laser pump diodes and laser gain media, which have the potential to support future acquisition programs, but are based on solid state laser technologies. Efforts in this area will focus on emerging commercial technologies and government sponsored research, which are suitable for use in a maritime domain. Research and technology developments will include advancements suitable for use by either solid state slab or solid state fiber optic laser subsystems - and which if matured, would enable rapid scientific advancements and improve specific systems performance against key performance parameters.
-Initiated and conducted scientific trade studies of notional predictive avoidance systems, which examine the control interfaces between sensors and future prototypical naval laser weapons, which would provide an inherent "safe-arm" function for the projecting of laser power at long range (potentially beyond typical visible, line of sight distances.) Of particular concern is the designs for safety in future laser weapons to halt laser energy propagation, while performing Navy surface ship self defense missions, and avoid inadvertent illumination of non-threat forces (e.g. friendly sensors or platforms.)</r2:Text>

                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>This PE develops early components technologies that can be integrated into weapon systems that meet warfighter requirements.  Most of the work in this PE can be classified between Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 2 (technology concept and/or application formulation) and TRL 4 (component and/or breadboard validation in laboratory environments).  The metrics used to evaluate 6.2 programs are necessarily less precise than those used in 6.3 programs. 

The metrics for this PE can be divided into two categories:  technological and organizational/functional.  Technological metrics address the success of the work performed.  The primary technological metrics used in this PE involve laboratory experiments/tests demonstrating proof of the concept for the technology.  This demonstration is frequently a hand-assembled functioning breadboard of the concept.  The organizational/functional metrics applied to this PE include:  transition of the technology to advanced development in a 6.3 PE and applicability of the technology to documented warfighter problems or requirements.  Successful implementation of these categories would result in the application of a pass/fail metric and further evaluation for possible transition to a 6.3 development/demonstration program.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                                        <r2:Text>The UTC initiative continued to design, develop, integrate, test and demonstrate a gun hardened Guidance, Navigation, Control and Targeting (GNC&amp;T) system.  UTC was leveraging its technologies and system components to enhance the value added for precision guided munitions.  As part of the initiative, UTC is developing a shortwave infra-red (SWIR) low cost multimode seeker.  Employing advanced technologies inherent in reconnaissance cameras these devices serve as both a superior semi-active laser (SAL) and a high resolution imaging seeker.  In FY13, UTC submitted milestone deliverables with a summary system technical data package complete with functional flow diagrams, performance requirements, and system architecture. UTC delivered a prototype SWIR seeker complete with performance predictions based on field test data.   The remainder of FY13 focused on integration and functionality into a compact, miniaturized modular seeker configuration and engineering builds and testing in laboratory environments and supersonic rocket testing to collect additional survivability and performance characteristics.</r2:Text>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>FY 2013 funding associated with Future Naval Capability (FNC) efforts are transferring to a new Program Element titled Future Naval Capabilities Applied Research (PE 0602750N).  This is to enhance the visibility of the FNC Program by providing an easily navigable overview of all 6.2 FNC investments in a single location.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this program element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (Sep 2011).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare.

This PE addresses applied research associated with providing the capability of Platform and Force Protection for the U.S. Navy.  It supports the development of technologies associated with all naval platforms (surface, subsurface, terrestrial, and air) and the protection of those platforms.  The goal is to provide the ability to win or avoid engagements with other platforms or weapons and, in the event of engagement, to resist and control damage while preserving operational capability.  Within the Naval Transformational Roadmap, this investment directly supports the Theater Air and Missile Defense transformational capability required by Sea Shield and the Ship to Objective Maneuver key transformational capability.  This is accomplished by improvements in platform offensive performance, stealth, and self defense.  

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project addresses applied research associated with providing the capability of Platform and Force Protection for the U.S. Navy.  It supports the development of technologies associated with all naval platforms (surface, subsurface, terrestrial, and air) and the protection of those platforms.  The goal is to provide the ability to win or avoid engagements with other platforms or weapons and, in the event of engagement, to resist and control damage while preserving operational capability.  Within the Naval Transformational Roadmap, this investment directly supports the Theater Air and Missile Defense transformational capability required by Sea Shield and the Ship to Objective Maneuver key transformational capability by virtue of improvements in platform offensive performance, stealth, and self defense.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Title>AIRCRAFT TECHNOLOGY</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The Aircraft Technology activity develops technologies for reduced observables technology and enhanced capability of naval aviation aircraft platforms in terms of mission effectiveness, platform range, responsiveness, survivability, observability, readiness, safety and life cycle cost. It also develops new Naval air vehicle concepts and high impact, scaleable naval air vehicle technologies, such as - autonomous air vehicle command and control, helicopter and tiltrotor rotor systems, aerodynamics, propulsion systems, materials, structures and flight controls for future and legacy air vehicles. This activity directly supports the Naval Aviation Enterprise Science and Technology Objectives and the Naval Science and Technology Strategic Plan, principally in the Autonomy and Unmanned Systems, Platform Design and Survivability, Power and Energy and Total Ownership Cost Focus Areas, Sea-Based Aviation was designated as a National Naval Responsibility (SBA NNR) in FY 2011 and will refocus investments beginning in FY 2014 in areas that are Naval unique or dominated by Naval requirements. 

Variable Cycle Advanced Technology (VCAT) will identify and mature critical, relevant variable/adaptive cycle propulsion system technologies for the next generation carrier-based TACAIR/ISR systems. Autonomous Aerial Cargo/Utility System (AACUS) will develop advanced autonomous capabilities to enable rapid resupply of distributed forces in the short term. The SBA NNR Structures and Materials program will develop the next generation structural capability and material response science for aircraft technology in fixed and rotary wing, manned and unmanned airframe technology to achieve reduced weight, increased durability, strength, streamlined manufacturability, reduced life-cycle cost and maintenance/readiness gaps improvements. Program payoffs include increased availability/readiness, reduced sustainment requirements, fatigue/loads life enhancement, reduced weight and improved range, and advanced prognostics design tools. 

Beginning in FY 2014, applied research efforts will begin under the Sea-Based Aviation National Naval Responsibility (SBA NNR) Propulsion thrust area as well, resulting in the funding increase in FY 2014.  

These efforts addresses unique attributes to propulsion and power technologies for Naval Aviation, as well as those having higher importance to Naval Aviation and some that are more pervasive to all of military aviation. Related basic research efforts are addressed under 0601153N.

The funding decrease from FY 2014 to FY 2015 is due to the AACUS funding decreasing significantly as the effort is nearing completion.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Fleet Force Protection and Defense against Undersea Threats efforts include applied research for complementary sensor and processing technologies for platform protection.  Current small platforms (both surface and airborne) have little to no situational awareness (SA) or self-protection against air, surface, and asymmetric threats.  A goal of this activity is to provide these platforms with effective self-protection.  The technology areas specific to platform protection will develop individual, multispectral electro-optical (EO), infrared (IR), radio frequency (RF), electro-magnetic (EM), visual and acoustic or chemical sensors/biosensors and associated processing.  To defend platforms from current and advanced threats in at-sea littoral environments and in port, these technologies must improve multispectral detection and distribution of specific threat information. 

The funding decrease from FY 2014 to FY 2015 is due to re-scoping/re-phasing of various efforts in this R-2 Activity.  This re-scoping was done to re-prioritize S&amp;T investments.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) encompasses the Independent Applied Research (IAR) efforts focused on solving a wide range of Naval Science and Technology (S&amp;T) fleet issues utilizing unique Naval Warfare Center (WC) laboratory capabilities. Efforts under this activity address the full spectrum of the DON S&amp;T Strategic Plan technology using focus areas which engage Naval aviation, sea surface, undersea, space, weapons, communication, information, and human systems. The IAR Program provides participating WCs with in-house funding for applied research to support the execution of their assigned missions by; 
-Developing and maintaining a cadre of active researchers who can distill and extend results from worldwide research and apply them to solve Naval problems.
-Promoting the hiring and development of talented new scientists and engineers (S&amp;E) with the insurance of proper mentoring with senior personnel
-Encouraging collaboration with universities, private industry, and other Navy and Department of Defense laboratories. 

Funded projects are chosen through rigorous internal competition by each WC's selection committee and typically last two to three years.  IAR projects are generally designed to promote investment in high-risk/high-payoff research and also allow young S&amp;Es to manage Navy relevant research projects. A limited number of successful efforts developed under the In-House Laboratory Independent Research (ILIR) basic research Program Element 0601152N are matured and further developed under the IAR program with the goal of transitioning these technologies to the warfighter. 

The IAR R2 activity was stood up in FY 2013 as the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) to consolidate all NRE related IAR investments. Projects funded in this R2 Activity are intended to be approximately 2-3 years in length.  Based on historical trends approximately 30% of these projects will turn over each year.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (June 2012).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare.

This PE is organized into nine activities which are represented as seven Expeditionary Warfighting Capability Areas, as well as Future Concepts, Technology Assessment and Roadmapping, and the Littoral Combat/Power Projection (LC/PP) FNC.  The primary objective of this PE is to develop and demonstrate the technologies needed to meet the Marine Corps unique responsibility of training and equipping the Marine Air/Ground Task Force (MAGTF) for Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare.  In the post-September 11 world, irregular warfare (IW) has emerged as the dominant form of warfare confronting the United States, its allies and its partners; accordingly, this PE has been structured to account for distributed, long-duration operations, including unconventional warfare, counterterrorism, counterinsurgency, and stabilization and reconstruction operations.  IW emphasizes the use of indirect, non-conventional methods and means to subvert, attrite, and exhaust an adversary, or render irrelevant, rather than defeat him through direct conventional military confrontation.   IW is now institutionalized in Marine Corps planning, investment, and capability development.  This PE provides the knowledge base to support Advanced Technology Development (6.3) and is the technology base for future expeditionary warfare capabilities.  This PE supports the Expeditionary Force Development System of the Marine Corps Combat Development Command (MCCDC) and responds directly to the Marine Corps Science and Technology (S&amp;T) process as well as supporting related Littoral and Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare capabilities developed by the Navy's Mission Capability Program.  The Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) process is supported and funds are programmed accordingly.  The FNC program explores and demonstrates technologies that enable Sea Strike, Sea Shield, Sea Basing, FORCEnet and Force Health Protection pillars, Space, Naval Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare and the Enterprise and Platform Enablers.  The FNC program comprises Enabling Capabilities (ECs) which develop and deliver quantifiable products (i.e., prototype systems, knowledge products, and technology improvements) in response to validated requirements for insertion into acquisition programs of record after meeting agreed upon exit criteria within five years. The core 6.2 program also supports Discovery and Invention (D&amp;I) and Innovation and Transformation (I&amp;T).  Within the Naval Transformation Roadmap, this investment will achieve key transformational capabilities required by the Sea Power 21 Pillars, as well as enable Ship to Objective Maneuver (STOM), Persistent Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO).  The Marine Corps Service Campaign Plan (MCSCP) is the lens through which USMC S&amp;T priorities are acted upon to guide the future development of the Total Force.
Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>This activity addresses the applied research associated with the Marine Corps participation in the Department of the Navy's (DoN) Science and Technology Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) Program.  The FNC Program represents the requirements-driven, delivery-oriented portion of the DoN Science and Technology (S&amp;T) portfolio.  FNC investments respond to Naval S&amp;T Gaps that are generated by the Navy and Marine Corps after receiving input from Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders.  The funding is aligned with the Naval challenges associated with projecting power despite anti-access and area denial, specifically the Sea Shield, Power and Energy, FORCEnet, and the Naval Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare warfighting capability gaps. The funding profile reflects the alignment of the FNC program investments into Enabling Capabilities (ECs); ECs respond to priority Naval warfighting capability gaps.  Funding for each EC is aligned to a 6.2 or 6.3 Budget Activity (BA) as appropriate.  Concurrent funding for Naval Expeditionary Warfare capability ECs is also provided from Navy PE0602750N and PE0603673N. Both of the Navy PE's were included in the FY 2013 President's Budget Request and are now the only program elements funding Navy FNC work.  In previous submissions 7 Navy 6.2 PEs and 8 Navy 6.3 PEs funded FNC efforts.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>This activity supports Marine Corps Expeditionary Logistics which is the practical discipline and real world application of the deployment, sustainment, reconstitution, and re-deployment of forces engaged in expeditionary operations.  Expeditionary Logistics replaces mass with assured knowledge and speed, is equally capable ashore or afloat in austere environments, and is fully scalable to meet uncertain requirements.  Expeditionary Logistics logically divides into five pillars:  deployment support, force closure, sustainment, reconstitution/redeployment, and command and control.  These pillars are thoroughly integrated and perpetually related in execution.

The FY 2014 to FY 2015 funding decrease is due to the early completion and transition of a solid oxide fuel cell capable of directly oxidizing liquid logistic fuels.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Maneuver thrust area focuses on the development, demonstration, and transition of technologies that will increase the warfighting capabilities and effectiveness of the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF).  This thrust aims at capturing emerging and "leap ahead" technologies in the areas of mobility, materials, propulsion, survivability, durability, signature reduction, modularity, and unmanned systems.  Special emphasis on survivability technologies for the defeat of small arms, IEDs, mine blast, and RPGs continue to be incorporated into this thrust area.  Efforts also continue in the development of modeling and simulation tools that integrate many different physics based modeling systems with rigorous operational analysis simulations to accurately define a system's performance characteristics.  These tools will aid in defining the trade space for emerging technologies and assist in providing the program manager insight and guidance into pursuing future technologies.  Finally, this technology thrust area also seeks to develop technologies to enhance combat vehicle crewman effectiveness and situational awareness through the incorporation of advanced autonomous vehicle functions triggered directly by the cognitive state of the operator.

The FY 2014 to FY 2015 decrease in funding is due to a decrease in the plans to initiate and develop autonomous technologies transcribing vision-based perception data.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>This activity supports S&amp;T investment in Command and Control and is focused in three main areas:  (1) Implementing the FORCEnet concept; (2) Developing decision support systems that enable warfighters to take advantage of the FORCEnet and MAGTF C2, and tactically extend Net-Enabled Command and Control (NECC) for shared situational awareness; and (3) Providing effective combat identification of enemy combatants, friendly forces, and non-combatants.  FORCEnet is the operational construct and architectural framework for naval warfare in the information age that integrates warriors, networks, command and control, and weapons into a networked, distributed, combat force that is scalable across all levels of conflict from the seabed to space, and from sea to land. The Marine Corps instantiation of FORCEnet is Marine Air Ground Task Force Command and Control (MAGTF C2), with technologies to exchange data and information with, and among, distributed tactical forces. Activities in this program area provide technologies for secure, robust, self-forming, mobile communications networks and distributed computing to support information dissemination to all echelons; and sensors, software and data processing to support formation of an appropriate common picture.  Marine Corps specific efforts include power management, low detectability, size and weight constraints, and interoperability within the joint environment.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>FY 2013 funding and associated Future Naval Capability (FNC) efforts addressed in this Program Element (PE) are transferring to a new PE titled Future Naval Capabilities Applied Research (PE 0602750N).  This is to enhance the visibility of the FNC Program by providing an easily navigable and consolidated overview of all 6.2 FNC investments in a single PE. 

FY 2014 - R2 Activity Human Factors and Organizational Design requirements and associated funding is transferred to the Warfighter Sustainment Applied research PE (PE 0602236N).  Ongoing Human Factors research is more closely aligned to Warfighter Sustainment objectives.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (Sep 2011). This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps). It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century. The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare. 

Activities and efforts in this program examine concepts and technologies that enable the transformation to network centric warfare. Network centric capabilities rely on information to connect assets and provide timely and accurate understanding of the environment. The mission area requirements for rapid, accurate decision-making; dynamic, efficient, mission-focused communications and networks; and pervasive and persistent sensing drive network centric S&amp;T investments. The program focus is investments in the following Enabling Capabilities (ECs): Combat Identification (ID) Information Management of Coordinated Electronic Surveillance; Automated Control of Large Sensor Networks; OCO Focused Tactical Persistent Surveillance, Globally Netted Joint/Coalition Force Maritime Component Commander, Dynamic Tactical Communications Networks; Dynamic C2 for Tactical Forces and Maritime Operations Center (MOC); High-bandwidth, Free-space Lasercomm; Actionable Intelligence Enabled by Persistent Surveillance; Pro-Active Computer Network Defense and Information Assurance; Fast Magic; Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) Space; Advanced Tactical Data Link; and Autonomous Tactical Persistent Surveillance. In the context of the Naval Transformation Roadmap construct, this investment will achieve capabilities required by FORCEnet (Persistent Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance; Time Sensitive Strike; and Sea Based Information Operations), Sea Strike (Ship-to-Objective Maneuver), and Sea Shield (Theater Air and Missile Defense).

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (Sep 2011). This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps). It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century. The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare. Activities and efforts in this program examine concepts and technologies that enable the transformation to network centric warfare. Network centric capabilities rely on information to connect assets and provide timely and accurate understanding of the environment. The mission area requirements for rapid, accurate decision-making; dynamic, efficient, mission-focused communications and networks; and pervasive and persistent sensing drive network centric S&amp;T investments. 

The program focus is investments in the following Enabling Capabilities (ECs): Combat Identification (ID) Information Management of Coordinated Electronic Surveillance; Automated Control of Large Sensor Networks; OCO Focused Tactical Persistent Surveillance; Globally Netted Joint/Coalition Force Maritime Component Commander; Dynamic Tactical Communications Networks; Dynamic C2 for Tactical Forces and Maritime Operations Center (MOC); High-bandwidth, Free-space Lasercomm; Actionable Intelligence Enabled by Persistent Surveillance; Pro-Active Computer Network Defense and Information Assurance; Fast Magic; Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) Space; Advanced Tactical Data Link; and Autonomous Tactical Persistent Surveillance. In the context of the Naval Transformation Roadmap construct, this investment will achieve capabilities required by FORCEnet (Persistent Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance; Time Sensitive Strike; and Sea Based Information Operations), Sea Strike (Ship-to-Objective Maneuver), and Sea Shield (Theater Air and Missile Defense).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>The overarching objective of this activity is to develop high throughput dynamic wireless communications and network technologies critical to the mission performance and robustness of naval communications for widely dispersed, mobile air, land, surface and submerged platforms.  These platforms are often size, weight and power (SWaP) limited, and will operate under constraints of cluttered RF spectrum, harsh electro-magnetic interference (EMI) and Beyond Line Of Sight (BLOS) conditions.  The technical payoff is increased network data rates, interoperability across heterogeneous radios, dynamic bandwidth management, and greater mobile network connectivity.  The operational payoff is that warfighters from the operational command to the tactical edge have near real-time access to information, knowledge and decision-making necessary to perform their tasks, including coalition and allied forces.  Emphasis is on tactical edge communications and networks to fully realize net-centric warfare, bridging the Global Information Grid (GIG) and the 'disadvantaged user', e.g., small-deck combatants, submarines, unmanned vehicles, distributed sensors and ground units in urban and radio frequency (RF) challenged environments.  The current specific objectives are:

a) Radios and Apertures: Develop technologies for high band radio, electrically-small and actively scanned antennas, addressing critical issue of radio spectrum bandwidth efficiency, spectrum contention and clutter, agile frequency communications with dynamic spectrum access, all-digital front-end with wide dynamic range, power amplifier efficiency, multipath effects, saltwater propagation and BLOS communications. Develop algorithms and signal processing for space-time-frequency diversity communications, including measures for electronic protection, such as low-intercept, antijam waveforms and modulation.  Develop affordable antenna technologies for small size and weight, high radiation efficiency, and wideband operation with rapid beam-steering.  Develop alternatives to RF communications in airborne and terrestrial environments as well as high data rate underwater communications for undersea warfare (distributed sensor netting, unmanned underwater vehicle data exfiltration, submarine Communications at Speed and Depth) using electro-optic/infra-red (EO/IR) technologies.  Develop secure, high bandwidth communications systems and the exploitation of existing and emerging network protocols that will avail development of new, Low Earth Orbit (LEO) based data transport mechanisms.

b) Tactical Networking and Network Control/Management: Develop advanced networking techniques for robust, highly dynamic environments; interoperable networks for secure communications and protocols, bandwidth and network management techniques that manage and allocate bandwidth across tactical and theater levels in support of net-centric operations. Develop rapidly auto-configuring and self-organizing networks with efficient and survivable routing, secure authentication, mobility management and Quality-of-Service guarantee, while optimizing network resources.  Address low bandwidth, synchronization and reliability for Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)/middleware architecture in both mobile ad-hoc networks (MANET) and infrastructure-based Internet Protocol (IP) backbone networks. Develop cognitive network planning and operations engines whose criteria are based directly on mission objectives, while self-adapting and managing the spectrum allocation and radio resources in such a way that network operations, SOA community of interest, and computer network defense are integrated to form a single common tactical network picture that requires a minimum of human intervention and skill.  Develop technology for improving tactical edge networking and for improving voice communications.

The decrease from FY 2014 to FY 2015 is the reprioritizing of the Development of optical communications technologies for underwater platforms and research into multi-modal networking across undersea platforms with acoustic, optical, and RF communications.

                                    <r2:Description>The goal of this activity is to support FORCEnet by developing enablers for decision making and mission execution, to achieve battlespace superiority.  It focuses on the development of algorithms and software technologies that identify and integrate informational content from multiple sources, leading to decision aids that support user-cognitive processes.  Because persistent sensors are generating massive amounts of data, the focus is on technologies that not only integrate information from diverse sources, but also provide indications of information significance in ways that support the user's decision needs, regardless of location and operational situation.  To achieve this, it must be possible to automate understanding of the battlespace by identifying objects, determining relationships among the objects, assessing intent, and automatically generating courses of action with associated risks and uncertainty.  Effort will also be devoted to developing technology for increasing assurance and security for C3 information systems and technology for improving information discovery and information presentation in such systems.  The Nano Electronics Technology activity is focused on developing ultra-low power, higher performance computing devices and components that are based on novel functionalities of nanometer scale materials and are enabled by improved understanding of nanomaterials, new devices and circuit design concepts, as well as new architectures uniquely suited for nanoscale systems.  

Effective in FY 2013, this activity title has been changed from Computational Framework and Methods for Rapid Accurate Decision Making to Applied Information Sciences for Decision Making in order to completely capture the work being performed.  

The current specific objectives are:
a) Data Understanding (Formerly: Automated Intelligence Tools): Develop automated, image and signal intelligence understanding tools based on rigorous mathematical and statistical methods that lead to improved change detection, improve object and activity detection and recognition capabilities, context and scene understanding, and inferring of the threat levels to support decision making and persistent and adaptive surveillance.

b) Information Integration (Formerly; Battlespace Sensor and Intelligence Integration): Develop innovative methods for combining traditional and non-traditional data from sensors and disparate sources to provide the best estimate of objects, events, and conditions in the battlespace, in terms of their identity, associated error or uncertainty, context, impact, while inferring relationships and their intentions.

c) Mission Focused Autonomy (MFA): Develop proactive situational awareness and rapid decision making applications and analytics with information PUSH as well as PULL, where joint human controlled and automated analytic processes can collaboratively work together to solve tactical and strategic problems within a multi-level, secure environment.  The MFA system contains the following elements: a) access to enterprise level structured and unstructured data repositories and automated search and discovery of evidence collected across these heterogeneous databases; b) analytics that automate the ability to infer the meaning of evidence that is discovered; c) structured process (hypothesis or argument) that provides context in order to constrain and guide the search and analytic techniques toward goals that are focused on proving the hypothesis right or wrong; d) knowledge repository that maintains pedigree and state of hypothesis satisfaction or refutation; e) Collaborative environment wherein all analytic participants can share the state of hypothesis satisfaction and collectively contribute evidence data to solve the common problem. Develop rigorous and efficient methods for building sophisticated situational models, and develop automated reasoning techniques to categorize and recognize situations under a variety of conditions leading to methods that predict situations under different settings.

d) Resource Optimization (Formerly: Automated Decision Tools): Develop automated decision tools based on mathematically rigorous techniques (e.g., mathematical optimization) that support decision-making to ensure the best use of scarce and/or expensive resources, achieving optimal allocations for large complex scenarios, including ones that contain uncertainty, in drastically reduced amounts of time.  Develop methods that support decision making in networked sensor management and allocation to ensure sensor assets are deployed in an optimal, or near optimal, manner.

e) Trusted Systems &amp; Networks (Formerly: Secure Sensor Networks): Develop tools and methods to securely handle information without exposing intelligence information about the networks or systems to adversaries. 

f) Nanoscale Electronics: To develop novel nanometer scale (feature size near or below 10nm) logic/memory devices and related circuits and architectures to deliver ultra-low power, light weight and high performance computational capability for autonomous vehicles and individual warfighters. Effective in FY 2014, Nanoscale Electronics has been transferred from Electromagnetic Systems Applied Research to Applied Information Sciences for Decision Making in order to completely capture the work being performed.

g) Quantum Information Sciences: Conduct research supporting the efficacy of a free space optical quantum key distribution that would operate in a maritime environment. Understand the implications of imperfect hardware implementations upon the vulnerability of the known protocols. Develop new protocols and encoding schemes that lead to robust performance with high throughput. Conduct research that leads to an understanding of, and develop methods that compensate for atmospheric effects.  

The increase from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is a result of the expanded investment in Mission Focused Autonomy research and the transfer of requirements and associated funding for Nanoscale Electronics Research from PE 0602271N.

The increase of funds from FY2014 to FY2015 is for the development and demonstration  of new naval capabilities providing improved cyber situational awareness and cyber toolkit development to assess vulnerabilities in Naval networks.  The funds will also explore new technologies to prevent/ isolate intrusions to Naval networks and explore automated approaches to cyber policy implementation management.

                                    <r2:Description>The overarching objective of this activity is the achievement of FORCEnet and Sea Power 21 goals by developing human factors principles and cognitive models for human centric design, decision support systems for collaborative decision making, and adaptive command and control structures.  The CNO's new Maritime Strategy and the Commander Fleet Forces Command complementary plan to revise organization of Maritime Operations Centers (MOC) place high priority on the aforementioned FORCEnet and Sea Power 21 goals.  Specific objectives focus on improving small team, platform, task force, and battle group operations by developing advanced human factors technologies for incorporation into operational systems.  The goals and payoffs are to enhance human performance effectiveness; improve the timeliness and quality of decision making; develop strategies to mitigate high workload and ambiguity; reduce manning; improve situational awareness and speed of command through a deeper understanding of human capabilities and limitations; and improvement of team decision making in ad-hoc, complex problem solving scenarios.  The current specific objectives are:

a) Human Computer Interaction/Visualization: Develop an understanding of the limitations of human perceptual and attentional systems in relation to maximizing user performance when interacting with complex Naval displays.  A combination of computational, cognitive modeling and psychological studies are employed to determine the capacity limitations on human performance that will undoubtedly have impact in reduced manning requirements, including information-rich weapons platforms.  Develop technology for improving human interaction with autonomous systems and for improving virtual reality systems for training purposes.

b) Collaboration and Knowledge Interoperability: Develop an understanding of the high-level cognitive processes underlying team knowledge processing, decision making and collaboration in order to improve team performance in the autonomous, agile, quick-response combat team of the future.  Develop cognitive, science-based tools, models, computational methods, and human-agent interfaces to enhance team collaboration effectiveness and team performance in complex problem solving scenarios.  Specific objectives include application of discourse analysis methods and other process metrics to assess team performance.  A conceptual model of team collaboration will be constructed and computational relationships among processes and team performance will be developed.  Findings will be validated and demonstrated in operationally oriented testbeds by addressing issues including: rapid team analysis of large volume, uncertain data; knowledge interoperability in coalition ops; measures of team situational awareness; accelerated team synchronization; improved heterogeneous team performance; team collaboration performance metrics; cultural/language/experience-free representation and transfer of meaning.

c) Organizational Design and Decision Support Systems: Develop quantitative, executable models, task graphs and optimization algorithms for the organizational design of MOC, consistent with the Navy's New Maritime Strategy. Investigate through modeling and simulation human competency requirements for staffing MOC.  Develop quantitative formalisms for monitoring and assessing the completeness, consistency and accuracy of rules of engagement (ROE).

d) Social Network Analysis: Develop computational models and algorithms for the analysis of terrorist threats and counter-measures, and strategies against terrorist threats.  Develop new computational algorithms for the discovery of missing and hidden nodes in complex graphs applicable to the problem of understanding hidden information in terror networks.  Develop new approaches to calculation of network completeness.  Develop computational approaches to the study of factionalism in social movements using Islamist movements as exemplar data collectivities.

The decrease from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is due to the transfer of requirements and associated funding to the Human Factors activities in the Warfighter Sustainment Applied Research PE 0602236N, to provide an easily navigable and consolidated overview of all Human Factors investments in a single PE.

This addresses development of autonomous robotic systems capability to interact with and service other platforms and autonomous vehicles. 

Micro-Robotic Servicing - advanced highly dexterous control of extremely lightweight and flexible robotic arms, with specific application to EOD, surveillance and on-orbit servicing robotic communities. This research would extend ongoing research in lightweight robotic arms.

Autonomous Refueling - development of hardware, algorithms, and sensors for hybrid rigid-compliant robotic arms in rapidly changing environments, with specific application to autonomous refueling of USVs, UAVs and UGVs while moving in their environments, advancing beyond the DARPA-sponsored "Rapid Autonomous Fuel Transfer Project".

Low Power Micro-robotics - development of onboard sensors, control electronics, and actuators requiring very low power, with specific application to robotic missions over long durations.

Advanced Manipulators and Tool-Changers - development of innovative robotic manipulators, tool changers, and associated sensors for challenging robotic manipulation tasks, with specific application to EOD and other robotic missions in difficult environments. This research would extend previous research by providing robust end effector technology and tool changing capability. The overall research outcomes will enhance DoD capability in the areas of explosive ordnance disposal, autonomous vehicle refueling, and innovative robotic arm control. Research deliverables will include hardware development in the areas of lightweight robotic arms, end effector tools and tool changers, and low power electronics and actuators.

Autonomous Vehicles:
- This effort will draw from current research and push the technology development to the next level to provide a leap-ahead capability in long endurance, deployable, autonomous, robotic air vehicle using fuel cell electric propulsion systems for high efficiency, even in small vehicles, which can provide robust airborne sensor capabilities for submarines, UUVs, small naval platforms and small dismounted units.

Undersea Vehicles:
- Funding would be used to acquire a medium sized (12.5 inch diameter) Autonomous Underwater Vehicle as an at sea test platform to advance the state of art of onboard intelligent autonomy. This medium sized UUV is readily amenable to vehicle and sensor testing in the wave pool in the Laboratory for Autonomous Systems Research facility. Subsequently, this would allow at sea testing of State of the art autonomy algorithms (e.g. goal driven autonomy, human cognitive models, Markov decision processes) that allow Navy underwater vehicles to carry out complex mission in denied areas by understanding the environment and adapting mission goals in the context of the commander's intent, with little or no human operator intervention.

Autonomous Systems Integration:
- To support the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering) (ASD(R&amp;E)) priorities in autonomous systems, and specifically to advance the state of the art in heterogeneous teams of autonomous platforms, (including sensor networks and mobile communication nodes) that can work seamlessly with the warfighter, funding will be applied to small air platforms and militarily relevant unmanned ground vehicles to integrate sensors and advanced power sources, and to develop the autonomy software that allows the individual platforms to work together, as well as to work at a peer-to-peer level with the warfighter. This includes advanced human-robot interaction techniques and information processing and presentation techniques that reduce the warfighter's cognitive load and allows him to work with a team of autonomous systems.</r2:Text>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>FY 2013 funding associated with Future Naval Capability (FNC) efforts are transferring to a new Program Element titled Future Naval Capabilities Applied Research (PE 0602750N).  This is to enhance the visibility of the FNC Program by providing an easily navigable overview of all 6.2 FNC investments in a single location.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (Sep 2011).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare.

This PE supports innovation-based efforts that will provide technology options for future Navy and Marine Corps capabilities.  Efforts focus on advanced Naval materials; biocentric technologies; environmental quality; human factors and organizational design; medical technologies; and Naval training technologies. Within the Naval Transformation Roadmap, this investment maps to future transformational capabilities and the FORCEnet pillar of the Chief of Naval Operations and the Commandant of the Marine Corps vision for the future -- Naval Power 21. 

The ONRG International Science Program mission is to search the globe for emerging scientific research and advanced technologies to enable the Office of Naval Research (ONR) and the NRE to address effectively the current needs of the Fleet/Forces, and investigate and assess revolutionary, high-payoff technologies for future Naval missions and capabilities. Within this Global mission, funding for the Naval Science Advisor Program ensures the Fleet/Force (F/F) helps shape the Department of the Navy (DoN) investment in Science and Technology (S&amp;T), develops teaming relationships to rapidly demonstrate and transition technology, supports development of technology-based capability options for naval forces, and enables warfighting innovations based on technical and conceptual possibilities. Science Advisors provide insight into issues associated with Naval Warfighting Capabilities that influence S&amp;T program decision making. The program develops leaders among civilian scientists and engineers in the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE). Upon completion of their tours, Science Advisors return to the NRE with first hand knowledge of the F/F, warfighting issues, and strategic decision making. The Office of Naval Research (ONR) Science Advisor program enables continuous communication and collaboration between the warfighters, the technical community, and strategic development commands. 

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>The overarching objective of this activity is the achievement of FORCEnet and Sea Power 21 goals by developing human factors principles and cognitive models for human centric design, decision support systems for collaborative decision making, and adaptive command and control structures. The CNO's new Maritime Strategy and the Commander Fleet Forces Command complementary plan to revise organization of Maritime Operations Centers (MOC) place high priority on the aforementioned FORCEnet and Sea Power 21 goals. Specific objectives focus on improving small team, platform, task force, and battle group operations by developing advanced human factors technologies for incorporation into operational systems. The goals and payoffs are to enhance human performance effectiveness; improve the timeliness and quality of decision making; develop strategies to mitigate high workload and ambiguity; reduce manning; improve situational awareness and speed of command through a deeper understanding of human capabilities and limitations; and improvement of team decision making in ad-hoc, complex problem solving scenarios. The current specific objectives are:

a) Human Computer Interaction/Visualization: Develop an understanding of the limitations of human perceptual and attentional systems in relation to maximizing user performance when interacting with complex Naval displays. A combination of computational cognitive modeling and psychological studies are employed to determine the capacity limitations on human performance that will undoubtedly have impact in reduced manning requirements, including information-rich weapons platforms. Develop technology for improving human interaction with autonomous systems and for improving virtual reality systems for training purposes.

b) Command Decision Making (CDM): This is a new sub-project that consolidates the previous Collaboration and Knowledge Interoperability (CKI) and Organizational Design and Decision Support Systems sub-projects. The CDM sub-project is focused at the development of dynamic decision support systems that recognize and are responsive to changing mission and task demands, and adapt to present information appropriately.  This focus is explicitly intended to deliver decision support that will be more timely and responsive to rapidly evolving operational needs.  Current thrusts within the sub-project are to: 1) Conduct research on the application of theory to exploit relevant information for effective decision making; 2) Develop models that are operationally context and task sensitive; 3) Study and apply research for the effective management of highly complex &amp; time critical decision making; 4) Develop and demonstrate decision support tools that address the timely management of risk and uncertainty.

c) Social Network Analysis: Develop computational models and algorithms for the analysis of terrorist threats and counter-measures and strategies against terrorist threats. Develop new computational algorithms for the discovery of missing and hidden nodes in complex graphs applicable to the problem of understanding hidden information in terror networks. Develop new approaches to calculation of network completeness. Develop computational approaches to the study of factionalism in social movements using Islamist movements as exemplar data collectivities. The following are non-inclusive examples of accomplishments and plans for projects funded in this activity.

This FY 2014 activity funding moves from Program Element 0602235N: Common Picture Applied Research efforts associated with the Human Factors activity and is being transferring into this PE0602236N: Warfighter Sustainment Applied Research to provide an easily navigable overview of all Human Factors investments in a single location.</r2:Description>

Navy investment in these areas is essential because Navy/USMC mission needs are not adequately addressed by the civilian sector or other Federal agencies. For example, civilian emergency medicine does not address casualty stabilization during long transit times to definitive care. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) focuses on the basic science of disease processes and not applied research related to development. Programs are coordinated with other Services through the Armed Services Biomedical Research Evaluation and Management (ASBREM) Committee, and Joint Technical Coordinating Group (JTCG) process, to prevent duplication of effort.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>ONR has a presence overseas, with an overarching purpose to search the globe for promising, emerging scientific research and development efforts to address the current needs of the Fleet/Forces, and investigate high-payoff technologies for future naval missions and capabilities. To accomplish this task, ONR capitalizes on global innovation and investment to solve U.S. Navy and Marine Corps science and technology (S&amp;T) challenges, builds global S&amp;T awareness to mitigate risk of potential technological surprise, ensures Fleet/Forces capability needs are communicated to the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE), and facilitates delivery of Naval S&amp;T solutions to the Fleet/Forces.  

ONR Applied Research (6.2) requirements prior to FY 2014 were funded in another R-2 activity within this PE and also in PE 0602123N and 0206568N.  Starting in FY 2014, these requirements have been consolidated into this separate R-2 activity to provide greater visibility for ONR international collaboration and research efforts. 

The decrease from FY 2014 to FY 2015 is due to reprioritization of requirements. All efforts will continue to the greatest extent possible.</r2:Description>

This is to enhance the visibility of the FNC Program by providing an easily navigable and consolidated overview of all 6.2 FNC investments in a single PE.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan, approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (Sep 2011).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare.

The Electromagnetic Systems Applied Research Program addresses technology needs associated with Naval platforms for new capabilities in EO/IR Sensors, Surveillance, Electronic Warfare, Navigation, Solid State Electronics, Vacuum Electronics Power Amplifiers, and Nanoelectronics. The program supports development of technologies to enable capabilities in Missile Defense, Directed Energy, Platform Protection, Time Critical Strike, and Information Distribution. This program directly supports the Department of Defense Joint Warfighter Plan and the Defense Technology Area Plans. Activities and efforts within this Program have attributes that focus on enhancing the affordability of warfighting systems. The program also provides for technology efforts to maintain proactive connectivity and collaboration between Department of the Navy (DON) Science and Technology (S&amp;T) and Joint, Navy, and Marine Corps commands worldwide.  

Also included in this PE is the Netted Emulation of Multi-Element Signatures against Integrated Sensors (NEMESIS) Innovative Naval Prototype (INP).

                                    <r2:Description>The overarching objective of this activity is to develop higher performance components and subsystems for all classes of military RF systems that are based on solid state physics phenomena and are enabled by improved understanding of these phenomena, new circuit design concepts and devices, and improvements in the properties of electronic materials.  An important subclass are the very high frequency (VHF), ultra-high frequency (UHF), microwave (MW), and millimeter wave (MMW) power amplifiers for Navy all-weather radar, surveillance, reconnaissance, electronic attack, communications, and smart weapon systems.  Another subclass are the analog and high speed, mixed signal components that connect the electromagnetic signal environment into and out of digitally realized, specific function systems.  These improved components are based on both silicon (Si) and compound semiconductors (especially the wide bandgap materials and narrow bandgap materials), low and high temperature superconductors, novel nanometer scale structures and materials.  Components addressed by this activity emphasize the MMW and submillimeter wave (SMMW) regions with an increasing emphasis on devices capable of operating in the range from 50 gigahertz (GHz) to 10 terahertz (THz).  The functionality of the technology developed cannot be obtained through Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) as a result of the simultaneous requirements placed on power, frequency, linearity, operational and instantaneous bandwidth, weight, and size.  Effort will involve understanding the properties of engineered semiconductors as they apply to quantum information science and technology. 

This activity also includes Anti-Tamper development of innovative techniques and technologies to deter the reverse engineering and exploitation of our military's critical technology and critical program information in order to impede technology transfer and alteration of system capability and prevent the development of countermeasures to U.S. systems. The current specific objectives are:

a) Solid State Transistors and Devices: Develop solid state transistors and devices for high frequency analog and digital operation.

b) High Efficiency, Highly Linear Amplifiers: Develop high efficiency, highly linear amplifiers for microwave, millimeter-wave, low-noise, and power applications.

c) Superconducting Electronics: Develop components for RF systems utilizing superconducting and other technologies which are designed to deliver software defined, wide band, many simultaneous signal functionality over a wide range of frequencies, in increasingly field-ready packaging and demonstrate the ability of these components to be combined into chains to deliver superior functionality in conventional system contexts, including, but not limited to, SATCOM, Electronic Warfare (EW), signal intelligence (SIGINT), and communications.

d) Control, Reception, Transmission, and Processing of Signals: Develop electronics and photonics technology that provides for the control, reception, transmission and processing of signals.

e) Novel Nanometer Scale Logic/Memory Devices and Related Circuits and Architectures: Develop novel nanometer scale (feature size at or below 10nm) logic/memory devices and related circuits and architectures to deliver ultra-low power, light weight and high performance computational capability for autonomous vehicles and individual warfighters.

f) Anti-Tamper: Develope innovative techniques and technologies to deter the reverse engineering and exploitation of our military's critical technology and critical program information in order to impede technology transfer and alteration of system capability and prevent the development of countermeasures to U.S. systems. 

Funding increase from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is due to the progression of Anti-Tamper Technology research from Basic to Applied Research.  

Funding decrease from FY 2014 to FY 2015 is the due to the completion of current packaging efforts and the reprioritizing of the additional work need to be pursued.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (Sep 2011).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare.

This PE provides the unique, fundamental programmatic instrument by which basic research on the natural environment is transformed into technological developments that provide new or enhanced warfare capabilities for the Battlespace Environment (BSE).  The objectives of this program are met through measuring, analyzing, modeling and simulating, and applying environmental factors affecting naval material and operations in the BSE.  This program provides for BSE technological developments that contribute to meeting top joint warfare capabilities established by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, with primary emphasis on Joint Littoral Warfare and Joint Strike Warfare. 

This PE fully supports the Director of Defense Research and Engineering's Science and Technology Strategy and is coordinated with other DoD Components through the Defense Science and Technology Reliance process.  Work in this program is related to and fully coordinated with efforts in accordance with the on-going Reliance joint planning process.  There is close coordination with the US Air Force and US Army under the Reliance program in the BSE categories of Lower Atmosphere, Ocean Environments, Space &amp; Upper Atmosphere, and Terrestrial Environments.  Within the Naval Transformation Roadmap, the investment will contribute toward achieving each of the "key transformational capabilities" required by Sea Strike, Sea Shield, and Sea Basing.  Moreover, environmental information, environmental models, and environmental tactical decision aids that emerge from this investment will form one of the essential components of FORCEnet (which is the architecture for a highly adaptive, human-centric, comprehensive maritime system that operates from seabed to space).  The Navy program includes efforts that focus on, or have attributes that enhance, the affordability of warfighting systems.

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides technologies that form the natural environment technical base on which all systems development and advanced technology depend.
Furthermore, this technical base provides developments that may be utilized in the Future Naval Capabilities programs: Organic Mine Countermeasures (MCM) and
Autonomous Operations. This project contains the National Oceanographic Partnership Program (NOPP) (Title II, subtitle E, of Public Law 104-201) and efforts aimed
at understanding and predicting the impacts of underwater sound on marine mammals.

Major efforts of this project are devoted to: gaining real-time knowledge of the BSE, determining the natural environment needs of regional warfare, providing the on-scene commander with the capability to exploit the environment to tactical advantage and, developing atmospheric research related to detection of sea-skimming missiles and strike warfare. This project provides natural environment applied research for all fleet operations and for current or emerging systems. Major developments are routinely transitioned to the Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center and to the Naval Oceanographic Office where they are used to provide timely information about the natural environment for all fleet operations.

Joint Littoral Warfare efforts address issues in undersea, surface, and air battlespace. Efforts include ocean and atmospheric analysis and prediction for real-time description of the operational environment, shallow water acoustics, multiple-influence sensors for undersea surveillance and weapon systems, and influences of the natural environment on MCM and Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) systems. Joint Strike Warfare efforts address issues in air battlespace dominance. Efforts include influences of the natural environment on air operations, electromagnetic (EM)/electro-optic (EO) systems used in intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, targeting, bomb damage assessment, and detection of missile weapon systems. They also include improvements in tactical information management about the BSE.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Research investments in this activity support the development and testing of expendable and autonomous bioluminescence sensors, the continued development of extended range underwater imaging technologies, and algorithm development and testing for application to ocean color remote sensing from aircraft and space in order to characterize key features of the coastal battle space such as bathymetry, shallow-water bottom types, and the distribution of ocean water optical properties.

Funding increase from FY 2013 to FY 2014 due to programs assigned to NRL-Base.

The funding decrease from FY 2014-FY 2015 in R2 Activity Coastal Geosciences/Optics is due to the completion of the development of a next generation atmospheric correction algorithm, the completion of the development of new data storage topologies and ensemble methods for irregular, multi-resolution, geophysical data, and the effort to quantify the effect that different sensor viewing angles and gain factors have on optical data measurements.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>This activity consolidates and expands research conducted in previous years in Coastal Geosciences/Optics and the Physical Oceanography Activities and expands these efforts. The sensitivity of Marine Mammals to sound produced by Naval operations and training will continue. This program is to assure that Navy decisions can be based on scientifically defensible positions. The goal of this activity is to support: (1) marine mammal research related to understanding impacts of sound (especially sonar) on marine mammal behavior, hearing, physiology, distributions and ecology; (2) development and testing of new technologies for the detection of marine mammals at sea; (3) research on the bio-acoustic properties, use of sound for detection of, and effects of sound on fish and lesser marine organisms; and (4) research on optically important biota in the coastal ocean in support of Naval Mine, Undersea, and Special Warfare (including oceanic bioluminescence and the development and testing of bioluminescence sensors). The marine mammals research conducted in this PE represents part of a total effort executed in coordination with complementary research performed in PE 0602747N. The emphasis of efforts within PE 0602435N are Marine Mammals and Biology thrusts that include Integrated Ecosystem Research/Sensor and Tag Development, Controlled Exposure Experiments (captive, free-ranging European waters), part of the Monitoring &amp; Detection thrust (DCL algorithm development), and effects of chronic stress (free-ranging animal studies).

                                    <r2:Description>The marine atmosphere affects most aspects of naval operations. This activity develops observing technologies, models, Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) systems and Tactical Decision Aids (TDA) that describe the atmospheric environment and its impacts on naval sensors and operations. This activity focuses on uniquely marine aspects of atmospheric science such as air-sea interaction, coupled ocean-atmosphere modeling, EM and EO propagation, coastal meteorology, Tropical Cyclone (TC) prediction, and the use of remote sensing to obtain quantitative observations of atmospheric properties. Aspects of the atmospheric environment of particular interest include near-surface phenomena that affect refractivity, marine boundary layer dynamics that affect clouds, rain, visibility and fog, and processes that control TC structure, track, and intensity. Objectives of this activity are improved NWP systems and TDAs that provide NOWCAST and forecast skill at global, regional, and tactical scales for operational support, sensor and system development, and performance prediction.

Funding increase from FY 2013 to FY 2014 reflects increased emphasis across Marine Meteorology efforts including ramp up of some efforts initiated in FY 2012.

Funding increase from FY 2014 to FY 2015 due to increased  research towards developing a predictive capability for the impact of clouds, aerosols, and  moisture gradients in littoral areas on electromagnetic and electro-optic propagation in support of new Naval sensors and weapons as part of Electromagnetic Maneuver Warfare. Also, to increase capability to assimilate non- traditional data sources such as those from autonomous systems and remote sensing for prediction of conditions in denied and degraded areas. Also an improved application for probabilistic prediction of air and sea conditions for ship routing and operational planning that enables increased energy efficiency and operational effectiveness.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>This activity is dedicated to the determination of the impact of the natural ocean environment on acoustic wave phenomena in support of naval undersea warfare and underwater force protection operations. This activity studies underwater acoustic propagation, scattering from ocean boundaries, and ambient noise issues that impact the development and employment of acoustic systems. The Littoral Zone (LZ) has been the ocean environment of greatest interest. Aspects of this environment, that greatly impact underwater acoustic systems, are the shallow water included in the Littoral Zone, the consequent closeness and physical significance of the ocean bottom, and the complexities inherent to rapid changes of the ocean structure. The objectives of this program are met through measuring, analyzing, modeling and simulating, and exploiting ocean acoustic factors to gain advantage over potential adversaries using undersea acoustic systems. Results of this activity support acoustic sensor and system development, performance prediction, and tactical decision aids.

Funding decrease from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is due to the completion of efforts associated with acoustic noise shielding and acoustic propagation models.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The goal of this activity is to develop naval tactical uses of knowledge of the physics of the ocean within the BSE. This is achieved through the development of predictive models of the water mass structure, waves, currents, and air-sea interactions and developing measurement/observation technology. Other applications utilize knowledge of the interaction of the water column hydrodynamics and the acoustics to predict the undersea transmission characteristics and sources of uncertainty in these statistics. Utilizing knowledge of the ocean surface physics, the physical oceanography program seeks to exploit the combination of remotely sensed data, in-situ data, and adaptively sampled data to optimize predictions of ocean currents and water column structure. These predictions, custom databases, adaptive sampling schemes and data programs serve ASW, Naval Special Warfare (NSW), Sea-Basing, and mine warfare needs.

Funding increase from FY 2014 to FY 2015 due to the implementation and integration of coastal forecast models into the TOPSIDE command and control and mission planning system.  These models will have a data assimilation to utilize the data sets featured in the data fusion section of the software.  The system is of interest to Naval Special Warfare and to Naval Oceanographic Office for their Glider Operations Center.</r2:Description>

In FY13 funds will be awarded to the University of Washington to initiate a six-month detailed engineering design effort by a naval architect, followed by a competitive selection for a shipyard to implement the design plans. The THOMPSON will enter the shipyard in November 2014 to begin the refit.

Deliverables will support new environmental compliance requirements regarding ballast water treatment, marine sanitation, engine exhaust, incinerator exhaust, air conditioning refrigerants, and oily-water separation.  Additional deliverables will overcome obsolescence of diesel engine and electrical system components, and enhance the ship safety with piping replacements in the ship's firemain and ballast water systems.</r2:Text>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The DOD's Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Program (JNLWP) was established by the Secretary of Defense, who assigned centralized responsibility for DoD joint research and development of non-lethal technology to the Commandant of the Marine Corps as the Executive Agent.  The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics provides direct oversight of the JNLWP.

The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) reflect science and technology (S&amp;T) investment decisions provided by the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons (NLW) Integrated Product Team, a multi-service flag level corporate board that executes the JNLWP for the Commandant of the Marine Corps.  This direction is based on the needs and capabilities of the Services, the Special Operations Command, and the Coast Guard, as identified in the DoD's Non-Lethal Weapons Joint Capabilities Based Assessment Document.  This coordinated joint S&amp;T development approach addresses mutual capability gaps and assures the best non-lethal technologies and equipment are provided to the operating forces while eliminating duplicative service S&amp;T investment.

This program funds the applied research, study, assessment, and demonstration of technologies that could provide a non-lethal capability or target effect.  Investment areas include applied research related to: non-lethal directed energy weapons (lasers, millimeter wave and high power microwave) for counter-personnel and counter-materiel missions; non-lethal acoustic and optical technologies; advanced non-lethal materiels (including materiels for vehicle/vessel stopping and counter-facility applications); associated human effects and effectiveness for new non-lethal stimuli; injury potential and effectiveness of directed energy, electric stun, ocular, and acoustic based non-lethal technologies; and developing models of crowd behavior and dynamics.  This program transitioned from PE 0602114N, Power Projection Applied Research by order of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, USD(AT&amp;L), to a separate PE for Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Applied Research and established the Commandant of the Marine Corps as the Executive Agent for DoD Joint Non-Lethal Weapons RDT&amp;E.

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>FY 2013 funding associated with Future Naval Capability (FNC) efforts are transferring to a new Program Element titled Future Naval Capabilities Applied Research (PE 0602750N).  This is to enhance the visibility of the FNC Program by providing an easily navigable overview of all 6.2 FNC investments in a single location.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (Sep 2011).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare.

This PE funds applied research efforts in undersea target detection, classification, localization, tracking, and neutralization.  Technologies being developed within this PE are aimed at enabling Sea Shield, one of the core operational concepts detailed in the Naval Transformational Roadmap.  Associated efforts focus on new Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) operational concepts that promise to improve wide-area surveillance, detection, localization, tracking, and attack capabilities against quiet adversary submarines operating in noisy and cluttered shallow water environments.  Related efforts are aimed at leveraging technologies that will protect the country's current capital investment in surveillance, submarine, surface ship, and air ASW assets. Research focused on understanding the impacts on marine mammals of manmade underwater sound is also conducted in the Program Element.

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Title>ANTI-SUBMARINE WARFARE (ASW) DISTRIBUTED SEARCH</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>ASW Distributed Search focuses on the development of technologies for the non-covert tactical search for undersea targets ranging from hours to weeks, using automated sensor systems deployed around operating areas, including along key transit routes to protect naval/maritime forces, around temporarily fixed sea base regions and naval force operating areas, or around fixed defensive regions and areas of interest, such as key US/Allied ports. "Non-covert" implies availability of airborne assets for sensor deployment (although other means may also be used), and the ability to employ active sonar along with passive and non-acoustic methods. "Search" is conducted in concentrated areas, typically exploiting cues received from surveillance systems. The submarine target must be detected beyond its weapons release range. The objective is to develop rapidly deployable systems employing automated detection and classification capabilities for use in both shallow and deep water operating environments. Distributed Search supports the ASW protected passage Maritime Shield operational constructs. Related efforts include the development of distributed systems employing optimization as well as active acoustic sensing and processing techniques, navy-unique transduction and underwater networking technology. Efforts also include the development of Unmanned Undersea Vehicle-based and affordable off-board deployable sensing systems employing persistent detection concepts and components. These efforts provide an extended reach of organic platform-based systems through the use of new sensor concepts, improved materials for advanced sensors, optimized deployment, employment, and automated operation of distributed sensor fields. The cornerstone of Distributed Search is the development of rapidly deployable, long-endurance active sensors with automated processing suitable for use in a wide variety of operational environments. 

Funding increase from FY 2014 to FY 2015 is due to realignments required to re-prioritize S&amp;T investments resulting in an increase in ASW Initiatives.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Precision Localization focuses on the development and demonstration of technologies which use information from surveillance or search systems to determine an area of uncertainty (AOU) relative to target range, bearing, and depth adequate to handoff to an attack system. Precision Localization employs non-acoustic techniques such as magnetic and optical sensing to highly localize submerged threats. The objective is to increase magnetic sensor range and robustness, enable deployment on Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs), and increase optical sensing search rates. Efforts include the development of non-traditional tracking and advanced magnetic and electric field sensors and processing. These technologies will provide a decreased AOU size thus enabling the effective use of smaller, more versatile torpedoes as well as increased performance gain in detection, targeting, tracking/trailing, and homing via target acquisition and covert prosecution.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Title>ANTI-SUBMARINE WARFARE (ASW) SURVEILLANCE</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>ASW Surveillance focuses on dramatically improving detection, classification, and localization capabilities in large ocean areas relative to the capabilities of legacy ASW surveillance systems. The related technologies support the conduct of covert, wide-area surveillance ranging from one day to six months. The objectives are to develop and demonstrate technologies that provide clandestine indications and warnings in far forward and contested operating areas, and in complex operational environments against all submarine threats, including new threats with unknown target signatures and tactics. Covertness implies use of non-observable platforms and/or deployed automated sensors employing passive sonar, or other non-detectable methods. The surveillance process includes initial detection and classification. Efforts include the development of Unmanned Undersea Vehicle-based and affordable, off-board deployable sensing systems employing a wide variety of surveillance concepts and components. These efforts focus on alternative detection phenomena, vector/tensor sensors, automated acoustic processing, more compact and longer lasting power sources, and high bandwidth, acoustic communications links.

FY 2014 to FY 2015 decrease is due to the INP LD UUV moving from the 6.2 portion of applied research to the 6.3 applied development portion of the program in PE 0603747N and completion of the ATLAS Imaging Sonar and the Modular Undersea Heavyweight Vehicle (MUHV) efforts.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The goal of this activity is to support: (1) marine mammal research related to understanding impacts of underwater sound (especially sonar) on marine mammal behavior, hearing, physiology, distributions and ecology; (2) development and testing of new technologies for the detection of marine mammals at sea; (3) research on the bio-acoustic properties, use of sound for detection of, and effects of sound on fish and lesser marine organisms; and (4) research on optically important biota in the coastal ocean in support of Naval Mine, Undersea, and Special Warfare (including oceanic bioluminescence and the development and testing of bioluminescence sensors).

The marine mammals research conducted in this Program Element (P.E.) represents part of a total effort executed in coordination with complementary research performed in PE 0602435N.

The emphasis of efforts within PE 0602747N Marine Mammals Activity focuses on the effects on the behavior of marine mammals of manmade sound transmitted underwater which includes Integrated Ecosystem Research, Controlled Exposure Experiments (free-ranging US waters), Marine Mammal Hearing, and part of the Monitoring &amp; Detection thrust (Autonomous platform development; gliders, profilers, etc.), Population-level Consequences of Acoustic Disturbance, effects of chronic stress (captive/modeling studies), and risk assessment modeling.

This Activity has been created specifically to address the work associated with determining and mitigating the effects on the behavior of marine mammals of manmade sound transmitted underwater.

Funding decreases from FY2014 to FY2015 due to completion of studies to examine sensitivity of fish to anthropogenic sound and completion of bioluminescence studies.</r2:Description>

FNC investments respond to Naval S&amp;T Gaps that are identified by the Navy and Marine Corps after receiving input from Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders. The Enabling Capabilities (ECs) and associated technology product investments of the FNC Program are competitively selected by a 3-star Technology Oversight Group (TOG), chartered by the S&amp;T Corporate Board and representing the requirements, acquisition, research and fleet/forces communities of the Navy and the Marine Corps.  

This was a new PE in FY 2013 that consolidated all Navy 6.2 FNC Program investments into a single Navy 6.2 PE.  Marine Corps FNC 6.2 investments are consolidated in a single Marine Corps 6.2 PE (0602131M). In FY 2011 and FY 2012, Navy 6.2 FNC Program investments were spread across 7 separate 6.2 PEs:  0602114N, 0602123N, 0602235N, 0602236N, 0602271N, 0602747N and 0602782N.  The consolidation in this PE allows all investments to be viewed by FNC Pillar, Enabling Capability (EC) and Technology Product.  It greatly enhances the visibility of the FNC Program by providing an easily navigable overview of all 6.2 FNC investments in a single place.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>FNC investments are typically 3-5 years in duration.  They provide a continuance of basic research by maturing technologies from a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 3 or 4 to a TRL of 6.  All FNC products require BA2 and BA3 funded technology development, which is coordinated to ensure tangible technology products are delivered upon completion of each investment.  Each year the TOG refreshes the FNC Program by approving new ECs and technology products as older ones get delivered.  After transition to an acquisition program, FNC products are further engineered, integrated and, ultimately, delivered to the warfighter. The development and delivery of each FNC product is guided by a Technology Transition Agreement (TTA) that is signed by the requirements and acquisition sponsors, as well as the S&amp;T developer.

This project supports the naval pillars of Capable Manpower, Enterprise and Platform Enablers, Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare, Force Health Protection, Forcenet, Power and Energy, Sea Basing, Sea Shield and Sea Strike.  Each of these pillars is listed as a separate R-2 Activity, as is FNC Management.  Under each R-2 Activity, the BA 6.2 accomplishments and plans for every Enabling Capability (EC) and Technology Product in the FNC Program are listed.  ECs are composed of one or more interrelated technology products, so for clarity, each product is shown under its EC.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>As discussed in Section A, there are a significant number of FNC technology products within this PE.  In all cases, these technology products support the Department of the Navy FNC Program and are managed at the Office of Naval Research.  All FNC investments in this PE are subjected to management oversight by 2-star chaired Integrated Product Teams (IPTs) that control the naval pillars of Sea Shield, Sea Strike, Sea Basing, Forcenet, Naval Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare, Enterprise and Platform Enablers, Power and Energy, Capable Manpower, and Force Health Protection.  Each EC is aligned to a pillar and each technology product is aligned to an EC.  At the lowest level, each technology product is measured against both technical and financial milestones on a monthly basis.  Annually, each technology product is reviewed in depth for technical performance and development status by the Chief of Naval Research against goals that have been approved by the Navy's 3-star Technology Oversight Group (TOG).  Also annually, each technology product is reviewed by its 2-star chaired pillar IPT for transition planning adequacy and transition commitment level.   Products must meet TOG required transition commitment levels for S&amp;T development to continue.  Transition issues and required adjustments are reported annually by the Chief of Naval Research to the TOG, which establishes investment priorities for the FNC Program.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>FY 2013 funding associated with Future Naval Capability (FNC) efforts are transferring to a new Program Element titled Future Naval Capabilities Applied Research (PE 0602750N).  This is to enhance the visibility of the FNC Program by providing an easily navigable overview of all 6.2 FNC investments in a single location.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (Sep 2011).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare.

This PE provides technologies for Naval Mine Countermeasures (MCM), Expeditionary Warfare, U.S. Naval sea mining, Naval Special Warfare (NSW), and Joint Tri-Service Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD). This program is strongly aligned with the Joint Chiefs of Staff Joint Warfighting Capability Objectives through the development of technologies to achieve military objectives with minimal casualties and collateral damage. Within the Naval Transformation Roadmap, this investment will achieve one of three "key transformational capabilities" required by "Sea Shield" as well as technically enable the Ship to Objective Maneuver (STOM) key transformational capability within "Sea Strike" by focusing on technologies that will provide the Naval Force with the capability to dominate the battlespace, project power from the sea, and support forces ashore with particular emphasis on rapid MCM operations. These efforts concentrate on the development and transition of technologies for the MCM-related and Urban Asymmetric/Expeditionary Warfare Operations (UAEO)-related Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) Enabling Capabilities (ECs). The Mine and Obstacle Detection/Neutralization efforts include technologies for clandestine and overt minefield reconnaissance, organic ship self-protection, organic minehunting and neutralization/breaching. The Urban Asymmetric Operation effort includes critical warfighting functions such as Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR), fires, maneuver, sustainment, etc. The Naval Special Warfare and Explosive Ordnance Disposal technology efforts concentrate on the development of technologies for safe near-shore mine detection, diver mobility and survivability, and ordnance disposal operations.

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>This activity focuses on applied research to enable longer detection ranges and precise mine location with fewer false alarms in a variety of challenging environments. It supports Discovery and Invention (D&amp;I) and MCM-related FNC ECs. Efforts in Synthetic Aperture Sonar (SAS) technologies for longer range detection and classification of mine-like targets and magnetic gradiometer sensing and electro-optic (EO) technology for buried mine identification, and sensor integration onto Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are being addressed. EO sensor research develops algorithms to enable image processing for rapid overt reconnaissance from an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). Other processing, classification and data fusion techniques to reduce operator workload, and a mine burial prediction "expert system" are also being developed. Efforts also support development of MCM Mission Modules for Littoral Combat Ships (LCS).

Funding increase from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is due to the initiation of applied research in environmentally adaptive Automatic Target Recognition(ATR). 

Funding increase from FY2014 to FY2015 for the Mine Obstacle Detection Area is due to plans to investigate several new and promising technology areas with respect to their applications to this mine reconnaissance.  These efforts will examine feasibility of employing acoustic radiation forces or vibro-acoustography to generate new target discrimination feature sets. These investigative efforts include the audition based object formation and attention models for MCM. In addition applied research into sensor-generic architectures for multi-session minefield mapping with multiple UUVs will initiate along with research into model-based MCM sonar performance estimation.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The goal of this effort is to develop technologies to extend stand-off of special operations and EOD forces in clandestine hydrography, mine clearance and port security missions while increasing the range and effectiveness of divers. Advanced technologies are needed to gain access to areas contaminated by area-denial sensors and/or booby traps. Developed technologies will transition to the Joint Service EOD Program, the Naval EOD Program, or the DOD Technical Response Group. This activity includes applied research in sensor technology for NSW and EOD autonomous and handheld sonar systems to increase detection range and accuracy in harsh environments. Other efforts include mission support technology improvements for AUVs and human divers - such as communications, navigation and life support.

Funding increase from FY 2013 to FY 2014 due to the initiation of the development of technologies to reduce platform vulnerability.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (Sep 2011).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare.

This program develops and demonstrates advanced technologies, including Electromagnetic (EM) Rail Gun for naval weapon systems.  

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>FY 2013 funding associated with Future Naval Capability (FNC) efforts are transferring to a new Program Element titled Future Naval Capabilities Advanced Technology Development (PE 0603673N).  This is to enhance the visibility of the FNC Program by providing an easily navigable overview of all 6.3 FNC investments in a single location.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (Sep 2011). This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps). It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century. The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare. 

This PE addresses advanced technology development associated with providing the capability of Platform and Force Protection for the U.S. Navy. This program supports the development of technologies associated with all naval platforms (surface, subsurface, terrestrial and air) and the protection of those platforms. 

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>FY 2013 funding and associated Future Naval Capability (FNC) efforts addressed in this Program Element (PE) are transferring to a new PE titled Future Naval Capabilities Advanced Technology Development (PE 0603673N).  This is to enhance the visibility of the FNC Program by providing an easily navigable and consolidated overview of all 6.3 FNC investments in a single PE.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (Sep 2011).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare. 

Activities and efforts in this Program Element (PE) address technologies critical to enabling the transformation of discrete functions to network centric warfare capabilities, which simultaneously perform Radar, Electronic Warfare (EW), and Communications and Network functions across platforms through multiple, simultaneous and continuous communications/data links.  The Electromagnetic Systems Advanced Technology program addresses Radio Frequency (RF) technology for Surface and Aerospace Surveillance sensors and systems, EW sensors and systems, RF Communication Systems, Multi-Function sensor systems, and Position, Navigation and Timing (PNT) capabilities.  Within the Naval Transformational Roadmap, this investment offers affordable options for the transformational capabilities required by the Sea Shield (Theater Air and Missile Defense), Sea Strike (Persistent Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance), and ForceNet (Communications and Networking) SeaPower 21 Naval Warfighting Pillars. 

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>The overarching objective of this activity is to develop technologies that enable the development of affordable, effective and robust Position, Navigation and Timing (PNT) capabilities using either GPS systems, non-GPS navigation devices, or atomic clocks. This activity will increase the operational effectiveness of U.S. Naval units. The focus is on the mitigation of GPS electronic threats, the development of atomic clocks that possess unique long-term stability and precision, and the development of compact, low-cost, Inertial Navigation Systems (INS). 

The major objectives of this activity are: 
a) GPS Anti-Jam Antennas and Receivers - Integrate and demonstrate anti-jam antennas and antenna electronics for Navy platforms for the purpose of providing precision navigation capabilities in the presence of electronic threats; to integrate and demonstrate anti-spoofer/anti-jam processors for the purpose of providing precision navigation capabilities in the presence of emergent threats. 
b) Precision Time and Time Transfer - Integrate and demonstrate tactical grade atomic clocks that possess unique long-term stability and precision for the purpose of providing GPS-independent precision time; to integrate and demonstrate the capability of transferring GPS-derived time via radio frequency links for the purpose of providing GPS-independent precision time. 
c) Non-GPS Navigation Technology - To integrate and demonstrate inertial navigation systems for the purpose of providing an alternative means of providing precision navigation for those Naval platforms which may not have GPS navigation capabilities and/or loss of GPS signals; to integrate and demonstrate a correlation navigation technique using earth maps of high precision (including bathymetric, magnetic and gravimetric data) for navigation for those Naval platforms which may not have GPS navigation capabilities and/or loss of GPS signals. 

The decrease in funding from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is due to the reduced investment in Advanced Technology efforts for GPS and Navigation, and planned increase in Applied Research investment in the Navigation Technology activity in PE 0602271N.

                                    <r2:Title>INTEGRATED TOPSIDE (INTOP) INNOVATIVE NAVAL PROTOTYPE (INP)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The overarching objective of the INTOP INP is to develop and demonstrate a set of prototypes that integrate RF functionality (EW, Radar, Communications, Navigation) into a common set of multi-function apertures electronics and software through an architecture that is modular, scalable across all platforms, and open at the RF as well as computer and software level.  The apertures are capable of providing multiple simultaneous, independent beams which can together perform any of the above functions.

The major objectives of this activity are:

a) Submarine SATCOM Array - Develop wide-band SATCOM array capable of supporting EW for submarines.

b) Electronic Warfare (EW)/Information Operations (IO)/Line of Sight (LOS) Communications (Comms) for Surface Combatants - Develop wide-band array to support EW capability and other functions, including but not limited to IO and LOS Comms, for surface combatants with potential application to other platforms.

c) Architecture, Standards and Devices - Develop architecture and standards for wide-band multi-beam, multi-band arrays and below deck systems and the technology and electronic devices needed to make integrated array systems affordable.

d) Surface Combatant Communication Array - Develop wide-band surface combatant communication array capable of supporting other RF functions.

e) Resource Allocation Manager - Develop enterprise common Resource Allocation Manager.

f) Digital Radar - Develop an all digital radar to demonstrate advanced concepts for coherent radar networking and control, which will increase radar coverage and provide new levels of electronic protection (EP), while maximizing radar resources and reducing cost.

g) Low Band Communications, IO and EW - Develop low band technology development and concept studies leading to development of an Advanced Development Model (ADM).

The increase in funding from FY2014 to FY2015 is to design and develop the LowRIDR to cover the bands below SEWIP Block III, to build the highly adaptable FLEXDAR Radar.

The following are non-inclusive examples of accomplishments and plans for projects funded in this activity.</r2:Description>

- Continued SEWIP Block III Prototype, a multi-function RF topside aperture prototype covering approximately 200MHz to 22 GHz and providing the appropriate control and synergy of the functionality, such that the RF functions automatically support one another, providing improved operational capability. Additionally, demonstrate reductions in size, weight, and power as well as cost (both acquisition and life cycle) by reducing the number of topside apertures needed for communication, electronic warfare, and some radar functions.  A critical tenet of the prototype will be the demonstration of an open architecture so that not only can different companies supply the major components, such as a given receive or transmit aperture, but even down to the subarray and lower component level throughout the life cycle, to ensure continuing competition for maintenance and replacement parts.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (June 2012).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential S&amp;T efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of United States Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare.

As a key component of naval expeditionary forces, the Marine Corps has unique and technologically stressing requirements because of its expeditionary mission and intensive operational tempo, Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) structure, and conduct of maneuver warfare.  Critical requirements in this PE are: Command, Control, Communications, Computers (C4); Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR); maneuver techniques and means; force protection; logistic sustainment; human performance, training and education; and firepower. There are ongoing actions to develop and demonstrate advanced technologies and concepts in operational environments. Joint service efforts are aligned with Defense Technology Objectives and Joint Warfighting Capability Objectives. In addition, there is funding for experimentation in warfighting concepts as well as operational assessment of emerging technologies, to include technical support of operating forces to assess military utility of selected technologies. This PE specifically supports: continued development of enhanced warfighting capabilities through field experiments with Marine operating forces; rapid response to low-, mid-, and high-intensity conflicts in the Overseas Contingency Operation (OCO); methods for countering irregular threats; and expansion of seabasing and naval force packaging capabilities. The investment directly assists in fulfilling the forward presence requirements of Sea Shield and the transformational capabilities prescribed by Sea Strike. The Future Naval Capability (FNC) process is supported and funds are programmed accordingly. This PE is largely focused on demonstration of products and capabilities from the knowledge base and Discovery and Invention (D&amp;I) phases of Naval S&amp;T. As Naval partners, the Navy and Marine Corps S&amp;T Team strive to transition technologies that will implement objectives outlined in the Naval Operations Concept. This PE also funds technical solutions designed to increase Naval force capability, such as the Naval Expeditionary Combat Command. Investments in S&amp;T provide the opportunities for future capabilities and will prevent technological surprise. The PE as a whole will advance the amphibious and expeditionary capabilities for the Combatant Commanders helping to meet their emerging challenges by enhancing Naval S&amp;T contributions to the long commitment to the OCO. The Marine Corps Service Campaign Plan (MCSCP) is the lens through which USMC S&amp;T priorities are acted upon in order to support the future development of the Total Force.


Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Schedule: Project 2297, Worldwide contingency and combat operations (e.g., Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and humanitarian efforts) have increased the operations tempo of the operating forces to the extent that their support of, and participation in, the Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory (MCWL) experimentation was/remains challenging to coordinate and often directly impacts planned projects.  Additionally, rapid responses to emergent warfighter needs impacts planned projects.  Also, experimentation itself is not a precise business and information gained throughout the process can also effect program plans.  Thus, executing planned projects becomes "an art" in an effort to balance complicated and competing needs.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Critical Marine Corps requirements/imperatives addressed in this Project are: Maneuver; Force Protection; Human Performance, Training and Education; Logistics; Command, Control, Communications and Computers (C4); Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) and Firepower.   These are ongoing efforts to develop and demonstrate advanced technologies and system concepts in an operational environment.  Multiple transitions into the Sub-system/Component Advanced Development Phase are planned, as well as fieldable prototyped to reduce risk in System Concept Development and Demonstration.  A tactically effective Mine Countermeasures (MCM) capability is vital to Force Protection and necessary if Maneuver on land is to become a functional component of Naval Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare.  Maneuver, supported by MCM provides synchronization and speed of detection, breaching, clearance, proofing, and marking operations.  This project supports: 1) engaging regional forces in decisive combat on a global basis; 2) responding to all other contingencies and missions in the full spectrum of combat operations (high, middle, and low intensity), in Military Operations in Urban Terrain (MOUT), and in Operations other than War (OOTW); and 3)  warfighting experimentation.  By providing the technologies to enable these capabilities, this project supports the goals and objectives of the Strike, Littoral Warfare and Surveillance Joint Mission Areas.  These are ongoing efforts to develop and demonstrate advanced technologies and system concepts in an operational environment. 

In addition, this project supports the goals and objectives of the Littoral Combat/Power Projection related Enabling Capability (EC) within the Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) portfolio.  The focus of the EC within this PE is technology related to Urban, Asymmetric, and Expeditionary Operations (UAEO).  The UAEO Capability Gap is a science and technology developmental area that is of the highest importance to Marine Corps operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and is one of the highest ranked Capability Gaps prioritized by the Chief of Naval Operations and the Marine Corps Combat Development Command (MCCDC).  The UAEO technology gap is being pursued as part of an overall effort that addresses the Sea Strike Capability Gap.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>This activity integrates and demonstrates enhanced communications and situational awareness in warfighting environments and communication and situational awareness technologies for near term USMC operations. The focus is on development and leveraging advanced C4 technologies to enable enhanced Distributed Operations, Irregular Warfare, and Marine Corps Expeditionary Warfare.  Specifically, the C4 Thrust intends to demonstrate markedly improved capabilities in over-the-horizon (OTH), beyond line-of-sight, and restricted environment communications; mobile networking; tactical decision making; tactical situational awareness; and small unit position location and navigation.  Advanced technology resources will be applied to complement commercial, other service, and defense agency investments to produce a technology base to address identified Marine Corps technology gaps.

The increase in the Command, Control, Communications, Computers (C4) funding from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is due to expanded development efforts and demonstrations of technologies that enhance urban communications capabilities.</r2:Description>

The FNC Program represents the requirements-driven, delivery-oriented portion of the DoN Science and Technology (S&amp;T) portfolio.  FNC investments respond to Naval S&amp;T Gaps that are generated by the Navy and Marine Corps after receiving input from Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders.  The funding is aligned with the Naval challenges associated with projecting power despite anti-access and area denial, specifically the Sea Shield, Power and Energy, FORCEnet, and the Naval Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare warfighting capability gaps. The funding profile reflects the alignment of the FNC program investments into Enabling Capabilities (ECs); ECs respond to priority Naval warfighting capability gaps.  Funding for each EC is aligned to a 6.2 or 6.3 Budget Activity (BA) as appropriate.  Concurrent funding for Naval expeditionary warfare capability ECs is also provided from Navy PE0602750N and PE0603673N. Both of the Navy PE's were included in the FY 2013 President's Budget Request and are now the only Navy program elements funding Navy FNC work.  In previous submissions 7 Navy 6.2 PEs and 8 Navy 6.3 PEs funded FNC efforts.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>This activity supports Marine Corps Expeditionary Logistics which is the practical discipline and real world application of the deployment, sustainment, reconstitution, and re-deployment of forces engaged in expeditionary operations.  Expeditionary Logistics replaces mass with assured knowledge and speed, is equally capable ashore or afloat in austere environments, and is fully scalable to meet uncertain requirements.  Expeditionary Logistics logically divides into five pillars:  deployment support, force closure, sustainment, reconstitution/redeployment, and command and control.  These pillars are thoroughly integrated and perpetually related in execution.

The increase in the Logistics funding from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is due to expanded field demonstrations for the Marine Corps of renewable energy devices and deployable equipment.

The FY 2014 to FY 2015 decrease in the Logistics Thrust Activity is due to a reduction in the scope and size of anti-fouling and non-fouling water purification components to enable enduring performance of small water purification systems.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Maneuver Thrust Technology Area focuses on the development, demonstration, and transition of technologies that will increase the warfighting capabilities and effectiveness of current and future Marine Corps maneuver systems.  This Thrust aims at capturing emerging and "leap ahead" technologies in the areas of mobility, materials, propulsion, survivability, durability, signature reduction, modularity, and unmanned systems.  Beginning in FY 2009, Mine Countermeasures (MCM) efforts are funded under the Force Protection activity.  Presently, MCM supports and enhances the maneuver and force protection Marine landing forces with the development of technologies to enable detection, neutralization, breaching, and clearing of mines, Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), and unexploded ordnance from the beach exit to inland objectives.  MAGTF MCM is a functional component of Naval Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare and includes Ship to Objective Maneuver (STOM), Expeditionary Operations from a Sea Base, sustained Operations Ashore, Urban and Asymmetric Operations, and OOTW.

The increase in the Maneuver Activity funding from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is due to higher costs associated with the development of autonomy technologies and system concepts that will enable unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) to be used as autonomous logistic connector vehicles. 

The FY 2014 to FY 2015 decrease in the Maneuver Thrust Activity is due to a reduction in scope of development of a vehicle demonstrator that focuses on enhanced crew survivability.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>As part of the Futures Directorate (FD), of Combat Development and Integration (CD&amp;I), the Commanding General (CG) of the Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory (MCWL) also serves as the United States Marine Corps (USMC) Executive Agent for Marine Corps Science and Technology (S&amp;T).  MCWL's mission is to enhance the current and determine the future Marine Corps strategic landscape.  This is accomplished by assessing the Marine Corps' next warfighting concepts and capabilities via development and evaluation of innovative tactics, techniques, procedures, organizations, and technologies using an integral combination of concept based experimentation, technology assessments, wargaming, and analysis which will provide the strategic axis of advance for the Corps' entire enterprise.  The FD also serves as the Marine Corps' liaison to the Joint Staff for Joint Concept Development and Experimentation; thereby facilitating service-specific experiments as well as participation in joint service experimentation.

Wargames are conducted to frame emerging warfighting concepts, establish the Joint context for the Marine Corps Force Development System, and establish priorities for development of experimental and non-experimental capabilities.

Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S)-based events allow MCWL to examine capabilities with larger scale venues and forces than is practical with live forces at lower cost in terms of funding and in terms of operating force personnel and equipment.  M&amp;S also enables assessment of proposed capabilities before making investments in costly concept demonstrator technologies required in live force experiments. 

Technology investigations, investments, and assessments are conducted to identify, modify where appropriate, and evaluate technological capabilities that support advanced warfighting concepts, and to explore the military utility of promising new commercial or government technologies in support of urgent and compelling needs.

Live force experimentation permits exploration of prototype and surrogate technologies, as well as Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs), in order to better refine equipment requirements and to identify Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership, Personnel, and Facilities (DOTMLPF) initiatives needed to produce future capabilities.  Experimentation encompasses inquiries into multiple warfighting areas, including:  Combat Service Support (CSS) and Force Protection; Command, Control, Communications, and Computers (C4); Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR); Fires, Targeting, and Maneuver; and Warfighting Excellence.

Using operational forces, MCWL conducts Advanced Warfighting Experiments (AWEs) supported by Limited Objective Experiments (LOEs), Limited Technical Assessments (LTAs), Wargames, and Studies.  These events are planned and scheduled as part of a series of experimentation campaigns focused on one or more central warfighting concepts.  These campaigns are executed under the guidance of the Commandant of the Marine Corps (CMC) and under the auspices of the Deputy Commandant (DC), CD&amp;I.

The current Futures Directorate Campaign Plan (FDCP), formerly the MCWL Campaign Plan (MCP) addresses the challenges associated with the Enhanced Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) Operations (EMO), Ship To Objective Maneuver (STOM), and Seabasing concepts.  This campaign began in FY 2011 and is projected to culminate with an Advanced Warfighting Experiment (AWE) in 2014.  EMO experimentation seeks to capitalize on the enhancements achieved during the previous MCWL campaign, Enhanced Company Operations (ECO), completed in FY 2010, which centered on expanding the combat capabilities of the Marine Infantry Company.  EMO experimentation examines and develops the capabilities of other elements of the MAGTF beyond the infantry company.  Focus areas for this effort are Logistics, Command and Control (C2), and Fires, Targeting, and Maneuver.

Upon completion of EMO experimentation in FY 2014, MCWL will shift focus in FY 2015 to experimentation based on the challenges associated with achieving the goals expressed in the Secretary of the Navy's "Cooperative Strategy 21" and the Marine Corps' follow-on "Expeditionary Force 21" (EF21) concept.  MCWL will pursue experimentation that support flexible and sustainable MAGTFs employing distributed tactical formations across the range of military operations.  MCWL will also examine future enhancements in training, organization, and equipment for immediate crisis response, with projects such as such as Fly-in Integrated Command Element (FICE).  The goal of this concept-based line of experimentation is to support the continued operationalization of the concepts of Distributed Operations (DO), Operational Maneuver From The Sea (OMFTS), STOM, and Seabasing.

Finally, the CMC designated MCWL as the lead agency for all USMC Counter Improvised Explosive Device (CIED) activities, thereby extending MCWL's responsibilities in this critical area.  MCWL continues to support the immediate needs of deployed forces and exploit opportunities presented by promising emerging technologies.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The DOD's Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Program (JNLWP) was established by the Secretary of Defense, who assigned centralized responsibility for DOD joint research and development of non-lethal technology to the Commandant of the Marine Corps as the Executive Agent.  The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics provides direct oversight of the JNLWP.

The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) reflect science and technology (S&amp;T) investment decisions provided by the Joint NLW Integrated Product Team, a multi-service flag level corporate board that executes the JNLWP for the Commandant of the Marine Corps.  This direction is based on the needs and capabilities of the Services, the Special Operations Command, and the Coast Guard, as identified in the DoD's Non-Lethal Weapons Joint Capabilities Based Assessment Document.  This coordinated joint S&amp;T development approach addresses mutual capability gaps and assures the best non-lethal technologies and equipment are provided to the operating forces while eliminating duplicative service S&amp;T investment.

This program funds Advanced Technology Development of next-generation Non-Lethal Weapons (NLWs) and includes performing analysis, technical development efforts, and modeling and simulation necessary to ensure optimum weaponization and use of these NLWs.  Investment areas include research and development of next-generation NLWs such as: non-lethal directed energy weapons (lasers, millimeter wave and high power microwave) for counter-personnel and counter-materiel missions; non-lethal counter-personnel technologies (acoustic, optical, and human electro-muscular disruption technologies), and advanced non-lethal materials (including materiels for vehicle/vessel stopping and counter-facility applications).  Next-generation NLW systems focus on long-range localized Non-Lethal (NL) effects to identified threat individuals (or groups of individuals) and/or their threat weapons systems operating in complicated environments such as urban areas, crowds, buildings, vehicles, vessels, and also in close proximity to high-value civilian facilities.  By order of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, the Commandant of the Marine Corps was established as the Executive Agent for DoD Joint Non-Lethal Weapons RDT&amp;E.

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project funds the research and development of next-generation NLWs and includes performing analysis, technical development efforts, and modeling and simulation necessary to ensure optimum weaponization and use of these NLWs.  Investment areas include research and development of next-generation NLWs such as: non-lethal directed energy weapons (lasers, millimeter wave and high power microwave) for counter-personnel and counter-materiel missions; non-lethal counter-personnel technologies (acoustic, optical, and human electro-muscular disruption technologies), and advanced non-lethal materiels (including materiels for vehicle/vessel stopping and counter-facility applications). Next-generation NLW systems focus on long-range localized NL effects to identified threat individuals (or groups of individuals) and/or their threat weapons systems operating in complicated environments such as urban areas, crowds, buildings, vehicles, vessels, and also in close proximity to high-value civilian facilities.

The increase in the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons funding from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is due to the initiation and expanded evaluation of alternative non-lethal prototype technologies offering operational military utility with the goal of transitioning the best candidates to higher levels of technology development and acquisition.

The FY 2014 to FY 2015 decrease in the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Technology Development PE is due to a funding reduction addressed in Deputy Secretary of Defense Memo, "Strategic Choices and Management Review Resulting Direction and Guidance".  This reduction slows the advanced prototype development and demonstration of a smaller, lighter active denial technology demonstrator based on most promising and mature 95 GHZ source technology.  It also delays the schedule of the modular prototyping of High Power Microwave (HPM) component hardware and defers initiation of behavior response research and analysis.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) address the Advanced Technology Development associated with the Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) Program.  The FNC Program represents the requirements-driven, delivery-oriented portion of the Navy's Science and Technology (S&amp;T) portfolio.  FNC investments respond to Naval S&amp;T Gaps that are identified by the Navy and Marine Corps after receiving input from Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders. The Enabling Capabilities (ECs) and associated technology product investments of the FNC Program are competitively selected by a 3-star Technology Oversight Group (TOG), chartered by the S&amp;T Corporate Board and representing the requirements, acquisition, research and fleet/forces communities of the Navy and the Marine Corps.  

This was a new PE in FY 2013 that consolidated all Navy 6.3 FNC Program investments into a single Navy 6.3 PE.  Marine Corps FNC 6.3 investments are consolidated in a single Marine Corps 6.3 PE (0603640M). In FY 2011 and FY 2012, the Navy's 6.3 FNC Program investments were spread across 8 separate 6.3 PEs:  0603114N, 0603123N, 0603235N, 0603236N, 0603271N, 0603279N, 0603747N and 0603782N.  The consolidation in this PE allows all investments to be viewed by FNC Pillar, Enabling Capability (EC) and Technology Product.  It greatly enhances the visibility of the FNC Program by providing an easily navigable overview of all 6.3 FNC investments in a single place.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>FNC investments are typically 3-5 years in duration.  They provide a continuance of basic research by maturing technologies from a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 3 or 4 to a TRL of 6.  All FNC products require BA2 and BA3 funded technology development, which is coordinated to ensure tangible technology products are delivered upon completion of each investment.  Each year the TOG refreshes the FNC Program by approving new ECs and technology products as older ones get delivered.  After transition to an acquisition program, FNC products are further engineered, integrated and ultimately, delivered to the warfighter. The development and delivery of each FNC product is guided by a Technology Transition Agreement (TTA) that is signed by the requirements and acquisition sponsors, as well as the S&amp;T developer.

This project supports the naval pillars of Capable Manpower, Enterprise and Platform Enablers, Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare, Force Health Protection, Forcenet, Power and Energy, Sea Basing, Sea Shield and Sea Strike.  Each of these pillars is listed as a separate R-2 Activity.  Under each R-2 Activity, the BA 6.3 accomplishments and plans for every Enabling Capability (EC) and Technology Product in the FNC Program are listed.  ECs are composed of one or more interrelated technology products, so for clarity, each product is shown under its EC.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This is to enhance the visibility of the FNC Program by providing an easily navigable overview of all 6.3 FNC investments in a single location.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (Sep 2011).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare.

This program supports the development and demonstration of field medical equipment and technologies to improve warfighter safety and to enhance personnel performance under adverse conditions. Navy investment in these areas is essential because Navy/USMC mission needs are not adequately addressed by the civilian sector or other Federal agencies. These projects support funds future capabilities within the Force Health Protection Program, a Future Naval Capability (FNC) that will provide technology options for the future Navy and Marine Corps by reducing morbidity and mortality when casualties occur.

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program supports the development and demonstration of field medical equipment, diagnostic capabilities and treatments; technologies to improve warfighter safety and to enhance personnel performance under adverse conditions; and systems to prevent occupational injury and disease in hazardous, deployment environments.  Navy investment in these areas is essential because Navy/USMC mission needs are not adequately addressed by the civilian sector or other Federal agencies.  For example, civilian emergency medicine does not address casualty stabilization during long transit times to definitive care.  The NIH focuses on the basic science of disease processes and not product development.  Programs are coordinated with other Services through the Armed Services Biomedical Research Evaluation and Management (ASBREM) Committee to prevent duplication of effort.  This project funds the Force Health Protection program a Future Naval Capability (FNC)that will provide technology options for future Navy and Marine Corps capabilities and supports the "Sea Warrior" component of the Naval Transformation Roadmap, medical logistics aspects of "Sea Basing" and expeditionary force medical support associated with "Sea Strike".</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>NMDP:
NMDP continued to expand participation of transplant centers in RITN. Hospitals that participate in both the NMDP Network of treatment centers as well as the NDMS that is managed by the Department of Health and Human Services were invited to join RITN.  As a result of this targeted recruitment, eight additional transplant centers joined; unfortunately two centers were lost to attrition resulting in a total composition of: 47 transplant centers, 6 donor centers, and 7 cord blood banks.

A new initiative that began was the Site Assessment program that involved an NMDP staff member reviewing existing documentation at 11 RITN transplant centers against a standardized checklist. As a result, many best practices were gleaned from these centers and the RITN SOP template was updated based on the content of the checklists.

NMRC:
During this period, the C. W. Bill Young Marrow Donor Recruitment and Research Program, BMRD, NMRC directly contributed to donor recruitment and transplantation and science and technology developments.  This includes over 5,000 transplants coordinated by the NMDP of which over 500 were provided by DoD volunteers through the NMRC / Georgetown part of the program.  The NMDP added over 700,000 volunteer donors to the national registry, of which over 40,000 were from DoD volunteers from the NMRC / Georgetown.  Numerous science and technology accomplishments are included and these developments are translated into the development of medical countermeasures to respond to potential marrow toxic injury which are linked to the national effort to develop medical countermeasures for radiation injury.    

Georgetown:
Donor Center Progress
The DoD registry includes 707,913 volunteers of which 45,362 volunteers were recruited in 2011. There were 8,709 health evaluations and confirmatory HLA typings requested in 2011 and 892 requests were made for stem cell collection of which 577 went to actual collection.

Probe Testing Progress:
The laboratory tested 17,885 new volunteers for HLA-A,-B; 17,885 for HLA-C, and 20,805 for HLA-DRB1. In the first three months the laboratory has typed 18,615 donors for HLA-DQB1 and is currently working on providing HLADPB1 typing for those donors. They are currently working on establishing and validating robust assays for DQB1 and DPB1 because of recent studies suggesting that these loci may impact outcome of transplantation; DQB1 when a mismatched donor is selected and DPB1 when a donor with a T cell epitope mismatch is selected.

Sequencing Progress Report:
Through this grant they continue to improve the robotics and reagents to test samples flow by typing large numbers of donors at recruitment. The PI and team are currently typing 1000 volunteers of European ancestry for the registry using a one step SBT typing method. They previously sequenced 196 loci from patients and potentially matched family members.</r2:Text>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>FY 2013 funding associated with Future Naval Capability (FNC) efforts are transferring to a new Program Element titled Future Naval Capabilities Advanced Technology Development (PE 0603673N).  This is to enhance the visibility of the FNC Program by providing an easily navigable overview of all 6.3 FNC investments in a single location.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (Sep 2011).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare.

All Navy advanced technology development in undersea target detection, classification, localization, tracking and neutralization is funded through this PE.  The related technologies being developed are aimed at enabling Sea Shield, one of the three core operational concepts detailed in the Naval Transformational Roadmap.  Associated efforts focus on new Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) operational concepts that promise to improve wide-area surveillance, detection, localization, tracking and attack capabilities against quiet adversary submarines operating in noisy and cluttered shallow water environments.  The focus is on leveraging technologies that will protect the country's current capital investment in surveillance, submarine, surface ship and air ASW assets.

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

- Localization of 85% or more of enemy submarines in far forward or contested waters with false locations of less than 10% of total calls.
- Effective cueing of an attack from a distance of up to 200nm.
- Improvement of the Lightweight Torpedo (Mk 54). Specific improvements are classified.
- Extending deep water active distributed system lifetime to a few months with a probability of detection (Pd) of 90% within 4 hours (field configuration) or 90% per crossing (barrier configuration), with a False Alarm Rate (FAR) of no more than 4/day.
- Delivery from a Vertical Takeoff Unmanned Air Vehicle (VTUAV) and/or a long-range, high-speed Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) a compact undersea weapon capable of a high Probability of Kill (PK) given precise target localization.
- Detection and localization performance with a single-line vector sensor array nominally equivalent or superior to that of two coherently processed TB-29A arrays. Acquisition costs to be competitive with the cost of a current TB-29A and at least 30% less than the cost of two arrays. Sensor and telemetry packaging will be adequate to achieve neutral buoyancy in an existing TB-29A form factor with array power efficiency greater than 75%. Array handling will be compatible with the existing TB-29 handling system.

- Achieving a drifting active distributed system lifetime of at least two days in areas of tactical significance while maintaining required system performance with a minimum number of sensor nodes.
- Maintaining an effective lifetime of a month for mobile active distributed systems when subjected to the action of eddies from a major ocean current.
- Predicting reseed 6 hours before performance degrades.
- Holding the Area of Uncertainty (AOU) to no larger than 10 nm2 for an hour after initial detection through the control of the coherent sources.

Through a combination of better Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) command-level training and improved operator training provide the following:
- Improve the ability of active sonar operators to detect targets and reject potential false alarms compared to current simulation based training.
- Increase Pd by 50%.
- Provide a decrease in FAR by a factor of two.
- Provide a reduction in the probability of a hit on a High Value Unit (HVU) by a factor of two.
- Improve the ability of the ASW Commander to position assets to increase coverage, reduce active system interference and deal effectively with competing missions.
- Reduce training cost by greater than 80% and increase the frequency of training opportunities by greater than 600% relative to live training.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) addresses the development of recent technology breakthroughs to meet current operational needs from a subscale proof-of-principle into a full-scale prototype for warfighter experimentation during laboratory and operational demonstrations, Fleet Battle Experiments (FBE), Limited Objective Experiments (LOEs) and sea trial exercises.  The key aspects of this PE are divided into four areas: (1) SwampWorks develops and demonstrates newly invented or recently discovered technologies that address emergent and enduring operational problems in an accelerated timeframe; (2) Naval Warfare Experimentation develops rapid prototypes and provides them to the warfighter for experimentation during laboratory and operational demonstrations; (3) TechSolutions develops rapid response science and technology prototypes addressing Fleet/Force needs identified by Sailors and Marines at the deckplate level; (4) Operations Analysis provides the Navy and Marine Corps the means to identify capability needs that can be addressed with science and technology solutions, and (5) Manufacturing Technology Science and Technology (S&amp;T) to accelerate recently discovered manufacturing technologies to reduce the acquisition and ownership costs of current and future platforms.

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>SwampWorks seeks to develop and demonstrate technologies that address emergent and enduring operational problems in an accelerated timeframe. Some of these technologies may end up in the hands of the warfighter for experimentation, or may culminate in a significant exercise that demonstrates capability then transitions into the Acquisition Program of Record (POR).

The funding increase from FY 2014 to FY 2015 is largely due to the increased research and fleet interest in the areas of Autonomy, Electromagnetic Warfare and the exploitation of unmanned vehicles.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>FY 2013 funding associated with Future Naval Capability (FNC) efforts are transferring to a new Program Element titled Future Naval Capabilities Advanced Technology Development (PE 0603673N).  This is to enhance the visibility of the FNC Program by providing an easily navigable overview of all 6.3 FNC investments in a single location.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (Sep 2011).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare.

This PE primarily develops and demonstrates prototype Mine Countermeasures (MCM) and Expeditionary Warfare system components that support capabilities enabling Naval Forces to influence operations ashore.  Third-world nations have the capability to procure, stockpile and rapidly deploy all types of naval mines, including new generation mines having sophisticated performance characteristics, throughout the littoral battlespace.  Real world operations have demonstrated the requirement to quickly counter the mine threat.  Advanced technologies must rapidly detect and neutralize all mine types, from deep water to the inland objective.  This program supports the advanced development and integration of sensors, processing, warheads and delivery vehicles to demonstrate improved Naval Warfare capabilities.  It supports the MCM-related Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) Enabling Capabilities (ECs).  Within the Naval Transformation Roadmap, this investment will achieve one of three key transformational capabilities required by Sea Shield as well as technically enable the Ship To Objective Maneuver (STOM) key transformational capability within Sea Strike.

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>This activity focuses on developing and demonstrating technologies that support detection, classification, identification and multi-sensor data fusion of mine and obstacle data to speed tactical timelines and increase operator standoff.  Efforts include: electro-optic sensors/systems to enable Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) rapid minefield reconnaissance and precise mineline location from Very Shallow Water (VSW) through the Beach Zone (BZ); sensors/systems to enable cooperating Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs) to perform wide-area reconnaissance and assault lane reconnaissance/preparation from shallow water through the Surf Zone (SZ); sensor development for detection and classification of buried mines; technologies for MCM Mission Modules for the new Littoral Combat Ships (LCS); and sensor data fusion to enable a theater mine warfare common operating picture and own ship protection.  This activity supports the development and transition of technologies for the MCM-related FNCs.

This S&amp;T investment supports the Joint Requirements Oversight Council of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (OPNAV) validated requirements for MCM.  This S&amp;T investment of mine and obstacle detection provides critical S&amp;T transitions to the Mine Warfare Mission package of the Navy's new LCS.  This investment in MCM S&amp;T is reported as part of OPNAV's annual report to Congress in the MCM Certification Plan.  This plan is reviewed and approved by the Office of the Secretary of Defense, and any deviations in ONR's reported S&amp;T funding for MCM throughout the Future Years Defense Plan must be reported and justified through Navy and OSD.  Further, the MCM S&amp;T investment plan structure is reviewed and authorized by the Navy's Technology Oversight Group that approves ECs, their supporting products, and funding profiles.

Funding increase from FY 2013 to FY 2014 due to the initiation of a laser interfermetric sensor/system that can be integrated onto various platforms including EOD robots for detection and/or diagnosis of buried objects. Highly dexterous dual manipulator systems will also be initiated in FY14 that can be integrated onto EOD robots for precision render safe and neutralization missions.</r2:Description>
