                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Advances fundamental knowledge and promotes theoretical and experimental research in life and physical sciences.

The projects within this BA reflect the research areas of Life Sciences (LF1) (e.g. microbiology, biochemistry, pathogenic mechanisms, cell and molecular biology, immunology, nanoscale science, and information science) which focus on fundamental efforts to understand living systems' response to biological or chemical agents, to support detection, diagnostics, protection, and medical treatment. 

The projects within this BA also include efforts in Physical Sciences (PS1) (e.g. chemistry, physics, materials science, nanotechnologies, nanoscale science and environmental science) which focus on fundamental scientific phenomena.  These support investigation of physical and chemical properties and interactions for enhanced functionalities important to detection, diagnostics, protection, and decontamination.

BA1 also supports the DoD Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) Strategy Plan to attract, inspire, and develop exceptional STEM talent across the education continuum to enrich our current and future DoD workforce to meet defense technological challenges.  This includes the Joint Science and Technology Institute (JSTI) which is a 2-week residential program for high school students and teachers who conduct a research project from a STEM field with a DoD scientist.  In addition, the National Research Council Research Associateship Program and the Military Internship Program provide unique opportunities for talented scientists and engineers, and promising midshipmen/cadets, respectively, to conduct research at DOD service laboratories on projects that are of interest to the Chemical and Biological Defense Program Enterprise in an effort to develop the future DoD workforce.

The projects in this PE are placed in BA1 because they are basic research efforts directed towards non-specific or non-unique military applications.  Basic research technological breakthroughs support applied research (PE 0602384BP) activities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project (PS1) advances fundamental scientific knowledge in physical science areas that include chemistry, physics, materials science, environmental sciences, and nanotechnology that could potentially lead to transformational CB defensive capabilities enhancing Warfighter performance and safety.  Research results in physics, chemistry and materials sciences that have potential application in point and standoff detection, diagnostics, as well as protection and decontamination.  Surface and environmental sciences focus on the study of physical and chemical properties and phenomena of interactions, especially with regard to Non Traditional Agents (NTAs), that seek to improve capabilities such as detection, protection, and decontamination.  Research in nanotechnology and nanoscale sciences, such as nanoelectromechanical systems, molecular motors, nano-mechanical resonance sensing, and nano-meter imaging, has potential application across CB capability areas to provide significant enhancement by, for example, decreasing detection response times, increasing medical countermeasure effectiveness against a wider array of threat agents, and providing currently unavailable modalities like detection imbedded in fabrics.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Designed and synthesized novel decontamination options that are broadly applicable to multiple chemicals or biologicals and are less harmful to equipment.  Investigated novel signatures and analytical methods, new separation approaches, and recognition elements to reduce logistical burden while increasing specificity to overcome limitations in current approaches to identifying and quantifying CB threats.  Developed synthetic strategies within nanostructured material to mitigate chemical and biological threats; results yielded promising porous material which catalytically deactivates Soman in less than ten (10) minutes at room temperature.  Explored materials and integration of functionality that may provide adaptive materials and capabilities for CB defense countermeasures that bind, catalyze, sense, transduce, respond and/or mitigate threats.  Verified reaction mechanisms between CB threats and state-of-the-art surfaces in a vacuum environment to establish a baseline of reactivity; results yielded in the utilization of advanced surface interrogation techniques verifying historic assumptions which previously could not be verified.  Developed understanding of chemical behavior in the environment, such as atmospheric reactivity and intra material interactions.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project TM2 provides for applied research for innovative technology approaches to advance medical systems designed to rapidly identify, diagnose, prevent, and treat disease due to exposure to all three of radiological, chemical and biological threat agents.  Categories for this project include core science efforts in Medical Chemical, Medical Biological, Diagnostics, and the Medical Countermeasures Initiative (MCMI).  Against radiological threats, this project provides investment for the development of pretreatments (prophylaxis) and post-irradiation therapeutics against radiological/nuclear exposure.  Against chemical and biological agents, this project supports applied research for the investigation of new medical countermeasures to include prophylaxes, pretreatments, antidotes, skin decontaminants, and therapeutic drugs against identified and emerging biological and chemical warfare agents.  Medical Science and Technology (S&amp;T) efforts in this Budget Activity refine promising medical initiatives identified in Budget Activity 1, resulting in the development of countermeasures to protect against and treat the effects of exposure to chemical and biological (CB) agents.  Diagnostic research focuses on providing high quality data closer to the point-of-need comprising device innovation, panels of biomarkers driven by bioinformatics, and epidemiological modeling tools.  

The Medical Countermeasures Initiative (MCMI) was established to coordinate inter-related advanced development and flexible manufacturing capabilities, providing a dedicated, cost-effective, reliable, and sustainable MCM process that meets the Warfighter and national security needs.  MCMI efforts within science and technology (S&amp;T) are concentrated in advancing two areas: 1) regulatory science and 2) flexible manufacturing technologies and processes for MCMs.  Efforts conducted in these areas are enablers supporting the DoD Medical Countermeasures Advanced Development and Manufacturing (MCM-ADM) capability.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Demonstrates technologies supporting transition to advanced component development.  This includes physical capabilities which cover biological and chemical detection, situational awareness and effects modeling, and protection and hazard mitigation.  Other major efforts support enhanced chemical detection capabilities for aerosols and non-traditional agents, expanded capabilities for biosurveillance in pathogen detection and diagnosis, and pretreatments and therapeutics against a broader set of chemical and biological agents.  Medical capabilities (pretreatments, therapeutics, diagnostics capabilities, and drug manufacturing and regulatory science technologies), include capabilities against non-traditional agents.

In the physical sciences area, Project CB3 focuses on demonstrations of CB defense technologies, including biological detection, chemical detection, information system technology for hazard prediction and systems performance, and protection, and decontamination.  The Project continues to pursue solutions against traditional agents. 

All non-traditional agent (NTA)-dedicated research (both medical and non-medical) is consolidated in Project NT3.  This Project includes NTA chemical diagnostics, medical pretreatments, therapeutics, detection, and protection and hazard mitigation.

The medical program in Project TM3, aims to produce biological diagnostic assays and reagents, diagnostic device platforms, pretreatments and therapeutics for bacterial, viral, and toxin threats as well as for chemical threats, and medical devices, as countermeasures for CBR threat agents.  Specific areas of medical investigation include: prophylaxis, pretreatment, antidotes and therapeutics, personnel and patient decontamination, and medical management of casualties.  

Project TT3, Techbase Technology Transition, pursues efforts to enhance military operational capability, concepts of operation, WMD elimination, and hazard mitigation following a biological warfare or chemical warfare attack.

The PE is dedicated to conducting proof-of-principle field demonstrations, and testing system-specific technologies to meet specific military needs.  Work conducted under this PE will transition to and will provide risk reduction for PE 0603884BP/PE 0604384BP activities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

This project focuses on demonstrating fast and agile scientific responses to enhance or develop capabilities that address emerging threats.  Efforts in this project support an integrated approach to develop new or enhanced countermeasures against novel and emerging threats through innovative science and technology (S&amp;T) solutions for detection, protection, decontamination and medical countermeasures (MCMs).  Efforts supply test methodologies and supporting science to verify capabilities, develop protection and hazard mitigation options, expand hazard assessment tools, and develop MCMs against NTAs.  This project is a comprehensive and focused effort for developing NTA defense capabilities, coordinated with specific interagency partners for doctrine, equipment, and training for the Warfighter and civilian population for defense against NTAs.  This project supports advanced technology development of NTA defense science and technology initiatives and transitions them to Budget Activities 4 and 5.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project TM3 supports preclinical and early phase clinical development of vaccines, therapeutic drugs, and diagnostic capabilities to provide safe and effective medical defense against validated biological threat agents or emerging infectious disease biothreats including bacteria, toxins, and viruses.  Innovative biotechnology approaches to advance medical systems designed to rapidly identify, diagnose, prevent, and treat disease due to exposure to biological threat agents will be evaluated.  In addition this project supports the advanced development of medical countermeasures to include prophylaxes, pretreatments, antidotes, skin decontaminants and therapeutic drugs against identified and emerging chemical warfare threat agents.  Entry of candidate vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostic technologies into advanced development is facilitated by the development of technical data packages that support the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Investigational New Drug (IND) processes, DoD acquisition regulations, and the oversight of early phase clinical trials in accordance with FDA guidelines.  This project also supports the advanced development of medical countermeasures to protect the Warfighter against radiological/nuclear exposure.

The Medical Countermeasures Initiative (MCMI) was established to coordinate inter-related advanced development and flexible manufacturing capabilities, providing a dedicated, cost-effective, reliable, and sustainable MCM process that meets the Warfighter and national security needs.  MCMI efforts within science and technology (S&amp;T) are concentrated in advancing two areas: 1) regulatory science and 2) flexible manufacturing technologies and processes for MCMs.  Efforts conducted in these areas are enablers supporting the DoD Medical Countermeasures Advanced Development and Manufacturing (MCM-ADM) capability.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

These programs offer an opportunity to identify and efficiently mature emerging technologies including limited objective experiments, laboratory experiments, risk reduction efforts, engineering and integration.  These demonstrations and programs seek to demonstrate the potential for enhanced military operational capability and/or cost effectiveness.  Upon conclusion of the technical and operational demonstrations, the user or sponsor provides a determination of the military utility and operational impact of the technology and capability demonstrated.  Successfully demonstrated technologies with proven military utility can remain in place for future extended user evaluations, accepted into the advanced stages of the formal acquisition process, proceed directly into limited or full-scale production or be returned to the technical base for further development.  This project addresses four family of products areas: Biological Resiliency, to include Biosurveillance; Integrated Early Warning, to include Remote Detection; Chemical and Biological Warfare Agent Destruction and Disablement; and Hazard Mitigation.  Biological resiliency efforts are targeted to reduce biological threats.  Integrated Early Warning is conducted through a coordinated program approach focused on layering Chemical and Biological Detection technologies and integrating CB threat indicators with rapid response actions.  WMD Disablement and Destruction addresses detection, identification, verification and baseline assessments in support of expeditionary forces deployed in non-permissive environments.  Hazard Mitigation addresses Chemical, Biological, and Radiological (CBR) remediation and decontamination processes.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

As part of the Transatlantic Collaborative Biological Resiliency Demonstration (TaCBRD), conducted extended user evaluation of capabilities for persistent and contagious bio agent scenarios in the US European Command Area of Responsibility (EUCOM AOR).  These capabilities recently transitioned to the JPM-Guardian, JPM-Information Systems, and JPM-NBC Contamination Avoidance for potential inclusion into multiple PORs and Poland Ministry of Defense.  Initiated biosurveillance and rapid response ATD, named Homeland Integrated Biosurveillance Response and Information Demonstration (HIBRID), in the U.S. Pacific Command (PACOM) AOR through FY18.  Conducted a rapid military utility assessment and field experiment process to assess early technology capability contributions, in collaboration with the CBDP Joint Combat Developer.  Completed demonstration of decontamination technologies for airframe interiors and exteriors against bio agents as part of a JCTD initiative with US TRANSCOM, allowing aircraft to return to service and achieving considerable cost savings over the alternative of removing those assets from service.  Completed and transitioned the Thermal Imaging Dual-use for Aerosol Monitoring Alarms and Security (TIDAMAS) ATD to Joint Project Manager-Guardian for detection of biological threat aerosol attacks, which allows for enhanced integrated base defense posture and protection of critical DoD infrastructure.  JPM-Guardian will continue to conduct advanced development of TIDAMAS in support of the DoD Physical Security Enterprise and Analysis Group (PSEAG).

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Operational forces have an immediate need to survive, safely operate, and sustain operations in a Chemical and Biological (CB) threat environment across the continuum of global, contingency, special operations/low intensity conflict, counternarcotics, and other high-risk missions.  This program element supports the Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) of medical and non-medical CB defensive equipment and materiel.  Congress directed centralized management of Department of Defense (DoD) medical and non-medical CB Defense initiatives.  DoD missions for civil support operations have recently expanded and have resulted in providing focus to develop technologies to support CB counterterrorism initiatives.  ADC&amp;P is conducted for an array of chemical, biological, and toxin detection and warning systems providing early warning, collector concentrators, generic detection, improved reagents, and decontamination systems using solutions that will remove and/or detoxify contaminated materiel without damaging combat equipment, personnel, or the environment.  CB sensors and diagnostics enhance the Departments environmental and medical surveillance efforts by improving the monitoring and surveillance of threats and forces preparing for and engaged in military operations.  These efforts are required to enable military commanders and the Military Health System to prevent, treat, and mitigate threats to individual Service Members and military units.  Integration of CB sensor and diagnostic data from the programs in this ACD&amp;P will also be usable within the homeland security and Federal public health common operating pictures.  

The Department of Defense is responsible for research, development, acquisition, and deployment of medical countermeasures to prevent or mitigate the health effects of CB threats to the Armed Forces and directs strategic planning for and oversight of programs to support medical countermeasures development and acquisition for our Armed Forces personnel.  The CB medical threat to the Armed Forces, in contrast with public health threats to U.S. citizens, encompasses all potential or continuing enemy actions that can render a Service Member combat ineffective.  CB medical threats, because they apply as a whole to military units deployed on a specific mission and/or operations, may result in the unit being unable to complete its mission.  CB medical countermeasures developed by DoD, unlike those developed to support U.S. population, must support military commanders practical operational requirements and deployment strategies and must emphasizes prevention of injury and illness and protection of the force.  Preventive measures in this ACD&amp;P, such as vaccines against the most likely biological threat agents and traditional / non-traditional chemical agent prophylaxis, conserves fighting strength, decreases the logistics burden by reducing the need for larger deployed hospital footprint and greater demand for tactical and strategic medical evacuation, and satisfies the need for greater flexibility in military planning and operations.  When vaccines and other prophylactic medical countermeasures are not available, efforts on this ACD&amp;P support pre-hospitalization treatment, en-route care, hospital care, and long-term clinical outcomes.  Specific items in this category include improvements to CB diagnostics and therapeutics to mitigate the consequences of biologic agents and exposure to ionizing radiation due to nuclear or radiological attacks.  DoD is the only Federal activity conducting ACD&amp;P on these prophylactic, diagnostic, and therapeutic CB medical countermeasures.  

The Department of Defense coordinates its efforts with the Departments of Health and Human Services to promote synergy and minimize redundancy.  The Department of Defense ensures coordination by participating in the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise interagency strategic planning process ("One Portfolio").  The Department of Defense's longstanding experience and success in CB medical countermeasure research, development, acquisition, and deployment not only ensures protection of the Armed Forces, it also accelerates and improves the overall national efforts in CB medical countermeasure research, development, and acquisition because of its unique facilities, testing capabilities, and trained and experienced personnel.  

ACD&amp;P also supports the development of updated test capabilities to evaluate Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Defense systems. 

The projects in this program element support efforts in the technology development phase of the acquisition strategy and are therefore correctly placed in Budget Activity 4.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) Project supports Component Advanced Development and System Integration (CAD/SI) of reconnaissance, detection, identification, and hazard prediction equipment, hardware, and software.  Experimentation and demonstration will be used in this phase to reduce risk and inform supporting materiel solutions, CONOPS and TTPs.  Individual efforts are: (1) Biosurveillance (BSV), (2) Next Generation Chemical Detector (NGCD); (3) Non-Traditional Agent (NTA) Defense.

Biosurveillance (BSV) is a set of capabilities that acquire, integrate, and analyze medical, environmental, and incident management data using existing and next generation systems, medical and non-medical sample collection tools and identifiers/diagnostics; and transition hardware/software tools and devices as residuals from the Biosurveillance Joint United States Force Korea (USFK) Portal and Integrated Threat Recognition (JUPITR) Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD).  BSV will align the biosurveillance efforts across DoD and national strategies.  BSV will scope and influence BSV capabilities as products to meet Warfighter requirements through innovative management of key BSV initiatives.  BSV requirements address medical and physical CBRN mission needs spanned in over 11 requirements documents and through Combatant Commander (COCOM) identified needs.  BSV supports Joint US Forces Korea (USFK) Portal and Integrated Threat recognition (JUPITR) ATD/BSV ATD which find, demonstrate, transition, and transfer the best operational concepts and technology solutions in support of a holistic approach to countering biological threats from the laboratory to operational use and theater confirmation of a Biological Event.  JUPITR ATD consists of four legs; Early Warning (EW), Biological Identification Capabilities Sets (BICS), Assessment of Environmental Detectors (AED), and Biosurveillance Portal (BSP).  The JUPITR ATD provides the USFK with a holistic biosurveillance capability to provide early warning, detection, collection, identification, and theater confirmation of a Biological event.  The JUPITR ATD consists of filling capability gaps through information sharing and communication systems and detection/diagnostic systems for the USFK.  Outputs will focus on proving component, CONOPS, and subsystem transition into relevant technologies that are currently programs of record (PORs) to include G-BSP, NGDS, JBTDS and CALS.  Systems used in Operational Demonstration will be left behind with a two year sustainment plan for continuing use.  Whole system live agent test (WSLAT) of AED units will support the Joint Project Manager for Nuclear Biological Chemical Contamination Avoidance business case analysis for maritime and fixed site Point Biological Detection.

The Next Generation Chemical Detector (NGCD) is several detection systems for multi-phase of matter sampling, location of liquid and solids on surfaces, and vapor and aerosol monitoring.  NGCD will detect and identify non-traditional agents, chemical warfare agents (CWAs), toxic industrial chemicals (TICs) in the air and on surfaces.  The NGCD will provide improved NTA/CWA/TIC selectivity and sensitivity on multiple platforms as well as multiple environments.  There are four capability areas, of which three; NGCD 1 Detector Alarm, NGCD 2 Survey Detector and NGCD 3 Sample Analysis are in the Technical Maturation and Risk Reduction Phase.  The fourth capability, NGCD 4 Individual Detector - personal chemical detection is still in material solution analysis.  These sensors will improve detection, consequence management and reconnaissance, and weapons of mass destruction (WMD) interdiction capabilities.  The scope of the project includes detection of chemical a few feet away from the detector as well as the sampling point of the detector.

The Non-Traditional Agent (NTA) Defense program supports the on-going chemical and biological (CB) defense efforts as acquisition programs address emerging threat requirements across the full spectrum of commodities.  Dedicated initiatives and projects will transition information, technologies, and capabilities into acquisition options/efforts (Programs of Record, Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD), and Accelerated Acquisition) that account for the breadth and depth of emerging threats which span the full range of military missions.  The NTA Defense program will provide essential enablers such as threat understanding; operational impacts of performance trades; and comprehensive, integrated, and layered defense concepts against emerging threats.  The program will support a balanced portfolio which will target capabilities to reduce operational and tactical risk from technology gaps inherent from emerging threats.  Additional efforts in conducting systems engineering analysis will occur in order to identify and consolidate capability knowledge gaps and prioritize required investments.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>BIOSURVEILLANCE (BSV)

BSV is a set of capabilities that acquire, integrate, and analyze medical, environmental, and incident management data using existing and next generation systems, medical and non-medical sample collection tools and identifiers/diagnostics; and transition hardware/software tools and devices as residuals from the Biosurveillance Joint United States Force Korea (USFK) Portal and Integrated Threat Recognition (JUPITR) Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD).  Prototype family of systems will be released to Busan Pier 8 and Camp Humphreys with a two year paid sustainment.  Lessons learned, technologies, concepts of employment from the ATD will be transitioned to the programs of record associated with the CBDP (such as G-BSP, NGDS, JBTDS &amp; CALS).  The acquisition strategy will address the materiel solutions identified out of the multiple Biosurveillance (BSV) related Analysis of Alternatives (AoA's).

NEXT GENERATION CHEMICAL DETECTOR (NGCD)

System Engineering and market survey results suggested the most effective way to develop NGCD was to divide the program into four unique capabilities to detect and identify the full spectrum of chemical compounds in all phases of matter.  The Government awarded ten (10) contracts in June 2014 to support Technology Maturation Risk Reduction (TMRR) acquisition phase activities in three of the four capability areas: three (3) contracts for the NGCD 1 capability, four (4) contracts for the NGCD 2 capability, and three (3) contracts for the NGCD 3 capability.  Full and Open competition will be used to award Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contracts with production options for each capability at Milestone B.

NON TRADITIONAL AGENT DEFENSE (NTA DEFENSE)

The Non-Traditional Agent (NTA) Defense program supports the Chemical Biological Defense Program (CBDP) to develop countermeasures for all emerging threats across all commodities.  The NTA Defense program consists of a number of projects and initiatives through full and open competition contract actions that enhance the CBDP's portfolio and mission and feed directly into Programs of Record, Advanced Technology Demonstrations, and Acquisition Programs.  NTA Defense efforts: (1) evaluate COTS and GOTS technologies and systems, (2) conduct demonstrations and experiments, (3) integrates Intelligence Community threat analysis, operational risk analysis with systems technical performance to identify technologies or systems that can be rapidly developed, and deployed, and/or transitioned to an Acquisition Program for technology insertion or derive an Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) to a fielded system, and (4) provides coordination of DoD, interagency, international NTA projects.  These initiatives allow the CBDP to mitigate risk against emerging threats and better prepare the warfighter to deal with technological surprise across the full range of military missions.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project supports the development of Contamination Mitigation (ConMit) systems utilizing solutions that will remove and/or detoxify contaminated material without damaging combat equipment, personnel, or the environment.  ConMit systems provide a force restoration capability for units that become contaminated.  Development efforts will provide systems that reduce operational impact and logistics burden, reduce sustainment costs, increase safety, and minimize environmental effects associated with decontamination and contamination mitigation operations.  Experimentation and demonstration will be used in this phase to reduce risk and inform supporting materiel solutions, CONOPS and Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs).

The programs supported under this Project include (1) Contaminated Human Remains System (CHRS), (2) Contamination Indicator Decontamination Assurance System (CIDAS), and (3) Joint Biological Agent Decontamination System (JBADS).  

CHRS is a new start in FY17.  The CHRS will address two capabilities identified within the Contamination Mitigation (ConMit) Initial Capabilities Document: a Contaminated Human Remains Transfer Case (CHRT) packaging solution to safely repatriate chemical, biological, or radiological contaminated human remains to the Continental United States and a sustainable Contaminated Human Remains Decontamination System (CHRDS) to reduce the hazard to warfighters by decontaminating chemical, biological, or radiological contaminated human remains. 

The CHRT is a containment system which will protect personnel from the hazards associated with transporting human remains that are potentially contaminated with chemical, biological or radiological agents and Toxic Industrial Materials (TIM) without posing additional risk to the handlers or the environment in accordance with federal and international transportation standards.

The CHRDS is a system of tents, plumbing, generators, and medical equipment necessary to establish a decontamination site to perform decontamination, identification, and packaging of contaminated human remains for further disposition.  The CHRDS will reduce the hazards associated with contaminated human remains through decontamination of remains and enable positive identification of remains for the Armed Forces Medical Examiner before packaging in a CHRT.

The CIDAS will provide a nerve and blister contamination indicator/decontamination assurance technology, henceforth called an "indicator", which will be packaged for application via small, mid or large scale applicators.  The indicator will be sprayed on tactical vehicles, aircraft, ships, crew-served weapons, and individual weapons that may have been exposed to traditional and non-traditional chemical contamination.  CIDAS is a new capability for the Joint Forces that will reduce the logistics burden of decontamination by indicating presence and location of traditional (Nerve and Blister) and non-traditional chemical agents on militarily relevant surfaces pre- and post-decontamination.

The JBADS will provide the capability to conduct biological and chemical agent decontamination of the interior and exterior of aircraft and vehicle platforms.  The capabilities will be provided in two phases.  Phase One will provide thorough biological decontamination of the interior and exterior of cargo aircraft.  The JBADS Phase One is a capability set that will include a shelter to encapsulate an airframe, a decontamination delivery system (e.g. hot-humid air-blower, etc.), environmental control and monitoring system(s), and other ancillary components required to ensure efficacious biological agent decontamination.  It will provide the capability to decontaminate biologically contaminated airframes to safe levels and allow more rapid return to service.  Phase Two will expand upon the Phase One capability set.  Phase Two will develop multiple decontaminants and modular designs to address various platforms and chemical agent decontamination.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>CONTAMINATED HUMAN REMAINS SYSTEM (CHRS)

The CHRS will consist of two separate approaches for the Contaminated Human Remains Transfer Case (CHRT) and the Contaminated Human Remains Decontamination System (CHRDS).  The CHRT will use Competitive Prototyping (CP) to evaluate multiple alternatives in the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction phase (Minimum TRL level of 4) that can meet the Contamination Mitigation (ConMit) ICD requirements.  A solution will be chosen at Milestone B and developed under a cost plus incentive fee contract in the Engineering Manufacturing Development phase with incentives for weight reduction and processing time.  The CHRDS will consist of a request for proposal to assemble Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) and Government Off the Shelf (GOTS) components for a Contaminated Human Remains Decontamination System using a best value firm-fixed price contracting strategy.

DFoS CONTAMINATION INDICATOR DECONTAMINATION ASSURANCE SYSTEM (DFoS CIDAS)

The CIDAS program will follow an evolutionary acquisition strategy in consonance with user developed capability documents.  Following MS A, collaborated with program efforts, including the Hazard Mitigation, Materiel and Equipment Restoration (HaMMER) Advanced Technology Development Operational Demonstration and Extended User Evaluations, and conducted technology demonstrations on candidate indicator and applicator technologies to mitigate risk and identify affordable mature technologies that meet requirements.  Determined need for and initiated Government designed mid and large scale applicators to provide an affordable solution to meet specific User requirements.  Following MS B, used full and open competition to award a performance based firm fixed price contract with options for LRIP and FRP for nerve indicator and small scale applicator systems.  Used full and open competition to award a performance based firm fixed price contract for engineering and manufacturing development and limited developmental testing of two blister technologies, with options for LRIP and FRP of preferred blister technology.  Integrate and test the contractor and Government designs in the developmental and operational testing.

JOINT BIOLOGICAL AGENT DECONTAMINATION SYSTEM (JBADS)

The JBADS program will be executed utilizing a phased approach.  Phase One will deliver a biological agent decontamination capability for interior and exterior decontamination of cargo aircraft.  For Phase One, the program will leverage the Joint Biological Agent Decontamination System Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (JCTD) and prior testing of candidate technologies to skip Milestone B and proceed directly to Milestone C, Low Rate Initial Production Decision.  Modifications to the JCTD design will be made and technical testing will be conducted to support a Milestone C/Low Rate Initial Production Decision.  A single, firm fixed price production contract with full and open competition will be awarded using a performance-based specification for the Aircraft Decontamination Units and a detailed specification for the Aircraft Enclosure.  Low Rate Initial Production/Operational test assets will be purchased using procurement funding due to the low density and estimated cost of the Phase One system.  These assets will be retrofitted and fielded following a successful Full Rate Production decision. 

JBADS Phase Two will expand the biological agent decontamination capability to other platforms such as tactical and rotary wing aircraft, as well as ground vehicles.  In addition, Phase Two will provide chemical agent decontamination capabilities.  Phase Two will enter the acquisition process at Milestone B and a full and open cost plus fixed fee contract will be awarded to conduct the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase.  Candidate technologies will be evaluated during EMD to determine the most cost effective combination of biological and chemical agent decontamination for a variety of platforms.  Following Milestone C/LRIP decision, a single, firm fixed price production contract with full and open competition will be awarded.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project provides for Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P).  Experimentation and demonstration will be used in this phase to reduce risk and inform supporting materiel solutions, CONOPS and TTPs.

The Joint Service General Purpose Mask (JSGPM) Advanced Respiratory Protection Initiative (ARPI) will address improved mask protection, filter protection against Toxic Industrial Chemicals (TIC)/Toxic Industrial Materials (TIM) and improved profile and breathing resistance; and wearability compatibility/integration.  This will be accomplished through class-based analysis, Filtration Advanced Screening Test (FAST), desorption study, and advanced CBRN filtration efforts.  Several technologies are being pursued by the Joint Science and Technology Office (JSTO), with two specific technologies being pursued in the FY16-17 timeframe.  The JSGPM ARPI effort will investigate alternative designs and modifications to Zirconium hydroxide, Zinc, Argentum (Silver), Triethylene di-amine (TEDA)) (ZZAT) to further increase filtration of TICs and Chemical Warfare Agents (CWA).  ZZAT is a zirconium hydroxide based filtration media that can potentially be layered with carbon.  The first technology, known as Cobalt-Zinc ZZAT (CoZZAT), uses a layered bed of carbon concept to improve TIC and CWA protection capabilities, while the second technology known as Metal Organic Framework (MOF), is an engineered media that is a porous crystalline compound made up of metal ions and organic bridging molecules (ligands) for targeted removal of chemicals.  The JSGPM ARPI effort will also investigate various applications of nanofiber particulate media.  This effort transitions to BA7 in FY16.

The Uniform Integrated Protection Ensemble (UIPE) is a Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear (CBRN) protective system offering the capability to select a tailored material solution based on the expected threat level commensurate with operational mission requirements.  Where appropriate, a family of systems approach that meets the scope of UIPE individual protection capability needs will be utilized.  The objective of UIPE is to fully integrate CBRN and toxic industrial material (TIM) protections into an ensemble, identical in fit and form to the combat uniform (including mask - helmet integration and protective boots and gloves), thus negating the need for separate protective ensemble components.  This integrated protection approach will result in increased warfighter operational performance in a CBRN environment.  The UIPE program will develop, integrate, test, procure and field incremental capability solutions that are modular in function and offer improvements in form and fit over current systems; the program will explore trade-space in areas such as protection level, heat stress, durability, antimicrobial properties, flame resistance, launderability, self-detoxification, and protection time in order to provide capabilities that afford maximum utility to the warfighter.  Where appropriate modeling and simulation tools will be used to lower UIPE program risks, reduce costs, and ensure a high confidence in selected technologies.  UIPE is aimed specifically at providing enhanced individual protection capabilities to the warfighter through reduction of physiological and psychological effects associated with CBRN protective garment thermal burden, weight, and bulk.  The UIPE program will consider modernization in order to ensure that the warfighter retains access to state of the art capability to support future operational mission requirements.  UIPE Increment 2 will leverage the approved UIPE CBRN Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) to build on and enhance capabilities attained in UIPE Increment 1 by continuing to provide integrated individual protective equipment that enables the Warfighter to operate in a contaminated environment with no or minimal degradation to performance.  The UIPE Increment 2 will seek to provide reduced thermal burden and weight compared to current protective ensembles.  It will develop, integrate, test, procure, and field incremental capability solutions that are modular in function and offer improvements over current systems.  The program will explore trade-space in areas such as protection level, heat stress, durability, antimicrobial properties, flame resistance, launderability, self-detoxification, and protection time in order to provide capabilities that afford maximum utility to the Warfighter.  Where appropriate, modeling and simulation tools will be used to lower UIPE Increment 2 program risks, reduce costs, and ensure a high confidence in selected technologies.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The JSGPM Advanced Respiratory Protection Initiative (ARPI) effort is using the two M61 filter contracts awarded to 3M and Avon to develop improved filters for the JSGPM.  There is a continual technology refreshment CLIN on both contracts that allow for filter development tasks to be awarded.  The tasks can be competed between the two awardees or awarded to both to ensure competition on future spares and delivery orders.  As filter technologies transition from the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) and Joint Science and Technology Office (JSTO), the technologies will be matured from system/subsystem prototyping demonstration technologies at Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 to actual system "mission proven" through successful mission operations in a mission environment at TRL 9.  In addition to the maturing of the technology, the Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL) of the media and the layered bed design requires maturing to an MRL level 9.  The complexity of maturing all these different items requires an evolutionary approach with one prototype iteration governing the approach on the next iteration.  With the criticality of the filter, the production transition to the new improved filter has to be done with a high degree of confidence with risks mitigated to a low level.

CBRN UNIFORM INTEGRATED PROTECTION ENSEMBLE (UIPE)

The UIPE Increment 2 supports an evolutionary acquisition strategy with the intent of protecting the Warfighter from operationally relevant and non-traditional chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN)/toxic industrial hazards during Joint Force operations.  UIPE Increment 2 will leverage the approved UIPE CBRN Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) to build on and enhance capabilities attained in UIPE Increment 1 by continuing to provide integrated individual protective equipment that enables the Warfighter to operate in a contaminated environment with no or minimal degradation to performance.  UIPE Increment 2 will perform trade space analysis using Requests for Information for materials, closures, and designs, the issuance of a Challenge, and a concept demonstration event to provide a baseline assessment and feed the requirements development process.  A manufacturing and development contract will be awarded prior to Milestone A to build prototypes/development samples, produce test articles, and provide manufacturability, development and documentation support.  The final UIPE Increment 2 garment design will be Government owned in order to control interfaces and insert future technologies.  UIPE Increment 2 is exploring the use of a Government issued Challenge to attract innovative ideas from Government, Industry, and Academia for inclusion into the final solutions.  Strategies for obtaining various capability solutions will be developed as those solutions are identified.  If Commercial-of-the-Shelf (COTS) or Non-Developmental Item (NDI) solutions are identified, appropriate contracting methods will be pursued.  Where possible, rights and data will be requested to allow competitive procurement.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project provides for Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P).  Experimentation and demonstration will be used in this phase to reduce risk and inform supporting materiel solutions, CONOPS and TTPs.

Efforts included in this project are: (1) Joint Effects Model (JEM); (2) the Joint Warning and Reporting Network (JWARN); (3) the Biosurveillance Portal (BSP) and (4) Software Support Activity (SSA).  

The Joint Effects Model (JEM) is a web-based software application that supplies the Department of Defense (DoD) with the one and only accredited tool to effectively model and simulate the effects of Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) weapon strikes and incidents.  JEM is capable of providing all Warfighters with the ability to accurately model and predict the time-phased impact of CBRN and Toxic Industrial Chemical/Material (TIC/TIM) events and effects.  JEM supports planning to mitigate the effects of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) and to provide rapid estimates of hazards and effects into the Common Operational Picture (COP).

Follow-on increments of JEM will refine and display hazard areas in near real time to reflect inputs such as meteorological, oceanographic, or actual agent concentration data.  JEM will automatically receive input data from the Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (C4I) system on which it resides such as historical climatology, local observations, weather forecasts, natural environmental threats (i.e.: pandemic influenza, etc.), terrain data, intelligence information, or population data.  Increment 2 will allow manual user input for factors such as concentrations of chemical warfare agents or actual exposure measurements and forecast sheltering stay-times and provide for modeling sheltering time through user-defined scenarios.

The Joint Warning and Reporting Network (JWARN) is an accredited Department of Defense (DOD) warning and reporting system that provides a standardized warning and reporting capability for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) and Toxic Industrial Materials (TIM) incidents.  

JWARN supports the Joint Force Commander (JFC) by improving force protection capabilities for units operating in chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear environments.  JWARN provides a digital display of CBRN 1-6 reports on the Common Operational Picture, displayed through Service provided C4I systems resident at all echelons of command.  JWARN will be operated by CBRN and non-CBRN trained personnel operating in the operations center at various command nodes.  This provides commanders with situational awareness to inform decision making for force protection criteria, unmasking operations, decontamination, and continuity of operations in a contaminated environment.  Future sensor configurations will forward sensor inputs directly to JWARN via established communication lanes, removing the man-in-the-loop requirement with the current system configuration.  JWARN will be information system classification agnostic and must be able to operate on unclassified, secret, top secret, and mission partner IT Systems without increasing system operator requirement, i.e.: sensor to COP via one communication loop.  As a result, sensors will then be able to communicate with JWARN on the same network, regardless of classification.

JEM and JWARN utilize the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) Manual prescribed Information Technology Box (IT Box) construct for managing requirements for the follow-on increments of capability development.  The "IT Box" is an acquisition approach and methodology regarding how software systems should be developed and fielded.  It is a process that differs from the way DoD acquires hardware systems.  The acquisition approach uses the Information Systems Initial Capabilities Document (IS ICD) to describe the required operational capabilities for the entire development effort.  These overarching requirements are further broken out into Requirements Definition Packages (RDPs) released over the life of the product instead of a single Capability Development Document released early in the program.  "Agile Software Development", a term used frequently throughout the JPM IS R forms, is a set of industry standard software development methods used in conjunction with the IT Box framework.  Agile Software Development promotes adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, continuous improvement, and encourages rapid and flexible response to change.  The Agile methodology is an alternative to traditional program management, typically used in software development.  It helps teams respond to unpredictability through incremental, iterative work cadences, known as sprints.  Agile methodologies are an alternative to waterfall, or traditional sequential development.

IT Box enables programs to tailor the incrementally fielded software program model in the DODI 5000.02 Interim to conduct multiple, more frequent fielding events in lieu of a single fielding event.  Programs conduct a single Milestone B (MSB) decision by the Milestone Decision Authority that covers the entire program.  MS B is followed by a series of supporting Build Decisions (BDs) associated with each RDP as they are released.  The supporting BDs will ensure incorporation of mature technology and development efforts culminating in incremental deliveries of capability to Joint and Service Command and Control (C2) architectures.  Instead of a single Milestone C decision and fielding event for one increment, the program will return to the MDA for more frequent fielding decisions, as often as annually, as portions of capability are determined suitable and operationally effective.  These multiple fielding efforts are based on providing capabilities with the most value to the operators based on Warfighter priorities/needs, maturation of the technology being incorporated and available resources supporting the effort. 

The Biosurveillance Portal (BSP) is an FY 2016 new start program to address USSOCOM requirements contained in an approved Information Systems Capability Development Document (IS CDD).  BSP is a web-based enterprise environment that will facilitate collaboration, communication, and information sharing in support of the detection, management, and mitigation of man-made and naturally occurring biological events.  BSP bridges the communication gaps in the biosurveillance domain to provide a central access point for biosurveillance information and situational awareness for DoD, interagency and allied partners supporting the early identification and response to biological events.

BSP provides an integrated suite of web-based components designed to support public health officers, environmental officers, clinicians, physicians, and CBRN personnel as they maintain their situational awareness of local, regional, and global biological threats to the force.  BSP does not duplicate existing DoD capabilities, but rather leverages existing tools and technologies to provide users across multiple organizations and disciplines with a centralized "one-stop shop" for all of their biosurveillance resources. 

The Software Support Activity (SSA) is a Chem-Bio Defense user developmental support and service organization to facilitate net-centric interoperability of systems in acquisition for the Warfighter.  The SSA provides the CBRN Warfighter with Joint Service solutions for Cybersecurity/Information Assurance (IA), Integrated Architectures, Data Management/Modeling, Interoperability Certifications, Verification, Validation and Accreditation (VV&amp;A) to support interoperable and integrated net-centric, service-oriented solutions for CBRN systems.  The SSA emphasizes development of reference implementations to guide Government and industry system and software developers to ensure that their products meet common interoperability standards.  The latest technologies/products include the definition of a Common CBRN Sensor Integration Standard (CCSI) and the CBRN Data Model.  These technologies and direct enablers for the development of CBRN integrated sensor networks and the dissemination of CBRN information across all users.  The SSA directly supports Chemical and Biological Defense Program (CBDP) initiatives by providing common service oriented architectures and frameworks for the collection and dissemination of Bio-Surveillance and other critical CBRN information.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>BIOSURVEILLANCE PORTAL (BSP)

The Biosurveillance Portal (BSP) program will meet the requirements as set forth in the USSOCOM Information Systems Capability Development Document (IS CDD), 19 May 2014.  BSP is a new start program in FY16.  The BSP program will utilize the JROC's "IT Box" construct for program requirements, management, and development.  The intent is to provide the next generation of capability with current and future technologies in less time and fielding products to the DoD utilizing an incremental delivery approach.  IT Box enables programs to tailor the incrementally fielded software program model in the DODI 5000.02 Interim to conduct multiple, more frequent fielding events in lieu of a single fielding event.  Capabilities will be developed and delivered in a series of Capability Drops (CDs) identified in Requirement Definition Packages (RDPs).  Intent is to deliver CDs every three months.  Developmental Testing (DT) and end-to-end tests (E2E) will be conducted for each CD and an operational assessment (OA) will be conducted to verify capabilities for each RDP.  User Feedback Events (UFEs) will be conducted with identified Users to illicit feedback on developed capabilities and input on required adjustments to address new technologies.  Initial Operational Capability (IOC) is targeted for 3QFY16 with Final Operational Capability to be delivered in 3QFY20.

JOINT EFFECTS MODEL (JEM)

JEM Increment 2 acquisition will utilize the JROC's "IT Box" construct for software development.  The intent is to provide the next generation of capability with current and future technologies, as stated in the IS ICD, in less time and fielding products to the service more frequently than an incremental delivery approach.

As part of this strategy, JEM program office developed and issued a competitive prototyping contract in April 2013 where two offerers were given the same Technical Data Package (TDP), performance Work Statement (PWS), and software requirements and were tasked to deliver a JEM prototype that implements the CCMI architecture.  This competitive prototyping strategy was successful and a single JEM integrator, General Dynamics Information Technology (GDIT), was selected as the prime development contract in December 2013. 

The current contractor for JEM 2.0 will provide all capabilities defined in the Requirement Definition Package 1 (RDP-1) document.  The JRO will release RDPs-2, 3, and 4 over the next three years prior to contract completion.  It is anticipated when the contract is re-competed in FY17 that there will be four of five capability drops not yet developed under RDP-2 and two of five under RDP-3.  The follow-on contract in FY17 will include scope for developing the remaining capabilities under the JEM 2.0 contract.  The JEM follow-on contract will utilize full and open competition and will be referred to as the JEM development, modernization and sustainment contract.

The JEM IS ICD describes the notional implementation plan for fielding of future JEM capabilities among five separate JEM Requirement Definition Packages (RDPs).  RDP-1 contains the baseline capabilities for software and was approved in June of 2014.  Since last report, the numbering scheme for RDPs was rearranged to account for the sequence of approval for each RDP.  RDP-2 now defines requirements to integrate baseline capabilities into a version that can be fielded on service C2 systems will be released in RDP-2.  RDP-2 will be released following RDP-1 to rapidly allow baseline capabilities to be incorporated into C2 systems.  RDP-3 is a notional package that allows the Science and Technology community a venue to use the JEM program to develop a version of the product for S&amp;T and analytical use.  Capabilities that are only required for the Science and Technology and analytical communities and not for operational users would be implemented in RDP-3.  Capabilities in RDP-3 would not be required to go to Operational Test, as they would not be fielded to operational users.  RDP-4 will be released after the completion of RDP-1.  This RDP will incorporate emerging capabilities that have reached a sufficient maturity for incorporation into the operationally fielded JEM system, such as ability to model new agents.  RDP-5 was added as a mechanism to define requirements for JEM 2.0 through the remainder of its life cycle.

RDP 1 - Baseline Capabilities: There are 5 planned Capability Drops (CD) within RDP 1. 
RDP 2 - C2 Integration: There are 8 planned Capability Drops (CD) within RDP 2 tied to all the various Strategic and Service C2 Systems
RDP 3 - Analytical Support: There are 2 planned Capability Drops (CD) within RDP 3.
RDP 4 - Emerging Capabilities: There are 5 planned Capability Drops (CD) within RDP 4.
RDP 5 - Modernization and Sustainment: There are 2 Capability Drops (CD) planned per year through the life of the program.

An over-arching MS B and Build Decision for RDP-1 were approved by the MDA in September 2014.  Each subsequent RDP will have an associated Build Decision.  Each CD will have an associated fielding decision.

JOINT WARNING &amp; REPORTING NETWORK (JWARN)

JWARN Increment 2 utilizes the JROC's "IT Box" construct for software requirements management and development.  The intent is to provide the next generation of capability with current and future technologies, as stated in the IS ICD, in less time and away from an incremental delivery approach.  This effort is being executed under a Cost-Plus-Award Term Incentive structure to gain maximum benefit to the Government in maintaining the fielded baseline and future software capability development and was awarded under a full and open competition Request for Proposal (RFP).  The JWARN Program will procure a Sensor Connectivity Capability (SCC) (hardware materiel solution) in order to facilitate the transfer of CBRN sensor information from legacy CBRN sensors to DoD networks.  This solution will be external to the CBRN Sensors and Service-identified network transmission device(s).

SOFTWARE SUPPORT ACTIVITY (SSA)

The SSA provides enterprise-wide services and coordination across all CBDP programs that contain data or software, or are capable of linking to the Global Information Grid (GIG).  The SSA facilitates interoperability, integration, and supportability of existing and developing IT and National Security Systems (NSS).  This will be followed by coordination to facilitate the concepts of interoperability, integration and supportability of enterprise-wide services.  Next follows work with user communities to develop and demonstrate enterprise-wide common architectures, products and services.  The SSA will support the application of the enterprise-wide architectures, products and services into the programs, with verification of compliance with the defined products and services.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

This Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) Project supports: 

The Antiviral Therapeutics Program will combine the efforts of the Emerging Infectious Diseases Therapeutics Program and the Hemorrhagic Fever Virus Program into a consolidated effort to develop and deliver FDA approved antiviral therapeutics for the warfighter, beginning in FY17.  Drug products will be developed targeting the pathogens on the biological warfare threat lists, such as Ebola.  This includes viruses of interest from the following families: Filoviridae, Alphaviridae, Arenaviridae, Bunyaviridae, and Flaviviridae.  The program will conduct human clinical safety studies, pilot and pivotal animal efficacy, and toxicology studies, required for FDA approval.  The performers will submit New Drug Applications/Biologic License Agreements for the therapeutics during the EMD Phase.  During the Production and Deployment phase, full rate manufacturing and stockpile production will be pursued.  If the FDA mandates post-marketing surveillance studies, they will be conducted during Production and Deployment.

The Medical Countermeasure Test and Evaluation (MCM T&amp;E) Capability performs T&amp;E and provides the essential data packages to support US Food and Drug Administration approval of leading biodefense medical countermeasure candidates to protect the Warfighter and the Nation.  This capability provides dedicated capacity for DoD to conduct biosafety level-4 (BSL-4) Good Laboratory Practice (cGLP) T&amp;E studies to meet programmatic needs following all applicable regulatory, biosurety, and safety standards.

Biosurveillance (BSV) actively gathers, analyzes, and interprets collected information that includes biosphere data that relate to disease activity and threats to human or animal health in order to achieve early warning of health threats, early detection of health events, and overall situational awareness of disease activity.  BSV will align the biosurveillance efforts across DoD and national strategies.  BSV will scope and influence BSV capabilities as products to meet Warfighter requirements through innovative management of key BSV initiatives.  BSV requirements address medical and physical CBRN mission needs spanned in over 11 requirements documents and through Combatant Commander (COCOM) identified needs.  BSV funds will support Joint US Forces Korea (USFK) Portal and Integrated Threat recognition (JUPITR) ATD/BSV ATD which will find, demonstrate, transition, and transfer the best operational concepts and technology solutions in support of a holistic approach to countering biological threats from the laboratory to operational use and theater confirmation of a Biological Event.  JUPITR ATD will consist of four legs; Early Warning (EW), Biological Identification Capabilities Sets (BICS), Assessment of Environmental Detectors (AED), and Biosurveillance Portal (BSP).  The JUPITR ATD will provide the USFK with a holistic biosurveillance capability to provide early warning, detection, collection, identification, and theater confirmation of a Biological event.  The JUPITR ATD consists of filling capability gaps through information sharing and communication systems and detection/diagnostic systems for the USFK.  Outputs will focus on proving component, CONOPS, and subsystem transition into programs of record (PORs) and/or integration into existing PORs.  Excursion for whole system live agent test (WSLAT) of AED units will support the CA Mission for Point Biological Detection.  The Biosurveillance (BSV) program will transfer from the Medical Biological Defense (MB) Project to the Contamination Avoidance (CA) Project effective FY 2016.

The Countermeasures for Multi-Drug Resistance-Bacterial (CMDR-B) program develops medical countermeasures (MCMs) for Service members for protection against multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria, including Biological Warfare Agents (BWAs) and organisms that are genetically modified to be MDR.  The resulting product(s) will be US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved to prevent or minimize effects of MDR bacterial exposures.  Leveraging collaborative Department of Defense (DoD), United States Government, and industry efforts will reduce program risk, lower program cost, and accelerate the delivery of therapeutics to the Warfighter.  The program has established a translational team with the Joint Science and Technology Office for animal model work and pipeline candidates that could transition to CMDR-B for Advanced Development.

The Emerging Infectious Diseases Therapeutics (EID Tx) program is developing and will deliver a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved, broad-spectrum medical countermeasure to the Warfighter for protection against naturally occurring or biologically engineered viruses.  The first indication being pursued is influenza due to a clear and established FDA regulatory approval pathway.  The drug in development is highly efficacious against multiple influenza viruses, including the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus, H5N1 avian influenza virus, the most recently identified H7N9 virus from the outbreak in China, and drug resistant strains of influenza viruses.  It has also demonstrated efficacy against other viruses of concern to the DoD's biodefense program.  FDA approval for an influenza treatment is anticipated following completion of the EMD phase.  EID Tx will leverage on going filovirus countermeasure development to demonstrate additional broad-spectrum MCM's against naturally occurring and/or engineered biowarfare threats.  To meet the mission need of "one drug, many bugs" EID Tx is testing product efficacy on BWA threats.  This will allow the military to leverage a product that will be FDA approved for influenza against other viruses.  This work will be funded by the Antiviral Therapeutic programs.

The NGDS is an evolutionary acquisition for a family of systems to provide increments of capability over time across many echelons of the Combat Health Support System.  The mission of the NGDS is to provide Chemical, Biological and Radiological (CBR) threat and infectious disease identification and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared diagnostics to inform individual patient treatment as defined in the approved NGDS Capabilities Development Document (CDD) and CBR situational awareness and disease surveillance as defined in the Common Analytical Laboratory (CALS) CDD.  NGDS Increment 1 will significantly improve diagnostic capability for deployable combat health support units (Role 2/3) while also improving operational suitability and affordability by developing FDA cleared biological warfare agent (BWA) and infectious disease in vitro diagnostic (IVD) assays on existing commercial diagnostic device with a well established FDA regulatory history and pipeline of commercial non-BWA infectious disease diagnostic tests.  The NGDS Increment 1 program has a streamlined MS A to MS C acquisition strategy.  BA4 supports the NGDS Increment 1 program through the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction phase to complete competitive prototyping activities, initiate development of six BWA IVDs (Anthrax, Ebola, Marburg, Plague, Tularemia and Q-Fever), initiate the development of BWA environmental surveillance assays, multiservice operational test assessment, and Urgent Material Release of systems and Ebola emergency use diagnostic test in support of the DoD's Ebola Response and Preparedness initiative under Title X.  NGDS Increment 2 will complement NGDS Increment 1 by developing diagnostics for unmet biological pathogen and toxin threats, chemical and radiological exposures, and to provide capability to lower echelons of care.  NGDS Increment 2 will also conduct collaborative work with the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency to accelerate development of a ruggedized Ebola detection and diagnostic system for use in austere environments in support of the DoD's Ebola Response and Preparedness initiative under Title X.

The Department of Defense (DoD) supports the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) phase for vaccines that are directed against validated biological warfare (BW) weapons to include bacteria, viruses, and toxins of biological origin.  Effective medical countermeasures are urgently needed to negate the threat of these biological warfare (BW) agents.  Vaccines have been identified as the most efficient countermeasure against the validated threat of BW weapons.  

The Trivalent Filovirus Vaccine (VAC FILO) Program will offer protection against the threat of Ebola and Marburg viruses.  The current budget supports development of trivalent prototypes to meet the BW threat through TMRR phase and acceleration of multiple prototypes in response to the Ebola outbreak to provide an interim fielding capability.  The DoD anticipates that the Food Drug Administration (FDA) will approve this vaccine using the 'Animal Rule', which allows for the demonstration of efficacy on relevant animal model(s).  During this phase a scalable manufacturing process is developed.  This process will be used to develop current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) lots suitable for a Phase 1 clinical trial.  In addition, animal safety and efficacy studies will be conducted to support an Investigational New Drug (IND) submission to the FDA and conduct Phase 1 clinical trials.  These efforts will support a Milestone B (MS B) decision and entry into the Engineering, Manufacturing, and Development (EMD) phase.  

The Ricin toxin is a validated bioweapon threat that is lethal, available and easily produced.  The program support one DoD vaccine candidate including manufacturing cGMP lots; and the continuation of animal model and assay development studies.  These efforts also include clinical trials, regulatory integration, and a manufacturing technology transfer to the ADM capability.  The DoD is the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures lead for the advanced development of the Ricin Vaccine.

The Western, Eastern, and Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis (VAC WEVEE) Vaccine program initiated competitive prototypes in FY13 to reduce program risk, and is developing multiple prototypes through the Technology Development Phase.  The efforts to be conducted during this period include: develop pilot scale manufacturing processes and manufacture of cGMP lots to support nonclinical and clinical studies; develop vaccine formulation that meets the logistical requirements of the DoD; conduct non-clinical GLP safety studies; submit Investigational New Drug (IND) applications; and conduct Phase 1 clinical human safety studies.  The DoD anticipates that the FDA will approve these products using the 'Animal Rule', which allows for the demonstration of efficacy in relevant animal model(s).  These efforts will support a Milestone B decision and entry into the EMD phase.  The Western, Eastern, and Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis (VAC WEVEE) Vaccine will protect the Warfighter against aerosolized exposure to three strains of alphaviruses; western, eastern and Venezuelan equine encephalitis viruses.  VAC WEVEE Program is developing competitive prototypes.  The early advanced development efforts include: develop pilot scale manufacturing processes and manufacture of cGMP lots to support nonclinical and clinical studies; develop vaccine formulation that meets the logistical requirements of the DoD; conduct non-clinical GLP safety studies; submit Investigational New Drug (IND) applications; and conduct Phase 1 clinical human safety studies.  The DoD anticipates that the FDA will approve these products using the 'Animal Rule', which allows for the demonstration of efficacy in relevant animal model(s).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Supported GLP toxicology studies (Battelle); Nonhuman primate efficacy studies (USAMRIID); Immunological testing of Phase 1 samples (Battelle/USAMRIID); qualification and validation of Human ELISA (Battelle/Focus Diagnostics).  These efforts were needed to support the Phase II/III clinical trials and interim fielding capability of this candidate in FY15.  This vaccine candidate will only address EBOLA not the core trivalent effort, however, data from these studies will support development and acceleration of the trivalent vaccine.  The ELISA efforts were critical for detecting dose selection for the vaccine used throughout Western Africa and other outbreak countries to establish a standardized assay for measuring the immune response across multiple vaccine platforms.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>ANTI-VIRAL THERAPEUTICS (AV TX)

The acquisition strategy combines the HFV and EID TX Program efforts beginning in FY17, into a single funding line to develop and deliver FDA approved antiviral countermeasures.  Independent market research conducted in FY15 identified multiple candidates appropriate for advanced development at varying stages of maturity.  A source selection will be conducted targeting award in FY16.  Candidates selected for entry into the EMD phase of development will be initiated in FY16 as part of the HFV program, and continued under the Antiviral Therapeutic program in FY17.  Candidates selected which are appropriate for entry into the TMRR phase will be deferred for award until FY17 when BA4 funding is available to the program.  The overall regulatory approach of the program remains to pursue development of products to FDA approval under the Animal Rule.  The program will conduct human clinical safety studies, pilot and pivotal animal efficacy, and toxicology studies, required for FDA approval.  The performers will submit New Drug Applications/Biologic License Agreements for the therapeutics during the EMD Phase.  During the Production and Deployment phase, full rate manufacturing and stockpile production will be pursued.  If the FDA mandates post-marketing surveillance studies, they will be conducted during Production and Deployment.

BSL4 GOOD LABORATORY PRACTICES TEST &amp; EVALUATION (BSL4 GLP T&amp;E)

The MCM T&amp;E Capability is being implemented in three phases.  Phase 1 (completed in FY13) established support contracts, agreements, and developed a capability implementation plan to utilize and maintain the existing and planned new US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) facility and staff.  Phase 2 executes the implementation plan, bringing the facility, equipment, personnel, and technical and business processes into a state of readiness to conduct BSL-4 studies under full GLP compliance.  In FY14, the capability established a new Program Management Office and organizational structure, implemented information technology tools for secure management of data, trained and integrated GLP-qualified staff, and validated supporting technology for conduct of T&amp;E studies.  In FY15 conducted secondary capability assessments and refinements, broadening and adapting contract support plans to meet increased customer demand, updating the Life-Cycle Sustainment Plan, and conducting multiple T&amp;E studies.  MCM T&amp;E support costs during Phase 2 and beyond will be offset by costs from specific MCM development programs where possible.  The period of FY16 to FY19 will continue secondary capability assessments and refinements and will focus on transition of the capability to the new USAMRIID facility, after which Full Operational Capability (FOC) will be reached.

BIOSURVEILLANCE (BSV)

BSV is a set of capabilities that acquire, integrate, and analyze medical, environmental, and incident management data using existing and next generation systems, medical and non-medical sample collection tools and identifiers/diagnostics; and transition hardware/software tools and devices as residuals from the Biosurveillance Joint United States Force Korea (USFK) Portal and Integrated Threat Recognition (JUPITR) Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD).  Prototype family of systems will be released to Busan Pier 8 and Camp Humphreys with a two year paid sustainment.  Lessons learned, technologies, concepts of employment from the ATD will be transitioned to the programs of record associated with the CBDP (such as G-BSP, NGDS, JBTDS &amp; CALS).  The acquisition strategy will address the materiel solutions identified out of the multiple Biosurveillance (BSV) related Analysis of Alternatives (AoA's).

COUNTERMEASURES FOR DRUG RESISTANT BACTERIA (CMDR-B)

The CMDR-B program develops MCMs for MDR (multi-drug resistant) bacteria, including BWAs and organisms that are genetically modified to be MDR.  The resulting product(s) will be US FDA-approved to prevent or minimize effects of MDR bacterial exposures.  CMDR-B will follow an integrated acquisition and regulatory pathway to achieve FDA approval for drug candidates.  The CMDR-B Program intends to fund one or more candidates to address competitive prototyping and mitigate drug development risk.  In FY13, a Market Survey and RFI were completed assessing current anti-bacterial countermeasure technologies.  Results confirmed technologies exist that are of sufficient maturity to enter advanced development.  CMDR-B is establishing collaborative relationships with DoD, other USG entities and international partners to reduce program risk, lower program cost, and accelerate delivery of MCMs to the Warfighter.  Milestone A obtained in 3QFY15.

EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES - THERAPUTIC (EID TX)

The goal of the EID Tx program is to develop a safe and effective MCM against biothreats of interest to the DoD.  The first step of the acquisition strategy is to develop an MCM for influenza due to a clear and established FDA regulatory approval pathway.  The Phase 2 clinical trial is complete, demonstrating both safety and efficacy in humans.  Program was authorized by FDA to move forward at End of Phase 2 meeting on 3 SEP 13.  Phase 3 clinical trials for EID Tx against influenza began during 1QFY14.  NDA submission is expected in 4QFY16 with approval in FY17, and all remaining FY16/17 funds will support the influenza effort.  In 3QFY16, the EID program will continue its strategy of leveraging broad spectrum therapeutics against new BW viral indications.  The program will leverage on-going development to demonstrate additional broad-spectrum MCM's against naturally occurring and/or engineered biowarfare threats.  The program will conduct human clinical safety studies, definitive animal efficacy, toxicology studies, and manufacturing scale up and optimization, as required for FDA approval.  The performer will submit New Drug Applications/Biologic License Agreements for the therapeutic during the EMD Phase.  During the Production and Deployment phase, full rate manufacturing and stockpile production will be pursued.  If the FDA mandates post-marketing surveillance studies, it will be conducted during Production and Deployment.  This work will be funded by the Antiviral Therapeutic programs.

NEXT GENERATION DIAGNOSTICS SYSTEM (NGDS)

The NGDS Increment 1 program has a streamlined MS A to MS C - Limited Deployment acquisition strategy.  The NGDS Increment 1 is intended to replace the legacy Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS) beginning in FY17.  NGDS Increment 2 will complement NGDS Increment 1 by developing diagnostic capabilities for biological pathogens and toxins and address diagnostics for chemical and radiological exposures, and to provide capability to lower echelons of care.

NGDS Increment 2 will conduct technology development FY14-FY16 prior to MS B.  The acquisition strategy and capability to be developed will be informed by the results of the Analysis of Alternatives to be completed 4QFY14.  NGDS Increment 2 is intended to be complementary to NGDS Increment 1 to expand the breadth and depth of diagnostics to CBR threats, pre-symptomatic diagnostics, and far forward echelons of care.

The MB7 program will support development, testing, and FDA approval of additional assays after system fielding.

FILOVIRUS (VAC FILO)

The acquisition strategy supports the development of multiple filovirus vaccine prototypes through the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) Phase.  At Milestone B (MS B), the best prototype will be selected through a full and open competition to transition to the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase with the delivery of an FDA licensed filovirus vaccine that will protect against multiple filoviruses.  It is anticipated that the development contracts will be a mix of Cost Plus and Fixed Price.  In addition, the program office may leverage the Advanced Development and Manufacturing capability, and other DOD agencies and laboratories to include U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID).  Following a successful MS B, the program will conduct manufacturing scale up, expanded clinical and nonclinical testing, and assay qualification and validation efforts.  These efforts will support Biological Licensure Application (BLA) submission to the FDA and licensure of a filovirus vaccine.

RICIN VACCINE (VAC RIC)

A ricin vaccine will protect against exposure to the ricin toxin, an identified BW threat.  The Government will serve as the integrator during this phase by managing and coordinating the various vaccine development efforts.  Additionally, the Program Office will partner with DoD agencies and laboratories to include U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID).  Due to an issue discovered in vaccine manufacturing in FY15, the planned Phase 1b clinical study is delayed 9-12 months.  FY16 and FY17 funding will fund manufacturing technology transfer and pilot lot production at the ADM capability.

WESTERN EASTERN VENEZUELAN EQUINE ENCEPH VACCINE (VAC WEVEE)

The WEVEE acquisition strategy uses a parallel evaluation of Virus Replicon Particle (VRP) and Virus Like Particle (VLP) vaccine prototypes through a Phase 1 clinical trials to achieve competitive prototyping in the Technology Development phase.  The lead prototype is more mature than the second prototype.  Several potential decision points will be used to assess the prototypes for possible down select.  The schedule is based on a down select to one prototype.  The Government will serve as the integrator during this phase by managing and coordinating the various vaccine development efforts.  At MS B, the best prototype will be selected through a full and open competition to transition to the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase, with delivery of a FDA-licensed WEVEE vaccine.  The development efforts will be a Cost Plus and Firm Fixed Price CLINs.  Additionally, the Program Office will partner Health and Human Services/National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases (HHS/NIAID), DoD agencies, and laboratories to include U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USMRIID).  This DoD program is the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures lead for the advanced development of this vaccine and is leveraging expertise across the Federal and International sectors to ensure programmatic success.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project provides for the development of medical materiel and other medical equipment items necessary for the Technology Development phase of the acquisition life cycle for the advanced development of medical countermeasures (MCMs) for chemical warfare agents including diagnostic equipment, prophylactic, pre-treatment, and therapeutic drugs, and individual/casualty decontamination compounds.  A family-of-systems approach for medical defense against chemical warfare agents is required to provide protection, to sustain performance in a chemical environment, and to provide for self-aid/buddy-aid and medical treatment of chemical casualties.  Fielding of prophylactic, pre-treatment, and therapeutic drugs and medical devices requires Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval.  Given the family-of-systems approach for development of chemical MCMs for the treatment of nerve agent intoxication, multiple long-term studies are required to obtain FDA approval to deliver products that effectively integrate with current and projected therapeutic regimens.  Efficacy testing of most candidate drugs against chemical warfare agents cannot be conducted in humans; therefore, animal surrogate models must be developed and employed.  The program currently includes: Improved Nerve Agent Treatment System (INATS) an enhanced nerve agent treatment regimen consisting of an improved oxime to replace the current fielded oxime 2-pralidoxime chloride (2-PAM).

The Improved Nerve Agent Treatment System (INATS) advanced development provides an enhanced capability treatment regimen offering greater protection over a broader spectrum of toxic nerve agent threats.  Components of the development include (1) a new and improved oxime (replacing 2-pralidoxime chloride (2-PAM)) to provide protection across current and emerging threats, (2) expanded nerve agent indications for a fielded, single indication, pyridostigmine bromide (PB) product, and (3) insertion of a centrally-acting (CA) anticholinergic agent to the treatment regimen to increase survivability and decrease morbidity.  The INATS treatment regimen both improves the performance of, and eventually replaces the Antidote Treatment Nerve Agent Auto-injector (ATNAA), while expanding warfighter pretreatment options.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

INATS' evolutionary Acquisition Strategy was recently expanded to (1) align all Department of Defense nerve agent therapeutics under it, and to (2) insert a centrally-acting (CA) anticholinergic agent, employs an incremental approach to provide independent, and more rapid deliveries of oxime, expanded PB indications, and CA capabilities than in a combined treatment regimen delivery.  To accomplish this, separate Milestones B and C reviews were originally scheduled for the oxime and CA development efforts.  However after decision briefings to the Milestone Decision Authority and discussions with the Joint Services, MCS-CDP will conduct combined Milestone B and C reviews for the oxime and CA development efforts and decision reviews for PB expansion beyond the combined-development Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TM&amp;RR) Phase.  In the TM&amp;RR phase, close collaborations will occur between the Joint Program Manager - Medical Countermeasure Systems (JPM-MCS)), and the science/ technology, and user communities to assess technical viability, capability delivery options, and to refine operational concepts; the Government will be the systems integrator overseeing the conduct of oxime and centrally acting formulation development efforts, nonclinical toxicology and efficacy studies, clinical safety studies, and efficacy studies addressing the PB indication.  In the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase for the oxime and CA each capability, the Government will engage with commercial partners to ensure that INATS development and manufacture is in accordance with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations and guidelines; the commercial partner(s) will perform a Phase 2 human clinical safety study, nonclinical toxicology studies and definitive animal efficacy studies; the system integrator will also oversee the manufacture of improved oxime and CA formulations and delivery system that is stable under operationally relevant temperatures.  The system integrator will submit a New Drug Application and seek FDA approval for the INATS product.  In the Production and Deployment (P&amp;D) Phase, the Government will pursue full-rate and stockpile production, conduct any FDA mandated post-marketing surveillance studies, and will transfer contracting/logistical responsibilities to the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) while remaining to monitor program performance through disposal as the life-cycle manager.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This funding supports the Chemical Biological Defense Portfolio (CBDP) Test Equipment, Strategy, and Support (TESS) efforts TESS provides test infrastructure products for testing and evaluating chemical and biological defense systems throughout the life cycle acquisition process.  TESS test infrastructure products are aligned in three groups to include: (1) Analysis and Requirements; (2) Laboratory; (3) Field. 

(1) Analysis and Requirements: The products for this area are the analyses of requirements and justification of needs for test infrastructure to support acquisition efforts (e.g. Programs of Record (PORs), Advanced Technology Demonstrations (ATDs), and Accelerated Acquisition).  The result is a verified need for component upgrades to existing test infrastructure, dynamic laboratory upgrades to existing test infrastructure, or initiation of new test infrastructure. 

(2) Laboratory: The products for this area are the Non-Traditional Agent Defense Test System (NTADTS) and improvements to the Dynamic Test Chamber (DTC).  The NTADTS provides a new capability to conduct chemical defense testing against current and emerging threat agents.  The NTADTS supports testing of decontamination, collective protection, individual protection, and contamination avoidance products.  The DTC provides a new capability for testing chemical point detection systems against chemical warfare agents in various environmental conditions.  The CBD acquisition programs supported are Dismounted Reconnaissance Sets Kits and Outfits (DR SKO), Next Generation Chemical Detector (NGCD), Joint Sensitive Equipment Wipes (JSEW), and Common Analytical Laboratory System (CALS).  Future efforts will include the development of test methods and methodologies for additional classes of agents.

(3) Field: The products for this area are the Test Grid, the Mobile Test Infrastructure (MTI), the Joint Ambient Breeze Tunnel (JABT) and the Active Standoff Chamber (ASC).  The Test Grid effort provides a fully instrumented grid for chemical and biological simulant field test capabilities that integrate referee systems; dissemination equipment; real-time cloud tracking capability; meteorological equipment; a wireless network; and a Data Management System (DMS) software to track and display the cloud health and status of all of the equipment in the network anywhere in Dugway Proving Ground (DPG).  The MTI is an all-inclusive mobile management service functioning wirelessly.  MTI is capable of integrating, controlling, commanding and managing all assets required to conduct transportable testing.  It provides algorithms and graphical user interfaces for automating real-time visualization, raw data, computation, hosts data collection and indefinite storage that can go to any Major Range Test Facility Base (MRTFB) for CB Testing.  The JABT and ASC improvements will provide a tech refresh to existing infrastructure and allow for test results to be integrated into the Test Grid Data Management System (DMS).  The CBD acquisition programs supported are the Joint Expeditionary Collective Protection (JECP), Next Generation Chemical Detector (NGCD), Joint Biological Tactical Detection System (JBTDS), and the Joint USFK Point and Integrated Threat Recognition (JUPITR) Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Operational forces have an immediate need to survive, safely operate, and sustain operations in a Chemical and Biological (CB) threat environment across the continuum of global, contingency, special operations/low intensity conflict, counternarcotics, and other high-risk missions.  Operating forces have a critical need for defense against worldwide proliferation of CB warfare capabilities and for medical treatment of CB casualties.  Congress directed centralized management of Department of Defense (DoD) CB Defense initiatives, both medical and non-medical.  This program element supports the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) of medical and physical CB defensive equipment and materiel.  Projects within BA5 are structured to consolidate Joint and Service-unique tasks within four commodity areas: contamination avoidance, individual and collective force protection, decontamination, and medical countermeasures.  This consolidation provides for development and operational testing of equipment for Joint Service use and for Service-unique requirements.  

Contamination avoidance efforts under this system development program will provide U.S. forces with real-time hazard assessment capabilities.  They include multi-agent point and remote chemical detection for ground, aircraft, and shipboard applications; automated warning and reporting systems; integrated radiation detection and monitoring equipment; and enhanced battlefield reconnaissance capabilities.  Force protection efforts will increase protection levels while decreasing physical and psychological burdens imposed by protective equipment.  

The Secretary of Defense is responsible for research, development, acquisition, and deployment of medical countermeasure equipment and materiel to prevent or mitigate the health effects of CB threats to the Armed Forces and directs strategic planning for and oversight of programs to support medical countermeasures development and acquisition for our Armed Forces personnel.  The CB medical threat to the Armed Forces, in contrast with public health threats to U.S. citizens, encompasses all potential or continuing enemy actions that can render a Service Member combat ineffective.  CB medical threats, because they apply as a whole to military units deployed on a specific mission and/or operations, may result in the unit being unable to complete its mission.  CB medical countermeasures developed by DoD, unlike those developed to support the U.S. population, must support military commanders practical operational requirements and deployment strategies and must emphasize prevention of injury and illness and protection of the force.  Preventive measures in this EMD, such as vaccines and chemical prophylaxis, conserves fighting strength, decreases the logistics burden by reducing the need for larger deployed hospital footprint and greater demand for tactical and strategic medical evacuation, and satisfy the need for greater flexibility in military planning and operations.  When vaccines and other prophylactic medical countermeasures are not available, efforts on this EMD support pre-hospitalization treatment, en-route care, hospital care, and long-term clinical outcomes.  Specific items in this category include CB diagnostics, and therapeutics to mitigate the consequences of biologic threats and exposure to ionizing radiation due to nuclear or radiological attacks.  

The Department of Defense coordinates its efforts with the Departments of Health and Human Services to promote synergy and minimize redundancy.  The Department of Defense ensures coordination by participating in the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise interagency strategic planning process ("One Portfolio").  The Department of Defense's longstanding experience and success in CB medical countermeasure research, development, acquisition, and deployment not only ensures protection of the Armed Forces, it also accelerates and improves the overall national efforts in CB medical countermeasure research, development, and acquisition because of its unique facilities, testing capabilities, and trained and experienced personnel.  

The projects in this program element support efforts in the engineering and manufacturing phase of the acquisition strategy and are therefore correctly placed in Budget Activity 5.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports Engineering and Manufacturing Development and Low Rate Initial Production (EMD/LRIP) of an array of reconnaissance, detection and identification equipment, and warning systems.  Experimentation and demonstration will be used in this phase to reduce risk and inform supporting materiel solutions, CONOPS and TTPs.  Efforts included in this project are: (1) Enhanced Maritime Biological Detection (EMBD); (2) Joint Biological Tactical Detection System (JBTDS); (3) Next Generation Chemical Detector (NGCD); (4) Non-Traditional Agent (NTA) Defense Support; and (5) the Global Biosurveillance Technology Initiatives (GBTI).

The Enhanced Maritime Biological Detection (EMBD) program as a FY17 new start will transition a technology from the Assessment of Environmental Detection (AED) leg of the Joint USFK Portal and Integrated Threat Recognition (JUPITR) Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD) to a program of record for the US Navy (USN).  The EMBD will address Navy detection and identification capability gaps and replace the 135 Joint Biological Point Detection Systems (JBPDS) currently fielded to the Navy.  The EMBD program will complete development and testing, integration and production of a lower cost biological point detection system that will detect, collect and identify biological warfare agent aerosols.  The EMBD will provide automated warning and provide a reduced sustainment cost while protecting the shipboard personnel.

The Joint Biological Tactical Detection System (JBTDS) program will develop, integrate, test, and produce the first lightweight, low cost biological surveillance system that will detect, collect, and identify biological warfare agent aerosols.  JBTDS will provide warning through the Joint Warning And Reporting Network (JWARN) and archive sample for follow-on analyses.  JBTDS, providing near real-time local audio and visual alarm, may be employed by any Military User.  JBTDS components will be man-portable, battery-operable, and easy to employ.  JBTDS will develop a tactical common identifier using technology from the Next Generation Diagnostic System.  Identifier testing will take place during EMD to evaluate technologies against requirements and find the best solution(s) for the warfighter.  JBTDS will provide notification of a hazard and enhance battle space awareness to protect and preserve the force.  When networked, JBTDS will augment existing biological detection systems to provide a theater-wide seamless array capable of biological detection, identification and warning to support time sensitive force protection decisions.  The JBTDS will develop lightweight, handheld identifiers specifically designed for environmental identification missions conducted by Special Purpose Units (SPU) for the screening and confirmation of unknown sample in the field.  JBTDS will initiate engineering and redesign studies to support the integration of components unto Nuclear Biological Chemical Reconnaissance Vehicle (NBCRV).

The Next Generation Chemical Detector (NGCD) is several detection systems for multi phase of matter sampling, location of liquid and solids on surfaces, and vapor and aerosol monitoring.  NGCD will detect and identify non-traditional agents, chemical warfare agents (CWAs), toxic industrial chemicals (TICs) in the air and on surfaces.  The NGCD will provide improved NTA/CWA/TIC selectivity and sensitivity on multiple platforms as well as multiple environments.  There are four capability areas, of which three; NGCD 1, NGCD 2 and NGCD 3 were awarded contracts in the Technical Maturation and Risk Reduction Phase.  The fourth capability - personal chemical detection is still in technology development.  These sensors will improve detection, consequence management and reconnaissance, and weapons of mass destruction (WMD) interdiction capabilities.  The scope of the project includes detection of chemical a few feet away from the detector as well as the sampling point of the detector. 

The Non-Traditional Agent (NTA) Defense program supports the on-going chemical and biological (CB) defense efforts as acquisition programs address emerging threat requirements across the full spectrum of commodities.  Dedicated initiatives and projects will develop and transition information, technologies, and capabilities into acquisition options and efforts (e.g. Programs of Record, Advanced Technology Demonstrations (ATD), and Accelerated Acquisition) that account for the breadth and depth of advanced, emerging, and unknown CB threats and span the full range of defense missions.  The NTA Defense program will provide essential enablers such as threat understanding; operational impacts of performance trades; and comprehensive, integrated, and layered defense concepts against advanced, emerging, and unknown CB threats.  The program will support a balanced portfolio which will target capabilities to reduce operational and tactical risk from technology gaps inherent from emerging threats.  Additional efforts in conducting systems engineering analysis will occur in order to identify and consolidate capability knowledge gaps and prioritize required investments.

The Global Biosurveillance Technology Initiatives (GBTI) is developing a globally-distributed, fully integrated and networked, state-of-the-art analytical capability for biological threats that will enable the compression of the discovery-to-decision timeframe and provide awareness and understanding of the baseline biological threat footprint.  For the first time, capabilities such as advanced characterization and genomic sequencing are being located in forward locations, bringing faster pathogen detection, improved multiplex assays and medical countermeasures to the Warfighter.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Operational assessment projects are the GBTI laboratories include metagenomic pathogen discovery, evaluation of GBTI optimized multi-plex assay panels, and high throughput surveillance projects with potential for regional or global impact within context of local health issues.  The information gleaned from the operational assessments will assess the baseline of each laboratory, identify and address the gaps, and determining the impact of standardized equipment and operating procedures between laboratories.  The Warfighter has a well-trained laboratory staff at 25 locations worldwide that can assist in conducting high throughput sample assessments and providing vital information to decision makers in a more concise timeframe, than previously when CONUS reachback support was required.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>ENHANCED MARITIME BIOLOGICAL DETECTION (EMBD)

The Enhanced Maritime Biological Detection (EMBD) program will use a streamlined acquisition strategy.  This approach is based on the mature technology that will transition from the Assessment of Environmental Detection (AED) leg of the Joint USFK Portal and Integrated Threat Recognition (JUPITR) Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD) to a program of record for the US Navy.  The EMBD program is expected to transition to a pre-MS C upon selection from AED and will make maximum use of the testing that has been done to field the replacement for the 135 Joint Biological Point Detection Systems (JBPDS) in the Navy.  The EMBD program will coordinate with the JBTDS, Next Generation Diagnostic System (NGDS) and Common Analytical Laboratory System (CALS) to share information and leverage potential collector and identification technologies.  A Sole Source contract is anticipated to be necessary to obtain the selected technology and meet expected fielding schedule.

JOINT BIO TACTICAL DETECTION SYSTEM (JBTDS)

The JBTDS program will use an evolutionary acquisition strategy.  Under this approach, capability is developed based on current technologies, recognizing up front the need for potential technology insertion as technology advances to provide better and more cost effective capabilities.  Technology insertions will provide militarily useful and supportable operational capabilities that can be developed, produced, deployed, and sustained.  JBTDS will make maximum use of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) and Government off-the-shelf (GOTS) technology.  The JBTDS program is coordinating with Common Analytical Laboratory System and Next Generation Diagnostic System (NGDS) to share information and leverage potential common identification technology solutions.  JBTDS utilized NGDS contract vehicle to research and develop a JBTDS tactical variant identifier.  Full and open competition was utilized at MS B for the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract with options for Low Rate Initial Production and Full Rate Production.  Chemring Detection Systems was awarded the EMD contract on 2 April 2015.  The JBTDS will address legacy SPU requirements gaps/deficiencies where they exist through the streamlined development and optimization of COTS/GOTS systems; awarded 3 sole-source contracts in July 2015 under the National Security exemption to full and open competition.

NEXT GENERATION CHEMICAL DETECTOR (NGCD)

System Engineering and market survey results suggested the most effective way to develop NGCD was to divide the program into four unique capabilities to detect and identify the full spectrum of chemical compounds in all phases of matter.  The Government awarded ten (10) contracts in June 2014 to support Technology Maturation Risk Reduction (TMRR) acquisition phase activities in three of the four capability areas: three (3) contracts for the NGCD 1 capability, four (4) contracts for the NGCD 2 capability, and three (3) contracts for the NGCD 3 capability.  Full and Open competition will be used to award Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contracts with production options for each capability at Milestone B.

NON TRADITIONAL AGENT DEFENSE (NTA DEFENSE)

The Non-Traditional Agent (NTA) Defense program supports the Chemical Biological Defense Program (CBDP) to develop countermeasures for all emerging threats across all commodities.  The NTA Defense program consists of a number of projects and initiatives through full and open competition contract actions that enhance the CBDP's portfolio and mission and feed directly into Programs of Record, Advanced Technology Demonstrations, and Acquisition Programs.  NTA Defense efforts: (1) evaluate COTS and GOTS technologies and systems, (2) conduct demonstrations and experiments, (3) integrates Intelligence Community threat analysis, operational risk analysis with systems technical performance to identify technologies or systems that can be rapidly developed, and deployed, and/or transitioned to an Acquisition Program for technology insertion or derive an Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) to a fielded system, and (4) provides coordination of DoD, interagency, international NTA projects.  These initiatives allow the CBDP to mitigate risk against emerging threats and better prepare the warfighter to deal with technological surprise across the full range of military missions.

GLOBAL BIO TECH INITIATIVE (GBTI)

Global Biosurveillance Technology Initiative (GBTI) will use an evolutionary acquisition strategy.  Under this approach capability is developed and fielded based on current technologies and user needs.  Technology insertions will provide state-of-the art analytical capability for biological threats.  GBTI will make maximum use of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and Government-Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) technology.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Common Analytical Laboratory System capability (CALS) will be modular, scalable and adaptable to a variety of concept of operations (CONOPS) and environmental conditions.  Currently, fielded systems have been designed and fielded independently by the services with the intent of meeting a specific unit requirement.  As a result, multiple mobile lab configurations exist with differing sustainment tails and lacking in commonality.  The CALS will provide common analytical capabilities packaged to meet the specific CONOPS and mission of the gaining unit.  The analytical capabilities will detect and identify Chemical Warfare Agents (CWAs), Toxic Industrial Chemicals (TICs), Toxic Industrial Materials (TIMs) and Biological Warfare Agents (BWAs).  Users of the system will include the National Guard Bureau Civil Support Teams, the Army 20th Support Command, the Army Medical Laboratory, the Air Force, the Marine Corps, and the Navy. 

There are three variants of CALS: 
Field Confirmatory Integrated System (FC-IS) - NGB and Marine Corp
-Integrates CBR systems into a common make / model 20-foot International Standard Organization (ISO) container.  The container will be integrated onto the International Durastar vehicle to support employment.

Theater Validation Integrated System (TV-IS) - Army
-Similar to the FC-IS but provides a higher level of confidence in analytical results through the use of orthogonal (complimentary) technologies and an expanded analytical suite.  This system employs multiple standardized ISO containers, which will be integrated onto two Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV) and one trailer, to support the needed additional laboratory space.

Field Confirmatory Analytical Capability Sets (FC-ACS) - All Services including NGB
-A palletized / transportable equipment subsets that allows them to be loaded into transport cases and palletized.  Enables the users to receive the Chemical, Biological and Radiological (CBR) subsystems that meet their specific mission profiles.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>COMMON ANALYTICAL LABORATORY SYSTEM (CALS)

The Common Analytical Laboratory System (CALS) will be developed using an Incremental approach, leveraging both Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) and Government Off the Shelf (GOTS) analytical components to support the identification of Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Non-traditional agent materials in environmental samples technology.  The (CALS) program is designed to provide an affordable, modular, scalable and sustainable field analytic capability that can be readily transported to meet the mission profile and requirements of the gaining organization.  Increment 1 will consist of (3) variants which will be fielded, in accordance with mission need, to components of the Air Force, Army, Marines, Navy and National Guard Bureau requiring CBRN field confirmatory analytical detection capability.  Post Milestone B (FY15), a hybrid contract (CPIF / FPI / FFP) was awarded to develop, design and build these system variant prototypes in order to conduct developmental test (DT) and evaluation.  The Field Confirmatory Analytical Capability Set (FC ACS) will enter DT first and is expected to reach an early Milestone C - Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) (FY17) followed by a Full Rate Production (FRP) Decision prior to the Milestone C (LRIP) (FY18) and (FRP) Decision for the FC and TV Integrated Systems.  After each Milestone C, contracts will be awarded to produce the (3) variants of the Common Analytical Laboratory System using Fixed Price (FP) Contract vehicles.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project supports Engineering and Manufacturing Development and Low Rate Initial Production (EMD/LRIP) of Joint Service Chemical, Biological, and Radiological (CBR) Collective Protection (CP) systems that are smaller, lighter, less costly to produce and maintain, and more logistically supportable enabling mission accomplishment in CBR environments.  CP systems can be installed on any type of platform, such as, hard and soft shelters, vehicles, ships, aircraft, and buildings.  CP systems provide spaces safe from the effects of CBR contamination.  Experimentation and demonstration will be used in this phase to reduce risk and inform supporting Concept of Operations (CONOPS) and Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs).

The system included in this project is the Joint Expeditionary Collective Protection (JECP).

JECP provides the Joint Expeditionary Forces a CP capability which is lightweight, compact, modular, and affordable.  A family of systems, developed in two phases, that will allow the application of CP to transportable soft-side shelters, enclosed spaces of opportunity, and in remote austere locations as a standalone resource.  Phase one includes standalone Collective protection systems, kits to provide existing host platforms and structures with CBRN protection.  Phase two includes kits to provide other host platforms and structures that were not explicitly designed in phase one.  JECP will be capable of protecting personnel groups of varying size, unencumbered by Individual Protective Equipment (IPE), from the effects of CB agents, Toxic Industrial Materials (TIMs), radiological particles, heat, dust, and sand.  The employment of JECP is a strategic deterrence against enemy use of CBR agents or TIMs, and will reduce the need for personnel and equipment decontamination.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Strategy based on evolutionary development, based on a family of systems approach.  After MS B, awarded competitive Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF) contract to Science Applications International Corporation (now Leidos) in 2008 to build prototypes subjected to robust engineering developmental testing and Operational Assessment during the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase.  After MS C, awarded a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) option to Leidos in September 2013 for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) systems to support formal Developmental Testing (DT) and Multi-Service Operational Test &amp; Evaluation (MOT&amp;E) events.  In addition, a Fixed Price Incentive Firm Target (FPIF) option was awarded to Leidos in January 2014 to perform non-recurring engineering (NRE) and logistic product development associated with the LRIP system configurations.  A post MS C Milestone Decision Authority Acquisition Decision Memorandum, dated March 2014, separated the program into two phases.  Phase two systems will be developed as engineering changes to phase one systems.  A business case analysis (BCA) will be conducted to determine the best strategy for full rate production.  Following a successful Full Rate Production (FRP) decision for phase one systems implement recommendations from the BCA.  Phase two systems will undergo limited developmental and operational testing and then pursue a MS C full rate production decision.  BA7 funding develops incremental improvements to fielded systems.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) for: (1) Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP); (2) Contamination Indicator Decontamination Assurance System (CIDAS); (3) General Purpose Decontaminant (GPD); (4) Joint Service Equipment Wipe (JSEW); and (5) Joint Biological Agent Decontamination System (JBADS).  Experimentation and demonstration will be used in this phase to reduce risk and inform supporting materiel solutions, CONOPS and TTPs.

The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) Decontamination System MDAP project will develop an integrated decontamination containment system and decontaminant delivery system to support the JSF program office Live Fire Test and Evaluation (LFT&amp;E) to satisfy specific F-35 decontamination requirements through aircraft-unique interfaces and demonstrate the aircraft's ability to meet CB decontamination and survivability requirements.

The CIDAS is a contamination indicator/decontamination assurance technology.  It will consist of an indicator and an applicator, for which there will be three applicator configurations (a small-scale, mid-scale and large scale applicator).  The indicator will be sprayed on tactical vehicles, aircraft, ships, crew-served weapons, and individual weapons that may have been exposed to traditional and non-traditional chemical contamination.  CIDAS is a new capability for the Joint Forces that will reduce the logistics burden of decontamination by indicating presence and location of traditional (Nerve and Blister) and non-traditional chemical agents on militarily relevant surfaces pre- and post-decontamination.

General Purpose Decontaminant (GPD) is a liquid, field adjustable decontaminant for chemical and biological agents that will provide thorough decontamination capabilities for tactical vehicles, shipboard surfaces, crewserved weapons, and individual/personal weapons in hostile and non-hostile environments that have been exposed to traditional and non-traditional CB contamination while providing the lowest logistical footprint. 
 
The Joint Service Equipment Wipe (JSEW) is a decontamination wipe that will provide immediate/operational decontamination capabilities for sensitive and non-sensitive equipment in hostile and non-hostile environments that have been exposed to chemical agents/contamination and shall decontaminate Nerve and Blister agents from a starting liquid challenge of 10 g/m2 to less than or equal to 1 g/m2 and non-traditional agents from a starting liquid challenge of 5 g/m2 to less than or equal to 1 g/m2.  In addition, the JSEW is intended to be a replacement for the Individual Equipment Decontamination Kit (M295).  Follow on increments of JSEW may include biological agent capability and/or use on skin.

The JBADS will provide the capability to conduct biological and chemical agent decontamination of the interior and exterior of aircraft and vehicle platforms.  The capabilities will be provided in two phases.  Phase I will provide thorough biological decontamination of the interior and exterior of cargo aircraft.  The JBADS Phase I is a capability set that will include a shelter to encapsulate an airframe, a decontamination delivery system (e.g. hot-humid air-blower, etc.), environmental control and monitoring system(s), and other ancillary components required to ensure efficacious biological agent decontamination.  It will provide the capability to decontaminate biologically contaminated airframes to safe levels and allow more rapid return to service.  Phase II will expand upon the Phase I capability set.  Phase II will develop multiple decontaminants and modular designs to address various platforms and chemical agent decontamination.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) Decontamination System MDAP project is utilizing sole source contracting to leverage and integrate commercially available technologies to provide a decontamination delivery system for the Joint Strike Fighter program office in support of the JSF Live Fire Test and Evaluation (LFT&amp;E).  The firm fixed price contracts have a period of performance to December 2016.

DFoS CONTAMINATION INDICATOR DECONTAMINATION ASSURANCE SYSTEM (DFoS CIDAS)

The CIDAS program will follow an evolutionary acquisition strategy in consonance with user developed capability documents.  Following MS A, collaborated with program efforts, including the Hazard Mitigation, Materiel and Equipment Restoration (HaMMER) Advanced Technology Development Operational Demonstration and Extended User Evaluations, and conducted technology demonstrations on candidate indicator and applicator technologies to mitigate risk and identify affordable mature technologies that meet requirements.  Determined need for and initiated Government designed mid and large scale applicators to provide an affordable solution to meet specific User requirements.  Following MS B, used full and open competition to award a performance based firm fixed price contract with options for LRIP and FRP for nerve indicator and small scale applicator systems.  Used full and open competition to award a performance based firm fixed price contract for engineering and manufacturing development and limited developmental testing of two blister technologies, with options for LRIP and FRP of preferred blister technology.  Integrate and test the contractor and Government designs in the developmental and operational testing.

DFoS GENERAL PURPOSE DECONTAMINANT (DFoS GPD)

Due to the maturity levels of the systems entering the Technology Development (TD) phase, the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) issued an Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) which approved GPD to by-pass Milestone (MS) B and enter directly to MS C Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP).  During the TD Phase (which includes CP I, CP II), the GPD Program employed a Competitive Prototyping (CP) effort to facilitate the evaluation of Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) technologies releasing a Request for Proposal (RFP) as a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial and Non-Developmental Items (NDI), utilizing full and open competition.  As the GPD program entered the final phase of Technology Development (Developmental Test), the program continued to follow an evolutionary acquisition strategy.  The production contract in support of MS C is a single award for LRIP with four option years for FRP, using Full and Open Competition in accordance with FAR Subpart 6.1. This strategy ensures that all prospective sources, with the capability of meeting the program requirements, have the opportunity to participate.

DFoS JOINT SENSITIVE EQUIPMENT WIPE (DFoS JSEW)

Due to the maturity levels of the systems entering the Technology Development (TD) phase, the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) issued an Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) which approved JSEW to pursue a Milestone (MS) A to MS C Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) acquisition strategy.  During the TD Phase (which includes CP I, CP II), the JSEW Program employed a Competitive Prototyping (CP) effort to facilitate the evaluation of Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) technologies releasing a Request for Proposal (RFP) as a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial and Non-Developmental Items (NDI), utilizing full and open competition.  As the JSEW program entered the final phase of Technology Development (Developmental Test), the program continued to follow an evolutionary acquisition strategy.  The JSEW acquisition strategy used to support Developmental Testing (DT), Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) and Full Rate Production (FRP) is a single contract award for DT (awarded 4QFY14), with options for LRIP and FRP, using Full and Open Competition in accordance with FAR Subpart 6.1.  This strategy ensures that all prospective sources, with the capability of meeting the contract requirements, have the opportunity to participate.

JOINT BIOLOGICAL AGENT DECONTAMINATION SYSTEM (JBADS)

The JBADS program will be executed utilizing a phased approach.  Phase One will deliver a biological agent decontamination capability for interior and exterior decontamination of cargo aircraft.  For Phase One, the program will leverage the Joint Biological Agent Decontamination System Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (JCTD) and prior testing of candidate technologies to skip Milestone B and proceed directly to Milestone C, Low Rate Initial Production Decision.  Modifications to the JCTD design will be made and technical testing will be conducted to support a Milestone C/Low Rate Initial Production Decision.  A single, firm fixed price production contract with full and open competition will be awarded using a performance-based specification for the Aircraft Decontamination Units and a detailed specification for the Aircraft Enclosure.  Low Rate Initial Production/Operational test assets will be purchased using procurement funding due to the low density and estimated cost of the Phase One system.  These assets will be retrofitted and fielded following a successful Full Rate Production decision. 

JBADS Phase Two will expand the biological agent decontamination capability to other platforms such as tactical and rotary wing aircraft, as well as ground vehicles.  In addition, Phase Two will provide chemical agent decontamination capabilities.  Phase Two will enter the acquisition process at Milestone B and a full and open cost plus fixed fee contract will be awarded to conduct the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase.  Candidate technologies will be evaluated during EMD to determine the most cost effective combination of biological and chemical agent decontamination for a variety of platforms.  Following Milestone C/LRIP decision, a single, firm fixed price production contract with full and open competition will be awarded.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides Engineering &amp; Manufacturing Development Phase and Low Rate Initial Production (EMD/LRIP) for individual protection equipment, with the goal of providing equipment that allows the individual soldier, sailor, airman, or Marine to operate in a contaminated Nuclear, Biological and Chemical (NBC) environment with little or no degradation of his/her performance.  Experimentation and demonstration will be used in this phase to reduce risk and inform supporting materiel solutions, Concept of Operations (CONOPS) and Techniques, Tactics, and Procedures (TTP).

Included in this program are: 

(1) The Joint Service Aircrew Mask (JSAM) for Tactical Aircraft (TA), Strategic Aircraft (SA), Joint Strike Fighter (JSF), and Rotary Wing (RW) are Acquisition Category (ACAT) III programs developed to provide respiratory and ocular protection.  The JSAM will be a lightweight chemical and biological (CB) protective mask that will be worn as CB protection for most Army, Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps fixed wing (FW) and RW aircrew members.  All JSAM variants will be compatible with most below-the-neck (BTN) CB protection ensembles and existing aircrew life support equipment (ALSE).  They will include a protective hood assembly, CB filter, blower assembly, and an intercom for ground communication.  They will also provide flame protection, demist/emergency demist, and anti-drowning features.  The goal of the JSAM programs is to develop, manufacture, field, and sustain an aircrew respirator system that, in conjunction with BTN clothing ensembles, will provide the capability for all aircrew to operate in an actual or perceived CB warfare environment.  

In FY14, the JSAM FW program was separated into two programs: JSAM TA and JSAM SA.  The JSAM TA and SA respirators are being developed for use in the majority of DoD FW aircraft except for the F-35 JSF.  The JSAM TA program will provide CB and anti-G protection up to nine times the vertical force (Gz), for aircrew in high-performance aircraft.  The JSAM SA program will be used in aircrew positions that do not require anti-G protection and provide CB protection for positions that only need pressure breathing for altitude.  

The JSAM-JSF is a CB respirator being specifically designed to support the F-35.  It is designed to ensure that system integration and qualification of CB protection and survivability requirements are achieved as derived from the JSF Operational Requirements Document.  Prior to FY15, this project was funded under the JSAM funding line.  When integrated with aircraft and pilot mounted equipment, the JSAM-JSF will provide combined CB, hypoxia and anti-G protection to all F-35 users, including the United States Air Force (USAF), Navy (USN), Marine Corps (USMC), and International Partners.  

The JSAM MPU-5 RW mask is being developed for use by pilots and aircrew in the majority of DoD RW aircraft in the United States Army (USA) except AH-64 users, USAF, USN, and USMC.  The JSAM RW will integrate with most BTN CB ensembles, normal aircrew flight equipment, and RW flight helmets.  The system contains a removable face plate, allowing the user to fly "face free" in Mission Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP) 2 (garment and boots) and easily convert to MOPP 3 (garment, boots, and mask) when the threat level dictates, thereby reducing physiological burden.  If threat level warrants, the user can install their face plate into an already donned hood and enter MOPP 4 without removing their flight helmet.  


(2) The Joint Service General Purpose Mask (JSGPM) Advanced Respiratory Protection Initiative (ARPI) will address improved mask protection, filter protection against Toxic Industrial Chemicals (TIC)/Toxic Industrial Materials (TIM) and improved profile and breathing resistance; and wearability compatibility/integration.  This will be accomplished through class-based analysis, Filtration Advanced Screening Test (FAST), desorption study, and advanced Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) filtration efforts.  Several technologies are being pursued by the Joint Science and Technology Office (JSTO), with two specific technologies being pursued in the FY14-16 timeframe.  The JSGPM ARPI effort will investigate alternative designs and modifications to Zirconium hydroxide, Zinc, Argentum (Silver), Triethylene di-amine (TEDA) (ZZAT) to further increase filtration of TICs and Chemical Warfare Agents (CWA).  ZZAT is a zirconium hydroxide based filtration media that can potentially be layered with carbon.  The first technology, known as Cobalt-Zinc ZZAT (CoZZAT), uses a layered bed of carbon concept to improve TIC and CWA protection capabilities, while the second technology known as Metal Organic Framework (MOF), is an engineered media that is a porous crystalline compound made up of metal ions and organic bridging molecules (ligands) for targeted removal of chemicals.  The JSGPM ARPI effort will also investigate various applications of nanofiber particulate media.  The new filters will create a new JSGPM mask, the M53A1, which will meet National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) certification standards for use against CBRN agents in order to provide users the flexibility to have one mask that is approved for both military and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulated missions.  This effort transitions to BA7 in FY16.

The Uniform Integrated Protection Ensemble (UIPE) is a Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear (CBRN) protective system offering the capability to select a tailored material solution based on the expected threat level commensurate with operational mission requirements.  Where appropriate, a family of systems approach that meets the scope of UIPE individual protection capability needs will be utilized.  The objective of UIPE is to fully integrate CBRN and toxic industrial material (TIM) protections into an ensemble, identical in fit and form to the combat uniform (including mask - helmet integration and protective boots and gloves), thus negating the need for separate protective ensemble components.  This integrated protection approach will result in increased warfighter operational performance in a CBRN environment.  The UIPE program will develop, integrate, test, procure and field incremental capability solutions that are modular in function and offer improvements in form and fit over current systems; the program will explore trade-space in areas such as protection level, heat stress, durability, antimicrobial properties, flame resistance, launderability, self-detoxification, and protection time in order to provide capabilities that afford maximum utility to the warfighter.  Where appropriate modeling and simulation tools will be used to lower UIPE program risks, reduce costs, and ensure a high confidence in selected technologies.  UIPE is aimed specifically at providing enhanced individual protection capabilities to the warfighter through reduction of physiological and psychological effects associated with CBRN protective garment thermal burden, weight, and bulk.  The UIPE program will consider modernization in order to ensure that the warfighter retains access to state of the art capability to support future operational mission requirements.

The UIPE Increment 2 will seek to provide reduced thermal burden and weight compared to current protective ensembles.  It will develop, integrate, test, procure, and field incremental capability solutions that are modular in function and offer improvements over current systems.  The program will explore trade-space in areas such as protection level, heat stress, durability, antimicrobial properties, flame resistance, launderability, self-detoxification, and protection time in order to provide capabilities that afford maximum utility to the Warfighter.  Where appropriate, modeling and simulation tools will be used to lower UIPE Increment 2 program risks, reduce costs, and ensure a high confidence in selected technologies.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>JS AIRCREW MASK FIXED WING (JSAM FW)

The overall JSAM acquisition approach is phased due to the complexity of interfacing with almost 200 aircraft types and models with different mission sets, Aviation Life Support Equipment (ALSE), cockpit layouts, priorities, etc.  JSAM will pursue two materiel solutions for fixed wing aircraft via the JSAM for Tactical Aircraft (TA) and JSAM for Strategic Aircraft (SA) programs.  JSAM TA and SA must be compatible with current CB ensembles and provide flame protection and will replace all existing Pressure Breathing for Gravity (PBG) and non-PBG CB aircrew respirators.  The JSAM TA program utilizes a phased acquisition strategy to provide aircrew of all Services with individual head-eye-respiratory protection against Chemical-Biological (CB) warfare agents.  The JSAM TA effort will provide Pressure Breathing for Gravity (PBG) Mask for USN and USAF tactical aircraft.  The JSAM SA (Modified M53 (MM53)) effort will test and field a mask for aircrew positions not requiring PBG capabilities.  This contract was awarded via sole source to Avon Protection Systems, Cadillac, Michigan to modify and field a commercially available mask (M53).

JS AIRCREW MASK ROTARY WING (JSAM RW)

The JSAM RW was developed under a competitive Cost Plus Fixed Fee contract, which is also used by JSAM Apache and JSAM Apache Block III.  A sole source Fixed Price Incentive (FPI) contract was awarded for LRIP items.  A sole source Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) production contract with FPI and FFP CLINs will be pursued for additional LRIP quantities and FRP.

JS AIRCREW MASK FIXED WING STRATEGIC AIRCRAFT (JSAM SA)

The JSAM SA acquisition approach involves modifying the fielded M53 ground mask design in order to add Pressure Breathing for Altitude (PBA), up to 40,000 feet above sea-level, and middle ear equalization capabilities.  The JSAM SA mask is intended to be fielded to the United States Air Force (USAF), United States Navy (USN), United States Marine Corps (USMC), United States Army (USA), and United States Coast Guard (USCG).  The RDT&amp;E contract was awarded via sole source to Avon Protection Systems, Cadillac, Michigan to modify and field a commercially available mask (M53).

The overall acquisition strategy is to initially produce and field the JSAM SA masks in four LRIP phases.  This phased approach will allow the JSAM SA mask to be fielded to aircrew of the most applicable aircrafts in the shortest amount of time.  At the end of each LRIP phase, the aircraft associated with each phase will have achieved an Initial Operating Capability (IOC) with the JSAM SA mask.  The remaining aircrew, not given a JSAM SA mask during the LRIP phases, will receive their masks after FRP.  At the end of FRP, the Services will have achieved their Full Operating Capability (FOC) with the mask.  LRIP 1 will consist of fielding the JSAM SA mask to most of the USAF E-3 and USN P-8 aircrew.  Based on technical difficulty and mission need, the JSAM SA program will work with the Services to determine which LRIP phase (i.e. 2, 3, or 4) will include the remaining aircraft.

The overall test strategy involves four major phases.  The first test phase consists of Design Verification Testing (DVT) which will evaluate developmental prototype masks prior to CDR.  The second test phase is Developmental Testing (DT) to support Milestone C/LRIP.  The third test phase is Operational Testing (OT) of LRIP assets to support IOC fielding to USAF E-3 and USN P-8 aircrew.  The final test phase is combined DT/OT for the LRIPs 2, 3, and 4.

The contract strategy consists of two sole-source contracts with Avon Protection Systems, the manufacturer of the base M53 mask.  The first contract, which was awarded on 31 July 2013, covers all activities during Engineering, Manufacturing, and Development (EMD) phase.  The second contract, which is planned to be awarded after Milestone C/LRIP, will cover the activities during the Production and Deployment (PD) phase including all LRIP and FRP builds.

JS AIRCREW MASK FIXED WING TACTICAL AIRCRAFT (JSAM TA)

The JSAM TA planned solution for the USAF F-22 Readiness requirement is an integration effort and an Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) to the Navy's A/ P22P-14(A).  The ECP will provide CB-protection capability to F-22 pilots while providing valuable test data to characterize the JSAM TA performance envelope.  The JSAM TA program plans to pursue a full-and-open competition for the production contract to cover Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) and Full Rate Production (FRP).  The Government plans to competitively award one, Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract that will include production and subsequent integration efforts to be completed for each aircraft platform.

JS AIRCREW MASK JOINT STRIKE FIGHTER (JSAM JSF)

JSAM-JSF is specifically designed for the F-35 (Joint Strike Fighter) to be incorporated within the JSF platform and fielded to US Services and international partners.  JSAM-JSF is being developed concurrently with other JSF equipment including life support and pilot flight equipment.  JSAM-JSF initially leveraged a JSAM-FW design and shared the same base contract with a Cost Plus Incentive Fee delivery order.

JS GENERAL PURPOSE MASK (JSGPM)

The JSGPM Advanced Respiratory Protection Initiative (ARPI) effort is using the two M61 filter contracts awarded to 3M and Avon to develop improved filters for the JSGPM.  There is a continual technology refreshment CLIN on both contracts that allow for filter development tasks to be awarded.  The tasks can be competed between the two awardees or awarded to both to ensure competition on future spares and delivery orders.  As filter technologies transition from the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) and Joint Science and Technology Office (JSTO), the technologies will be matured from system/subsystem prototyping demonstration technologies at Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 to actual system "mission proven" through successful mission operations in a mission environment at TRL 9.  In addition to the maturing of the technology, the Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL) of the media and the layered bed design requires maturing to an MRL level 9.  The complexity of maturing all these different items requires an evolutionary approach with one prototype iteration governing the approach on the next iteration.  With the criticality of the filter, the production transition to the new improved filter has to be done with a high degree of confidence with risks mitigated to a low level.

CBRN UNIFORM INTEGRATED PROTECTION ENSEMBLE (UIPE)

The UIPE Increment 2 supports an evolutionary acquisition strategy with the intent of protecting the Warfighter from operationally relevant and non-traditional chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN)/toxic industrial hazards during Joint Force operations.  UIPE Increment 2 will leverage the approved UIPE CBRN Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) to build on and enhance capabilities attained in UIPE Increment 1 by continuing to provide integrated individual protective equipment that enables the Warfighter to operate in a contaminated environment with no or minimal degradation to performance.  UIPE Increment 2 will perform trade space analysis using Requests for Information for materials, closures, and designs, the issuance of a Challenge, and a concept demonstration event to provide a baseline assessment and feed the requirements development process.  A manufacturing and development contract will be awarded prior to Milestone A to build prototypes/development samples, produce test articles, and provide manufacturability, development and documentation support.  The final UIPE Increment 2 garment design will be Government owned in order to control interfaces and insert future technologies.  UIPE Increment 2 is exploring the use of a Government issued Challenge to attract innovative ideas from Government, Industry, and Academia for inclusion into the final solutions.  Strategies for obtaining various capability solutions will be developed as those solutions are identified.  If Commercial-of-the-Shelf (COTS) or Non-Developmental Item (NDI) solutions are identified, appropriate contracting methods will be pursued.  Where possible, rights and data will be requested to allow competitive procurement.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports Engineering and Manufacturing Development and Low Rate Initial Production (EMD/LRIP).  Experimentation and demonstration will be used in this phase to reduce risk and inform supporting materiel solutions, CONOPS and TTPs.

Efforts included in this project are: (1) Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear Information Systems (CBRN IS); (2) Joint Effects Model (JEM); (3) Joint Warning and Reporting Network (JWARN); (4) Biosurveillance Portal (BSP); and (5) Software Support Activity (SSA).

CBRN IS aligns Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical Biological Defense (JPEO CBD) information technology in order to utilize a common software architecture, eliminate duplicative integration effort, produce interoperable system components, and minimize time-to-market of end user capability.  JPEO CBD information technology is assembled from the inventory of available capability in place of the current paradigm where functionality only exists within the individual Joint Effects Model (JEM), Joint Warning and Report Network (JWARN), and Biosurveillance Portal (BSP) applications.  CBRN IS aligns with the Joint Information Environment (JIE), such as milCloud, in order to field the integrated capabilities.  The JIE is the cornerstone of the DoD's future - providing a secure information framework from our national senior leaders and joint force commanders, command and control forces that deliver responsive, decisive actions from any device; anytime and anywhere. 

The Joint Effects Model (JEM) is a web-based software application that supplies the Department of Defense (DoD) with the one and only accredited tool to effectively model and simulate the effects of Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) weapon strikes and incidents.  JEM is capable of providing all Warfighters with the ability to accurately model and predict the time-phased impact of CBRN and Toxic Industrial Chemical/Material (TIC/TIM) events and effects.  JEM supports planning to mitigate the effects of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) and to provide rapid estimates of hazards and effects into the Common Operational Picture (COP).

Follow-on increments of JEM will refine and display hazard areas in near real time to reflect inputs such as meteorological, oceanographic, or actual agent concentration data.  JEM will automatically receive input data from the Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (C4I) system on which it resides such as historical climatology, local observations, weather forecasts, natural environmental threats (i.e.: pandemic influenza, etc.), terrain data, intelligence information, or population data.  Increment 2 will allow manual user input for factors such as concentrations of chemical warfare agents or actual exposure measurements and forecast sheltering stay-times and provide for modeling sheltering time through user-defined scenarios.

The Joint Warning and Reporting Network (JWARN) is an accredited Department of Defense (DOD) warning and reporting system that provides a standardized warning and reporting capability for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) and Toxic Industrial Materials (TIM) incidents.  

JWARN supports the Joint Force Commander (JFC) by improving force protection capabilities for units operating in chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear environments.  JWARN provides a digital display of CBRN 1-6 reports on the Common Operational Picture, displayed through Service provided C4I systems resident at all echelons of command.  JWARN will be operated by CBRN and non-CBRN trained personnel operating in the operations center at various command nodes.  This provides commanders with situational awareness to inform decision making for force protection criteria, unmasking operations, decontamination, and continuity of operations in a contaminated environment.  Future sensor configurations will forward sensor inputs directly to JWARN via established communication lanes, removing the man-in-the-loop requirement with the current system configuration.  JWARN will be information system classification agnostic and must be able to operate on unclassified, secret, top secret, and mission partner IT Systems without increasing system operator requirement, i.e.: sensor to COP via one communication loop.  As a result, sensors will then be able to communicate with JWARN on the same network, regardless of classification.

JEM and JWARN utilize the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) Manual prescribed Information Technology Box (IT Box) construct for managing requirements for the follow-on increments of capability development.  The "IT Box" is an acquisition approach and methodology regarding how software systems should be developed and fielded.  It is a process that differs from the way DoD acquires hardware systems.  The acquisition approach uses the Information Systems Initial Capabilities Document (IS ICD) to describe the required operational capabilities for the entire development effort.  These overarching requirements are further broken out into Requirements Definition Packages (RDPs) released over the life of the product instead of a single Capability Development Document released early in the program.  "Agile Software Development", a term used frequently through the JPM IS R forms, is a set of industry standard software development methods used in conjunction with the IT Box framework.  Agile Software Development promotes adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, continuous improvement, and encourages rapid and flexible response to change.  The Agile methodology is an alternative to traditional program management, typically used in software development.  It helps teams respond to unpredictability through incremental, iterative work cadences, known as sprints.  Agile methodologies are an alternative to waterfall, or traditional sequential development. 

IT Box enables programs to tailor the incrementally fielded software program model in the DODI 5000.02 Interim to conduct multiple, more frequent fielding events in lieu of a single fielding event.  Programs conduct a single Milestone B (MSB) decision by the Milestone Decision Authority that covers the entire program.  MS B is followed by a series of supporting Build Decisions (BDs) associated with each RDP as they are released.  The supporting BDs will ensure incorporation of mature technology and development efforts culminating in incremental deliveries of capability to Joint and Service Command and Control (C2) architectures.  Instead of a single Milestone C decision and fielding event for one increment, the program will return to the MDA for more frequent fielding decisions, as often as annually, as portions of capability are determined suitable and operationally effective.  These multiple fielding efforts are based on providing capabilities with the most value to the operators based on Warfighter priorities/needs, maturation of the technology being incorporated and available resources supporting the effort. 

The Biosurveillance Portal (BSP) is a web-based enterprise environment that will facilitate collaboration, communication, and information sharing in support of the detection, management, and mitigation of man-made and naturally occurring biological events.  BSP bridges the communication gaps in the biosurveillance domain to provide a central access point for biosurveillance information and situational awareness for DoD, interagency and allied partners supporting the early identification and response to biological events.

BSP provides an integrated suite of web-based components designed to support public health officers, environmental officers, clinicians, physicians, and CBRN personnel as they maintain their situational awareness of local, regional, and global biological threats to the force.  BSP does not duplicate existing DoD capabilities, but rather leverages existing tools and technologies to provide users across multiple organizations and disciplines with a centralized "one-stop shop" for all of their biosurveillance resources.

As software-intensive systems, JEM, JWARN, and BSP have no separately identifiable unit production components.  JEM and JWARN are designated as ACAT III programs and unit cost calculations including Program Acquisition Unit Cost/Average Procurement Unit Cost (PAUC/APUC) and Operations and Sustainment (O&amp;S) average annual per unit costs are not applicable.  Expect BSP to be similarly designated.

The Software Support Activity (SSA) is a Chem-Bio Defense user developmental support and service organization to facilitate net-centric interoperability of systems in acquisition for the Warfighter.  The SSA provides the CBRN Warfighter with Joint Service solutions for Cybersecurity/Information Assurance (IA), Integrated Architectures, Data Management/Modeling, Interoperability Certifications, Verification, Validation and Accreditation (VV&amp;A) to support interoperable and integrated net-centric, service-oriented solutions for CBRN systems.  The SSA emphasizes development of reference implementations to guide Government and industry system and software developers to ensure that their products meet common interoperability standards.  The latest technologies/products include the definition of a Common CBRN Sensor Integration Standard (CCSI) and the CBRN Data Model.  These technologies and direct enablers for the development of CBRN integrated sensor networks and the dissemination of CBRN information across all users.  The SSA directly supports Chemical and Biological Defense Program (CBDP) initiatives by providing common service oriented architectures and frameworks for the collection and dissemination of Bio-Surveillance and other critical CBRN information.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>BIOSURVEILLANCE PORTAL (BSP)

The Biosurveillance Portal (BSP) program will meet the requirements as set forth in the USSOCOM Information Systems Capability Development Document (IS CDD), 19 May 2014.  BSP is a new start program in FY16.  The BSP program will utilize the JROC's "IT Box" construct for program requirements, management, and development.  The intent is to provide the next generation of capability with current and future technologies in less time and fielding products to the DoD utilizing an incremental delivery approach.  IT Box enables programs to tailor the incrementally fielded software program model in the DODI 5000.02 Interim to conduct multiple, more frequent fielding events in lieu of a single fielding event.  Capabilities will be developed and delivered in a series of Capability Drops (CDs) identified in Requirement Definition Packages (RDPs).  Intent is to deliver CDs every three months.  Developmental Testing (DT) and end-to-end tests (E2E) will be conducted for each CD and an operational assessment (OA) will be conducted to verify capabilities for each RDP.  User Feedback Events (UFEs) will be conducted with identified Users to illicit feedback on developed capabilities and input on required adjustments to address new technologies.  Initial Operational Capability (IOC) is targeted for 3QFY16 with Final Operational Capability to be delivered in 3QFY20.

CBRN INFORMATION SYSTEMS

CBRN IS utilizes the agile construct for software requirements management and development.  The intent is to scan the programs within the JPEO CBD, DTRA, and other sources for IT assets that can be hosted in a cloud environment and provide a CBRN capability for the warfighter.  Once a program has been identified for integration into CBRN IS, an evaluation will occur in order to see if any changes are necessary.  Modifications will be completed in coordination with the developer of the capability in order to be in alignment with CBRN IS guidelines.

JOINT EFFECTS MODEL (JEM)

JEM Increment 2 acquisition will utilize the JROC's "IT Box" construct for software development.  The intent is to provide the next generation of capability with current and future technologies, as stated in the IS ICD, in less time and fielding products to the service more frequently than an incremental delivery approach.

As part of this strategy, JEM program office developed and issued a competitive prototyping contract in April 2013 where two offerers were given the same Technical Data Package (TDP), performance Work Statement (PWS), and software requirements and were tasked to deliver a JEM prototype that implements the CCMI architecture.  This competitive prototyping strategy was successful and a single JEM integrator, General Dynamics Information Technology (GDIT), was selected as the prime development contract in December 2013. 

The current contractor for JEM 2.0 will provide all capabilities defined in the Requirement Definition Package 1 (RDP-1) document.  The JRO will release RDPs-2, 3, and 4 over the next three years prior to contract completion.  It is anticipated when the contract is re-competed in FY17 that there will be four of five capability drops not yet developed under RDP-2 and two of five under RDP-3.  The follow-on contract in FY17 will include scope for developing the remaining capabilities under the JEM 2.0 contract.  The JEM follow-on contract will utilize full and open competition and will be referred to as the JEM development, modernization and sustainment contract.

The JEM IS ICD describes the notional implementation plan for fielding of future JEM capabilities among five separate JEM Requirement Definition Packages (RDPs).  RDP-1 contains the baseline capabilities for software and was approved in June of 2014.  Since last report, the numbering scheme for RDPs was rearranged to account for the sequence of approval for each RDP.  RDP-2 now defines requirements to integrate baseline capabilities into a version that can be fielded on service C2 systems will be released in RDP-2.  RDP-2 will be released following RDP-1 to rapidly allow baseline capabilities to be incorporated into C2 systems.  RDP-3 is a notional package that allows the Science and Technology community a venue to use the JEM program to develop a version of the product for S&amp;T and analytical use.  Capabilities that are only required for the Science and Technology and analytical communities and not for operational users would be implemented in RDP-3.  Capabilities in RDP-3 would not be required to go to Operational Test, as they would not be fielded to operational users.  RDP-4 will be released after the completion of RDP-1.  This RDP will incorporate emerging capabilities that have reached a sufficient maturity for incorporation into the operationally fielded JEM system, such as ability to model new agents.  RDP-5 was added as a mechanism to define requirements for JEM 2.0 through the remainder of its life cycle.

RDP 1 - Baseline Capabilities: There are 5 planned Capability Drops (CD) within RDP 1. 
RDP 2 - C2 Integration: There are 8 planned Capability Drops (CD) within RDP 2 tied to all the various Strategic and Service C2 Systems
RDP 3 - Analytical Support: There are 2 planned Capability Drops (CD) within RDP 3.
RDP 4 - Emerging Capabilities: There are 5 planned Capability Drops (CD) within RDP 4.
RDP 5 - Modernization and Sustainment: There are 2 Capability Drops (CD) planned per year through the life of the program.

An over-arching MS B and Build Decision for RDP-1 were approved by the MDA in September 2014.  Each subsequent RDP will have an associated Build Decision.  Each CD will have an associated fielding decision.

JOINT WARNING &amp; REPORTING NETWORK (JWARN)

JWARN Increment 2 utilizes the JROC's "IT Box" construct for software requirements management and development.  The intent is to provide the next generation of capability with current and future technologies, as stated in the IS ICD, in less time and away from an incremental delivery approach.  This effort is being executed under a Cost-Plus-Award Term Incentive structure to gain maximum benefit to the Government in maintaining the fielded baseline and future software capability development and was awarded under a full and open competition Request for Proposal (RFP).  The JWARN Program will procure a Sensor Connectivity Capability (SCC) (hardware materiel solution) in order to facilitate the transfer of CBRN sensor information from legacy CBRN sensors to DoD networks.  This solution will be external to the CBRN Sensors and Service-identified network transmission device(s).

SOFTWARE SUPPORT ACTIVITY (SSA)

The SSA provides enterprise-wide services and coordination across all CBDP programs that contain data or software, or are capable of linking to the Global Information Grid (GIG).  The SSA facilitates interoperability, integration, and supportability of existing and developing IT and National Security Systems (NSS).  This will be followed by coordination to facilitate the concepts of interoperability, integration and supportability of enterprise-wide services.  Next follows work with user communities to develop and demonstrate enterprise-wide common architectures, products and services.  The SSA will support the application of the enterprise-wide architectures, products and services into the programs, with verification of compliance with the defined products and services.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project includes medical countermeasures, development of reagents, assays, diagnostic equipment, biosurveillance and supporting efforts.

Biosurveillance programs align the biosurveillance efforts across the DoD and national strategies.  The BSV program will scope and influence BSV capabilities as products to meet Warfighter requirements through innovative management of key BSV initiative.  BSV will also support the Joint US Forces Korea (USFK) Portal and Integrated Threat Recognition (JUPITR) ATD which will find, demonstrate, transition, and transfer the best operational concepts and technology solutions in support of a holistic approach to countering biological threats from laboratory to operational use.  Depending on the maturity, outputs will focus on providing component, CONOPS, and subsystem transition into programs of record (PORs) and/or integration into existing PORs.  Technologies identified from the JUPITR ATD will be fielded in FY16 to Pacific Command (PACOM).  Future ATD developments will continue to bridge communication gaps between US Forces across other Combatant Command (COCOMs).  The Biosurveillance (BSV) program will transfer from the Medical Countermeasures (MB) Project to the Contamination Avoidance (CA) Project effective FY 2016.

The Critical Reagents Program's (CRP) strategy establishes a core research and development capability by developing biological threat agent reference materials (strains, antigens, antibodies and nucleic acids) and detection/diagnostic assays for biothreat agent detection.  These reagents/assays are leveraged across multiple programs to meet the requirements of the Warfighter and Joint biological defense systems and support the biological defense community.  Through the Targeted Acquisition of Reference Materials Augmenting Capabilities (TARMAC) initiative, the CRP will use a systematic approach to the introduction of new materials and information into MCM development.  

The Emerging Infectious Diseases Therapeutics (EID Tx) program is developing and will deliver a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved, broad-spectrum medical countermeasure to the Warfighter for protection against naturally occurring or biologically engineered viruses.  The first indication being pursued is influenza due to a clear and established FDA regulatory approval pathway.  The drug in development is highly efficacious against multiple influenza viruses, including the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus, H5N1 avian influenza virus, the most recently identified H7N9 virus from the outbreak in China, and drug resistant strains of influenza viruses.  It has also demonstrated efficacy against other viruses of concern to the DoD's biodefense program.  FDA approval for an influenza treatment is anticipated following completion of the EMD phase.  EID Tx will leverage on going filovirus countermeasure development to demonstrate additional broad-spectrum MCM's against naturally occurring and/or engineered biowarfare threats.  To meet the mission need of "one drug, many bugs" EID Tx is testing product efficacy on BWA threats.  This will allow the military to leverage a product that will be FDA approved for influenza against other viruses.  This work will be funded by the Antiviral Therapeutic programs.

The Hemorrhagic Fever Virus (HFV) MCS Acquisition Program develops medical countermeasures (MCMs), using high threat, extremely lethal Biological Warfare Agents (BWAs) of the Filoviridae family agents as a model system.  Medical countermeasures will be advanced through the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensure/approval via the FDA 'Animal Rule', which allows for the demonstration of efficacy in relevant animal model(s) when human testing is not ethically feasible.  HFV will also conduct animal model development and refinement as needed to support the pivotal animal efficacy testing required under the FDA 'Animal Rule'.  Completion of Phase I trials, animal model development, and manufacturing scale up were the focus of the TMRR phase.  FDA approval for Filovirus therapeutics are expected following completion of the EMD phase.  Beginning in FY17, the work will be continued under the Antiviral Therapeutic Countermeasures program.

The Antiviral Therapeutic Program will combine the efforts of the Emerging Infectious Diseases Therapeutics and the Hemorrhagic Fever Virus Program into a consolidated effort to develop and deliver FDA approved antiviral therapeutics for the warfighter, beginning in FY17.  Drug products will be developed targeting the pathogens on the biological warfare threat lists, such as Ebola.  This includes viruses of interest from the following families: Filoviridae, Alphaviridae, Arenaviridae, Bunyaviridae, and Flaviviridae.  The program will conduct human clinical safety studies, pilot and pivotal animal efficacy, and toxicology studies, required for FDA approval.  The performers will submit New Drug Applications/Biologic License Agreements for the therapeutics during the EMD Phase.  During the Production and Deployment phase, full rate manufacturing and stockpile production will be pursued.  If the FDA mandates post-marketing surveillance studies, they will be conducted during Production and Deployment.

The NGDS is an evolutionary acquisition family of systems to provide increments of capability over time across many echelons of the Combat Health Support System.  The mission of the NGDS is to provide Chemical, biological and radiological (CBR) threat, and infectious disease identification and FDA-cleared diagnostics to inform individual patient treatment and CBR situational awareness and disease surveillance.  NGDS Increment 1 will significantly improve diagnostic capabilities for deployable combat health support units (Role 3) while also improving operational suitability and affordability.  The term "Role" is used to describe the stratification of the four tiers in which medical support is organized, on a progressive basis, to conduct treatment, evacuation, resupply, and functions essential to the maintenance of the health of the force.  Role 3 support is normally provided at Division or Service equivalent level and includes specialist laboratory resources.  NGDS Increment 2 will complement NGDS Increment 1 by developing diagnostics for unmet biological pathogen and toxin threats, chemical and radiological exposures, and to provide capability to lower echelons of care. 

The DoD provides for the development of vaccines that are directed against validated biological warfare (BW) weapons to include bacteria, viruses, and toxins of biological origin.  Effective medical countermeasures are urgently needed to negate the threat of these BW agents.  Vaccines have been identified as the most efficient countermeasure against the validated threat of BW weapons.  Products under development in this budget item include Recombinant Botulinum A/B, Plague, and Filovirus vaccines.  Efforts to be conducted during the Engineering Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase include the development of large scale manufacturing process and validation of that process, nonclinical studies, demonstration of manufacturing consistency, and expanded clinical human safety studies.  The results of these efforts, and those conducted during the EMD phase, will be used to submit a Biologic License Application (BLA) to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for product licensure.  To evaluate vaccine effectiveness, pivotal animal studies will be conducted concurrently with the Phase 3 clinical trial to satisfy the requirements of the FDA's "Animal Rule".  The DoD anticipates that the FDA will approve these products using the Animal Rule, which allows for the demonstration of efficacy in relevant animal model(s).  Upon FDA licensure, the product will transition to full-scale licensed production.  

The DoD also has the mission to maintain Investigational New Drug (IND) vaccines in Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) storage and to conduct the periodic potency and sterility testing of these materials to support submissions to the FDA.  These IND vaccines will be used to provide additional levels of protection to laboratory workers in the Special Immunizations Program (SIP) conducting research on these diseases.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>ANTI-VIRAL THERAPEUTICS (AV TX)

The acquisition strategy combines the HFV and EID TX Program efforts beginning in FY17, into a single funding line to develop and deliver FDA approved antiviral countermeasures.  Independent market research conducted in FY15 identified multiple candidates appropriate for advanced development at varying stages of maturity.  A source selection will be conducted targeting award in FY16.  Candidates selected for entry into the EMD phase of development will be initiated in FY16 as part of the HFV program, and continued under the Antiviral Therapeutic program in FY17.  Candidates selected which are appropriate for entry into the TMRR phase will be deferred for award until FY17 when BA4 funding is available to the program.  The overall regulatory approach of the program remains to pursue development of products to FDA approval under the Animal Rule.  The program will conduct human clinical safety studies, pilot and pivotal animal efficacy, and toxicology studies, required for FDA approval.  The performers will submit New Drug Applications/Biologic License Agreements for the therapeutics during the EMD Phase.  During the Production and Deployment phase, full rate manufacturing and stockpile production will be pursued.  If the FDA mandates post-marketing surveillance studies, they will be conducted during Production and Deployment.

BIOSURVEILLANCE (BSV)

BSV is a set of capabilities that acquire, integrate, and analyze medical, environmental, and incident management data using existing and next generation systems, medical and non-medical sample collection tools and identifiers/diagnostics; and transition hardware/software tools and devices as residuals from the Biosurveillance Joint United States Force Korea (USFK) Portal and Integrated Threat Recognition (JUPITR) Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD).  Prototype family of systems will be released to Busan Pier 8 and Camp Humphreys with a two year paid sustainment.  Lessons learned, technologies, concepts of employment from the ATD will be transitioned to the programs of record associated with the CBDP (such as G-BSP, NGDS, JBTDS &amp; CALS).  The acquisition strategy will address the materiel solutions identified out of the multiple Biosurveillance (BSV) related Analysis of Alternatives (AoA's).

CRITICAL REAGENTS PROGRAM (CRP)

The Critical Reagents Program's (CRP) strategy establishes a core research and development capability to develop biological threat agent reference materials (antigens, nucleic acids, and antibodies) and detection and diagnostic assays for biothreat agent detection that shall be used across multiple detection and diagnostic platforms.  In addition, this strategy includes a formal, validated advanced development process for transitioning new assays into production and subsequent integration with the appropriate detection/diagnostic platform.

EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES - THERAPUTIC (EID TX)

The goal of the EID Tx program is to develop a safe and effective MCM against biothreats of interest to the DoD.  The first step of the acquisition strategy is to develop an MCM for influenza due to a clear and established FDA regulatory approval pathway.  The Phase 2 clinical trial is complete, demonstrating both safety and efficacy in humans.  Program was authorized by FDA to move forward at End of Phase 2 meeting on 3 SEP 13.  Phase 3 clinical trials for EID Tx against influenza began during 1QFY14.  NDA submission is expected in 4QFY16 with approval in FY17, and all remaining FY16/17 funds will support the influenza effort.  In 3QFY16, the EID program will continue its strategy of leveraging broad spectrum therapeutics against new BW viral indications.  The program will leverage on-going development to demonstrate additional broad-spectrum MCM's against naturally occurring and/or engineered biowarfare threats.  The program will conduct human clinical safety studies, definitive animal efficacy, toxicology studies, and manufacturing scale up and optimization, as required for FDA approval.  The performer will submit New Drug Applications/Biologic License Agreements for the therapeutic during the EMD Phase.  During the Production and Deployment phase, full rate manufacturing and stockpile production will be pursued.  If the FDA mandates post-marketing surveillance studies, it will be conducted during Production and Deployment.  This work will be funded by the Antiviral Therapeutic programs.

HEMORRHAGIC FEVER VIRUS (HFV)

The acquisition strategy uses an evaluation of a drug candidate against the lethal Ebola Zaire viruses.  Following a successful Milestone B and entry into EMD phase, the program will conduct expanded human clinical safety studies, definitive animal efficacy, and toxicology studies, required for FDA approval.  The performer will submit a New Drug Application for the Ebola Zaire therapeutic during the EMD Phase.  During the Production and Deployment phase, full rate manufacturing and stockpile production will be pursued.  If the FDA mandates post-marketing surveillance studies, they will be conducted during Production and Deployment.

NEXT GENERATION DIAGNOSTICS SYSTEM (NGDS)

The NGDS Increment 1 program has a streamlined MS A to MS C - Limited Deployment acquisition strategy.  The NGDS Increment 1 is intended to replace the legacy Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS) beginning in FY17.  NGDS Increment 2 will complement NGDS Increment 1 by developing diagnostic capabilities for biological pathogens and toxins and address diagnostics for chemical and radiological exposures, and to provide capability to lower echelons of care.

NGDS Increment 2 will conduct technology development FY14-FY16 prior to MS B.  The acquisition strategy and capability to be developed will be informed by the results of the Analysis of Alternatives to be completed 4QFY14.  NGDS Increment 2 is intended to be complementary to NGDS Increment 1 to expand the breadth and depth of diagnostics to CBR threats, pre-symptomatic diagnostics, and far forward echelons of care.

The MB7 program will support development, testing, and FDA approval of additional assays after system fielding.

BOTULINUM VACCINE (VAC BOT)

The Prime System Contractor (Dynport Vaccine Company/DVC LLC, Frederick MD) will function as the FDA regulatory sponsor and will perform all ancillary, regulatory, quality assurance, and data management as required by the FDA.  The current budget supports development through FDA licensure of a recombinant bivalent (A and B) botulinum vaccine.  Other serotypes will be developed through an evolutionary approach, as funding becomes available.  The Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) phase included the manufacture of candidate current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) lots, animal safety testing, and initial clinical trials.  During this phase, the vaccine was evaluated for safety and immunogenicity in a small human clinical trial (Phase 1).  During the Engineering Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase, the prime contractor stabilized the vaccine formulation, validated the manufacturing process and testing protocols, optimized the delivery systems and manufactured consistency lots.  Phase 2 clinical trials were performed and provided additional safety data.  The evaluation of efficacy in pivotal animal studies to satisfy FDA requirements for the Animal Rule has been completed.  The remaining efforts to be conducted during the EMD phase include the Phase 3 clinical trial to demonstrate safety in an expanded volunteer population.  The Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) decision will be conducted after the manufacturing process has been validated and consistency lots have been produced.  A Biologics License Application (BLA) is be submitted to the FDA including all clinical, nonclinical, and manufacturing data.  The FDA grants licensure to products that are determined to be safe and efficacious.

FILOVIRUS (VAC FILO)

The acquisition strategy supports the development of multiple filovirus vaccine prototypes through the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) Phase.  At Milestone B (MS B), the best prototype will be selected through a full and open competition to transition to the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase with the delivery of an FDA licensed filovirus vaccine that will protect against multiple filoviruses.  It is anticipated that the development contracts will be a mix of Cost Plus and Fixed Price.  In addition, the program office may leverage the Advanced Development and Manufacturing capability, and other DOD agencies and laboratories to include U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID).  Following a successful MS B, the program will conduct manufacturing scale up, expanded clinical and nonclinical testing, and assay qualification and validation efforts.  These efforts will support Biological Licensure Application (BLA) submission to the FDA and licensure of a filovirus vaccine.

PLAGUE VACCINE (VAC PLG)

The Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) phase included the manufacture of candidate current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) lots, animal safety testing, and initial clinical trials.  During this phase, the vaccine was evaluated for safety and immunogenicity in a small human clinical trial (Phase 1).  In order to reduce technical program risk in the Plague vaccine program, the program office conducted competitive prototyping between a US vaccine candidate and a United Kingdom vaccine candidate.  During the 2008 Resource Allocation Decision, the US Plague Vaccine candidate was selected for development through licensure under a Prime System Contract.  The Prime System Contractor (Dynport Vaccine Company/DVC LLC, Frederick MD) currently functions as the FDA regulatory sponsor and performs all ancillary, regulatory, quality assurance, and data management as required by the FDA.  A Project Arrangement is in place with the United Kingdom and Canada.  During the Engineering Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase, the prime contractor stabilized the vaccine formulation, validated the manufacturing process and testing protocols, optimized the delivery systems and manufactured consistency lots.  Phase 2 clinical trials were performed and provided additional safety data.  The remaining efforts to be conducted during the EMD phase include the Phase 3 clinical trial to demonstrate safety in an expanded volunteer population and evaluation of efficacy and duration of protection in pivotal animal studies to satisfy FDA requirements for the Animal Rule .  The Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) decision will be conducted after the manufacturing process has been validated and consistency lots have been produced.  A Biologics License Application will be submitted to the FDA with all clinical, nonclinical, and manufacturing data.  The FDA grants licensure to products that are determined to be safe and efficacious.  Currently, the Phase 3 clinical trial has been delayed about 12-14 months due to new guidance from the FDA that all documentation concerning vaccine production (large scale engineering and consistency lot manufacturing) and formulation and Fill/Finish (vialing) must be completed and approved prior to the start of the Phase 3 clinical trial.  This was normally done concurrently with the Phase 3 clinical trial.

SPECIAL IMMUNIZATION PROGRAM (VAC SIP)

The SIP effort Life Cycle Cost Estimate (LCCE) manages the IND vaccines which provide additional protection to laboratory workers performing research on the infectious agents for Tularemia, Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE), Western Equine Encephalitis (WEE), Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis (VEE), and Q-Fever.  Efforts include Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) storage and periodic potency testing to support the FDA regulated Investigational New Drug (IND) reporting requirements.  This Department of Defense program supports the Federal interagency with this effort, as well as academic and industry partners.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

This project supports efforts in the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase of the acquisition strategy for prophylactic, pre-treatment, and therapeutic drugs and diagnostic medical devices for the protection, treatment, detection, and medical management of chemical warfare agent exposures.  Project provides for the research and development of safety studies, manufacturing scale-up, process validation, drug interaction, performance test, and submission of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) drug licensure application(s).  This program currently includes: (1) Alternative Autoinjector (AUTOINJ), which consists of investigating an FDA approved alternative source(s), beyond the single current DoD source, for autoinjectors that deliver DoD nerve agent antidote and treatment capabilities to the warfighter; mitigates capability fielding and operational readiness risks.  This resulted from the manufacturing and quality issues for the Advanced Anticonvulsant System (AAS) program, Midazolam in an autoinjector.  (2) Bioscavenger (BSCAV), a new capability, to be used as a prophylaxis against nerve agents; (3) Improved Nerve Agent Treatment System (INATS) an enhanced nerve agent treatment regimen consisting of an improved oxime to replace the current fielded oxime 2-pralidoxime chloride (2-PAM), a centrally acting therapeutic to increase survival, and studies to generate data to support use of pyridostigmine bromide (PB), as a pretreatment for nerve agents in addition to soman.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>ALTERNATE AUTOINJECTOR MANUFACTURER CAPABILITY (AUTOINJ)

The Alternative Autoinjector Investigation will identify an alternative source(s) to develop, and provide required and FDA approved autoinjector-delivered nerve agent antidote and treatment capabilities to the services.  Currently, a single DoD source provides all of these capabilities, and should that single source experience manufacturing or quality issues, the services may not meet their operational requirements.  This effort leverages previous work begun under the Advanced Anticonvulsant System (AAS) autoinjector-delivered product wherein the single manufacturer notified the AAS program office that the FDA had noted manufacturing and quality issues which impacted the AAS program as well as all other DoD autoinjector-delivered nerve agent antidotes and treatments.  At that time, the AAS program began investigating alternative sources through the release of a request for Information (RFI).  Subsequent to the RFI, the AAS program awarded a task order under an existing IDIQ contract vehicle to begin the identification efforts.  As this issue is well beyond the scope of the AAS program and impacts all developmental and fielded autoinjector-delivered capabilities, the Joint Program Executive Office, Chemical and Biological Defense (JPEO-CBD) approved the strategy to expand the alternative autoinjector effort beyond AAS, thus initiating a new effort benefiting both fielded and developmental capabilities.  The JPEO-CBD also approved the management and oversight of the effort via a series of In-Process Reviews (IPRs).  The effort will proceed through the submission of a New Drug Application and will culminate with FDA approval of an alternative autoinjector source(s).

ADVANCED ANTICONVULSANT SYSTEM (AAS)

The Advanced Anticonvulsant System, consists of Midazolam in an autoinjector for treatment of nerve agent induced seizures.  Midazolam, injected intramuscularly, will treat traditional nerve agent and non-traditional agent-induced seizures and prevent subsequent neurological damage.  Midazolam is more water-soluble than diazepam (the currently fielded medication to control nerve agent-induced seizures) and terminates nerve agent-induced seizures more quickly than diazepam.  AAS will not eliminate the need for other protective and therapeutic systems.

A contractor shall be responsible for conducting activities associated with drug development in a manner consistent with eventual approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  The contractor shall sponsor the drug to the FDA and hold all approvals and/or licenses.  During the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) Phase, large scale manufacturing, Phase 2 human clinical safety studies and definitive animal efficacy studies will be conducted.  FDA approval of the countermeasure is an exit criterion for the SDD phase.  During the Production and Deployment Phase, sufficient quantities of product to meet Initial Operational Capability will be purchased.  Subsequent purchases will be made by the Defense Logistics Agency.  Any post-marketing surveillance requested by the FDA will be the responsibility of the contractor.

In addition, the program will assess the viability of establishing an alternative manufacturing capability for currently fielded autoinjectors used for therapeutic treatment and medical management of chemical warfare agent exposures.

BIOSCAVENGER (BSCAV)

Used a serial evaluation of candidates to achieve competitive prototyping in the Technology Development Phase which culminated in a down-select decision.  The Bioscavenger program issued a Request For Proposal (RFP) to select the best value for the government for a prophylaxis to support an initial limited user group.  During the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) phase the program will continue to exercise management oversight with system integration support of a commercial partner to ensure that manufacturing of the product is in accordance with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations and guidelines.  The RFP for product manufacturing includes options for transition to the Medical Countermeasures Initiative (MCMI) Advanced Development and Manufacturing (ADM) capability.  Prior to FDA licensure, a commercial partner will perform a Phase 2 human clinical safety study, definitive animal efficacy studies, and toxicology studies.  The system integrator will also develop and manufacture a product formulation and delivery system and will submit a New Drug Application and seek FDA approval.  The SDD phase will culminate in FDA licensure of the Bioscavenger.  During the Production and Deployment phase, the Bioscavenger program, in conjunction with a commercial partner, will pursue full rate production and conduct any FDA-mandated post-marketing surveillance studies.  Concurrently the Bioscavenger program will conduct an analysis of alternative manufacturing technologies, investigate additional product indications, and pursue an expanded force prophylaxis once alternate technologies have matured.

IMPROVED NERVE AGENT TREATMENT SYSTEM (INATS)

INATS' evolutionary Acquisition Strategy was recently expanded to (1) align all Department of Defense nerve agent therapeutics under it, and to (2) insert a centrally-acting (CA) anticholinergic agent, employs an incremental approach to provide independent, and more rapid deliveries of oxime, expanded PB indications, and CA capabilities than in a combined treatment regimen delivery.  To accomplish this, separate Milestones B and C reviews were originally scheduled for the oxime and CA development efforts.  However after decision briefings to the Milestone Decision Authority and discussions with the Joint Services, MCS-CDP will conduct combined Milestone B and C reviews for the oxime and CA development efforts and decision reviews for PB expansion beyond the combined-development Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TM&amp;RR) Phase.  In the TM&amp;RR phase, close collaborations will occur between the Joint Program Manager - Medical Countermeasure Systems (JPM-MCS)), and the science/ technology, and user communities to assess technical viability, capability delivery options, and to refine operational concepts; the Government will be the systems integrator overseeing the conduct of oxime and centrally acting formulation development efforts, nonclinical toxicology and efficacy studies, clinical safety studies, and efficacy studies addressing the PB indication.  In the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase for the oxime and CA each capability, the Government will engage with commercial partners to ensure that INATS development and manufacture is in accordance with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations and guidelines; the commercial partner(s) will perform a Phase 2 human clinical safety study, nonclinical toxicology studies and definitive animal efficacy studies; the system integrator will also oversee the manufacture of improved oxime and CA formulations and delivery system that is stable under operationally relevant temperatures.  The system integrator will submit a New Drug Application and seek FDA approval for the INATS product.  In the Production and Deployment (P&amp;D) Phase, the Government will pursue full-rate and stockpile production, conduct any FDA mandated post-marketing surveillance studies, and will transfer contracting/logistical responsibilities to the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) while remaining to monitor program performance through disposal as the life-cycle manager.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

TESS test infrastructure products are aligned in two groups to include: (1) Laboratory; (2) Field.

(1) Laboratory: The products for this area are the Non-Traditional Agent Defense Test System (NTADTS) and improvements to the Dynamic Test Chamber (DTC).  The NTADTS provides a new capability to conduct chemical defense testing against current and emerging threat agents.  The NTADTS supports testing of decontamination, collective protection, individual protection, and contamination avoidance products.  The DTC provides a new capability for testing chemical point detection systems against chemical warfare agents in various environmental conditions.  The CBD acquisition programs supported are Dismounted Reconnaissance Sets Kits and Outfits (DR SKO), Next Generation Chemical Detector (NGCD), Joint Sensitive Equipment Wipes (JSEW), and Common Analytical Laboratory System (CALS).  Future efforts will include the development of test methods and methodologies for additional classes of agents.

(2) Field: The products for this area are the Test Grid, the Mobile Test Infrastructure (MTI), the Joint Ambient Breeze Tunnel (JABT) and the Active Standoff Chamber (ASC).  The Test Grid effort provides a fully instrumented grid for chemical and biological simulant field test capabilities that integrate referee systems; dissemination equipment; real-time cloud tracking capability; meteorological equipment; a wireless network; and a Data Management System (DMS) software to track and display the cloud health and status of all of the equipment in the network anywhere in Dugway Proving Ground (DPG).  The MTI is an all-inclusive mobile management service functioning wirelessly.  MTI is capable of integrating, controlling, commanding and managing all assets required to conduct transportable testing.  It provides algorithms and graphical user interfaces for automating real-time visualization, raw data, computation, hosts data collection and indefinite storage that can go to any Major Range Test Facility Base (MRTFB) for CB Testing.  The JABT and ASC improvements will provide a tech refresh to existing infrastructure and allow for test results to be integrated into the Test Grid Data Management System (DMS).  The CBD acquisition programs supported are the Joint Expeditionary Collective Protection (JECP), Next Generation Chemical Detector (NGCD), Joint Biological Tactical Detection System (JBTDS), and the Joint USFK Point and Integrated Threat Recognition (JUPITR) Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Budget Activity includes research, development, testing and evaluation management support for the Department of Defense (DoD) Chemical and Biological Defense Program (CBDP).

Program Element 0605384BP supports Joint Doctrine and Training (Project DT6), sustains the technical test capability at West Desert Test Center (WDTC) (Project DW6); sustains the core Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&amp;T) laboratory infrastructure (Project LS6), provides for program management and financial management support (Project MS6), and supports the Joint Concept Development and Experimentation (JCDE) program (Project O49).  

The Joint Training and Doctrine Support (DT6) project supports the development of Joint Doctrine and Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) for developing CB defense systems.  This project also supports CB modeling and simulation to support the Warfighter.

The Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB) is a set of test installations, facilities, and ranges which are regarded as "national assets".  These assets are sized, operated, and maintained primarily for DoD test and evaluation missions.  However, the MRTFB facilities and ranges are also available to commercial and other users on a reimbursable basis.  WDTC is designated as the primary element of the MRTFB to primarily conduct CB Defense test and evaluation.  The DW6 Project provides operating support to WDTC to ensure that DoD test customers are only charged direct costs of testing and that overhead expenses are centrally funded.  It finances the required institutional test operating costs.  Institutional test operating costs include institutional civilian and contractor labor; repair and maintenance of test instrumentation, equipment, and facilities; and replacement of test equipment.

The Laboratory Support (LS6) project includes laboratory infrastructure to maintain and enhance DoD infrastructure capabilities to counter an expanding threat space, exploit advances in technology; and develop and transition CB defense equipment and countermeasures to the Warfighter.

The management support (MS6) project, provides management support for the DoD CBDP to allow program overview and integration of overall medical and non-medical programs by the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Nuclear, Chemical, and Biological Defense Programs (ASD(NCB)), through the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Chemical Biological Defense Programs (DATSD(CBD)); funds management by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA); Development, coordination, and approval of joint CBRND requirements, management of multi-service and joint CBRND doctrine, tactics, techniques and procedures; training, leader development, education, exercises, and development of the CBDP Program Objective Memorandum (POM) by the Joint Requirements Office; Joint RDA planning, input to the Annual Report to Congress and Program Objective Memorandum (POM) development by the Program Analysis and Integration Office (PAIO); review of Joint plans and the consolidated CB Defense POM Strategy by Army in its Executive Agent role.  

The management support project also includes the Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) Executive mission to establish test infrastructure investment strategy and adequate testing for Developmental Testing (DT) and Operational Testing (OT) of Department of Defense (DoD) Chemical Biological Defense (CBD) systems and components throughout the systems' acquisition life cycle, as required in the RDA Plan under the Joint Test Infrastructure Working Group (JTIWG) program.  The JTIWG program includes T&amp;E Early Involvement, test threat planning, Fielded Equipment Assessments, T&amp;E studies, and T&amp;E Standards planning and development to support testing the CBD systems for all services to include radiological, nuclear, medical T&amp;E efforts.  

The Joint Concept Development and Experimentation (O49) project supports the planning, conduct, evaluation, and reporting on Joint tests (for other than developmental hardware) and accomplishment of operational research assessments in support of requirements received from the Services and the Combatant Commanders for already fielded equipment and systems.

This Budget Activity also provides for Program Element 0605502BP, which supports the Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) program.  The overall objective of the CBD SBIR program is to improve the transition or transfer of innovative CBD technologies between DoD components and the private sector for mutual benefit.  The CBD program includes those technology efforts that maximize a strong defensive posture in a CB environment using passive and active means as deterrents.  These technologies include CB detection; information assessment (identification, modeling, and intelligence); contamination avoidance; and protection of both individual soldiers and equipment.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Project provides overhead (institutional) funding required to operate WDTC in compliance with Section 232 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for FY03 (Public Law 107-314 - December 2002).

WDTC is the reliance center for all DoD CB defense testing and provides the United States' only combined range, chamber, toxic chemical lab, and bio-safety level-3 (BSL-3) test facility. Total institutional test operating costs are to be provided by the OSD Chemical and Biological Defense Program IAW Program Budget Decision 250 (1996).

WDTC uses state-of-the-art chemical and life sciences test facilities and test chambers to perform CB defense testing of protective gear, decontamination systems, detectors, equipment, and non-materiel CB defense solutions while maintaining safety, security, and surety of chemical agents and biological pathogens.  WDTC also provides test ranges, to include fully instrumented outdoor ranges, for TTPD activities and testing with simulants that can be correlated to the laboratory testing with live agents to ensure reliable and repeatable data is generated to support acquisition decisions of CB defense equipment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The SBIR Program is a Congressionally mandated program established to increase the participation of small business in federal research and development (R&amp;D).  Currently, each participating Government agency must reserve 2.5% of its extramural R&amp;D for SBIR awards to competing small businesses.  The goal of the SBIR Program is to invest in the innovative capabilities of the small business community to help meet Government R&amp;D objectives while allowing small companies to develop technologies and products which they can then commercialize through sales back to the Government or in the private sector.

The Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Program like SBIR, is a Government-wide program, mandated by the Small Business Research and Development Enhancement Act of 1992, PL 102-564.  STTR was established in FY94 as a three-year pilot program.  In early 1996, the General Accounting Office (GAO) conducted a comprehensive review of the Government-wide STTR Program to determine the effectiveness of the pilot program.  Upon review of the GAO report, Congress voted to reauthorize the STTR Program to the year 2000, consistent with the authorization period for the SBIR Program.

STTR was established as a companion program to the SBIR Program and is executed in essentially the same manner; however, there are several distinct differences.  The STTR Program provides a mechanism for participation by university, Federally-Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), and other non-profit research institutions.  Specifically, the STTR Program is designed to provide an incentive for small companies and research at academic institutions and non-profit research and development institutions to work together to move emerging technical ideas from the laboratory to the marketplace to foster high-tech economic development and to advance U.S. economic competitiveness.  Each STTR proposal must be submitted by a team which includes a small business (as the prime contractor for contracting purposes) and at least one research institution, which have entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement for the purposes of the STTR effort.  Furthermore, the project must be divided up such that the small business performs at least 40% of the work and the research institution(s) performs at least 30% of the work.  The remainder of the work may be performed by either party or a third party.  The budget is separate from the SBIR budget and is significantly smaller (0.15% of the extramural R&amp;D budget vs.  2.5% for the SBIR Program).

The DoD has consolidated management and oversight of the CBDP into a single office within the OSD.  The Army was designated as the Executive Agent for coordination and integration of the Chemical and Biological Defense (CBD) program.  The executive agent for the SBIR/STTR portion of the program is the Army Research Office-Washington.

The overall objective of the CBD SBIR/STTR program is to improve the transition or transfer of innovative CBD technologies between DoD components and the private sector for mutual benefit.  The CBD program includes those technology efforts that maximize a strong defensive posture in a biological or chemical environment using passive and active means as deterrents.  These technologies include chemical and biological detection; information assessment, which includes identification, modeling, and intelligence; contamination avoidance; and protection of both individual soldiers and equipment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear Dismounted Reconnaissance Systems (CBRN DRS) program uses a government-off-the-shelf (GOTS)/commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) non-developmental item (NDI) single step acquisition approach to full capability.  This strategy employs an NDI acquisition concept to establish a simplified management framework to translate mission needs and emerging technology capabilities into a stable, affordable, and well-managed acquisition program.  CBRN DRS systems will be produced using a workshare approach between Organic assets and Contractor workforce.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

In FY17-18, this funding will develop a leakage test capability that will allow the Warfighter to validate the integrity of collective protection / Filtration systems.  In FY17-19, this funding will also integrate newly developed filtration material into existing M98 filter sets.  These new filters will provide the Warfighter with improved protection against toxic industrial chemicals and toxic industrial materials while maintaining performance characteristics against Chemical Warfare Agents and meeting military standards.  Additionally, these improvements can serve a dual purpose by providing improvements to other Collective Protection Systems such as the Chemical and Biological Protective Shelter, Shipboard Collective Protection Systems, Fixed Site Collective Protection Systems, M20A1 Simplified Collective Protection Equipment, and the Collectively Protected Field Hospitals.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Strategy based on evolutionary development, based on a family of systems approach.  After MS B, awarded competitive Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF) contract to Science Applications International Corporation (now Leidos) in 2008 to build prototypes subjected to robust engineering developmental testing and Operational Assessment during the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase.  After MS C, awarded a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) option to Leidos in September 2013 for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) systems to support formal Developmental Testing (DT) and Multi-Service Operational Test &amp; Evaluation (MOT&amp;E) events.  In addition, a Fixed Price Incentive Firm Target (FPIF) option was awarded to Leidos in January 2014 to perform non-recurring engineering (NRE) and logistic product development associated with the LRIP system configurations.  A post MS C Milestone Decision Authority Acquisition Decision Memorandum, dated March 2014, separated the program into two phases.  Phase two systems will be developed as engineering changes to phase one systems.  A business case analysis (BCA) will be conducted to determine the best strategy for full rate production.  Following a successful Full Rate Production (FRP) decision for phase one systems implement recommendations from the BCA.  Phase two systems will undergo limited developmental and operational testing and then pursue a MS C full rate production decision.  BA7 funding develops incremental improvements to fielded systems.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

The JSGPM Advanced Respiratory Protection Initiative (ARPI) effort is using the two M61 filter contracts awarded to 3M and Avon to develop improved filters for the JSGPM.  There is a continual technology refreshment CLIN on both contracts that allow for filter development tasks to be awarded.  The tasks can be competed between the two awardees or awarded to both to ensure competition on future spares and delivery orders.  As filter technologies transition from the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) and Joint Science and Technology Office (JSTO), the technologies will be matured from system/subsystem prototyping demonstration technologies at Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 to actual system "mission proven" through successful mission operations in a mission environment at TRL 9.  In addition to the maturing of the technology, the Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL) of the media and the layered bed design requires maturing to an MRL level 9.  The complexity of maturing all these different items requires an evolutionary approach with one prototype iteration governing the approach on the next iteration.  With the criticality of the filter, the production transition to the new improved filter has to be done with a high degree of confidence with risks mitigated to a low level.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project provides for the upgrade and modernization of fielded Information Systems including the Joint Effects Model (JEM) and the Joint Warning and Reporting Network (JWARN).  This project also provides for the Software Support Activity (SSA).

Efforts included in this project are: (1) Joint Effects Model (JEM); (2) the Joint Warning and Reporting Network (JWARN); and (3) Software Support Activity (SSA).

JEM and JWARN utilize the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) Manual prescribed Information Technology Box (IT Box) construct for managing requirements for the follow-on increments of capability development.  The "IT Box" is an acquisition approach and methodology regarding how software systems should be developed and fielded.  It is a process that differs from the way DoD acquires hardware systems.  The acquisition approach uses the Information Systems Initial Capabilities Document (IS ICD) to describe the required operational capabilities for the entire development effort.  These overarching requirements are further broken out into Requirements Definition Packages (RDPs) released over the life of the product instead of a single Capability Development Document released early in the program.  "Agile Software Development", a term used frequently through the JPM IS R forms, is a set of industry standard software development methods used in conjunction with the IT Box framework.  Agile Software Development promotes adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, continuous improvement, and encourages rapid and flexible response to change.  The Agile methodology is an alternative to traditional program management, typically used in software development.  It helps teams respond to unpredictability through incremental, iterative work cadences, known as sprints.  Agile methodologies are an alternative to waterfall, or traditional sequential development.  

IT Box enables programs to tailor the incrementally fielded software program model in the DODI 5000.02 Interim to conduct multiple, more frequent fielding events in lieu of a single fielding event.  Programs conduct a single Milestone B (MSB) decision by the Milestone Decision Authority that covers the entire program.  MS B is followed by a series of supporting Build Decisions (BDs) associated with each RDP as they are released.  The supporting BDs will ensure incorporation of mature technology and development efforts culminating in incremental deliveries of capability to Joint and Service Command and Control (C2) architectures.  Instead of a single Milestone C decision and fielding event for one increment, the program will return to the MDA for more frequent fielding decisions, as often as annually, as portions of capability are determined suitable and operationally effective.  These multiple fielding efforts are based on providing capabilities with the most value to the operators based on Warfighter priorities/needs, maturation of the technology being incorporated and available resources supporting the effort.  

The Software Support Activity (SSA) is a Chem-Bio Defense user developmental support and service organization to facilitate net-centric interoperability of systems in acquisition for the Warfighter.  The SSA provides the CBRN Warfighter with Joint Service solutions for Cybersecurity/Information Assurance (CS/IA),Integrated Architectures, Data Management/Modeling, Interoperability Certifications, Verification, Validation and Accreditation (VV&amp;A) to support interoperable and integrated net-centric, service-oriented solutions for CBRN systems.  The SSA emphasizes development of reference implementations to guide Government and industry system and software developers to ensure that their products meet common interoperability standards.  The latest technologies/products include the definition of a Common CBRN Sensor Integration Standard (CCSI) and the CBRN Data Model.  These technologies and direct enablers for the development of CBRN integrated sensor networks and the dissemination of CBRN information across all users.  The SSA directly supports Chemical and Biological Defense Program (CBDP) initiatives by providing common service oriented architectures and frameworks for the collection and dissemination of Bio-Surveillance and other critical CBRN information.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

JEM Increment 2 acquisition will utilize the JROC's "IT Box" construct for software development.  The intent is to provide the next generation of capability with current and future technologies, as stated in the IS ICD, in less time and fielding products to the service more frequently than an incremental delivery approach.

As part of this strategy, JEM program office developed and issued a competitive prototyping contract in April 2013 where two offerers were given the same Technical Data Package (TDP), performance Work Statement (PWS), and software requirements and were tasked to deliver a JEM prototype that implements the CCMI architecture.  This competitive prototyping strategy was successful and a single JEM integrator, General Dynamics Information Technology (GDIT), was selected as the prime development contract in December 2013. 

The current contractor for JEM 2.0 will provide all capabilities defined in the Requirement Definition Package 1 (RDP-1) document.  The JRO will release RDPs-2, 3, and 4 over the next three years prior to contract completion.  It is anticipated when the contract is re-competed in FY17 that there will be four of five capability drops not yet developed under RDP-2 and two of five under RDP-3.  The follow-on contract in FY17 will include scope for developing the remaining capabilities under the JEM 2.0 contract.  The JEM follow-on contract will utilize full and open competition and will be referred to as the JEM development, modernization and sustainment contract.

The JEM IS ICD describes the notional implementation plan for fielding of future JEM capabilities among five separate JEM Requirement Definition Packages (RDPs).  RDP-1 contains the baseline capabilities for software and was approved in June of 2014.  Since last report, the numbering scheme for RDPs was rearranged to account for the sequence of approval for each RDP.  RDP-2 now defines requirements to integrate baseline capabilities into a version that can be fielded on service C2 systems will be released in RDP-2.  RDP-2 will be released following RDP-1 to rapidly allow baseline capabilities to be incorporated into C2 systems.  RDP-3 is a notional package that allows the Science and Technology community a venue to use the JEM program to develop a version of the product for S&amp;T and analytical use.  Capabilities that are only required for the Science and Technology and analytical communities and not for operational users would be implemented in RDP-3.  Capabilities in RDP-3 would not be required to go to Operational Test, as they would not be fielded to operational users.  RDP-4 will be released after the completion of RDP-1.  This RDP will incorporate emerging capabilities that have reached a sufficient maturity for incorporation into the operationally fielded JEM system, such as ability to model new agents.  RDP-5 was added as a mechanism to define requirements for JEM 2.0 through the remainder of its life cycle.

RDP 1 - Baseline Capabilities: There are 5 planned Capability Drops (CD) within RDP 1. 
RDP 2 - C2 Integration: There are 8 planned Capability Drops (CD) within RDP 2 tied to all the various Strategic and Service C2 Systems
RDP 3 - Analytical Support: There are 2 planned Capability Drops (CD) within RDP 3.
RDP 4 - Emerging Capabilities: There are 5 planned Capability Drops (CD) within RDP 4.
RDP 5 - Modernization and Sustainment: There are 2 Capability Drops (CD) planned per year through the life of the program.

An over-arching MS B and Build Decision for RDP-1 were approved by the MDA in September 2014.  Each subsequent RDP will have an associated Build Decision.  Each CD will have an associated fielding decision.

JOINT WARNING &amp; REPORTING NETWORK (JWARN)

JWARN Increment 2 utilizes the JROC's "IT Box" construct for software requirements management and development.  The intent is to provide the next generation of capability with current and future technologies, as stated in the IS ICD, in less time and away from an incremental delivery approach.  This effort is being executed under a Cost-Plus-Award Term Incentive structure to gain maximum benefit to the Government in maintaining the fielded baseline and future software capability development and was awarded under a full and open competition Request for Proposal (RFP).  The JWARN Program will procure a Sensor Connectivity Capability (SCC) (hardware materiel solution) in order to facilitate the transfer of CBRN sensor information from legacy CBRN sensors to DoD networks.  This solution will be external to the CBRN Sensors and Service-identified network transmission device(s).

SOFTWARE SUPPORT ACTIVITY (SSA)

The SSA provides enterprise-wide services and coordination across all CBDP programs that contain data or software, or are capable of linking to the Global Information Grid (GIG).  The SSA facilitates interoperability, integration, and supportability of existing and developing IT and National Security Systems (NSS).  This will be followed by coordination to facilitate the concepts of interoperability, integration and supportability of enterprise-wide services.  Next follows work with user communities to develop and demonstrate enterprise-wide common architectures, products and services.  The SSA will support the application of the enterprise-wide architectures, products and services into the programs, with verification of compliance with the defined products and services.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project provides for the upgrade and modernization of fielded Medical Biological defense equipment/systems including the Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS) and Next Generation Diagnostic Systems (NGDS) suite.  

JBAIDS is a commercial off-the-shelf development/production effort started in August 2003 that focused on rapid development and fielding efforts to deliver a critical capability to identify bacterial and viral agents in environmental surveillance and clinical specimen sample types.  By 2005, 16 biological warfare (BW) agent surveillance detection kits were fielded along with the first JBAIDS in vitro diagnostic (IVD) assay cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  JBAIDS currently has seven IVD kits cleared by the FDA, JBAIDS achieved full operational capability (340 systems delivered all Services) in July 2011.  JBAIDS efforts in 2012-2015 focused on adding surveillance food and water pathogen detection assays as well as initiating laptop retrofit and fielding.  JBAIDS efforts in FY16 will focus on completing the laptop fielding and continue to develop pre-Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) packages annually for FDA review.  JBAIDS efforts in FY17 will focus on sustainment and additional pre-EUA's.  This project will be used to oversee the configuration management of the system to include the conduct of annual software security information assurance (IA) updates on fielded software and monitor analyzer/laptop parts obsolescence.


The NGDS is an evolutionary acquisition family of systems to provide increments of capability over time across many echelons of the Combat Health Support System.  The mission of the NGDS is to provide Chemical, Biological and Radiological (CBR) threat and infectious disease identification and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared diagnostics to inform individual patient treatment as defined in the approved NGDS Capabilities Development Document (CDD) and CBR situational awareness and disease surveillance as defined in the Common Analytical Laboratory (CALS) CDD.  NGDS Increment 1 will significantly improve diagnostic capability for deployable combat health support units (Role 3) while also improving operational suitability and affordability by developing FDA cleared biological warfare agent (BWA) and infectious disease in vitro diagnostic (IVD) assays on existing commercial diagnostic device with a well established FDA regulatory history and pipeline of commercial non-BWA infectious disease diagnostic tests.  The NGDS Increment 1 program has a streamlined MS A to MS C - Limited Deployment acquisition strategy.  BA7 will be used to complete the development of assays initiated during the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) phase and needed for JBAIDS replacement as well as fund the development of three objective assays (Burkholderia, Alpha Virus, and Orthopox).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>JOINT BIO AGENT IDENT AND DIAG SYSTEM (JBAIDS)

JBAIDS is a commercial off-the-shelf capability to identify multiple biological agents and other pathogens of operations concern, to include environmental and FDA cleared in vitro diagnostic assays.  JBAIDS also has pre-positioned Emergency Use Authorizations assays for the identification of low probability, high consequence pathogens in clinical samples that can be deployed in the event of a declared health emergency.  The program plans to conduct the annual JBAIDS Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) software compliance certification in addition to any logistics sustainment issues associated with parts obsolescence.  The JBAIDS program will begin to prepare for the Risk Management Framework processes for FY16 information assurance.  Additionally, the JBAIDS program office continues to partner with the US Army Medical Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), other DoD and US Government laboratories to develop FDA Pre-Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) packages for biological warfare agents (BWA's) that could be used as biological warfare threats to DoD military forces.

NEXT GENERATION DIAGNOSTICS SYSTEM (NGDS)

The NGDS Increment 1 program has a streamlined MS A to MS C - Limited Deployment acquisition strategy.  The NGDS Increment 1 is intended to replace the legacy Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS) beginning in FY17.  NGDS Increment 2 will complement NGDS Increment 1 by developing diagnostic capabilities for biological pathogens and toxins and address diagnostics for chemical and radiological exposures, and to provide capability to lower echelons of care.

NGDS Increment 2 will conduct technology development FY14-FY16 prior to MS B.  The acquisition strategy and capability to be developed will be informed by the results of the Analysis of Alternatives to be completed 4QFY14.  NGDS Increment 2 is intended to be complementary to NGDS Increment 1 to expand the breadth and depth of diagnostics to CBR threats, pre-symptomatic diagnostics, and far forward echelons of care.

The MB7 program will support development, testing, and FDA approval of additional assays after system fielding.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
