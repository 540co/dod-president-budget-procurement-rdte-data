                                    <r2:ProgramElementNote>The National Security Science and Engineering Faculty Fellowship (NSSEFF) program is realigned from the National Defense Education Program (NDEP), program element (PE) 0601120D8Z, to this PE beginning in FY 2015.

This program element (PE) incorporates Minerva Research Initiative activities, which include university-led basic research in social science and sponsored research faculty chair positions at defense education institutions, and activities to implement the basic research office strategic plan for the Department of Defense (DoD).</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Basic research provides the DoD with a deep and broad awareness of current directions in science and engineering through the scientific performers in areas of research that are important to U.S. military capabilities including, among others, physics and the physical sciences, materials science, chemistry and chemical engineering, electrical engineering, applied mathematics, computer science, mechanical and aerodynamic engineering, ocean sciences, biological sciences, and the social sciences.  Basic research sustains scientific and engineering communities in areas that form the critical technical underpinnings of DoD capabilities.  Basic research through exploration and discovery provides the unique means for disruptive non-incremental advances that can improve or radically change military capabilities, strategy, and operations. 

The Minerva Research Initiative is a university-based social science basic research program directed from within the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and executed by the Services, consistent with the January 2012 priorities document "Sustaining U.S. Global Leadership: Priorities for 21st Century Defense" and the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) requirements.  This program seeks to build a deeper understanding of the social, cultural, and political forces that shape regions of the world of strategic importance to the United States.  Deeper understanding of the cultural and political environments where threats, such as radical actors and regime disruptions, develop supports more effective strategic and operational policy decisions.

The Strategic Support for Basic Research (SSBR) program funds initiatives to implement the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD(R&amp;E)) strategic plan for defense basic research.  This plan defines specific and quantifiable actions to help create conditions for defense basic research investments capable of creating high-payoff, transformative scientific breakthroughs for DoD.  The SSBR initiatives support the five aims of: (1) providing scientific leadership; (2) attracting the Nation’s best Scientists and Engineers (S&amp;Es); (3) ensuring the coherence and balance of the Basic Research portfolio; (4) fostering connections between DoD performers and DoD; and (5) improving the efficiency of the defense research business environment.

The National Security Science and Engineering Faculty Fellowship (NSSEFF) program supports world-class researchers in scientific areas of critical importance to DoD and ensures the cultivation of exceptional talent.  NSSEFF provides a critical resource for connections between academia and the DoD science and engineering enterprise.  Fellows’ work spans all seven DoD S&amp;T priorities and defines a broad set of emerging scientific areas.  Fellows serve as speakers at DoD events, reviewers on panels for DoD science, and as collaborators with DoD laboratory scientists and engineers.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Basic research provides the DoD with a deep and broad awareness of current directions in science and engineering through the scientific performers in areas of research that are important to U.S. military capabilities including, among others, physics and the physical sciences, materials science, chemistry and chemical engineering, electrical engineering, applied mathematics, computer science, mechanical and aerodynamic engineering, ocean sciences, biological sciences, and the social sciences.  Basic research sustains scientific and engineering communities in areas that form the critical technical underpinnings of DoD capabilities.  Basic research through exploration and discovery provides the unique means for disruptive non-incremental advances that can improve or radically change military capabilities, strategy, and operations. 

The Minerva Research Initiative is a university-based social science basic research program directed from within the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and executed by the Services, consistent with the January 2012 priorities document "Sustaining U.S. Global Leadership: Priorities for 21st Century Defense" and the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) requirements.  This program seeks to build a deeper understanding of the social, cultural, and political forces that shape regions of the world of strategic importance to the United States.  

The Strategic Support for Basic Research (SSBR) program funds initiatives to implement the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD(R&amp;E)) strategic plan for defense basic research.  This plan defines specific and quantifiable actions to help create conditions for defense basic research investments capable of creating high-payoff, transformative scientific breakthroughs for DoD.  The SSBR initiatives support the five aims of (1) providing scientific leadership; (2) attracting the Nation’s best Scientists and Engineers (S&amp;Es); (3) ensuring the coherence and balance of the Basic Research portfolio; (4) fostering connections between DoD performers and DoD; and (5) improving the efficiency of the defense research business environment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The Minerva Research Fellows program is being restructured to more effectively build in-house social science capabilities and better connect social science research insights to current and future defense leadership at professional military education institutions (PMEs) and elsewhere. An ongoing pilot program has been designed to augment existing institutional resources rather than funding new research faculty by enabling activities such as PME curriculum development, new academic-government exchange opportunities, and research-informed tabletop exercises.</r2:Text>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The National Defense Education Program (NDEP) engages the full science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) continuum to ensure the Department of Defense (DoD) will have access to high-quality STEM personnel vital to national defense now and in the future.  STEM degree production compared to U.S. employment projections show that there is likely to be a significant shortage of STEM professionals, especially in computing, information technology, and electronics engineering, DoD mission critical occupations for which NDEP’s continuum of initiatives provides a pool of exceptional talent.  NDEP’s portfolio provides short, medium, and long-term solutions to the perfect storm of workforce challenges, which include: (1) impending retirement of 33 percent of DoD’s STEM workforce; (2) low college readiness rate and interest in STEM majors; and (3) challenges that DoD, like other Federal employers, face in recruiting and retaining high-quality STEM talent in a competitive environment.

NDEP aligns to the DoD Science and Technology (S&amp;T) priorities and the integrated STEM/Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Institutions (HBCU/MIs) program, synchronized with the Federal 5-Year STEM Strategic Plan, the DoD STEM Strategic and Implementation Plans and the DoD Strategic Workforce Plan (in progress).  NDEP components engage in assessment and evaluation as required by the Office of Management and Budget and the Government Accountability Office.

Science, Mathematics, and Research for Transformation (SMART) awards highly competitive scholarships-for-service to undergraduate and graduate students in 19 academic STEM disciplines and moves graduates directly into DoD's workforce following graduation.  Internships engage SMART scholars in hands-on, authentic research and work experiences in DoD facilities, thereby enhancing their educational experience and building a public service commitment to the Department’s mission.  Since its inception as a pilot program in FY 2005, SMART has supported ~1,455 students from bachelor to doctoral levels and to date ~900 have completed program studies and transitioned into the DoD workforce.  SMART ensures that DoD has a steady infusion of high-quality U.S. technical talent, prepared in areas of critical importance to DoD, ready to apply their technical knowledge, skills, and abilities to fulfill DoD’s mission. 

National Security Science and Engineering Faculty Fellowship (NSSEFF) currently supports 29 world-class researchers (NSSEFF Fellows) in scientific areas of critical importance to DoD and ensures the cultivation of exceptional future talent.  The NSSEFF Fellows work with ~100 undergraduate students, ~270 graduate students, and ~150 post-doctoral scholars at their respective academic institutions.  Three cohorts of NSSEFF Fellows, with the first selected in FY 2008, provides a critical resource for connections between academia and the DoD science and engineering enterprise. Fellows’ work spans all seven DoD S&amp;T priorities and defines a broad set of emerging scientific research areas, critical to the development of future DoD technologies.  NSSEFF Fellows serve as speakers at DoD events, reviewers on panels for DoD science, and as collaborators with scientists and engineers at DoD’s laboratories and other research facilities.  The NSSEFF program is realigned to PE 0601110D8Z Basic Research Initiatives in FY 2015.

NDEP Pre-Kindergarten (PK)-12 engages, develops, and attracts STEM talent for future DoD military and civilian workforce needs via 68 local sites and nine national organizations.  NDEP PK-12 leverages the DoD’s STEM expertise to connect students, teachers, schools, and public sector and industry partners with DoD subject matter experts (SMEs) primarily in those communities adjacent to DoD laboratories and bases where the talent pool resides.  Authentic STEM experiences for teachers and students include hands-on activities that are aligned with DoD’s technical workforce requirements.  Since FY 2007, NDEP PK-12 has increased the number of DoD facilities that directly engage local education authorities (LEAs) to: (1) build student interest in STEM fields and disciplines and in careers specific to DoD; (2) develop DoD-relevant science, engineering and mathematics skills; and (3) provide future talent to fulfill DoD’s demand for highly skilled STEM professionals.  NDEP PK-12 has utilized 4,100 exceptional DoD STEM professionals to reach 500,000 students and 8,300 teachers in 30 states.  As one specific example, DoD SMEs contributed over 8,000 hours to lead FIRST Robotics Competition teams, with over 90 percent of team members reporting that the hands-on experience taught them about how science and technology can be used to solve real-world science and engineering problems.  The PK-12 program is terminated in FY 2014, though portions may transfer to the Department of Education.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The National Defense Education Program (NDEP) engages the full science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) continuum to ensure the Department of Defense (DoD) will have access to high-quality STEM personnel vital to national defense now and in the future.  STEM degree production compared to U.S. employment projections show that there is likely to be a significant shortage of STEM professionals, especially in computing, information technology, and electronics engineering, DoD mission critical occupations for which NDEP’s continuum of initiatives provides a pool of exceptional talent.  NDEP’s portfolio provides short, medium, and long-term solutions to the perfect storm of workforce challenges, which include: (1) impending retirement of 33 percent of DoD’s STEM workforce; (2) low college readiness rate and interest in STEM majors; and (3) challenges that DoD, like other Federal employers, face in recruiting and retaining high-quality STEM talent in a competitive environment.

NDEP aligns to the DoD Science and Technology (S&amp;T) priorities and the integrated STEM/Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Institutions (HBCU/MIs) program, synchronized with the Federal 5-Year STEM Strategic Plan, the DoD STEM Strategic and Implementation Plans and the DoD Strategic Workforce Plan (in progress).  NDEP components engage in assessment and evaluation as required by the Office of Management and Budget and the Government Accountability Office.

Science, Mathematics, and Research for Transformation (SMART) awards highly competitive scholarships-for-service to undergraduate and graduate students in 19 academic STEM disciplines and moves graduates directly into DoD's workforce following graduation.  Internships engage SMART scholars in hands-on, authentic research and work experiences in DoD facilities, thereby enhancing their educational experience and building a public service commitment to the Department’s mission.  Since its inception as a pilot program in FY 2005, SMART has supported ~1,455 students from bachelor to doctoral levels and to date ~900 have completed program studies and transitioned into the DoD workforce.  SMART ensures that DoD has a steady infusion of high-quality U.S. technical talent, prepared in areas of critical importance to DoD, ready to apply their technical knowledge, skills, and abilities to fulfill DoD’s mission. 

National Security Science and Engineering Faculty Fellowship (NSSEFF) program supports world-class researchers in scientific areas of critical importance to DoD and ensures the cultivation of exceptional future talent.  The NSSEFF provides a critical resource for connections between academia and the DoD science and engineering enterprise. NSSEFF Fellows’ work spans all seven DoD S&amp;T priorities and defines a broad set of emerging scientific research areas, critical to the development of future DoD technologies.  NSSEFF Fellows serve as speakers at DoD events, reviewers on panels for DoD science, and as collaborators with scientists and engineers at DoD’s laboratories and other research facilities.  The NSSEFF program is realigned to PE 0601110D8Z Basic Research Initiatives in FY 2015.

NDEP Pre-Kindergarten (PK)-12 engages, develops, and attracts STEM talent for future DoD military and civilian workforce needs via 68 local sites and nine national organizations.  NDEP PK-12 leverages the DoD’s STEM expertise to connect students, teachers, schools, and public sector and industry partners with DoD subject matter experts (SMEs) primarily in those communities adjacent to DoD laboratories and bases where the talent pool resides.  Authentic STEM experiences for teachers and students include hands-on activities that are aligned with DoD’s technical workforce requirements.  Since FY 2007, NDEP PK-12 has increased the number of DoD facilities that directly engage local education authorities (LEAs) to: (1) build student interest in STEM fields and disciplines and in careers specific to DoD; (2) develop DoD-relevant science, engineering and mathematics skills; and (3) provide future talent to fulfill DoD’s demand for highly skilled STEM professionals.  NDEP PK-12 has utilized 4,100 exceptional DoD STEM professionals to reach 500,000 students and 8,300 teachers in 30 states.  As one specific example, DoD SMEs contributed over 8,000 hours to lead FIRST Robotics Competition teams, with over 90 percent of team members reporting that the hands-on experience taught them about how science and technology can be used to solve real-world science and engineering problems.  The PK-12 program is terminated in FY 2014, though portions may transfer to the Department of Education.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                        <r2:Description>SMART is a scholarship-for-service program that provides support to high performing U.S. graduate and undergraduate students in 19 academic STEM disciplines identified as areas of future workforce need by DoD.  

The disciplines align with the Department’s seven S&amp;T priorities and emerging scientific research areas.  The disciplines are: Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering; Biosciences; Chemical Engineering; Chemistry; Civil Engineering; Cognitive, Neural, and Behavioral Sciences; Computer Science; Electrical Engineering; Geosciences; Industrial and Systems Engineering; Information Sciences; Materials Science and Engineering; Mathematics; Mechanical Engineering; Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering; Nuclear Engineering; Oceanography; Operations Research; and Physics.  Upon completion of their degree, students fulfill a service commitment to DoD on a one-to-one payback per year of education funded.  In part, SMART's success is measured by participants that remain in the DoD workforce beyond their required service commitment: 84 percent who have completed their service commitment are still employed by DoD beyond their original service commitment.

Oversight of the SMART program falls under the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (OASD(R&amp;E)).  Two types of individuals participate in the program: retention scholars who are current DoD employees and recruitment scholars who are college students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate programs and represent new talent for the DoD.  Internships provide SMART scholars with an opportunity to engage in hands-on research and work experiences in DoD labs, thereby enhancing their educational experience and building a public service commitment to the Department’s mission.

Since FY 2005, ~1,455 students have participated in SMART at ~ 160 sponsoring facilities.  As of August 2013, ~900 SMART scholars have transitioned into the service commitment phase.  To date, these scholars have transitioned as civilian employees into the Air Force, Army, Navy, and other DoD components.</r2:Description>

The DoD HBCU/MI Program encourages participation of small minority schools as well as large minority research institutions.  This competitive program provides support through grants or contracts for research, education assistance, instrumentation purchases, and technical assistance as described below.

•  Research.  The research grants are to further the knowledge in the basic scientific disciplines through theoretical and experimental activities.  Collaborative research allows university professors to work directly with military laboratories or other universities.

•  Education.  Education assistance funds are used by minority institutions to strengthen their academic programs in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), thereby increasing the number of under-represented minorities obtaining undergraduate and graduate degrees in these fields.  These grants provide equipment, scholarships, cooperative work/study opportunities, visiting faculty programs, summer programs, and a variety of other enhancements designed to support students and to encourage them to pursue careers in STEM.

•  Infrastructure.  This program allows universities to purchase basic laboratory equipment for research and education program enhancements to highly sophisticated research instruments, such as lasers and spectrometers.

•  Technical assistance.  These funds are used to design programs that enhance the ability of minority institutions to successfully compete for future Defense funding.  The objective is to assist the HBCU/MI community in areas such as proposal writing and administration of grants and contracts.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program addresses applied research associated with improving the lethality, reliability, safety, and survivability of munitions and weapon systems.  The goal is to develop and demonstrate joint enabling technologies that can be used by the Program Executive Officers (PEOs) as they develop their specific weapon programs.  The program invests in and demonstrates technologies from a Joint Service perspective, thus maximizing efficiencies, ensuring the development of technology with the broadest applicability while avoiding duplication of efforts.

Munition Area Technology Groups (MATGs) and Fuze Area Technology Groups (FATGs) have been established for each munition and capability area and are tasked with: 1) coordinating, establishing, and maintaining 2018, and 2023 year technology development plans and roadmaps, 2) coordinating biannual meetings to review technical and programmatic details of each funded and proposed effort, 3) developing and submitting Technology Transition Agreements in coordination with appropriate PEOs for insertion in their Insensitive Munitions (IM) Strategic Plans / Fuze Technology Development Plan, and 4) interfacing with other MATGs / FATGs and IM / fuze science and technology projects as appropriate.  The Joint Insensitive Munitions Technology Program (JIMTP) and Joint Fuze Technology Program (JFTP) will utilize a Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) (consisting of senior Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of Energy (DOE) laboratory representatives, and senior Munitions PEO representatives) to provide program oversight, policy, direction, and priorities during its annual meeting.

The Insensitive Munitions (IM) effort will demonstrate enabling technologies needed to develop weapons in compliance with requirements established in United States Code, Title 10, Chapter 141, Section 2389 and DoD Instruction 5000.1.  This effort will take promising technologies demonstrated at the laboratory scale and transition them into demonstration programs utilizing generic hardware based on priority munitions identified in the PEO IM Strategic Plans.  Mature demonstrated IM technology can be transitioned, thereby decreasing their program costs and schedule risk and facilitating spin-offs to other non-compliant munitions within their portfolios.

The JIMTP investments focus on five Munition Areas:  1) High Performance Rocket Propulsion (HPP), 2) Minimum Signature Rocket Propulsion (MSP), 3) Blast and Fragmentation Warheads (BFW), 4) Anti-Armor Warheads (AAW), and 5) Gun Propulsion (GP).  MATGs, under tri-service leadership, have developed technology roadmaps for each Munition Area that are used to guide investments based on goals consistent with the DoD IM Strategic Plan.  These IM technologies, alone or in combination, will be developed and tested at the small-scale, and for eventual incorporation in hardware, simulating real-world munitions, to demonstrate their utility and feasibility. 

The Enabling Fuze Technology effort will also demonstrate fuze enabling technologies needed to develop weapons that address priority capability areas identified in the Guidance for Development of the Force (GDF), the Secretary of Defense Memorandum, DoD Policy on Cluster Munitions and Unintended Harm to Civilians, and shortfalls in current weapon systems.  This effort will develop fuzing technologies and mature them for transition into advanced technology (6.3) programs and/or design tools and protocols for weapon fuzing.  In this way, the Service and Industrial base weapon and fuze will be able to heavily leverage and apply these emerging and promising technologies in fuzing modeling and simulation tools, multi-point initiation, high reliability fuze architectures, survivable components, modular fuze packaging, and fuze sensor. 

The Joint Fuze Technology Program investments focus on four specific capability areas that have been identified by Department strategic guidance and current shortfalls in weapon systems and will be validated by the PEOs and the Heads of the Service Science and Technology (S&amp;T) communities.  These capability areas are:  1) Hard Target Survivable Fuzing, 2) Tailorable Effects Weapon Fuzing, 3) High Reliability Fuzing, and 4) Enabling Fuze Technologies and Common Architecture.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Joint Insensitive Munitions (IM) Technology Program (JIMTP) aims at developing the enabling technologies needed to build weapons in compliance with requirements established in statute (United States Code, Title 10, Chapter 141, Section 2389) and regulation (DoDI 5000.1 and CJCSI 3170.01F).  This effort will take promising technologies developed at the laboratory scale and transition them into demonstration programs utilizing generic hardware based on the priority munitions identified in the DoD IM Strategic Plan.  Mature and demonstrated IM technology can be transitioned, thereby decreasing the program costs and schedule risk.  This will additionally promote spin-offs to other non-compliant munitions within the DoD portfolio.  Without new technology, future variants of current weapon systems will have the same, or worse, response to IM stimuli.  New weapon developments will face similar challenges. 

The JIMTP investments focus on five Munition Areas:  1) High Performance Rocket Propulsion, 2) Minimum Signature Rocket Propulsion, 3) Blast and Fragmentation Warheads, 4) Anti-Armor Warheads, and 5) Gun Propulsion.  Munition Area Technology Groups (MATGs), under tri-service leadership, have developed technology roadmaps for each Munition Area that are used to guide investments based on goals consistent with the DoD IM Strategic Plan.  The program is structured around these five areas with clear cross-cutting tasks.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

These technologies, when applied to rocket motors, improve to one or more threats, while not degrading the response to other IM threats and at least maintaining munition performance.  Technologies include, but are not limited to, rocket propellant ingredients (including synthesis, characterization and scale-up), reduced smoke or smoky propellants (including formulation, characterization and scale-up), rocket motor case design, materials for active and passive thermal mitigation, shock mitigation materials and techniques, passive and active coatings, active and passive venting techniques for motor cases or containers, ignition systems, sensors, and thrust mitigation techniques.  Operating conditions may be controlled or widely varying in both temperature and vibration.  The 2018 and 2023 year goals of the HPP MATG are concentrated on solving the IM response of missile propulsion systems due to Fragment Impacts and Slow Cook Off for the majority of HPP rocket motors, and solving the Fast Cook Off response of very large HPP motors.</r2:Description>

                                                        <r2:Description>Anti-Armor Warheads (AAW) focuses on the development and demonstration of explosive ingredients, explosives, warhead and fuze technologies for improving IM of AAW munitions.  The development of explosive ingredients, explosives and warhead and fuze technologies that, when applied to munitions, improve IM response to one or more threats, while not degrading the response to other IM threats and at minimum maintain munition performance.  Technologies include but are not limited to new ingredient synthesis and characterization, initial formulation development, scale-up, warhead/charge configuration, venting techniques for both munitions and their containers, protection/packaging materials and systems, shock mitigation liners, and initiation devices, techniques, and technologies.  Applications vary but include high performance warhead fills, booster explosives, and all other technology to mitigate the violent response of Anti-Armor Warhead munitions to IM threats.  Munition operating conditions may be controlled or have widely varying environmental conditions, such as temperature and vibration, and other factors such as cost, availability, and reliability may be critically important depending on the intended munition application.  The 2018 and 2023 year goals of the AAW MATG are concentrated on solving the IM response of anti-armor warheads to the Fragment Impact, Sympathetic Reaction and Shaped Charge Jet threats for larger munitions and the Fragment Impact, Slow Cookoff, and Sympathetic Reaction / Shaped Charge Jet threats for Medium Caliber Munitions.</r2:Description>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This RDT&amp;E effort will demonstrate fuze enabling technologies needed to develop weapons that address priority capability areas identified in the Guidance for Development of the Force (GDF), the Secretary of Defense Memorandum, DoD Policy on Cluster Munitions and Unintended Harm to Civilians, and shortfalls in current weapon systems.  This effort will develop enabling technologies at the laboratory scale and transition them into 6.3 demonstration programs for weapons where priority capabilities and technology needs have been identified and validated by the Program Executive Officers (PEOs) and the Heads of the Service Science and Technology (S&amp;T) communities.  Mature 6.2 fuze technologies will be transitioned, thereby decreasing their program costs and schedule risk and facilitating spin-offs to other munitions within their portfolios.
Under the Joint Fuze Technology Program (JFTP), investments are focused on specific capability areas that have been identified by Department strategic guidance and current shortfalls in weapon systems and validated by the PEOs and Heads of the Service S&amp;T communities.  These four capability areas are: 1) Hard Target Survivable Fuzing, 2) Tailorable Effects (TE) Weapon Fuzing, 3) High Reliability Fuzing, and 4) Enabling Fuze Technologies and Common Architecture.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                        <r2:Description>The Hard Target Fuzing challenges are grouped into three Technology Areas.  First, improved modeling and simulation capabilities provide the validated computational tools necessary for hard target applications.  Second, basic phenomenology and understanding of the Fuze Environment is the science-based endeavor of providing the test equipment, instrumentation, and analysis techniques for experimentation and data gathering necessary for next generation fuzing.  Third, hard target survivable fuze components are developed to increase the effectiveness of facility denial munitions by improving the prediction tools and testing methodologies to evaluate the survivability and functionality of legacy and future fuzes.  Development of these technologies will enable next generation boosted and hypersonic penetrators to execute missions against hardened and deeply buried targets.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The HBCU/MI program provides support in fields of science and engineering that are important to national defense.  The Department of Defense (DoD) HBCU/MI Program encourages participation of small minority schools as well as large minority research institutions.  This competitive program provides support through grants or contracts for research, education assistance, instrumentation purchases, and technical assistance as described below.

•  Research.  The research grants further the knowledge in the basic scientific disciplines through theoretical and experimental activities.  Collaborative research allows university research staff to work directly with military laboratories or other universities.

•  Education.  Minority institutions use education assistance funds to strengthen their academic programs in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), thereby increasing the number of under-represented minorities obtaining undergraduate and graduate degrees in these fields.  These grants provide equipment, scholarships, cooperative work/study opportunities, visiting faculty programs, summer programs, and a variety of other enhancements designed to support students and to encourage them to pursue careers in STEM.

•  Infrastructure.  This program allows universities to purchase basic laboratory equipment for research and education program enhancements and highly sophisticated research instruments, such as lasers and spectrometers.

•  Technical assistance.  HBCU/MI uses these funds to design programs that enhance the ability of minority institutions to successfully compete for future Defense funding.  The objective is to assist the HBCU/MI community in areas such as proposal writing and administration of grants, and contracts.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The Department of Defense (DoD) HBCU/MI Program encourages participation of small minority schools as well as large minority research institutions.  This competitive program provides support through grants or contracts for research, education assistance, instrumentation purchases, and technical assistance as described below.

•  Research.  The research grants further the knowledge in the basic scientific disciplines through theoretical and experimental activities.  Collaborative research allows university research staff to work directly with military laboratories or other universities.

•  Education.  Minority institutions use education assistance funds to strengthen their academic programs in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), thereby increasing the number of under-represented minorities obtaining undergraduate and graduate degrees in these fields.  These grants provide equipment, scholarships, cooperative work/study opportunities, visiting faculty programs, summer programs, and a variety of other enhancements designed to support students and to encourage them to pursue careers in STEM.

•  Infrastructure.  This program allows universities to purchase basic laboratory equipment for research and education program enhancements and highly sophisticated research instruments, such as lasers and spectrometers.

•  Technical assistance.  HBCU/MI uses these funds to design programs that enhance the ability of minority institutions to successfully compete for future Defense funding.  The objective is to assist the HBCU/MI community in areas such as proposal writing and administration of grants and contracts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Lincoln Laboratory (LL) research line program is an advanced technology research and development effort conducted through a cost reimbursable contract with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).  The LL Program funds innovations that directly lead to the development of new system concepts, technologies, components and materials in support of Lincoln Laboratory’s missions in Advanced Electronics Technology, Communications Systems, Intelligence, Cyber Security and Information Sciences, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Systems and Technology, Tactical Systems, Space Control, and Air and Missile Defense.  In FY 2013 the LL Program supported these missions by conducting research and development in five core science and engineering disciplines and four technical initiatives:
- Advanced Devices, with emphasis on development of materials, devices, and subsystems utilizing microelectronic, photonic, biological, and chemical technologies to enable new system approaches to Department of Defense (DoD) sensors.
- Optical Systems and Technologies, including the development of focal planes, integrated imagers, imaging and spectroscopic detection systems.
- RF Systems and Technologies, including the development of novel active and passive Radio Frequency (RF) sensors and development of electronic protection and electronics attack technologies and system concepts.
- Information, Computation, and Exploitation, which seeks to develop novel architectures, tools, and techniques for the processing, fusion, interpretation, computation, and exploitation of multi-sensor, multi-intelligence data. 
- Cyber Security, includes developing technologies and new techniques for the protection of systems against cyber attack and exploitation.
- Technical Initiatives, include biological sciences to aid the warfighter and develop tools for biological research; autonomous systems technologies with the objective of developing mobile, autonomous, robotic platforms that demonstrate key capabilities needed for a wide range of defense applications; quantum information sciences to develop basic technologies that support the storage, transport, and computation of quantum information; and novel and engineered materials that utilize nano-manufacturing techniques to create meta or other materials with unique physical and optical properties not readily found in nature.

Supporting these and other priority technology and capability areas are work efforts entitled Technical Intelligence and Testbed for Comparative Analysis:
- Technical Intelligence is working to develop a comprehensive understanding of technology emergence and advancement in a range of relevant scientific areas such as nanotechnology, directed energy, and propulsion.  Some details are classified, but one focus area is working to establish a broad horizon scanning and technology forecasting capability through a collaborative effort by the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Intelligence Community.  This effort will develop insight into our relative position in science and technology around the world over time, as well as determine potential impacts on DoD capability development and future threat environments.  
- The Testbed for Comparative Analysis will enable the evaluation of quantitative, horizon scanning and technology forecasting techniques for discovering disruptive technologies that may impact the DoD.  This effort will provide the DoD with objective ways to evaluate the accuracy of existing and future horizon scanning and technology forecasting efforts.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Lincoln Laboratory (LL) research line program is an advanced technology research and development effort conducted through a cost reimbursable contract with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).  The LL Program funds innovations that directly lead to the development of new system concepts, technologies, components and materials in support of Lincoln Laboratory’s missions in Advanced Electronics Technology, Communications Systems, Intelligence, Cyber Security and Information Sciences, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Systems and Technology, Tactical Systems, Space Control, and Air and Missile Defense.  For FY 2013 the LL Program will support these missions by conducting research and development in five core science and engineering disciplines and four technical initiatives:
- Advanced Devices, with emphasis on development of materials, devices, and subsystems utilizing microelectronic, photonic, biological, and chemical technologies to enable new system approaches to Department of Defense (DoD) sensors.
- Optical Systems and Technologies, including the development of focal planes, integrated imagers, imaging and spectroscopic detection systems.
- RF Systems and Technologies, including the development of novel active and passive Radio Frequency (RF) sensors and development of electronic protection and electronics attack technologies and system concepts.
- Information, Computation, and Exploitation, which seeks to develop novel architectures, tools, and techniques for the processing, fusion, interpretation, computation, and exploitation of multi-sensor, multi-intelligence data. 
- Cyber Security, includes developing technologies and new techniques for the protection of systems against cyber attack and exploitation.
- Technical Initiatives, include biological sciences to aid the warfighter and develop tools for biological research; autonomous systems technologies with the objective of developing mobile, autonomous, robotic platforms that demonstrate key capabilities needed for a wide range of defense applications; quantum information sciences to develop basic technologies that support the storage, transport, and computation of quantum information; and novel and engineered materials that utilize nano-manufacturing techniques to create meta or other materials with unique physical and optical properties not readily found in nature.

Supporting these and other priority technology and capability areas is a work effort titled Technical Intelligence.  Technical Intelligence supports comprehensive understanding of technology emergence and advancement in a range of relevant scientific areas such as nanotechnology, directed energy, and propulsion.  Some details are classified, but one collaborative effort by DoD and the Intelligence community is focused on establishing a broad horizon scanning and technology forecasting capability.  This effort will develop insight over time into our relative position in science and technology around the world and potential impacts on capability development and future threat environments.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Emerging conflicts, shifting global priorities, natural disasters, and dwindling federal resources, to name a few, are all factors that will tax our ability to provide a timely and cost-effective military defense of the nation.  LL will develop an agile analytical and experimental methodology for addressing the impact of proposed solutions on complex-systems-engineering challenges and will reduce this method to practice on specific problems selected by the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD(R&amp;E)).</r2:Description>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>(U) The Technical Intelligence program provides global scientific and technological (S&amp;T) awareness – an understanding of relevant fields, developments, applications, and opportunities of S&amp;T topics – in order to assist decision-makers in the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research and Engineering (OASD(R&amp;E)) to prepare for an uncertain future. 

(U) The Technical Intelligence program provides this support through three over-arching areas: Current Threat and Capability Estimates, Technical Watch and Horizon Scanning (TW/HS), and Technical Assessments. The current threat and capability estimate focus area coordinates with multiple U.S. government agencies to characterize today’s global S&amp;T environment – to include threats and opportunities – using intelligence-derived and open source information as well as developing proof-of-concept systems to address identified threats. The TW/HS focus area identifies nascent and disruptive technologies that will shape the future S&amp;T landscape through novel TW/HS tools and engagement with international partners. The technical assessment focus area identifies the military relevance, research opportunities, and policy recommendations for existing and future technologies. Each of these areas is supported by a robust outreach program.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementNote>Change from FY 2013 to FY 2014 reflects a realignment of the program from the Data to Decisions Applied Research program element (PE) 0602663D8Z to higher Department of Defense (DoD) priorities.

The goals of this program will be shifted to the DoD Components under the direction of the Research and Engineering (R&amp;E) Executive Committee and will conform with the DoD Data to Decision Priority Steering Council roadmaps.  Historically, the Joint Data Management program was restructured to evolve into the revised Data to Decisions Applied Research program, a FY 2012 new start, in support of the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review mission:  Succeed in counterinsurgency, stability, and counterterrorism operations.  In addition, this program addresses a signed Secretary of Defense S&amp;T priority, Data to Decisions, which reduces the cycle time and manpower requirements for analysis and use of large data sets.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The DoD response to a changing threat environment includes an expansion of the types of sensors deployed, new types of information collected, and different features used to classify these new threats.  As the DoD increases the capability and capacity to generate increasing amounts of data from numerous sensors in the battlespace, the issue of handling very large data sets has become more challenging.  From a technical perspective, data creation speeds have outpaced the speed and ability to transport, store, and process the data created.  S&amp;T investigation into new and novel ways to manage and exploit this data is required to more efficiently use sensor assets and effectively use information in a timely fashion.

The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Data to Decisions program (PEs 0602663D8Z and 0603663D8Z) uniquely addresses three specific gap areas not addressed by Component S&amp;T:  minimal dedicated Data to Decisions research to support Joint and emerging mission areas; DoD needs a mechanism to increase responsiveness of Component Data to Decisions research and lower the time-to-solution across a broad DoD-wide user base; and limited investment in multi-disciplinary research investigations of Data to Decisions issues and solutions.  The OSD Data to Decisions program pulls together research efforts to address shortfalls within the context of Joint and emerging missions to ensure that the distinctive needs of these joint analysts and decision makers are addressed by DoD science and technology.  As an example, irregular warfare, non-state terrorism movements, and uncertain environmental patterns that trigger major weather disasters are producing a reality for military and government leaders where traditional physics-based sensors alone are insufficient to plan current and future actions in a region of interest or need.  Component Data to Decisions efforts focus on developing technology to overcome a particular challenge within a mission or to advance a particular priority area of that Component.  As a result, the R&amp;E Database has over 388 references to Decision Support programs; all of which are designed to address a specific need over the course of several years.  However, there exists no other program in the DoD that focuses on technology development efforts to speed the delivery of the Component solutions and lessons learned to a DoD-wide user base.  The OSD Data to Decisions program provides the common platform (access to datasets, infrastructure, and metrics) to integrate and evaluate the technology development and research methods to support various missions driven by the challenge problems.  This ability to rapidly evaluate technology development and research methods will allow technology transfer for mission analysis not previously foreseen and lower the time-to solution across DoD by rigorously analyzing technical performance for more immediate use.  Traditional approaches within research seek to advance machine systems for a specific mission effect resulting in large complex data sets.  While necessary for sensor system improvements, potential Data to Decisions solutions require a coupling of automated data analysis with human analysts, operators, and decision makers in order to reduce time and limit the number of people required.  Many research studies, workshops, and analysis have stated that solutions to data issues are multi-disciplinary.  The OSD Data to Decisions program is in the unique position to reach across Components and research disciplines to blend promising research in new ways in response to cross-service Challenge Problem statements.  For Challenge Problems, contextual understanding will result from research combining human sciences with computer processing techniques to take advantage of a person’s cognitive ability to fuse and assimilate multiple sources and types of information for new insights.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The OSD Data to Decisions (D2D) program (PEs 0602663D8Z and 0603663D8Z) uniquely addresses three specific gap areas not addressed by Component Science and Technology (S&amp;T):  (1) minimal dedicated D2D research to support Joint and emerging mission areas; (2) DoD needs a mechanism to increase responsiveness of Component D2D research and lower the time-to-solution across a broad DoD-wide user base; and (3) limited investment in multi-disciplinary research investigations of D2D issues and solutions.

The D2D program establishes the demonstration and experimentation environment to conduct independent evaluations of research efforts that have the most potential of minimizing the impact of the increasing amount of information available and required to support military operational decision-making.  The intent is to leverage existing research investments within defense S&amp;T and provide proper evaluations and assessments to facilitate technology transition.  The Applied Research program concentrates on the development portion of this collaborative effort, focusing on the development of improved algorithms, relative to FY 2012 state of the art, to be demonstrated and validated in the 6.3 D2D program test bed.  The D2D Advanced Development (6.3) program uses a spiral development model with four-steps.  Each year Operational teams will choose a series of cross-service challenge problems dominated by a specific sensing modality.  Representative data for each of those problems will then be collected for testing against that problem.  A Development team will design algorithms and data management architectures using high-level languages and self-test on controlled data sets to address those challenge problems.  Independent assessment will occur with sequestered data sets, but each development tool will also be tested against new sensors not included in the self-testing to determine fragility and applicability.  A Transition team will host the developed algorithms as services in a spiraling prototype system that will support rapid prototyping and transition.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                        <r2:Description>Text Analytics, a term used to identify a set of linguistic, statistical, and machine learning techniques that model and structure the information content of textual sources for exploratory data analysis, research, and investigation¸ play a vital role in achieving open-source intelligence (OSINT) and human intelligence (HUMINT) capabilities that inform timely and accurate situational awareness in time-constrained, uncertain, and complex environments.  With the recent advances in online social media and the proliferation of mobile communication devices, text information is available in unprecedented amounts and formats and thus represents an opportunity to engage in research for information retrieval, lexical analysis to study word frequency, and data mining techniques including link and association analysis, visualization, and predictive analytics.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Our military forces require resilient, reliable networks and computer systems to conduct effective operations.  However, the number and sophistication of threats in cyberspace are rapidly growing, making it urgent and critical to improve the cyber security of Department of Defense (DoD) systems to counter those threats and assure our missions.  The Cyber Applied Research program focuses on innovative and sustained research in both cyber security and computer network operations to develop new concepts to harden key network and computer components, design new resilient cyber infrastructures, increase the military’s ability to fight and survive during cyber attacks, disrupt nation-state level attack planning and execution, measure the state of cyber security, and explore and exploit new ideas in cyber warfare for agile cyber operations and mission assurance. 

This program builds upon existing basic and applied research results.  The program focuses on integrating computer network defense and computer network operations, addressing joint problems in cyber operations, and filling capability and technology gaps as identified in the 2012 Cyber Priority Steering Council Science and Technology Roadmap and assessments conducted by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (OASD(R&amp;E)).  Progress and results are reviewed by the DoD Cyber Science &amp; Technology Community of Interest.  New efforts will also be aligned with emerging U.S. Cyber Command Mission Requirements.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

A resilient infrastructure has the ability to continue to perform its functions and provide its services at required levels during an attack.  The objective in this area is to develop integrated architectures that are optimized for their ability to absorb (cyber) shock, and recover in a timely fashion to a known secure state, even if this is at the expense of degraded performance.  Resilient Algorithms and Protocols address novel protocols and algorithms to increase the repertoire of resiliency mechanisms available to the infrastructure and architecture.  Research is needed to develop resilience at lower levels with specific algorithms and protocols to support higher-level resiliency architectures.</r2:Description>

These capabilities present technology challenges in the areas of Autonomic Cyber Agility and Cyber Maneuver.  Cyber Maneuver is a new way to manage systems dynamically in a cyber situation.  It is a set of emerging methods for maintaining defensive or offensive advantage in cyber operations.  It entails developing mechanisms that enable goal-directed reshaping of cyber systems.  Cyber maneuver encompasses reallocation for repurposing a device or platform, reconfiguration for changing the way a system performs a task, and repositories for altering the operating state in a logical or physical topology.  Autonomic Cyber Agility covers several forms of agility.  As cyber infrastructures increase in scale and complexity, there is an urgent need for autonomous and agile mechanisms to reconfigure, heal, optimize, and protect defensive and offensive cyber mechanisms.</r2:Description>

While the focus in cyber research is often placed on individual technologies, how these technologies work toward an effective mission is critical for the DoD.  The objective of Assuring Effective Missions presents technology challenges in the areas of Cyber Mission Control and Effects at Scale.  Cyber Mission Control covers the ability to orchestrate cyber systems to achieve an overarching mission goal.  To perform dyanmic analysis of asset criticality, and course-of-action analysis alternatives, there is a critical need for tools that can map information technology assets to missions and use modeling and simulation, or other techniques.  Inherent in Cyber Mission Control is the ability to automatically derive and fuse information about the characteristics of information technology systems in a manner that allows us to describe, analyze, observe, and control the operation of information technology components.  A key goal of this research area is to have tools that enable commanders to assess and direct different information technology maneuvers in conjunction with mission actions.  Effects at Scale encompass full spectrum challenges that intersect with cyber becoming a new full-fledged domain of warfare.</r2:Description>

There are two technical challenges associated with cyber modeling, simulation, and experimentation; 1) Cyber Modeling and Simulation and 2) Cyber Measurement.  Cyber Modeling and Simulation seeks to develop tools and techniques that enable analytical modeling and multi-scale simulation of complex cyber systems.  Cyber Measurement develops cyber experimentation and test range technology to conduct controlled, repeatable experiments, providing the ability to track the progress of cyber research investments in a quantitative fashion.  This area will explore new analytical methodologies, models, and experimental data sets to establish metrics to measure a system’s state of security, apply the scientific method to establish the foundations of a framework in which cyber security research can be conducted, to test hypothesis with measurable and repeatable results, and the quantitative experimentation and assessment for new cyber technologies.  These new methodologies will enable exploration of modeling and simulation tools and techniques that can drive innovation in research and aid in integrated experimentation and transition to operations to simulate the cyber environment with sufficient fidelity, and to integrate cyber modeling and simulation with the traditional modeling and simulation related to the kinetic domain.</r2:Description>

The objective in the area of embedded and tactical systems is to develop tools and techniques that assure the secure operation of microprocessors within our weapons platforms and systems; enable security in real-time systems; and establish security in disadvantaged, intermittent, and low-bandwidth environments.  This research also seeks to expand and cultivate military-grade techniques for securing and operating with enterprise-style commodity mobile devices, such as smart phones, tablets, and their associated infrastructures.  With the constant evolution of these devices and their respective infrastructures it is of the utmost importance to provide a secure environment where these devices can be effectively utilized, monitored and tracked.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The OSD HSCB Modeling Program is a vertically integrated effort to research, develop, and transition technologies, tools, and systems to programs of record and users in need.  The program exists to optimize U.S. forces’ ability to perform population-centric sensing, understand behaviors driven by social and cultural variables, and select effective courses of action in the full range of military operations.  Program research will enhance population-centric intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities for understanding the increasingly complex global environment to address national strategic challenges such as instability, aggression, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and violent extremism.  In three integrated program elements (PE), the program will conduct applied research, mature and demonstrate advanced technology, and develop transitionable methods, technology, tools, and prototypes.  Work under PE 0602670D8Z will focus on developing an applied science base, to include validated theory and methods, along with knowledge products and resources to support sociocultural behavior data collection, analysis and forecasting of sociocultural behavior, course of action planning, and effects analysis.  Research will address needs in two areas:  modeling and data.  It will develop and validate theoretical constructions, generate knowledge products, and develop stand-alone computational models of sociocultural behavior; and improve methods for collecting data that will facilitate model development and enhance forecasting and analysis capabilities.  The program will ensure that supported research is clearly tied to warfighters and their needs. 

Human behavior based theory, knowledge products, and stand-alone models will support development of software to help users represent, understand, and forecast sociocultural behavior at strategic, operational, and tactical levels.

Improved data collection methods will help build the sociocultural science base, facilitate subsequent model development and validation, and address emerging data types and sources.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The OSD HSCB Modeling Program is a vertically integrated effort to research, develop, and transition technologies, tools, and systems to programs of record and users in need.  The Program exists to optimize U.S. forces’ ability to perform population-centric sensing, understand behaviors driven by social and cultural variables, and select effective courses of action in the full range of military operations.  Program research will enhance population-centric intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities for understanding the increasingly complex global environment to address national strategic challenges such as instability, aggression, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and violent extremism.  In three integrated program elements (PEs), the Program will conduct applied research, mature and demonstrate advanced technology, and develop transitionable methods, technology, tools, and prototypes.  Work under PE 0602670D8Z will focus on developing an applied science base, to include validated theory and methods, along with knowledge products and resources to support sociocultural behavior data collection, analysis and forecasting of sociocultural behavior, course of action planning, and effects analysis.  Research will address needs in two areas:  modeling and data.  It will develop and validate theoretical constructions, generate knowledge products, and develop stand-alone computational models of sociocultural behavior; and improve methods for collecting data that will facilitate model development and enhance forecasting and analysis capabilities.  The Program will ensure that supported research is clearly tied to warfighters and their needs. 

Human behavior based theory, knowledge products, and stand-alone models will support development of software to help users represent, understand, and forecast sociocultural behavior at strategic, operational, and tactical levels.

Improved data collection methods will help build the sociocultural science base, facilitate subsequent model development and validation, and address emerging data types and sources.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementNote>To ensure that the Department of Defense (DoD) retains a differential advantage over potential adversaries, the Department split funding for Defense-wide software research at the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) across two program elements (PEs): this new Budget Activity (BA) 2 PE 0602751D8Z and the continuing BA 3 PE 0603781D8Z.  The goals are to address both longer-term challenges in software technology and engineering (PE 0602751D8Z) and to continue to benefit from the proven experience the SEI FFRDC has with developing and transitioning advanced technology (PE 0603781D8Z).</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Software is key to meeting the DoD’s increasing demand for high-quality, affordable, and timely national defense systems.  With growing global parity in software engineering, the DoD must maintain leadership to avoid strategic surprise.  To assist the DoD in retaining a long-term differential advantage over potential adversaries, the SEI Applied Research PE will develop and evaluate the feasibility and practicality of software and computer science concepts with the potential to improve future DoD systems. 

This PE represents a pivot toward more fundamental research that will enable the DoD to address longer-term challenges in software technology and engineering.  The SEI Applied Research PE will fund the SEI Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) as the leading DoD center for addressing these longer term challenges.  The SEI Applied Research PE will bolster the organic research at the SEI FFRDC, enable stronger collaborations between the SEI FFRDC and academia, attract top researchers to the SEI, give DoD access to top experts in information science, and generally enhance the DoD’s ability to benefit from the military applications of research in software and computer science.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

With growing global parity in software engineering, the DoD must maintain leadership to avoid strategic surprise.  To assist the DoD in retaining a long-term differential advantage over potential adversaries, the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) Applied Research Program Element (PE) seeks to establish a program of applied research that will develop and evaluate the feasibility and practicality of software and computer science concepts with the potential to improve future DoD systems. 

The SEI Applied Research PE will initially have four main research thrusts:  (1) measurement techniques for the effectiveness of software technologies and methods; (2) design principles and tools for evolvable, scalable ecosystems; (3) models of computational behaviors; and (4) cyber-tradecraft and analytics.  These thrusts have known military applications and can be associated with active areas of basic research.  The SEI Applied Research PE seeks to translate this promising basic research into solutions for broadly defined military needs.  This PE will leverage the expertise of the SEI Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) in advanced technology development and technology transition to design, develop, and improve tools, prototypes, and new processes that meet general requirements for software-intensive DoD systems.

The SEI Applied Research PE will also conduct research in multicore computing, architecture-led iterative incremental development (Agile at scale); and emerging software and computer science areas that can act as catalysts for acquiring DoD systems with improved performance.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                        <r2:Description>Research projects at the SEI FFRDC will be awarded under this PE on a competitive basis across the SEI.  Funding levels in each thrust area may vary from year to year.  Research will address the goal of assisting the DoD to retain a long-term differential advantage over potential adversaries in the area of software-intensive systems.  The four main thrust areas are:

1) Measurement techniques for the effectiveness of software technologies and methods.  Modern tools, integrated development environments, and software engineering processes have captured large data sets about development activities.  This thrust seeks to study the metrics that affect cost, schedule, quality, and performance based on real-world observation and experiment.  

2) Design principles and tools for evolvable, scalable ecosystems.  The commercial world has many successful examples of software ecosystems, but the DoD has not capitalized on these to the same extent.  This thrust looks beyond implementing ecosystems in a DoD context and seeks to implement the underlying principles in a way that makes automated creation, evolution, and scaling of ecosystems easier.

3) Models of Computational Behaviors.  System performance depends on end-to-end models of computational behavior that include the user, architecture, source and object code, firmware components, and processor hardware.  This thrust seeks to study emerging ideas that better model end-to-end computational behavior.  

4) Cyber-tradecraft and analytics.  Cyberwarfare is an increasingly important and rapidly evolving dimension on the modern battlefield.  This thrust seeks to investigate methods that will give the DoD enduring advantages in the cyber battlespace such as reverse software engineering, automated code &amp; malware analysis, code-level software resiliency (e.g., randomizing and time variant techniques), and other techniques such as those found in the Software Security Assurance State-of-the-Art Report.  

The SEI Applied Research PE will also conduct research in multicore computing, architecture-led iterative incremental development (Agile at scale); and emerging software and computer science areas that can act as catalysts for acquiring DoD systems with improved performance.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program addresses advanced technology development associated with improving the lethality, reliability, safety, and survivability of munitions and weapon systems.  The goal is to develop and demonstrate joint enabling technologies that can be used by the Program Executive Officers as they develop their specific weapon programs.  The program invests in and demonstrates technologies from a Joint Service perspective, thus maximizing efficiencies, ensuring the development of technology with the broadest applicability while avoiding duplication of efforts.

Munition Area Technology Groups (MATGs) and Fuze Area Technology Groups (FATGs) have been established for each munition and capability area and are tasked with: 1) coordinating, establishing, and maintaining 2018 and 2023 year technology development plans and roadmaps, 2) coordinating biannual meetings to review technical and programmatic details of each funded and proposed effort, 3) developing and submitting Technology Transition Agreements in coordination with appropriate Program Executive Offices (PEO) for insertion in their Insensitive Munition (IM) Strategic Plans / Fuze Technology Development Plan, and 4) interfacing with other MATGs / FATGs and IM / fuze science and technology projects as appropriate.   The Joint Insensitive Munitions Technical Program (JIMTP) and Joint Fuze Technical Program (JFTP) will utilize a Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) (consisting of senior DoD and DOE laboratory representatives and senior Munitions PEO representatives) to provide program oversight, policy, direction, and priorities during its annual meeting.

The Insensitive Munitions effort will demonstrate enabling technologies needed to develop weapons in compliance with Insensitive Munitions requirements established in United States Code, Title 10, Chapter 141, Section 2389 and DoDI 5000.1.  This effort will take promising technologies demonstrated at the laboratory scale and transition them into demonstration programs utilizing generic hardware based on priority munitions identified in the PEO IM Strategic Plans.  Mature and demonstrated IM technology can be transitioned, thereby decreasing their program costs and schedule risk and facilitating spin-offs to other non-compliant munitions within their portfolios.

The JIMTP investments focus on five Munition Areas:  1) High Performance Rocket Propulsion, 2) Minimum Signature Rocket Propulsion, 3) Blast and Fragmentation Warheads, 4) Anti-Armor Warheads, and 5) Gun Propulsion.  Munition Area Technology Groups (MATG), under tri-service leadership, have developed technology roadmaps for each Munition Area which are used to guide investments based on goals consistent with the PEO IM Strategic Plans.  These IM technologies, alone or in combination, will be incorporated in hardware, simulating real-world munitions, to demonstrate their utility and feasibility as part of Technology Transition Agreements with PEOs.

The Enabling Fuze Advanced Technology effort will also demonstrate fuze enabling technologies needed to develop weapons that address priority capability areas identified in the Guidance for Development (GDF) of the Force, the Secretary of Defense Memorandum, DoD Policy on Cluster Munitions and Unintended Harm to Civilians, and shortfalls in current weapon systems.  This effort will take promising technologies demonstrated at the laboratory scale and transition them into demonstration weapons and programs based on priority capabilities and technology needs identified and validated by the PEOs and the Heads of the Service Science and Technology (S&amp;T) communities.  In this way, promising multi-point initiation architectures, high reliability fuze architectures, survivable components, modular fuze packaging, and components produced based on ease of manufacturing can be integrated into munitions applications and its ability to address required capability needs will be validated.  Mature fuze technologies will be transitioned to Weapon PEO’s and/or Industry, thereby decreasing program costs and schedule risk while facilitating technology into potentially broader range of munitions applications.

The JFTP investments focus on four specific capability areas that have been identified by the Department strategic guidance and current shortfalls in weapon systems and as validated by the PEOs and the Service S&amp;T communities.  These capability areas are:  1) Hard Target Survivable Fuzing, 2) Tailorable Effects Weapon Fuzing, 3) High Reliability Fuzing, and 4) Enabling Fuze Technologies and Common Architecture.   These Fuzing technologies will be incorporated in weapon applications to demonstrate their maturity and utility as part of Technology Transition Agreements with PEOs.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Insensitive Munitions effort addresses advanced technology development associated with improving the lethality, reliability, safety, and survivability of munitions and weapon systems.  The goal is to develop and demonstrate joint enabling technologies that can be used by program managers as they develop their specific weapon programs.  The program invests in and demonstrates technologies from a Joint Service perspective, thus ensuring the development of technology with the broadest applicability while avoiding duplication of efforts – providing efficiencies and cost savings for the Department.

This effort will demonstrate enabling technologies needed to develop weapons in compliance with Insensitive Munitions requirements established in United States Code, Title 10, Chapter 141, Section 2389 and DoDI 5000.1.  This effort will take promising technologies demonstrated at the laboratory scale and transition them into demonstration programs utilizing generic hardware based on priority munitions identified in the PEO IM Strategic Plans.  Mature demonstrated IM technology can be transitioned, thereby decreasing their program costs and schedule risk and facilitating spin-offs to other non-compliant munitions within their portfolios.

The Joint Insensitive Munitions Technology Program investments focus on five Munition Areas:  1) High Performance Rocket Propulsion, 2) Minimum Signature Rocket Propulsion, 3) Blast and Fragmentation Warheads, 4) Anti-Armor Warheads, and 5) Gun Propulsion.  Munition Area Technology Groups (MATG), under tri-service leadership, have developed technology roadmaps for each Munition Area which is used to guide investments based on goals consistent with the DoD IM Strategic Plan.  These IM technologies, alone or in combination, will be incorporated in hardware, simulating real-world munitions, to demonstrate their utility and feasibility as part of Technology Transition Agreements with PEOs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

These technologies, when applied to rocket motors, improve IM response to one or more threats, while not degrading the response to other IM threats and at least maintaining munition performance.  Technologies include, but are not limited to, rocket propellant ingredients (including synthesis, characterization and scale-up), reduced smoke or smokey propellants (including formulation, characterization and scale-up), rocket motor case design, materials for active and passive thermal mitigation, shock mitigation materials and techniques, passive and active coatings, active and passive venting techniques for motor cases or containers, ignition systems, sensors and thrust mitigation techniques.  Operating conditions may be controlled or widely varying in both temperature and vibration.  The 2018 and 2023 year goals of the HPP MATG are concentrated on solving the IM response of missile propulsions systems due to Fragment Impacts and Slow Cook Off for the majority of High Performance Propulsion rocket motors, and solving the Fast Cook Off response of very large High Performance Propulsion motors.</r2:Description>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This effort will demonstrate fuze enabling technologies needed to develop weapons that address priority capability areas identified in the Guidance for Development of the Force, the Secretary of Defense Memorandum, DoD Policy on Cluster Munitions and Unintended Harm to Civilians, and shortfalls in current weapon systems.  This effort will take promising technologies integrated and tested to Technical Readiness Level (TRL) five and demonstrate the technologies to a TRL-six utilizing weapon hardware based on priority capabilities and technology needs identified and validated by the Program Executive Officers (PEOs) and the Heads of the Service S&amp;T communities.  Mature demonstrated fuze technology will be transitioned, thereby decreasing their program costs and schedule risk and facilitating spin-offs to other munitions within their portfolios.  Under the Joint Fuze Technology Program (JFTP), investments are focused on specific capability areas that have been identified by Department strategic guidance and current shortfalls in weapon systems and validated by the PEOs and Heads of the Service S&amp;T communities.  These four capability areas are:  1) Hard Target Survivable Fuzing, 2) Tailorable Effects (TE) Weapon Fuzing, 3) High Reliability Fuzing, and 4) Enabling Fuze Technologies and Common Architecture.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

First, improved modeling and simulation capabilities provide the validated computational tools necessary for hard target applications.  Second, basic phenomenology &amp; understanding of the Fuze Environment is the science-based endeavor of providing the test equipment, instrumentation, and analysis techniques for experimentation and data gathering necessary for next generation fuzing.  Third, hard target survivable fuze components are developed to increase the effectiveness of facility denial munitions by improving the prediction tools and testing methodologies to evaluate the survivability and functionality of legacy and future fuzes.  Development of these technologies will enable next generation boosted and hypersonic penetrators to execute missions against hardened and deeply buried targets.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>P206, Explosive Ordnance Disposal/Low-Intensity Conflict (EOD/LIC).  The EOD/LIC Program develops and delivers advanced capabilities for military Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) operators and Special Operations Forces (SOF) to meet the challenges of improvised explosive devices (IEDs), force protection, and the war on terrorism.  EOD/LIC efforts focus in two areas:  support to SOF to combat terrorism; and access, detection, identification, and neutralization of all types of conventional explosive ordnance and improvised explosive devices.  Requirements submitted by the Joint Service EOD and Service Special Operations communities are prioritized and approved by OASD (SO/LIC).  With a decreased budget, CTTSO will proceed with The Improvised Device Defeat (IDD)subgroup expanding its inclusion of joint service EOD operators in its efforts since the Department’s announcement to cancel PE 0603121D8Z.  IDD will absorb the appropriate joint service EOD requirements for prioritization and interagency coordination going forward.  IDD will use the limited resources it possesses to provide the broadest possible capability improvement to the community.

 P207, Special Reconnaissance Capabilities (SRC).  The SRC Program exploits, leverages, and integrates DoD’s service and agency efforts to improve surveillance and reconnaissance tools (unattended sensors, tagging and tracking devices, data infiltration/exfiltration, remote delivery, and mobility/delivery of sensors), while providing risk reduction for DoD and other agency technology and development programs.  The SRC Program identifies, integrates, and operationalizes the technical tools for the collection of actionable information against a variety of targets and mission requirements, including emerging requirements, and maintains DoD’s on-line catalog of tools in order to minimize crisis response time for special reconnaissance and surveillance. 

P208, Information Dissemination Concepts (IDC).  The IDC Program addresses technology capabilities necessary to enable sustained information dissemination campaigns in denied areas.  The IDC program, working as necessary with DoD and the interagency, develops, modifies, and demonstrates concepts, mechanisms, platforms and payloads to propagate themes and messages that convince target audiences to take action favorable to the United States and its allies. The Surveillance, Collection, and Operations Support (SCOS) subgroup has managed the IDC project for CTTSO since gaining oversight of the funding.  The language program orchestrated by SCOS will remain, albeit with a drastic reduction in funding without PE 0603121D8Z.
 
P209, Irregular Warfare Support (IWS).  The IWS Program (IWSP) develops adaptive and agile capabilities and methodologies to support irregular warfare in the current and evolving strategic environments. IWSP supports joint, interagency, and other partners who conduct or counter irregular warfare through indirect and asymmetric approaches, though they may employ a full range of military and other capabilities, in order to erode an adversary’s power, influence, and will. Solutions include material and non-material operational analysis, concept development, field experimentation, and delivery of capabilities, to defeat the motivations, sanctuaries, and enterprises of targeted state and non-state actors.  As evidenced by every applicable Defense and National Security strategy document, (e.g., 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance (DSG), “Sustaining U.S. Global Leadership: Priorities for 21st Century Defense, Irregular Warfare capabilities are vital to U.S. security.  CTTSO, in coordination with the ASD (SO/LIC), is in the process of reviewing options to continue the IWS capability that is critical to the combating terrorism community.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The EOD/LIC Program develops and delivers advanced capabilities for military Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) operators and Special Operations Forces (SOF) to meet the challenges of improvised explosive devices (IEDs), force protection, and the war on terrorism.  EOD/LIC efforts focus in two areas:  support to SOF to combat terrorism; and access, detection, identification, and neutralization of all types of conventional explosive ordnance and improvised explosive devices.  Requirements submitted by the Joint Service EOD and Service Special Operations communities are prioritized and approved by OASD (SO/LIC).  With a decreased budget, CTTSO will proceed with The Improvised Device Defeat (IDD)subgroup expanding its inclusion of joint service EOD operators in its efforts since the Department’s announcement to cancel PE 0603121D8Z.  IDD will absorb the appropriate joint service EOD requirements for prioritization and interagency coordination going forward.  IDD will use the limited resources it possesses to provide the broadest possible capability improvement to the community.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The primary objective of the SRC program is to seek out and identify technical tools for the collection of actionable data and information which will assist DoD in its execution of Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) tasks.  To accomplish this objective, the program leverages emerging and existing developmental technologies from government and commercial ventures and operationalizes them to meet near term reconnaissance and surveillance operational requirements.  The operational tools transition unattended sensors, tagging devices, data transfer, remote delivery, and mobility/delivery of sensors into established Programs of Record throughout the DoD.  The program evaluates new and existing technical surveillance technologies and incorporates results into a reference database for future access.</r2:Description>

The IDC Program addresses technology capabilities necessary to enable sustained information dissemination campaigns in denied areas.  The IDC program, working as necessary with DoD and the interagency, develops, modifies, and demonstrates concepts, mechanisms, platforms and payloads to propagate themes and messages that convince target audiences to take action favorable to the United States and its allies. The Surveillance, Collection, and Operations Support (SCOS) subgroup has managed the IDC project for CTTSO since gaining oversight of the funding.  The language program orchestrated by SCOS will remain, albeit with a drastic reduction in funding without PE 0603121D8Z.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Deployed an enhanced training capability and planned for transition to a program of record a counter- “green on blue” capability for ISAF and U.S. forces. This effort assisted warfighters in detecting and mitigating insider threat attacks in partner, COIN and contingency operations, which is a serious issue that undercuts efforts at training host nation security forces, one of the pillars of Irregular Warfare.   Continued to support an Advanced Situational Awareness Capability that includes instructor-led training and supporting publications for tactical unit leaders at the US Army Maneuver Center of Excellence (MCoE), Ft. Benning, GA.  This capability led to trained units achieving the highest IED discovery rates in the OEF theater and saving coalition lives. This capability was ultimately transitioned to the US Army MCoE and they currently seek to enhance this capability with the training to counter “green on blue” violence that was previously mentioned in a hybrid training course. Continued to support Project LEGACY, a capability that significantly improves host-nation police counterinsurgency and military intelligence capabilities. Conducted and completed a spiral effort of Legacy to provide training that institutionalizes within U.S. Forces and the Interagency the capability developed by the Legacy Program to deliver police/military investigative training to host nation security forces.  Conducted an assessment of the relevance and applicability of specialized Security Force Assistance doctrine and operational approach for environments outside Operation Enduring Freedom.  Continued to elicit and refine requirements for users within rapid assessment framework in order to successfully pair SOF and Interagency users with off the shelf, high performance technologies and novel capabilities that fulfill specific requirements to share and analyze operational data better and faster.   Continued to research and develop threat group assessments based on open source information that allows operators and decision makers to understand the threats associated within their various areas of operation globally and how these threat groups affect the global security of the US and its allies.  Continued to develop and expand an effort that integrates and fuses heterogeneous social media data for use in strategic and tactical operational planning and preparation of the battlefield with new end users and different support environments. This effort provides a real time data and analysis capability along with mentorship and the analytical tradecraft to understand and monitor critical events and sentiments in open source social media.  Continued to develop frameworks and training to better understand and implement Combatant Command (COCOM) -level Communication Activities.  Delivered Return on Investment Analytic Framework for the COCOM VOICE Program in order to assist in garnering quantifiable measurements of performance, measurements of effectiveness and methods of determining overall return on investment (ROI) of program dollars.  Additionally, this effort also developed training designed to equip decision makers and operators with the knowledge and skills necessary to properly utilize population data and avoid common traps and risks in order to assess and appropriately interpret the population research required in support of these Communications Activities. Conducted deep-dive research and analysis aimed at defining today’s and the near future’s typology of adversaries, their capabilities, intentions, use of terrain, weapons, technologies, proliferation schemes, U.S. technology and operational advantages adversaries will work to offset, and what the U.S. should be looking for to be better prepared when it faces off with these types of threats.  Assisted with further development and understanding of the US Marine Corps concept of the Intelligence Driven Combat, to include international partnership and exchanges with Israel.   Developed enhanced MISO/PSYOP capabilities in planning, targeting and execution for support to special and unconventional warfare mission requirements.  Researched and started development of enhanced mobile capabilities for assessing and surveying assault and landing zones to support small units conducting distributed operations in remote and austere environments (to include resupply/drop zones, refueling, and helicopter landing zones). Conducted research, development, operational analysis, and field experimentation of efforts intended to counter emerging and extant threats in the intersection of the digital-physical domains (such as understanding the usage of social media by transnational criminal organizations in order to predict changes in support and influence; measures of effectiveness of social media and understanding how to use this media for intended effects). 
Initiated the Secure Unclassifed Network (SUNet), which provided protected dynamic enclaves of capability for multi-agency users (Law Enforcement, Interagency, Defense, Coalition, and Foreign Nationals) in order to provide inter-organizational collaborative areas and enhanced capabilities of data upload, searching and sharing from headquarters down to smartphones, tablets or laptops.  Research and development of a non-material effort intended to better understand indirect and irregular threats currently facing the US, and how to implement effective measures against them. The studies and related activities undertaken for this project will fall under three broad lines of effort: 1) an analysis of indirect/irregular actions employed historically and how these capabilities may be applied to today’s threat environment; 2) an analysis of current and the evolving irregular threat environment; and 3) identification and analysis of which of the capabilities the US could apply to prevail against irregular/indirect threats now and in the future.  Initiated a research and development effort to assess the degree and quality of organizational learning, adaptation, and innovation in the field over the course of the deployment of specific units engaged in IW; provide an initial framework to speed up and enhance organizational learning in the field; and operationalize framework through instruction/education aids.</r2:Text>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Combating Terrorism Technical Support (CTTS) program identifies capabilities to combat terrorism and irregular adversaries and delivers these capabilities to U.S., interagency, and international users through rapid research and development, advanced studies, and technical innovation.  Projects are distributed among 10 mission categories, in line with the interagency Technical Support Working Group (TSWG): Advanced Analytics and Capabilities, Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosives; Improvised Device Defeat; Investigative Support and Forensics; Personnel Protection, Physical Security; Surveillance, Collection, and Operations Support; Tactical Operations Support;  Training Technology Development; and a new working group, Irregular Warfare and Evolving Threats.  The CTTS program is a diverse, advanced technology development effort that capitalizes on interagency and international participation to demonstrate the utility or effectiveness of technology when applied to combating terrorism requirements.  It includes technology capability development, proof-of-principle demonstrations in field applications, and coordination to transition from development to operational use.  CTTS manages approximately 450 individual projects in support of Defense, federal, state, local, and international customers and partners. 

The CTTS program justified in the R-2 exhibit identifies the projects fully or partially funded by Congressional appropriations for the CTTS program.  However, the Combating Terrorism Technical Support Office (CTTSO) develops technology and provides support using external funds provided by other DoD and other Federal Departments and International partnerships. These projects and support activities are not necessarily reflected in this justification R-2; but the number of activities do reflect positively on the trust and competence that CTTSO has earned throughout the Department and interagency to rapidly conduct critical RDT&amp;E and provide innovative products.  

In FY 2013, CTTS focused on DoD requirements that supported military forces in demanding or hostile environments such as Afghanistan, Yemen, Africa, the Philippines, Mexico, and Colombia; by rapidly developing and delivering leading edge products such as tactical sensors and unmanned vehicles, personal and physical protection, user friendly apps for analytical tools and reference guides, and weapons, sights, and ammo modifications.  Several of the highly successful products include Legacy human source information programs in Afghanistan and Mexico, the Lighthouse and PALANTIR information collection and analysis systems, the Enhanced Mortar Targeting System (EMTAS), and Insider Threat Situation Awareness Training. 

For U.S. federal, state and local law enforcement and first responders, CTTS improved personal protection equipment for chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high explosive protection; as well as developed apps for interactive reference data to assist in identifying and neutralizing threat agents in the field and in laboratories.  CTTS also hosted interagency and foreign partner information exchange seminars and capability exercises to share and enhance response techniques and procedures for first responders.  

FY14 plans for CTTS will continue to address combating terrorism requirements from Defense, federal, state, local, and international customers and partners at home and abroad.  As the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan accelerates, CTTS will continue to address force protection needs for the remaining forces.  Additionally, CTTS will increasingly address technology requirements requested from USSOCOM’s field components as they increase their regional operations tempo in other parts of the world. Special emphasis will be for the Theater SOF in Africa and to support Theater SOF in the Pacific in support of the National Strategy to shift focus towards the Pacific.

In parallel, CTTS is increasing its support of the USMC as they reconstitute and improve the capacity and capabilities of the Marine Expeditionary Units.  Another area of increased emphasis that has become even more concerning will be the protection of U.S. personnel, to include State Department personnel in embassy and consulate locations overseas that need increased security.  

CTTS will continue to actively support the Department’s Homeland Defense mission at NORTHCOM, including Defense support of civil authorities, interagency coordination, Special Operations support, and security cooperation.  Consistent with that focus, this office will also work to address Department of Defense Security requirements for advanced technology and capabilities that will (1) enhance security along the U.S. Southwest Border and (2) proactively address improvised devices and other chemical, biological, nuclear and radiological threats in a domestic environment.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Began developing a prototype entity extraction/guided clustering software that significantly improves the quality and accuracy of data analyses by enabling analysts to change relationships in the data in real-time as part of a “guided clustering” capability while automating the actual analysis.  This technique should allow the analyst to identify clusters of related data in large data sets and represents a significant improvement of a key analytic tool.  Continued development and proof of concept for multi-model analyses using Model Predictive Controllers (MPC) to make better decisions and establish measures of effectiveness for multiple courses of action.   Initiated the development of an enhanced Critical Thinking Tool that allows complex reasoning approaches to be accomplished by analysts with a user-friendly platform that guides them through processes that are currently difficult to use (e.g. Evidence-based reasoning) but very valuable.  Initiated the application of an additional MPC model that allows regional agent-based analyses that also reduces dependence on subject matter experts for MPC analyses once conditions are initially set.</r2:Text>

                                                        <r2:Description>U.S. Forces face a threat environment where irregular, state-sponsored and non-state hybrid and conventional adversaries armed with easy to employ precision weapons, global surveillance and networking will have the capability to undercut the operational and technical superiority of U.S. Conventional and Special Operations Forces. These evolving threats will progressively blur the boundaries between conventional and irregular warfare. Offering foresight about disruptions of this nature through rapid, adaptive demonstration of novel operational concepts so that concept developers can explore new models and capabilities before a conflict begins must be a primary goal.

The IW/ET subgroup develops new concepts and capabilities for warfighters and inter-agency partners who are confronting the complexity of the current operational environment, while simultaneously looking outward rather than inward to appropriately size, shape and develop their forces. In accordance with the QDR’s emphasis on preparation to defeat adversaries and succeed in a wide range of contingencies, IW/ET will engage in operational assessment, concept development, and independent validation of unique prototype capabilities to identify, confront and defeat evolving threats.</r2:Description>

FCT’s broad reach across our allies and friendly foreign countries will enable finding and developing innovative, cost effective, and potentially interoperable solutions for the DoD, Multi-Service and Combatant Command (COCOM) priority requirements. 

In FY 2015, Foreign Comparative Testing (FCT) funding from Program Element (PE) 0605130D8Z is being realigned to PE 0603133D8Z for Budget Activity alignment and emphasis on prototypes.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Foreign Comparative Testing (FCT) program supports the warfighter by leveraging technologies and equipment from allied nations and coalition partners to satisfy U.S. defense requirements, thereby accelerating the United Sates acquisition process and lowering development costs.  The FCTs enhance interoperability, facilitate international collaboration, expand opportunities for prototyping to increase competition in innovation and enable more efficient and affordable transition of technologies into acquisition programs of record.  Authorized by Title 10, U.S. Code, Section 2350a (g), the FCT program is managed by the Office of Secretary of Defense (Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (DASD) Rapid Fielding), Comparative Technology Office (CTO).  The FCT projects are sponsored by the Services and SOCOM.  Evaluation processes for project selection include a detailed review to confirm the proposed item addresses valid requirements and DoD priorities, a thorough market survey, and development of a viable acquisition strategy.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Foreign Comparative Testing (FCT) program supports the warfighter by leveraging advanced technologies and equipment from allied nations and coalition partners to satisfy U.S. defense requirements, thereby accelerating the U.S. acquisition process and lowering development costs.  The FCTs enhance interoperability, facilitate international collaboration, expand opportunities for prototyping and enable more efficient and affordable transition of technologies into acquisition programs of record.  Authorized by Title 10, U.S. Code, Section 2350a(g), the FCT program is managed by the Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD), Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (DASD) Rapid Fielding (RF), Comparative Technology Office (CTO).  The FCT projects are sponsored by the Services and U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM).  Evaluation processes for project selection include a detailed review to confirm the proposed item addresses valid requirements and DoD priorities, a thorough market survey, and development of a viable acquisition strategy.  

Since the program's inception in 1980, OSD has initiated 671 projects; 619 projects have been completed to date.  Of the 324 evaluations that met the sponsors' requirements, 252 led to procurements worth approximately $11.000 billion in FY 2013 constant year dollars.  With an OSD investment of about $1.170 billion, the FCT Program realized an estimated research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&amp;E) cost avoidance of $7.800 billion in FY 2013 constant year dollars.

The FCT program is a catalyst for teaming and other business relationships between foreign and U.S. industries.  Many successful FCT projects result in the licensed production of the qualified foreign item in the United States.  Other nations recognize the long-term value of such practices for competing in the United States defense market and the resultant strengthening of the "two-way street" in Defense procurement.  The result often means the creation of jobs and contributions to local economies throughout the United States.  To date, companies across 33 states benefited from FCT projects.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                        <r2:Description>The current M3 Carl Gustaf Recoilless Rifle was introduced to US forces in 1991.  The original version used a thin steel barrel liner containing the rifling, strengthened by a carbon fiber outer sleeve.  External steel parts were eventually replaced with aluminum alloys or plastics thereby reducing the weapon weight from 36 pounds to 21 pounds.  At 21 pounds the weapon is extremely heavy, especially when also carrying 84mm ammunition.  This M3A1 project will eliminate 6 pounds (28 percent) from the existing system by replacing various components (bolt, trigger, venturi, and ancillary parts) without changing the firing procedures, operations or ammunition.  Since the weapons’ operational characteristics will not be changed, this low risk approach will produce a lighter weight 84mm shoulder fired weapon without going through a costly and time consuming process to test, qualify, and re-certify an entirely new modernized weapon system.  This is continuing project which was previously funded during FY 2014 in PE 0605130D8Z.</r2:Description>

                                                        <r2:Description>The project will test and evaluate a Tank and Infantry Fighting Vehicle gunnery training system that wirelessly transmits live audio and video feeds of weapon systems data to a mobile monitoring station.  The MGLFMS enables instructors to evaluate crew functions, make instantaneous corrections, and provides recording capability for detailed after action reviews.  Foreign data has shown that training with this system significantly increases probability of gunnery crews placing first round on target.  The system also provides an essential tool for instructors to evaluate and make the necessary feedback to ensure the analytical abilities that encompasses all the gunnery skills required for accurate fire.  Several North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) allies currently train with this same equipment.  This is continuing project which was previously funded during FY 2014 in PE 0605130D8Z.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The mission of the Joint Department of Defense (DoD)/Department of Energy (DOE) Munitions Technology Development Program (JMP) is to develop new and innovative warhead, explosive, fuzing, and lifecycle technologies and modeling tools to enable major improvements in conventional munitions.  The JMP supports the development and exploration of advanced munitions concepts and enabling technologies that precede Service-specific system engineering.  A Memorandum of Understanding signed in 1985 by DoD and DOE provides the basis for the cooperative effort and for cost-sharing the long-term commitment to this effort.  The DoD funds budgeted in this justification are matched dollar for dollar by DOE funds.  Through this interdepartmental cooperation, DoD’s relatively small annual investment leverages DOE’s substantial investments in intellectual capital and highly specialized skills, advanced scientific equipment and facilities, and computational tools not available within DoD.  Under the auspices of the JMP, the integration of DOE technologies with Joint and Individual Services’ needs has provided major advances in warfighting capabilities over many years and continues to play a crucial role in the exploration, development, and transition of new technologies needed by the Services.

The JMP seeks to develop:  improved modeling and simulation tools for munitions design and evaluation, including evaluation of vulnerability (for example: design of insensitive munitions (IM)); novel experimental techniques and material property databases to support modeling and simulation and materials characterizations; higher power and safer energetic materials (EMs)(e.g., explosives and propellants); miniaturized, lower-cost, and higher reliability fuzes, initiators, power systems, and sensors; design tools to enable development of higher performance warheads and weapons—such as penetrators—that are hardened against high impact loads; and tools to assess the health and reliability of the munitions stockpile and predict lifetimes based on these assessments.

The JMP is aligned with Department strategic plans and policies such as:

•	Advancing munitions for contingency operations, particularly for the reduction of unintended collateral effects.
•	Reducing time and cost for acquisition of munitions.
•	Rapidly transitioning science and technology (S&amp;T) to support the warfighter in today’s conflicts.
•	Establishing future core capabilities and maintaining our national S&amp;T capabilities through joint investment and interagency cooperation and teaming.
•	Aiding in recruiting and retaining high-caliber scientists and engineers at DoD S&amp;T organizations.
•	Developing advanced munitions technologies to support the increased role of conventional weapons to deter and respond to non-nuclear attack, as described in the Nuclear Posture Review report.
•	Developing safer munitions that are compliant with IM standards to meet statutory and Department policy requirements.

The JMP has established a successful collaborative community of DoD and DOE scientists and engineers. This community develops technologies of interest to both Departments within a structured framework of technical reviews and scheduled milestones.  The JMP is administered and monitored by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and reviewed annually by the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), which is comprised of over 25 senior executives from the Army, Navy, Air Force, Special Operations Command, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, OSD, and DOE.  Projects are organized in eight Technology Coordinating Groups (TCG) that bring together the disciplines necessary to properly evaluate technical content, relevance, and progress.  The TCGs conduct semi-annual technical peer reviews of JMP projects and plans.  DoD Service laboratory technical experts lead each of the TCGs to ensure that the technologies under development address high-priority DoD needs.  The JMP also promotes more in-depth technical exchange via short-term visiting scientist and engineer assignments at both the DOE and the DoD laboratories.

The JMP has a long history of successful transitions and significant Return on Investment (ROI).

•	The JMP is the primary provider of high performance, physics-based, structural mechanics computer codes used by DoD.  The Department expects this heavy reliance on DOE codes to grow for several reasons including: preference for using DOE codes because they are export-controlled; DOE codes are scalable, incorporate multiphysics modules, run on massively parallel computer systems, and the Department can obtain source codes to modify the tools for individual Service needs.  According to the FY 2014 High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP) Requirements Analysis Report, the DOE computer codes are used for over 82 percent of all (classified and unclassified) structural mechanics simulations and for virtually all of the classified calculations run by DoD on HPCMP platforms.  The CPU (central processing unit) hours for CTH alone grew by eight fold between FY12 to FY14 (from 63 million CPU hours to 584 CPU hours).
•	A significant number of defense industrial contractors also use the DOE structural mechanics computer codes.
•	Cheetah, a standalone thermochemical computer code, is the most widely used code by DoD and defense contractors for predicting performance of energetic materials.
•	The Army Research &amp; Engineering Development Center (ARDEC) has stated that the DOE computer codes are now routinely used to design all new warheads.  The use of these tools has reduced the number of validation tests required for each new warhead from about five to one with concomitant cost and time savings.  For example, DOE codes were used to analyze the fusible plug for Excalibur, saving the department close to $2 million dollars.
•	The Army Research Laboratory has used DOE computer codes to develop and deploy new armor solutions to Iraq and Afghanistan with unprecedented speed.
•	New munitions’ case material and explosive fill technologies provide the warfighter with a lethal and low collateral damage capability.  These technologies have been transitioned to the Focused Lethality Munition variant of the Small Diameter Bomb, which is currently fielded.  The technologies are also the basis for a new GBU 129 weapon that is currently under rapid development to meet a Joint Urgent Operational Need requirement for a low-collateral Mk-82 class weapon.
•	The Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization (JIEDDO) has supported applications of JMP technologies, including:  new compact, lightweight synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems for counter-Improvised Explosive Device (IED) efforts; pre-deployment training of military personnel by DOE explosive experts on how to recognize feed stocks and processes for homemade explosives; and use of massively parallel, multiphysics computer codes to understand how explosive blast waves cause brain injury and how to mitigate these injuries.
•	An erosive initiator technology developed under the JMP has been transitioned to the Services for use in selectable output weapons and self-destruct capabilities.
•	A novel approach to controlling the sensitivity and therefore the initiability of explosives using microwave energy, as well two new, insensitive energetic materials have transitioned to development projects in the Joint IM Technology and Joint Fuze Technology Programs.
•	Reliability analysis tools were used by Army Missile Command to assess Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM), Advanced Medium Range Air to Air Missile (AMRAAM), and Tube-launched, Optically-tracked, Wire command data-linked guided Missile (TOW).
•	Robotic demilitarization processing systems were installed at several locations, including a system at Hawthorne Army Depot, to recover copper shape charge liners, Comp A5, and grenade bodies.

The JMP works with the Defense Ordnance Technology Consortium (DOTC) and the National Warheads and Energetics Consortium (NWEC) of industrial suppliers to equitably and efficiently transition JMP technologies to defense industrial contractors. In addition to the computer codes mentioned earlier, the JMP has transitioned case technology for low-collateral weapons, low-temperature co-fired ceramic technology for smaller, less expensive fuze electronic components, and erosive initiator technology for selectable effects weapons to defense industrial suppliers.

The integrated DoD and DOE efforts within the JMP are transitioning new munitions’ technologies to the Department and the defense industrial base through the advanced development process. The JMP is a focal point for collaborative work by nearly 300 DoD and DOE scientists and engineers. Executive and technical leaders from both Departments consider the JMP a model of cooperation, both within their respective departments and between departments. The highly challenging technical objectives of the approximately 35 JMP projects require multi-year efforts and sustained, long-term investments to achieve success.

The JMP projects are divided into five technical focus areas: Computational Mechanics and Material Modeling; Energetic Materials; Initiators, Fuzes, and Sensors; Warhead and Penetration Technology; and Munitions Lifecycle Technologies.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The mission of the Department of Defense (DoD)/Department of Energy (DOE) Joint Munitions Technology Development Program (JMP) is to develop new and innovative warhead, explosive, fuzing, and lifecycle technologies and tools to enable major improvements in conventional munitions.  The JMP supports the development and exploration of advanced munitions concepts and enabling technologies that precede Service-specific system engineering.  A Memorandum of Understanding signed in 1985 by DoD and DOE provides the basis for the cooperative effort and for cost-sharing the long-term commitment to this effort.  The JMP funds budgeted in this justification are matched dollar for dollar by DOE funds.  Through this interdepartmental cooperation, DoD’s relatively small investment leverages DOE’s substantial investments in intellectual capital and highly specialized skills, advanced scientific equipment and facilities, and computational tools not available within DoD.  Under the auspices of the JMP, the integration of DOE technologies with Joint and Individual Services’ needs has provided major advances in warfighting capabilities over many years and continues to play a crucial role in the exploration, development, and transition of new technologies needed by the Services.

The JMP seeks to develop: improved modeling and simulation tools for munitions design and evaluation, including evaluation of vulnerability (for example:  design of insensitive munitions (IM)); novel experimental techniques and material property databases to support modeling and simulation; higher power and safer explosives and propellants; miniaturized, lower-cost, and higher reliability fuzes, initiators, power systems, and sensors; design tools to enable development of higher performance warheads and weapons—such as penetrators—that are hardened against high impact loads; and tools to assess the health and reliability of the munitions stockpile and predict lifetimes based on these assessments.

The JMP is aligned with Department strategic plans and policies such as:

– Munitions for contingency operations, particularly for the reduction of unintended collateral effects.
– Reducing time and cost for acquisition of munitions.
– Rapidly transitioning science and technology (S&amp;T) to support the warfighter in today’s conflicts.
– Establishing future core capabilities and maintaining our national S&amp;T capabilities through joint investment and interagency cooperation and teaming.
– Aiding in recruiting and retaining high-caliber scientists and engineers at DoD S&amp;T organizations.
– Developing advanced munitions technologies to support the increased role of conventional weapons to deter and respond to non-nuclear attack, as described in the Nuclear Posture Review report.
– Developing safer munitions that are compliant with IM standards to meet statutory and Department policy requirements.

The JMP has established a successful collaborative community of DoD and DOE scientists and engineers.  This community develops technologies of interest to both Departments within a structured framework of technical reviews and scheduled milestones.  The JMP is administered and monitored by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and reviewed annually by the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), which is comprised of over 25 senior executives from the Army, Navy, Air Force, Special Operations Command, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, OSD, and DOE.  Projects are organized in eight Technology Coordinating Groups (TCG) that bring together the disciplines necessary to properly evaluate technical content, relevance, and progress.  The TCG conduct semi-annual technical peer reviews of JMP projects and plans. DoD Service laboratory technical experts lead each of the TCG to ensure that the technologies under development address high-priority DoD needs.  The JMP also promotes more in-depth technical exchange via short-term visiting scientist and engineer assignments at both the DOE and the DoD laboratories.

The JMP has a long history of successful transitions and significant Return on Investment (ROI).

– The JMP is the primary provider of high performance structural mechanics computer codes used by DoD.  According to the FY 2010 High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP) Requirements Analysis Report, the DOE computer codes are used for over 70 percent of all (classified and unclassified) structural mechanics simulations and for virtually all of the classified calculations run by DoD on HPCMP platforms.  The Department expects this heavy reliance on DOE codes to grow for several reasons including: preference for using DOE codes because they are export-controlled; DOE codes are scalable, incorporate multiphysics, and run on massively parallel computer systems; and the Department can obtain source codes to modify for individual Service needs.
– A significant number of defense industrial contractors also use the DOE structural mechanics computer codes.
– CHEETAH, a standalone thermochemical computer code, is the most widely used code by DoD and defense contractors for predicting performance of energetic materials.
– The Army Armament Research, Development &amp; Engineering Center (ARDEC) has stated that the DOE computer codes are now routinely used to design all new warheads. The use of these tools has reduced the number of validation tests required for each new warhead from about five to one with concomitant cost and time savings.
– The Army Research Laboratory has used DOE computer codes to develop and deploy new armor solutions to Iraq and Afghanistan with unprecedented speed.
– New munitions’ case material and explosive fill technologies provide the warfighter with a lethal and low collateral damage capability.  These technologies have been transitioned to the Focused Lethality Munition variant of the Small Diameter Bomb, which is currently fielded.  The technologies are also the basis for a new GBU 129 weapon that is currently under rapid development to meet a Joint Urgent Operational Need requirement for a low-collateral Mk-82 class weapon.
– The Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization (JIEDDO) has supported applications of JMP technologies, including: compact synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems for counter-Improvised Explosive Device (IED) efforts; pre-deployment training of military personnel by DOE explosive experts on how to recognize feed stocks and processes for homemade explosives; and use of massively parallel, multiphysics computer codes to understand how explosive blast waves cause brain injury and how to mitigate these injuries.
– An erosive initiator technology developed under the JMP has been transitioned to the Services for use in selectable output weapons and self-destruct capabilities.
– A novel approach to controlling the sensitivity and therefore the initiability of explosives using microwave energy, as well two new, insensitive energetic materials have transitioned to development projects in the Joint IM Technology and Joint Fuze Technology Programs.
– Reliability analysis tools were used by Army Missile Command to assess Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM), Advanced Medium Range Air to Air Missile (AMRAAM), and Tube-launched, Optically-tracked, Wire command data-linked guided Missile (TOW).
– Robotic demilitarization processing systems were installed at several locations, including a system at Hawthorne Army Depot to recover copper shape charge liners, Comp A5, and grenade bodies. 

The JMP also works with the Defense Ordnance Technology Consortium (DOTC) and the National Armaments Consortium (NAC) of industrial suppliers to equitably and efficiently transition JMP technologies to defense industrial contractors.  In addition to the computer codes mentioned earlier, the JMP has transitioned case technology for low-collateral weapons, low-temperature co-fired ceramic technology for smaller, less expensive fuze electronic components, and erosive initiator technology for selectable effects weapons to defense industrial suppliers.

The integrated DoD and DOE efforts within the JMP are transitioning new munitions’ technologies to the Department and the defense industrial base through the advanced development process.  The JMP is a focal point for collaborative work by nearly 300 DoD and DOE scientists and engineers.  Technical leaders from both Departments consider the JMP a model of cooperation, both within their respective departments and between departments.  The highly challenging technical objectives of the approximately 35 JMP projects require multi-year efforts and sustained, long-term investments to achieve success.

The JMP projects are divided into five technical focus areas:  Computational Mechanics and Material Modeling; Energetic Materials; Initiators, Fuzes, and Sensors; Warhead and Penetration Technology; and Munitions Lifecycle Technologies.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Numeric tools are the foundation that makes possible the integration of mechanics, materials science, physics, and chemistry.  This focus area also includes an extensive experimental component consisting of phenomenological or “discovery” experiments that drive model development; calibration experiments to compliment models; and experiments for model and code validation.

                                                        <r2:Description>The goals of this technical focus area are to develop new energetic materials (EMs) and supporting technologies to satisfy the competing requirements for smaller, more lethal, and safer munitions.  Work is primarily focused on explosives, gun and rocket propellants, and, to a lesser extent, pyrotechnics.  The projects include development of: new EMs, including new molecules in a range of particle sizes and morphologies; new EM formulations; a fundamental understanding of energetic properties and performance; and computational tools for analysis of performance and sensitivity.  New materials and formulations are developed with the recognition that costs must be reasonable, chemical feed stocks reliable, and manufacturing processes suitable for scale-up to production levels.

Both Federal statute and Department policy direct the development of safer, less sensitive munitions.  Making munitions less sensitive while maintaining explosive or propellant performance is a difficult challenge.  This goal is best attained through a combination of new EM development, EM characterization, and more sophisticated modeling and simulation tools.  It is cost prohibitive to qualify weapons for compliance with insensitive munitions requirements through testing alone.  A better, and in many cases, the only means to qualify these weapons is with the combination of analysis based on validated computational tools and a few well-designed tests.

The Department also needs munitions that provide selectable effects.  To achieve these effects, weapons designers need to thoroughly understand the performance of EMs used in both the main weapon fill and the initiation systems.  Distributed fuzing systems can provide selectable effects as well as safer munitions, but such complex, small-scale systems require more complete knowledge of EM detonation physics and in some cases, new EMs designed for this application.

The desire for smaller and lighter munitions is driven in large part by the increasing dependence on unmanned weapons platforms and to some extent by the need to reduce logistical burden, especially energy consumption.  New EMs are needed to meet the munitions weight and size requirements while maintaining lethality and safety.

The Department is working to increase the range and velocity of weapons and to develop weapons against hardened targets.  These applications subject EMs to high accelerations and shock loads.  To support the development of these new systems, we need to improve our ability to model EM under higher impact loads and to characterize relevant properties to determine their ability to survive in these aggressive environments.  We may also need to develop new, more robust EMs that survive impact loads while maintaining lethality and initiability.

-  Synthesis, properties, and scale-up of new energetic compounds.
-  Insensitive munitions and surety.
-  New energetic materials formulation and characterization.
-  Cheetah thermochemical code development and experiments.

                                                        <r2:Description>The goals of this technical focus area are to develop new materials, components, diagnostic techniques, and modeling and simulation tools for fuzing systems. Initiators, fuzes, and sensors must work reliably together to prevent unintended detonation, to correctly detect intended targets, and to initiate detonation when required.   Projects in this focus area support the Department’s needs to miniaturize fuzing systems.  Smaller systems are required for several reasons including: compatibility with smaller and lighter weapons systems; trading volume in munitions for other components such as additional explosives, higher energy and power density power sources, or enhanced guidance systems; increasing reliability through redundancy (use of two or more smaller initiating systems); and upgrading existing sub-munitions with smarter and more reliable fuzing systems. 

The miniaturization of fuzing systems requires new material and components, new power systems, new diagnostic techniques, and improved modeling tools for microdetonics.  The Department also needs weapons systems with selectable effects and these effects may be achieved with multi-point initiation systems.  Such systems are inherently more complex and require improved characterization of initiator materials and components, as well as more sophisticated modeling and simulation tools.  To attain greater precision and to avoid unintended collateral effects when weapons are used in the complex environment of counter-insurgency or counter-terrorist operations, target sensors must be reliable and provide high-fidelity discrimination.  Projects in this focus area are developing technologies to achieve this level of performance in compact packages.

-  Firing systems technology: FireMod firing set code model development and validation, 1.6 hazard classification detonator development, and initiation and detonation physics on the millimeter scale.

                                                        <r2:Description>This focus area supports the development of new warheads and penetrator weapons through advances in materials processing and characterization, instrumentation, and computational codes.  In recent years there have been significant increases in warhead performance directly attributed to our ability to understand and accurately model the physics and fine details of new warhead designs, and to advances in increasingly sophisticated material processing.  The Department’s requirement to achieve more precise weapon effects with minimum collateral damage is supported by work on controlled fragmentation, non-fragmenting warhead cases, and multiphase blast explosives (MBX).  More recently, increases in performance and reductions in vulnerability are being achieved through improved warhead integration into munitions using a systems-oriented approach. 

The goals for penetrator weapons are to investigate, develop, and transition advanced technologies for the design, development, and performance assessment of the next generation of high performance, precision strike weapons.  This effort directly supports national initiatives to defeat hard and deeply buried targets, which are proliferating worldwide, and to deny/defeat weapons of mass destruction.  The work addresses high-velocity penetration into granular materials (sand and soil), penetration into high strength concrete, new penetrator materials and designs, and non-inertial onboard instrumentation.

                                                        <r2:Description>This focus area supports improving the Department’s ability to understand, measure, predict, and mitigate safety and reliability problems caused by materials aging and degradation in weapons systems.  Current stockpile assessment methods typically focus on addressing materials aging and reliability problems after they occur, rather than anticipating and avoiding future problems or failure mechanisms.  The overall objective of this work is to develop a toolset of computational models that are able to quantitatively predict materials aging processes and ultimately improve the long-term reliability of weapons systems, subassemblies, and/or components.  These objectives are achieved by: identifying aging mechanisms, quantifying the rates at which those aging mechanisms occur, developing predictive models, and using these models to predict the munitions stockpile reliability.  An additional objective of this work is to develop technologies and methodologies to enable munitions health management and condition-based maintenance.

The specific projects in the munitions lifecycle technologies focus area are:

-  Predictive materials aging including: solder interconnect reliability, corrosion of electronics, and adhesive degradation.
-  Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) reliability.
-  Military use of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) electronics.
-  Complex system health assessment.</r2:Description>

The activities in FY 2015 deviate slightly from this balance as studies completed during FY 2014 (funded through other PEs) mature into experiments, prototypes, then subsequently testing and integration. Accordingly, the following activities are planned for FY 2015:

-	Quick Reaction Analytic efforts responding to critical questions related to vulnerabilities to developing missiles, options for electronic warfare capability applied to missile defense, Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR), and undersea engagements.						
-	Prototype development of an electronic attack capability for a high priority ballistic missile threat.	 			
-	Prototype development of an electronic attack for a high priority surface naval engagement.					
-	Analytic prototype development of a next generation electronic warfare capability for both air and surface based kill chains.		
-	Development of analytic tools and analysis for electronic warfare in a complex environment.					
-	Development of capability improvement prototype concept for resilient ISR.	
-	Development of capability improvement architecture and prototype concept for assured tactical communications.			
-	Experimental data collection applied to ISR capabilities.				
-	Architecture assessment and element prototyping for countering situational awareness resources.			
-	System and technology assessment for warfare from under the sea.</r2:Text>

Technology demonstrations of innovative concepts and prototypes, backed by detailed performance and effects analysis, will focus on Secretary/Department Strategic Vectors, and Chairman’s Gap Assessment of capability shortfalls.  Concepts that provide capability improvements to Combatant Commanders will be identified for accelerated prototype demonstration and worked as joint projects with the Services to speed transition time for rapid fielding.  The program objectives are to develop disruptive anticipatory products, processes and services suited for quick deployment to fulfill emerging pre-conflict requirements.  Disruptive technology and process demonstrations will leverage low cost, commercial, and often low technology options that don’t conform to the typical DoD acquisition business model but have the potential to disrupt and change warfighting capabilities by avoiding or creating technological surprise.  Demonstrations will include protection capabilities in an era of increased theft of Defense-related Intellectual Property (IP).</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Department of Defense must be ready to meet the widespread and growing asymmetric electronic threats that are proliferating at an alarming rate, enabled by widely available commercial electronic components and devices.  These range from improvised devices constructed from commercially available electronic and industrial components to dedicated military devices that could be used in ways that diminish our technological advantage in conflicts with nation-states.  The surprisingly fast appearance of these threats is accelerating and is now happening quicker than the requirements and acquisition process can respond.

The use of asymmetric devices is well understood by terrorists and nation-states alike.  Using man portable air defense systems, mortars, and improvised explosive devices actuated by electronic components terrorists have attacked both air and ground forces and pose a threat in any region due to their portability.  Unmanned aircraft systems, also strongly enabled by electronic components are proliferating and pose a threat both as military capability and as potential terrorist weapons delivery mechanism.  

Technological surprise and speed of appearance are two asymmetries that highlight the need to rapidly develop and field Electronic Warfare, Information Operations, and Asymmetric Warfare capabilities capable of neutralizing such threats in ways that are both fiscally and temporally responsive.  This program element investigates means to rapidly mitigate asymmetric threats by integrating advanced commercial and military off-the-shelf technologies in innovative ways and rapidly demonstrating new technological capabilities to augment and/or reduce risk when inserted into service programs of record.  Efforts will also look for methods to employ asymmetric principles against our adversaries.

Beginning in FY 2014, the Joint Electronic Advanced Technology (JEAT) project reorganized to be in better alignment with Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering electronic warfare research priorities.  Particularly, JEAT established three pillars that will support the JEAT approach to innovation:  1) experimentation/demonstration, 2) advanced technology development/verification, and 3) innovative technology exploration.  The overarching JEAT philosophy is to be adaptive and to help lead the pace of rapid electronic systems development and the evolving threat picture.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Department of Defense (DoD) must be ready to meet the widespread and growing asymmetric electronic threats that are proliferating at an alarming rate, enabled by widely available commercial electronic components and devices.  These range from improvised devices constructed from commercially available electronic and industrial components to dedicated military devices that could be used in ways that diminish our technological advantage in conflicts with nation-states.  The surprisingly fast appearance of these threats is accelerating quicker than the requirements and acquisition process can respond.

The use of asymmetric devices is well understood by terrorists and nation-states alike.  Using man portable air defense systems, mortars, and improvised explosive devices actuated by electronic components terrorists have attacked both air and ground forces and pose a threat in any region due to their portability.  Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), also strongly enabled by electronic components are proliferating and pose a threat both as a military capability and as a potential terrorist weapons delivery mechanism.  

Technological surprise and speed of appearance are two asymmetries that highlight the need to rapidly develop and field Electronic Warfare, Information Operations, and Asymmetric Warfare capabilities capable of neutralizing such threats in ways that are both fiscally and temporally responsive.  This program element investigates means to rapidly mitigate asymmetric threats by integrating advanced commercial and military off-the-shelf technologies in innovative ways; rapidly demonstrating new technological capabilities to augment and/or reduce risk when inserted into service programs of record.  Efforts will also look for methods to employ asymmetric principles against our adversaries.

Beginning in FY 2014, the Joint Electronic Advanced Technology (JEAT) project reorganized to be in better alignment with Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD(R&amp;E)) electronic warfare research priorities.  Particularly, JEAT established three pillars that will support the JEAT approach to innovation:  1) experimentation/demonstration, 2) advanced technology development/verification, and 3) innovative technology exploration.  The overarching JEAT philosophy is to be adaptive and to help lead the pace of rapid electronic systems development and the evolving threat picture.

Experimentation/Demonstration:

Vigilant Hammer - A recurring multi-year, multi-agency, live, virtual, and constructive (LVC) venue of increasing complexity and difficulty which advances the state of the art for the detection, classification, geolocation and prosecution of electromagnetic signals of interest using DoD and national resources.  The event will be modeled after the BLACK DART and Trident Spectre venues, and will include scripted and free play scenarios intended to give participants an opportunity to identify synergies and incrementally build capabilities to engage threats.  Engagement (Hammer) payloads will be developed and vetted through distributed electronic effects development. 

Advanced Technology Development/Verification:

Distributed electronic effects development – A laboratory and developmental construct that will assess emerging Electronic Warfare (EW) technologies, allowing more effective coordination of sensor and electronic attack capabilities to deliver multi-point, collaborative EW services to warfighters. Distributed electronic effects development will seek to identify and match technologies together that have natural synergies and produce more capability than the sum of the individual capabilities.  

Software Programmable/Spectrum Diverse Electronic Attack (EA) Capability – Opportunities exist to adapt existing technology used for communication and other purposes into highly configurable EA capability.  This technology will help counter adversary movement into advanced military purpose digital electronic systems.  Beginning in FY 2014, JEAT began to adapt software configurable communications technology to be used as part of a distributed, networked, EA capability that can be readily adapted for installation in a wide variety of host platforms.

Innovative Technology Exploration:

Adaptive/Asymmetric Technology – This effort directly supports ASD(R&amp;E), Director EW and Countermeasures (EW&amp;C) by performing analyses and studies of emerging asymmetric threats.  Past efforts under this JEAT project include the Aircraft Survivability Equipment Joint Analysis Team and the Helicopter Survivability Task Force, both of which resulted in significant strategic technology investments by the Department.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

These sensors typically provide the pilot with separate displays of radar warning and missile warning to guide the pilot in selecting automatic or manual countermeasures against radar, laser, or radio frequency guided threats.  These unfused sensors create a serial information stream which can induce an inadequate response to the threat.  Federated systems consume weight, space, and power which are at a premium in small platforms.  Additionally, there currently is no coordinated effort to develop integrated situational awareness or control countermeasures that include off-board systems.</r2:Description>

Rotorcraft Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) Experiment (RASE) – JEAT completed its objectives during a RASE experiment in FY 2013, conducting the third and final annual RASE event.  Objectives for this event included geo-location of the point of origin of a hostile projectile, networking the point of origin information off-board and exploring the technical feasibility of delivering non-lethal countermeasures to the shooter.</r2:Text>

Primary payoff is an assessment of current system capabilities and limitations against the threat and capture of baseline system performance against the threat set for developing technologies.  Trident Spectre provides a venue for various members of Special Forces, Conventional Forces and Intelligence Community to collaborate on and evaluate technologies and techniques related to “Tactical Intelligence” in a technical, operational, and safe environment.  Trident Spectre provides an opportunity for capability developers (scientists, engineers, designers) to interact directly with tactical operators, collectors and analysts; and a process that correctly and efficiently reviews potential Tactical Intelligence technologies and techniques that will enhance the operational capability of the DoD activities in OCO.  Primary payoff is improved connectivity and more efficient collection and dissemination of Tactical Intelligence.  Customers include United States Central Command, Special Operations Command (SOCOM), ASD(R&amp;E), DoD Conventional/Special Forces, and members of the Intelligence Community.

Of particular emphasis is the use of near-real time analysis of an environment full of diverse commercial and military purpose emitters to quickly produce actionable, decision quality information that allows us to use the spectrum to our advantage.  The objective of this effort is to encourage better collaboration and capability development including the military services and the Intelligence Community.  In this first year of effort, JEAT will study opportunities for better utilization of Intelligence Community derived information and capability.</r2:Text>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementNote>Historically, the Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (JCTD) Program has worked primarily with the Combatant Commands (COCOMs) and Services to identify DoD priorities and accelerated the development and demonstration of technical solutions.  However, with the end of current conflicts there has been a strategic shift to a more balanced approach that will continue to address COCOM needs in conjunction with initiating broader, longer-term JCTDs to address DoD’s strategic initiatives to mitigate emergent threats, address affordability and interoperability of defense systems.  The JCTD Program will begin to employ developmental and operational prototypes to address these longer-term DoD priorities.

The shift in the JCTD Program will also result in a shift in Program metrics.  JCTDs supporting the DoD’s strategic initiatives will tend to be longer and larger, with less focus on transition and partner funding.  Overall, we envision initiating fewer yet more impactful JCTD projects. 

In FY 2015, Disruptive Demonstrations (Project P264) funding will be transferred from Program Element (PE) 0603648D8Z (Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (JCTD)) to PE 0603289D8Z (Advanced Innovative Analysis &amp; Concepts).</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The JCTD Program directly addresses DoD, multi-Service and COCOMs’ priorities through partnering and cost sharing with solution providers and resource sponsors.  The value and impact of the JCTD Program is to cost-effectively address the COCOMs’ priorities and the Department’s strategic initiatives to mitigate emergent threats, address affordability and interoperability of defense systems through developmental and operational prototyping.  JCTDs provide key partnerships with the Department, Services, and other government agencies, select allies, and industry that allow for expedited development, deployment, and evaluation of capability solutions with the potential to close validated warfighting capability gaps.  The JCTD Program typically demonstrates solutions in two - four years and has a transition rate to the warfighter greater than 80 percent.  At least 57 JCTD projects supported Operation Enduring Freedom, 74 projects supported Operation Iraqi Freedom, and over 30 percent of JCTD projects involved partner nations.  These JCTD partnerships also enable interdepartmental cooperation and joint capability development (e.g. Departments of Homeland Security, State, Transportation, National Aeronautics and Space Administration and Justice).  In FY 2013, the JCTD Program successfully demonstrated and transitioned several key warfighter capabilities that address operational warfighting needs of the Department, providing affordable and sustainable solutions.

Key values demonstrated by the JCTD program are:
• The JCTD Program has a long history of providing enduring capabilities.  See “Section D.  Acquisition Strategy” for more details on transition.
• The JCTD Program delivers capabilities rapidly and projects execute far quicker than the traditional DoD Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution (PPBE) process.  The result is that 74 JCTD projects delivered capabilities used in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and 57 projects delivered capabilities to Operation Enduring Freedom.  Most of those capabilities would not have been delivered – or would have been significantly delayed – if not for the JCTD program.  Recent examples include: 
1. A robust “detect and track” capability of "dark" (i.e. non-emitting) maritime targets.  This is accomplished through automated data fusion of an existing suite of sensors supporting the Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) function.  This capability was successfully transitioned into the Sealink Advanced Analysis system at Office of Naval Intelligence and is now used by multiple agencies to provide a MDA capability.
2. An operational, internet-based, open-access, Arctic-focused, environmental research and decision-support system that enables local, regional, and international cooperation and coordination on long-term environmental planning and near-term actions in response to climatic and environmental changes occurring in the Arctic Region.
3. A vastly improved capability for U.S., NATO, and Coalition naval forces boarding operations, data collection, and sharing of time-critical boarding and biometrics information during an international operational assessment in April 2013.
• The JCTD Program enables coalition cooperative development by leveraging partner nation expertise and resources; approximately one-third of JCTD projects involve some degree of coalition partner participation.  As a result of successful past collaborations, the program now enjoys routine interactions with the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and the Republic of Korea. 
• The JCTD Program enables development and execution of interdepartmental cooperation projects, such as projects with the Department of Homeland Security, State, Transportation, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.  
• The JCTD Program enables rapid response to new DoD priorities before Service PPBE cycles can respond.  For example, the DoD has established priorities for Anti-Access/Area-Denial, Building Partner Capacity, understanding human terrain, and nuclear forensics.  The JCTD Program quickly responded to the new priorities and is providing initial capabilities that are transitioning to the warfighter today.

MEASURABLE OUTCOMES:  
• Capabilities delivered and technologies transitioned have been key metrics:
1. JCTDs typically transition capability within 24 - 36 months with initial spiral products and deliverables in less than 24 months. 
 2. The JCTD program has been achieving transition rates of over 80 percent, well in excess of the DoD Strategic Objective 3.5.2D, Performance Measure 3.5.1-2D, goal of 40 percent.  The JCTD Program defines transition as all, or components of the demonstrated JCTD, going to a new or existing Program(s) of Record, providing fieldable-prototypes (residual capabilities) sustained by non-JCTD funds in direct support of operations in theater, or commodity-type capabilities entered onto GSA schedule for procurement by DoD users.  In FY 2013, 12 of 12 completed JCTDs successfully transitioned.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectNote>Historically, the Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (JCTD) Program has worked primarily with the Combatant Commands (COCOMs) and Services to identify DoD priorities and accelerated the development and demonstration of technical solutions.  However, with the end of current conflicts there has been a strategic shift to a more balanced approach that will continue to address COCOM needs in conjunction with initiating broader, longer-term JCTDs to address DoD’s strategic initiatives to mitigate emergent threats, address affordability and interoperability of defense systems.  The JCTD Program will begin to employ developmental and operational prototypes to address these longer-term DoD priorities.

The shift in the JCTD Program will also result in a shift in Program metrics.  JCTDs supporting the DoD’s strategic initiatives will tend to be longer and larger, with less focus on transition and partner funding.  Overall, we envision initiating fewer yet more impactful JCTD projects. 

In FY 2015, funds will be transferred from the JCTD Program Element (PE) to establish a new PE 0603289D8Z (Advanced Innovative Analysis &amp; Concepts).</r2:ProjectNote>
                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The JCTD Program directly addresses DoD, multi-Service and COCOMs’ priorities through partnering and cost sharing with solution providers and resource sponsors.  The value and impact of the JCTD program is to cost-effectively address the COCOMs’ priorities and the Department’s strategic initiatives to mitigate emergent threats, address affordability and interoperability of defense systems through developmental and operational prototyping.  JCTDs provide key partnerships with the Department, Services, and other government agencies, select allies, and industry that allow for expedited development, deployment, and evaluation of capability solutions with the potential to close validated warfighting capability gaps.  The JCTD Program typically demonstrates solutions in two - four years and has a transition rate to the warfighter greater than 80 percent.  At least 57 JCTD projects supported Operation Enduring Freedom, 74 projects supported Operation Iraqi Freedom, and over 30 percent of JCTD projects involved partner nations.  These JCTD partnerships also enable interdepartmental cooperation and joint capability development (e.g. Departments of Homeland Security, State, Transportation, National Aeronautics and Space Administration and Justice).  In FY 2013, the JCTD Program successfully demonstrated and transitioned several key warfighter capabilities that address operational warfighting needs of the Department, providing affordable and sustainable solutions.

Key values demonstrated by the JCTD program are:
• The JCTD Program has a long history of providing enduring capabilities.  See “Section D.  Acquisition Strategy” for more details on transition.
• The JCTD Program delivers capabilities rapidly and projects execute far quicker than the traditional DoD Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution (PPBE) process.  The result is that 74 JCTD projects delivered capabilities used in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and 57 projects delivered capabilities to Operation Enduring Freedom.  Most of those capabilities would not have been delivered – or would have been significantly delayed – if not for the JCTD program.  Recent examples include: 
1. A robust “detect and track” capability of "dark" (i.e. non-emitting) maritime targets.  This is accomplished through automated data fusion of an existing suite of sensors supporting the Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) function.  This capability was successfully transitioned into the Sealink Advanced Analysis system at Office of Naval Intelligence and is now used by multiple agencies to provide a MDA capability.
2. An operational, internet-based, open-access, Arctic-focused, environmental research and decision-support system that enables local, regional, and international cooperation and coordination on long-term environmental planning and near-term actions in response to climatic and environmental changes occurring in the Arctic Region.
3. A vastly improved capability for U.S., NATO, and Coalition naval forces boarding operations, data collection, and sharing of time-critical boarding and biometrics information during an international operational assessment in April 2013.
• The JCTD Program enables coalition cooperative development by leveraging partner nation expertise and resources; approximately one-third of JCTD projects involve some degree of coalition partner participation.  As a result of successful past collaborations, the program now enjoys routine interactions with the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and the Republic of Korea. 
• The JCTD Program enables development and execution of interdepartmental cooperation projects, such as projects with the Department of Homeland Security, State, Transportation, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.  
• The JCTD Program enables rapid response to new DoD priorities before Service PPBE cycles can respond.  For example, the DoD has established priorities for Anti-Access/Area-Denial, Building Partner Capacity, understanding human terrain, and nuclear forensics.  The JCTD Program quickly responded to the new priorities and is providing initial capabilities that are transitioning to the warfighter today.

MEASURABLE OUTCOMES:  
• Capabilities delivered and technologies transitioned have been key metrics:
1. JCTDs typically transition capability within 24 - 36 months with initial spiral products and deliverables in less than 24 months. 
2. The JCTD program has been achieving transition rates of over 80 percent, well in excess of the DoD Strategic Objective 3.5.2D, Performance Measure 3.5.1-2D, goal of 40 percent.  The JCTD Program defines transition as all, or components of the demonstrated JCTD, going to a new or existing Program(s) of Record, providing fieldable-prototypes (residual capabilities) sustained by non-JCTD funds in direct support of operations in theater, or commodity-type capabilities entered onto GSA schedule for procurement by DoD users.  In FY 2013, 12 of 12 completed JCTDs successfully transitioned.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

TEDS focuses on exchanging data from Army and Marine Corps C2 Authoritative Data Sources for the C2 and Battlespace Awareness domains.  The efficiencies gained will be the reduction of redundant software being developed across multiple programs and the ability to seamlessly exchange data within Military Services as well as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and coalition partners who adopt UCore.  Transition of the C2 Core extensions and Web services for translation and semantic mediation is planned for Programs of Record in the Army and Marine Corps.  The output of TEDS will enable C2 systems to migrate to a Service Oriented Architecture environment.</r2:Description>

                                                        <r2:Description>This effort is comprised of three programs that support the entire JCTD Program, separate from the specific JCTD projects.  The three programs are (1) Unified Combatant Commander (COCOM) Direct Support; (2) JCTD Pre-Transition; and (3) Program Integration Office for execution of select, classified projects.  (1) COCOM Direct Support:  The COCOMs are essential in specifying capability needs, project selection, validation, demonstration, assessment, and transition of JCTDs.  The JCTD Program provides direct support to COCOMs, enabling the COCOMs to provide an on-site JCTD manager, typically one to two full-time equivalents (FTEs).  (2) JCTD Pre-Transition:  In some cases, Service or Agency partner transition funding is not available for one to two years following the JCTD assessment phase due to Service or Agency commitments.  In such cases, where there is a clear transition and the need to sustain the capability for a short time prior to availability of Service or Agency transition funds the JCTD Pre-Transition fund may be used to meet that need.  (3) Program Integration Office:  A limited number of classified projects that require enhanced security measures due to need-to-know and/or mission partner sensitivities are managed within the Program Integration Office.</r2:Description>

C3E reduces data collection errors by guiding the user to choose a variety of options using cascading drop-down menus.  C3E will enable U.S./Korean personnel to describe their requirements in general military terms, symbols, and graphics within their native language.  C3E reduces reliance on specialized skills, language, and process that are beyond the shared experience of coalition operators.  It improves the ability to gather, manage, and understand collection requirements and tasks in real time.</r2:Description>

                                                        <r2:Description>JWIN consolidates independent Situational Awareness (SA) data sources into an integrated network management framework for analysis, planning, and display.  JWIN translates Service specific network information into a common actionable format.  This approach enables employment of Network Operations tools to enhance the Joint Force Commander (JFC) or Joint Task Force (JTF) Commander’s decision making process over tactical edge network resources.  Key benefits include enhanced situational awareness to understand the impact of network events on critical operations and network distributed policy collaboration and management capabilities used to communicate authoritative direction over tactical network resources.  Concept of Operations (CONOPS) is developed to ensure a Joint procedural construct is established, and proposed Joint Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (JTTPs) will be identified during initial prototype fielding at United States Pacific Command (USPACOM).  Providing the JFC/JTF a consolidated network view affords them the ability to monitor and influence tactical NETOPS supporting associated missions to implement the commander’s intent.</r2:Description>

Imagery tasking and delivery is controlled directly by the Combatant Commander to ensure sufficient timelines for near real-time situational awareness and decision-making in the field.  The cost of less than $1.500 million enables an affordable constellation for persistence, near continuous converge between 45 degrees North/South.  The primary outputs and efficiencies are:  (1) Finish one Block one “proof of concept” design, launch Block one Kestrel Eye and conduct on-orbit evaluation and upgrade Block two design with propulsion system and improved telescope pointing using a star tracker.  The JCTD will build and launch three Block two design Kestrel Eye satellites.</r2:Description>

As a result, the FY 2014 JCTD Program will primarily work with the Combatant Commands (COCOMs) and Services to develop JCTD projects to address Defense strategic initiatives that can be identified from the Chairman’s Risk Assessment or multi-service technology challenges in response to DoD priorities.  In addition, the JCTD Program will work with the acquisition community, via the AT&amp;L Defense Acquisition Board process, to identify acquisition challenges facing the Department that can be addressed by the JCTD Program through the initiation of development and operational prototypes.

                                                        <r2:Description>In FY 2015, the JCTD Program will seek a balance between projects that address the broader strategic DoD priorities that support future threats and capability shortfalls, as well as traditional JCTD projects that address the Combatant Commands' (COCOMs’) capability gaps and their most pressing needs not being addressed by the Service programs.  These COCOM-focused projects will be identified through the traditional candidate identification and selection process.  In addition, the JCTD Program will continue to develop JCTD projects to address broader Defense strategic initiatives in areas such as anti-access / anti-denial, defense support to civil authorities, and counter weapons of mass destruction. Operational prototypes will focus in areas of concepts for space defense, solid state technologies for maritime defense, advancements in counter electronic systems and space capability without a space layer (precision navigation and timing, communications, battle-space awareness, international and interagency collaboration (Australian, Canadian, Department of Homeland security)).</r2:Description>

                                                        <r2:Description>BWA will demonstrate a meta-material based antenna design to replace multiple conventional whip antennas worn by all service radio operators.  BWA offers greater performance and concealment than whip antennas, increasing the capability and survivability of the Warfighter.  The prototype antenna will be integrated onto the load-bearing belt with mission necessary enhanced features identified and addressed.  BWA also predicts greater performance and signal strength at several different positions versus current whip antennas, including the limiting prone position.  BWA will replace four distinct whip antennas, totaling over five pounds, necessary to cover the same communication band.  BWA weighs three lbs creating a lighter load and increasing operator maneuverability by dispersing weight around the waist.  Radiation patterns for BWA will demonstrate much lower radiation levels to the head compared to legacy antennas.</r2:Description>

This solution will reduce the total cost of ownership of the networks.  MD-SAVE leverages technology to enable the collapse of multi-tower workstations into one box.  This approach is hardware-based and a prototype exists.   Current design will allow for the collapse of up to 16 domains, ensuring physical separation and no cross-domain information flow.  The result is a reduced multi-domain workspace that is certified and accredited saving space, weight and power at U.S. Central Command (USCENTCOM) Headquarters.</r2:Description>

- The capabilities address a documented capability gap in an existing Program of Record, so that the existing Program can acquire, further develop, sustain, and provide the capability under existing program documentation.
- The capabilities address capability gaps that naturally fit with an existing Program of Record, but program documentation addressing the new capabilities does not exist.  In these cases, existing program documentation (such as the Capabilities Development Document or Capabilities Production Document) is revised to include the new capabilities from the JCTD, and the JCTD capabilities transition to the Program of Record.
- The capabilities address a current operational need without requiring Program of Record changes.  In these cases, the JCTD capabilities may transition directly to operational use, with sustainment (operations and maintenance) funding arranged through the gaining command.  
- The capabilities may be widely applicable commodity products, useful to many commands.  In these cases, the commodity products listed on General Services Administration schedule, and made available for purchase by any commands needing the capability, using procurement funds.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                                                <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Strategic Goals Supported in FY 2015:
- Project Selection Focus
- Spiral Technologies to Fielded Capabilities
- Time to Final Demonstration
- 70 Percent Transition Rate 
- Adequately Shared Funding and Visibility
- Independent Assessment Capability
- Successful Military Utility Assessment (MUA)

The majority of funding from this program element is forwarded to the Services/Defense Agencies that execute the individual JCTD projects.  The Director, JCTD Program, maintains and provides overall programmatic oversight for the JCTD program, to include the individual JCTD projects.  The JCTD performance metrics center on how fast relevant joint and/or transformational technologies can be demonstrated and provided to the joint warfighter.  These metrics are driven by the overall business process which includes six parts:  (1) selection focus; (2) ability to spin-off spiral technologies; (3) time necessary to complete a final demonstration; (4) adequately resourced projects with appropriate oversight; (5) capability to complete an independent assessment of the technology; and (6) the number of successful capabilities that are actually transitioned to the warfighter.  

MEASURABLE OUTCOMES:  Metrics include:  all JCTDs will deliver products within 12 months to enable assessment for project continuation; 50 percent of JCTDs will provide an operationally-relevant prototype within 12 months and 75 percent will complete final demonstration within 24 months of Implementation Directive signature.  JCTDs will spiral products and deliverables during the demonstration.  At least 75 percent of JCTD projects will transition products to Programs of Record (POR), sustained residual operations, or availability for procurement from the General Services Administration Schedule.

Transition Achievement:  The JCTD program has been achieving actual transition rates of over 80 percent, well in excess of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering) stated goal of 40 percent.  The JCTD Program defines transition as all or components of the demonstrated JCTD going to a new or existing POR, providing fieldable-prototypes (residual capabilities) sustained by non-JCTD funds in direct support of operations, or commodity-type capabilities entered onto GSA schedule for procurement by Department users.  In FY 2013, 12 of 12 completions successfully transitioned.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Networked Communications Capability Program (NCCP) seeks to accelerate the wireless mobile networking capability of Department of Defense’s (DoD) current and planned investments in response to national military strategy and ever growing needs.  Today's Warfighter rely more and more on communications networks to support and enable actions from targeting and shooting weapons to video-conferencing.  Though military basic infrastructure capabilities follow the mainstream commercial internet, for many reasons (security, mobility, and robustness), commercial telecommunications especially commercial wireless (tactical edge) communications are not well-matched with the requirements of today’s warfighter.  These trends will continue as the military data load becomes more diverse and heavy.  These tactical edge technology challenges cut across all warfare domains (space, air, ground, and sea).  In response to recognized technical problems today, as well as anticipated problems in the future, this research will focus on two key problems in networked technologies:  the need for "Joint interoperability" and  "expanded reach" (resilient and robust) where no communication infrastructure exists.  The main research objectives of this program are to:

– Perform Network Communications Analysis to establish the scientific foundations for tactical mobile networking with a specific emphasis on integrating heterogeneous Networks and Integrated Network Operations (NetOps) for tactical networks.
– Complete the enhancements of joint integrated capability to predict performance of heterogeneous communication networks and expand the reach/connectivity and capacity. 
– Jointly manage and operate existing and planned diverse communications networks, services and applications.
– Create mature products for transition to programs of record (POR) or directly to field.
	1)  Wireless mobile network design, development and operations, spectrum management, information assurance and information dissemination management software tools.
	2)  Joint Aerial Layer Networking (JALN), services and applications packages including hardware and software systems and integrated/joint network operations software tools and new information architectures.

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Tactical Mobile Networking - As studies have suggested, for instance, the National Research Council’s Network Science Report (2005) and Army Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET) JASON's Report (January 2006), the type of networking projected to meet military tactical requirements is not supported by network theory, network design, and analysis tools.  This research will define those technical parameters important to military tactical mobile networking environments, investigate the status of network design and analysis tools, and evaluate how modeling and simulation is conducted to support tactical mobile networking environments.  The role of network experimentation with respect to network modeling will be explored.  Further development and analysis will be conducted to improve the awareness of the condition of tactical mobile networking technologies.  Design tools, architectures, and technical approaches will be recommended to acquisition programs as a result of this research.  
  
Network Management Tools and Analysis - Network management in the commercial world is a highly organized, synchronized activity that has excellent tools to monitor activity and repair disrupted networks as needed.  These same tools are ill-matched for management in the wireless world, and specifically for military tactical mobile networking.  In addition, the military tactical mobile networking environment lacks the infrastructure (connectivity) and support (helpdesk) because resources (spectrum, people, and equipment) are scarce (not in harm's way).  As the complexity of networking grows and as network capabilities are introduced, improved network management is required.  For military operations, assured delivery may be needed for specific information and operations.  This requires management tools to be in place to ensure continued secure and robust operations, which is not achieved with commercial wireless technologies.  This research will assess network management tools in place for the military tactical mobile networking environment and develop technology and tools to address shortfalls with the goal to transition technology to operational systems.   
  
Spectrum Management Tools and Analysis - For wireless, tactical mobile networking, the management of the use of spectrum effects network operations.  The demand for spectrum is increasing due to the expanded use of sensors, imagery, and voice.  This demand increases the pressure on the limited shared radio frequency (RF) spectrum for military tactical networking.  The current Department of Defense (DoD) frequency planning and management infrastructure will have a limited ability to cope with this demand through operational planning, Coalition Joint Spectrum Management Planning Tool (CJSMPT) Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (JCTD), and the Global Electromagnetic Spectrum Information System (GEMSIS).  Advanced spectrum management concepts such as sense and adapt, spectrum sharing, and dynamic reallocation are under investigation but not yet mature support operations.  This research will evaluate opportunities for more efficient and effective use of the frequency spectrum within DoD.  Technology advances are expected to advance the concept of cognitive radio and cognitive antenna devices to sense and adapt operations based on spectrum policy and usage, the management of multi-band and multifunction apertures, and the use of spectrum efficient waveforms for use in military environments.  This research will develop the models and tools to demonstrate capabilities for operational planning and monitoring of spectrum as these technologies are introduced.  
  
Integrated Network Management Capability - Network management becomes more complex as more and different types of networking capability become available.  Integrated network management across heterogeneous systems, especially wireless systems, requires definition, design, and development.  Operationally, network management assumes all functions required to share networking resources and ensure proper operation for participants.  This research will define integrated network operations tools for all aspects of network resource management and to prioritize across operational spectrum management, security management, network management, and information management.  This research will also develop test beds especially to validate models and simulations used to develop and test network management tools, and conduct experimentation on approaches developed. 

Tactical Networking Evolution and Expansion - Fielded and about-to-be-fielded tactical networks can be vastly expanded and evolved from their current capabilities by developing and applying new techniques (or existing techniques developed in basic research) to the existing systems, providing modern capability to the warfighter without the large expense to the DoD of developing new systems.  This research will focus on developing and applying new DoD specific techniques to create leap-ahead approaches to Anti-Jam resistance of tactical networks, larger, more fully exploited networks, and expanded capabilities for signal/data processing and data compression in radios and across the networks.  This research will take advantage of new software defined radios about to be fielded by the Department, as well as focus on the existing legacy systems, using the successful approach we developed when fielding the Netted Iridium capability.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementNote>Change from FY 2013 to FY 2014 reflects a realignment of the program from the Data to Decisions Advanced Development PE 0603663D8Z to higher Department of Defense (DoD) priorities.  

The goals of this program will be shifted to the DoD Components under the direction of the Research and Engineering (R&amp;E) Executive Committee and will conform with the DoD Data to Decision Priority Steering Council roadmaps.  Historically, the Joint Data Management program was restructured to evolve into the revised Data to Decisions program in support of the FY 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review mission:  succeed in counterinsurgency, stability, and counterterrorism operations.  In addition, this program addresses a signed Secretary of Defense S&amp;T priority, Data to Decisions, which reduces the cycle time and manpower requirements for analysis and use of large data sets.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>As the DoD increases the capability and capacity to generate increasing amounts of data from numerous sensors in the battlespace, the issue of handling very large data sets has become more challenging.  This is in part due to Department of Defense response to a changing threat environment where there is an expansion of the types of sensors deployed, new types of information collected, and different features used to classify these new threats.  From a technical perspective, data creation speeds have outpaced the speed and ability to transport, store and process the data created.  Science and Technology (S&amp;T) investigation into new and novel ways to manage and exploit this data is required to more efficiently use sensor assets and effectively use information in a timely fashion.

The OSD Data to Decisions program (PEs 0602663D8Z and 0603663D8Z) uniquely address three specific gap areas not addressed by Component S&amp;T:  minimal dedicated Data to Decisions research to support joint and emerging mission areas; DoD needs a mechanism to increase responsiveness of Component Data to Decisions research and lower the time-to-solution across a broad DoD-wide user base; and limited investment in multi-disciplinary research investigations of Data to Decisions issues and solutions.  The OSD Data to Decisions program pulls together research efforts to address shortfalls within the context of Joint and emerging missions to ensure that the distinctive needs of these joint analysts and decision makers are addressed by DoD science and technology.  As an example, irregular warfare, non-state terrorism movements, and uncertain environmental patterns that trigger major weather disasters are producing a reality for military and government leaders where traditional physics-based sensors alone are insufficient to plan current and future actions in a region on interest or need.  Component Data to Decisions efforts focus on developing technology to overcome a particular challenge within a mission or to advance a particular priority area of that Component.  As a result the R&amp;E Database has over 388 references to Decision Support programs, all of which are designed to address a specific need over the course of several years.  However, there exists no other program in the DoD that focuses on technology development efforts to speed the delivery of the Component solutions and lessons learned to a DoD-wide user base.  The OSD Data to Decisions program provides the common platform (access to datasets, infrastructure, and metrics) to integrate and evaluate the technology development and research methods to support various missions driven by the challenge problems.  This ability to rapidly evaluate technology development and research methods will allow technology transfer for mission analysis not previously foreseen and lower the time-to solution across DoD by rigorously analyzing technical performance for more immediate use.  Traditional approaches within research seek to advance machine systems for a specific mission effect resulting in large complex data sets.  While necessary for sensor system improvements, potential Data to Decisions solutions require a coupling of automated data analysis with human analysts, operators and decision makers in order to reduce time and limit the number of people required.  Many research studies, workshop and analysis have stated that solutions to data issues are multi-disciplinary.  The OSD Data to Decisions program is in the unique position to reach across Components and research disciplines to blend promising research in new ways in response to Challenge Problem statements.  For Challenge Problems, contextual understanding will result from research combining human sciences with computer processing techniques to take advantage of a person’s cognitive ability to fuse and assimilate multiple sources and types of information for new insights.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The OSD Data to Decisions (D2D) program (PEs 0602663D8Z and 0603663D8Z) uniquely address three specific gap areas not addressed by Component Science and Technology:  minimal dedicated D2D research to support Joint and emerging mission areas; DoD needs a mechanism to increase responsiveness of Component D2D research and lower the time-to-solution across a broad DoD-wide user base; and limited investment in multi-disciplinary research investigations of D2D issues and solutions.

The D2D program establishes the demonstration and experimentation environment to conduct independent evaluations of research efforts that have the most potential of minimizing the impact of the increasing amount of information available and required to support military operational decision-making.  The intent is to leverage existing research investments within defense S&amp;T and provide proper evaluations and assessments to facilitate technology transition.  The Applied Research program concentrates on the Development portion of this collaborative effort, focusing on the development of improved algorithms (relative to FY 2012 state of the art) to be demonstrated and validated in the 6.3 D2D program test bed.  The D2D Advanced Development (6.3) program uses a spiral four step development model.  Each year Operational teams will choose a series of cross-service challenge problems dominated by a specific sensing modality.  Representative data for each of those problems will then be collected for testing against that problem.  A Development team will design algorithms and data management architectures using high-level languages and self-test on controlled data sets to address those challenge problems.  Independent assessment will occur with sequestered data sets, but each development tool will also be tested against new sensors not included in the self-testing to determine fragility and applicability.  A transition team will host the developed algorithms as services in a spiraling prototype system that will support rapid prototyping and transition.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Challenge problems focus multiple levels of algorithm development across the DoD to catalyze a larger technical community to work D2D issues for joint and future missions and also provide a basis for testing the reuse and repurposing of algorithms and systems for rapid repurposing of algorithms and systems that match the agility of threats and missions.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Our military forces require resilient, reliable networks and computer systems to conduct effective operations.  However, the number and sophistication of threats in cyberspace are rapidly growing, making it urgent and critical to improve the cyber security of Department of Defense (DoD) networks to counter those threats and assure our missions.  This program focuses on innovative and sustained advanced development in both cyber security and computer network operations to mature new concepts to harden key network and computer components to include: designing new resilient cyber infrastructures; increasing the military’s ability to fight and survive during cyber attacks; disrupting nation-state level attack planning and execution; measuring the state of cyber security for the U.S. government; increasing our understanding of cyber as a war-fighting domain; and providing modeling and simulation of cyberspace operations to explore and exploit new ideas in cyber warfare for agile cyber operations and mission assurance. 

The Cyber Advanced Technology Development program element is budgeted in the advanced technology development budget activity because it focuses on the maturation of successful applied research results, and their development, into demonstrable advanced cyber security capabilities.  The Cyber Advanced Technology Development program will build on the results of matured applied research from the Cyber Applied Research (0602668D8Z), and other programs, to develop technology demonstrations for potential transition into capabilities that support the full spectrum of computer network operations.  These approaches will include moving from cyber defense to cyber resilience by changing the defensive terrain of our existing digital infrastructure, identifying ways to raise the risk and lower the value of an attack from an advanced persistent cyber threat, and focusing on mission assurance metrics. 

This program focuses on integrating computer network defense (CND) and computer network operations (CNO), in addressing the advanced persistent threat (APT), filling DoD technology gaps as identified in the Cyber Science &amp; Technology Priority Steering Council Roadmap, as determined by assessments conducted by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (OASD(R&amp;E)).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Cyber Advanced Technology Development program will build on, mature, and transition the results of successful applied research results from the Cyber Applied Research PE.  The link between the Cyber Applied Research and Cyber Advanced Technology Development PEs is intended to create a mechanism to take existing basic research results and mature them to the point of incorporation into technology demonstrations.  This program focuses on integrating computer network defense and computer network operations, addressing joint problems in cyber operations, and filling capability and technology gaps as determined by assessments in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research &amp; Engineering.  Progress and results are reviewed by the Cyber S&amp;T Community of Interest.

Efforts of the program will develop improved and demonstrable capabilities through the DoD science and technology (S&amp;T) organizations within and across the following technical areas:

INFORMATION ASSURANCE AND COMPUTER NETWORK DEFENSE (IA/CND):
Develop technologies to harden DoD network components; evolve from network defense to mission assurance; and enable systems to operate through cyber attacks in degraded and contested environments.

COMPUTER NETWORK OPERATIONS (CNO):
Disrupt adversary attack planning and execution; explore game-changing ideas over the full spectrum of CNO and new concepts in cyber warfare; increase collaboration between disparate research communities within CNO; and address identified gaps in DoD CNO S&amp;T to prepare for cyber conflict against advanced persistent threats.

Beginning in FY 2013, the program will expanded research in cyber command and control to provide warfighters and commanders new situational awareness, course of action analysis, cyber operational agility and cyber mission control.  This research will include protection of tactical networks, weapons systems and platforms.  The six new technical thrust areas include:

FOUNDATIONS OF TRUST
RESILIENT INFRASTRUCTURE
AGILE OPERATIONS
ASSURING EFFECTIVE MISSIONS
CYBER MODELING, SIMULATION, AND EXPERIMENTATION (MSE) 
EMBEDDED, MOBILE, AND TACTICAL ENVIRONMENTS (EMT)</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

A resilient infrastructure has the ability to continue to perform its functions and provide its services to required levels during an attack.  The objective in this area is to develop integrated architectures that are optimized for their ability to absorb (cyber) shock, and recover in a timely fashion to a known secure state, even if this is at the expense of degraded performance.  Resilient Algorithms and Protocols cover ways to develop novel protocols and algorithms to increase the repertoire of resiliency mechanisms available to the infrastructure and architecture.  Research is needed to develop resiliency at lower levels with specific algorithms and protocols to support higher-level resiliency architectures.</r2:Description>

These capabilities present technology challenges in the areas of Autonomic Cyber Agility and Cyber Maneuver.  Cyber Maneuver is a new way to manage systems dynamically in a cyber situation.  It is a set of emerging methods for maintaining defensive or offensive advantage in cyber operations.  It entails developing mechanisms that enable goal-directed reshaping of cyber systems.  Cyber maneuver encompasses reallocation for repurposing a device or platform, reconfiguration for changing the way a system performs a task, and relocation for altering the operating location in a logical or physical topology.  Autonomic Cyber Agility covers several forms of agility.  As cyber infrastructures increase in scale and complexity, there is an urgent need for autonomous and agile mechanisms to reconfigure, heal, optimize, and protect defensive and offensive cyber mechanisms.</r2:Description>

While the focus in cyber research is often placed on individual technologies, how these technologies work toward an effective mission is critical for the DoD.  The objective of Assuring Effective Missions presents technology challenges in the areas of Cyber Mission Control and Effects at Scale.  Cyber Mission Control covers the ability to orchestrate cyber systems to achieve an overarching mission goal.  There is a critical need for tools that can map information technology assets to missions and use modeling and simulation, or other techniques, to perform dynamic analysis of asset criticality and course-of-action alternatives.  Inherent in Cyber Mission Control is the ability to automatically derive and fuse information about the characteristics of information technology systems in a manner that allows us to describe, analyze, observe, and control the operation of information technology components.  A key goal of this research area is to have tools that enable commanders to assess and direct different information technology maneuvers in conjunction with mission actions.  Effects at Scale encompass full spectrum challenges that intersect with cyber becoming a new full-fledged domain of warfare.</r2:Description>

There are two technical challenges associated with cyber modeling, simulation, and experimentation; Cyber Modeling and Simulation and Cyber Measurement.  Cyber Modeling and Simulation seeks to develop tools and techniques that enable analytical modeling and multi-scale simulation of complex cyber systems.  Cyber Measurement develops cyber experimentation and test range technology to conduct controlled, repeatable experiments, providing the ability to track the progress of cyber research investments in a quantitative fashion.  This area will explore new analytical methodologies, models, and experimental data sets to establish metrics to measure a system’s state of security, apply the scientific method to establish the foundations of a framework in which cyber security research can be conducted, to test hypothesis with measurable and repeatable results, and the quantitative experimentation and assessment for new cyber technologies.  These new methodologies will enable the exploration modeling and simulation tools and techniques that can drive innovation in research and aid in integrated experimentation and transition to operations to simulate the cyber environment with sufficient fidelity, and to integrate cyber modeling and simulation with the traditional modeling and simulation related to the kinetic domain.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The OSD HSCB Modeling Program is a vertically integrated effort to research, develop, and transition technologies, tools, and systems to programs of record and users in need.  The Program exists to optimize U.S. forces’ ability to perform population-centric sensing, understand behaviors driven by social and cultural variables, and select effective courses of action in the full range of military operations.  Program research will enhance population-centric intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities for understanding the increasingly complex global environment to address national strategic challenges such as instability, aggression, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and violent extremism.  In three integrated program elements (PEs), the Program will conduct applied research, mature and demonstrate advanced technology, and develop transitionable methods, technology, tools and prototypes.  Work under PE 0603670D8Z is focused on developing and demonstrating general-use, cross-domain tools in two areas: computational modeling; and sociocultural behavior data collection, management, and dissemination.  Research will result in more effective cultural understanding in existing intelligence, influence operations, and operations planning systems; modeling capabilities for forecasting reactions to U.S./coalition actions; demonstration of strategic decision making tools that highlight political, religious, cultural, and related factors; tools and technologies enabling more widespread and effective use of sociocultural behavior models in operations and mission rehearsal; and toolsets that can be used as strategic decision making tools to account for sociocultural factors.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The Program has emphasized development of tools to support forecasting of instability.  In addition to refining and extending those tools, the Program is researching and developing comparable models and tools for analysis and forecasting of other events of interest.  Work in this area also includes modeling to support analysis of alternative courses of action (COA).  This is a challenging objective that requires research, development and integration of constituent technologies.  Integrate and demonstrate decision making support tools useful within programs of record and operational user analysis, planning and execution systems for political, religious, cultural and other factors.  Support specific operational planning tasks for selected government partners via limited technical demonstration in user settings.  In addition, working with operational partners HSCB Program models will be tested in realistic environments by representative users.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Defense-wide Manufacturing Science and Technology (DMS&amp;T), established within the Manufacturing Technology Program directed in Title 10 USC Section 2521, provides the Department with a comprehensive manufacturing program to achieve the strategic goals of focused technology, improved acquisition across the life cycles, and cost-effective logistics.  By designing for manufacturability early in development, anticipated results will have an impact on increasing reliability and decreasing the life cycle burden of weapon systems. The mission to anticipate and close gaps in defense manufacturing capabilities and drive significant system life cycle affordability benefits makes DMS&amp;T an increasingly important leveraging tool in the current budget environment.
			
DMS&amp;T will: 1) address manufacturing enterprise game-changing initiatives that are beyond the scope of any one Military Department or Defense Agency or platform and, 2) establish and mature cross-cutting manufacturing processes required for transitioning emerging technologies which impact the time lines, affordability, and productivity of acquisition programs and shorten the deployment cycle times.
			
The DMS&amp;T program is fundamental to a coordinated development process.  Concurrent development of manufacturing processes with the S&amp;T development enables the use of emerging technologies.  Key technical areas for investment for DMS&amp;T include Advanced Electronics and Optics Manufacturing, Advanced Materials Manufacturing, and Enterprise and Emerging Manufacturing.  Advanced Electronics and Optics addresses advanced manufacturing technologies for a wide range of applications such as sensors, radars, power generation, switches, and optics for defense applications.  Advanced Materials addresses advanced manufacturing technologies for a wide range of materials such as composites, metals, ceramics, nanomaterials, metamaterials, and low observables.  Enterprise and Emerging Manufacturing addresses advanced manufacturing technologies and enterprise business practices for defense applications.  Key focus areas include the industrial information infrastructure, advanced design/qualification/cost tools, supply network integration technologies and management practices, direct digital (or additive) manufacturing, machining; robotics, assembly, and joining.

The total sequestration reduction executed as a result of the FY 2013 DoD appropriation act was -$.4.438, of which -$3.430 was applied to FY 2012 and -$1.008 was applied to FY 2013.  Sequestration of these amounts impacted the ability of the OSD Defense-wide ManTech program to execute DoD and Administration priorities for Advanced Manufacturing by  investing in fewer manufacturing processes and improved materials, which are intended to drive in affordability for reduction of system life-cycle costs of major weapons systems.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The DMS&amp;T program has a two-pronged approach: 1) technology initiatives and 2) specific single projects.  Technology initiatives, in collaboration with the Joint Defense Manufacturing Technology Panel (JDMTP) and industry, identify and develop investment strategies to advance the manufacturing processes needed to support the specific technology.  Above-the-shop-floor investments focus on new manufacturing processes that have potential to significantly improve manufacturing efficiencies. Single specific projects address investment opportunities not associated with selected technology initiatives and enable the program to respond to urgent, compelling manufacturing needs and provide seed funding to more high risk-high payoff technologies.
 			
Data calls are launched through two methods to identify technology initiatives and single specific issues requiring investment.  One method is through the JDMTP.  The JDMTP is comprised of the ManTech Directors from the Services, Defense Logistics Agency, and Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD).  The call is distributed through the ManTech Directors to the four JDMTP sub panels: Metals Processing and Fabrication Subpanel, Composites Processing and Fabrication Subpanel, Electronics Processing and Fabrication Subpanel and Advanced Manufacturing Enterprise Subpanel. Potential candidates are evaluated by the JDMTP based on criteria set forth in the call and announcements and down-selected for further development prior to final selection.  The other method is through Broad Agency Announcements to industry.  Priority is given to investments that support affordability and producibility of critical enabling manufacturing technologies that cut across multiple platforms.  Investments also balance defense priorities in specialty materials, electronics, propulsion and power, and manufacturing processes including "above the shop floor" (lean and business technologies facilitating interoperable manufacturing).  Final projects are selected by the OSD ManTech Director, considering input from the JDMTP and Director of Manufacturing, and as approved by Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense, Manufacturing and Industrial Base Policy (MIBP).  Technology initiatives and projects are executed at the Component level.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

In addition, these programs all had a clear transition path with implementation on a current platform or one undergoing acquisition targeted to be within 2-3 years of project completion.  The following areas of investment were executed to enable a diverse suite of advanced manufacturing production improvements

- Innovation Manufacturing Institutes (IMI) (previously Advanced Manufacturing Innovation Institutes) (see program  descriptions addressed above): 
  1) IMI for 3D printing:  The institute accomplished a first-year, start-up phase consisting of establishing over 80 industry, academic, and non-profit members, creating a balanced governance structure to engage industry and government stakeholders, development of performance metrics, a project call process, an operating plan, the hiring of full-time staff, and completed renovations of the headquarters, the Innovation Factory.  A Call for Projects resulted in six applied research projects, engaging over 35 member organizations on project teams.  The Additive Manufacturing technology roadmap was developed using results generated from a series of workshops with members.  A  Second Project Call was launched with anticipated awards totaling $9 million (government share).  Plans for education and workforce training and outreach were developed, and initiatives were launched in these areas.  The IMI for 3D printing began the development of a new public and private (members-only) collaborative website for secure exchange of relevant information on projects, member organization capabilities, and developments in the additive manufacturing industry.

  2) IMIs for digital manufacturing and design, and for lightweight metals:  Provided resources for initial staffing of each Institute, permitting timely standup of the Institutes to facilitate growth in membership and customer interest.  Awarded initial cooperative agreements. The Technology Advisory Boards of these Institutes were established along with operating procedures on governance, intellectual property protection, and membership. Began cross-institute project teaming with the 3D printing IMI, and began engagement with organic (depot) manufacturing communities within DoD. Executed the initial Project Calls and awarded first round of projects, typically $1M in government funds matched 1:1 or better by industry. Contracts were awarded in the following core areas for each Institute: 
  IMI for digital manufacturing and design: advanced manufacturing enterprise, intelligent machines, and advanced analysis; 
  IMI for lightweight metals: applications of new/novel metals and alloys, primary metal manufacturing processes, secondary manufacturing processes, and development of products exploiting lightweight and modern metals.

                                                        <r2:Description>This effort applies an existing radar system already in production to satisfy a low-cost, open-architecture radar requirement for the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) program. This program will reduce the cost of the current radar system by $1M per ship set, and will fit into the existing TRS-3D top side and below decks available footprint. The open architecture configuration will allow upgrades for new technologies over the lifetime of the program as well as offer lower cost via the potential for open competition for the radar’s building blocks.  Radar manufacturing and support capability will be transferred from a foreign company to a domestic company and facility.  Transmit/Receive (T/R) module packaging cost will be reduced through near-hermetic, commercial Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuit (MMIC) packaging and automated Surface Mount Technology (SMT) assembly techniques, reducing touch labor costs.  Model Based Enterprise (MBE) concepts will be integrated to ensure supportability and technology refresh via an Intelligent Technical Data Package.  The commercial packaging effort for T/R module components as a part of this program will have a direct impact on the Volume Search Radar (VSR) on CVN-79 – creating a $1M/hull cost savings for the Navy.  This effort will provide the Navy with the first truly open architecture radar solution that will be able to accommodate different Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuit (MMIC) technologies, Line Replaceable Unit (LRU) technologies, processor, and power supplies from multiple vendors.  The system will use fiber optics to connect the above-deck equipment (antenna) with the below-deck equipment (signal processing and control) which will allow greater flexibility in location of below-deck equipment (allowing a lower center of gravity and thus improved ship stability).</r2:Description>

                                                        <r2:Description>Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems require precise timekeeping even if the Global Positioning System (GPS) is unavailable. The size, weight, power, and cost components of conventional atomic clocks are too high for tactical applications. Chip Scale Atomic Clock (CSAC) provides improved long-term frequency stability that gets integrated into long-term time accuracy. The focus of this project is leveraging Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) investments in the CSAC technology to reduce operational costs and transition beyond custom fabrication of the current CSAC.  Objectives include improving the existing batch manufacturing processes such as atomic cell filling, cell sealing, physics package assembly, and sub-system testing to reduce the “touch hours” required for CSAC assembly and testing. Development of a network of multiple vendors to foster competition and ensure a viable supply base is a complementary goal. Current manual assembly processes can produce CSAC in small quantities with low yield at high cost ($8,000/unit).  The DMS&amp;T funding enables producibility at an affordable cost ($100–$300/unit). Successful performance enables an environment of continued operation of critical C4ISR systems, regardless of the presence or absence of global positioning system (GPS). The ability to rapidly reacquire GPS military code in a hostile Electro Magnetic Interference (EMI) environment is an additional targeted benefit.</r2:Description>

Current F-35 Electro-Optical Targeting System (EOTS) and Electro-Optical Distributed Aperture System (EODAS) focal plane arrays (FPAs) suffer manufacturing yield and cost issues.  This effort will leverage prior and concurrent DoD investments in laser protection technology to make manufacturing improvements that incorporate laser protection technology into the FPA’s Read-Out Integrated Circuits (ROICs) while concurrently reducing ROIC defects (improving yield) and minimizing the total cost to F-35 to meet this requirement.  The goal is to increase the Transition Readiness Level/Manufacturing Readiness Level to TRL/MRL 6 (demonstrate/produce prototype system or subsystem in a relevant environment) and to transition laser-hardened FPAs in time for the F-35 Block 5 Upgrade.  These technologies are applicable not just for F-35, but to any Medium Wavelength Infrared detector, including those on tactical and reconnaissance sensor systems.</r2:Description>

Even a 10% reduction in system weight would significantly increase warfighter acceptance, mobility, agility, and endurance.  This effort will leverage prior DoD investments to mature three complimentary manufacturing technologies that will reduce body armor weight by 10%-15% while improving ballistic performance and flexibility.  Cost will be reduced 5%-10% and cycle time will be reduced by 10X-20X.  The project will mature three manufacturing technologies for lighter weight armor from a capability to produce the technologies in a laboratory to a capability to produce them in an environment representative of a production facility.  The three technologies are: 1) Dissimilar Material Assembly Technology to integrate ceramic, polymer adhesives, composites, and other organic and inorganic constituents into a unified body armor system. 2) Co-consolidation processing, to reduce cost and cycle time for the production of composite material enabling 10% lighter armor while maintaining ballistic performance. 3) Multi-scale modification of ballistic ceramics and associated processes, which will include new additive processes and metallic substrates to improve ballistic integrity and manage adverse shock events due to ballistic impact.</r2:Description>

Conventional sintering takes from hours to days in a sintering oven, and the beneficial characteristics of nano-structured materials are lost when the material is sintered.  FAST has the potential to dramatically reduce cycle time and manufacturing costs while maintaining the beneficial characteristics of nano-structured materials.  The FAST process passes a pulsed direct current through the part while it is pressed in a die, and the combination of rapid heating and compressive loading results in fine grained, fully dense materials in short processing times that are not possible with conventional sintering processes.  Many parts that are made with a powder press and sinter process are candidates for FAST, but this project will focus on ceramic body and vehicle armor, tungsten kinetic energy penetrators, infrared windows, heat sinks for electromagnetic propulsion cooling, and hypersonic and high temperature for enhanced performance jet propulsion.</r2:Description>

These efforts provide significant productivity and efficiency gains in the defense manufacturing base.  These manufacturing technologies accelerate delivery of technical capabilities to impact current warfighting operations, and manufacturing technologies to reduce the cost, acquisition time and risk of our major defense acquisition programs.

Mini Short Wave Infrared (SWIR) Cameras and ManTech for SWIR Imagers: Thermoelectric Cooler (TEC)-less SWIR imagers are being developed that are smaller, use less power, have a lower cost than currently available SWIR imagers, and offer improved functionality over sensors presently in use.  These new SWIR imagers will be used by warfighters including SOF to see target designation lasers during day and night, to identify friend or foe at long range at night, and to operate with covert lasers.  Applications include several night vision and targeting system programs with the Army, Navy, Air Force, and SOCOM.

Manufacturability of Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers (VCSELs): One emerging manufacturing technology undergoing development focuses on the manufacturability of VCSELs.

Will apply a modern factory approach of a fab-less front-end with specialized in-house process steps, allowing more flexibility for DoD procurement cycles and leveraging installed, previously-invested capital. This project is expected to benefit numerous programs, including: PUMA, RAVEN, TigerShark, Anubis, Spectre-FINDER, Speckles, TigerMoth, WAAS, PAWS, IPODS, AngelFire, MAV-OBAT, nLoss, LOS-short, CLRF, JETS, IDNST, TLDS, Big Safari, OEF, OIF,  STINGER , and ARGUS.

Organic Light Emitting Diode (OLED) Microdisplays: Many applications of microdisplays require extremely high brightness and contrast in order to see sensor imagery in challenging high brightness environments. Existing technologies are limited by low contrast, bulky and complex packaging, and high power consumption. Recently developed methods of direct patterning and Silicon On Insulator (SOI) allow color OLED displays to have large color gamuts and very long lifetimes at high luminances. Direct pattern color OLED on SOI has been successfully demonstrated; however, proliferation is limited due to high costs and manufacturing deficiencies.  This project will transition this techology from MRL5 to MRL8, improving the manufacturing capability to produce an
ultra-high resolution, high brightness, high contrast, full color micro-display at a low unit cost. 

Improved Focal Plane Array Production for Thermal Hyperspectral Applications Using III-IV Antimony Based Technology: This effort will mature the use of III-V material technologies in long wave infrared (LWIR) focal plane arrays (FPAs) used for hyperspectral imaging in numerous tri- service applications.  Improved devices will have size, weight, and power advantages, and reduced logistics costs.  Production readiness will be demonstrated by integrating with an Army owned sensor asset provided by Project Manager-Airborne Reconnaissance and Exploitation Systems (PM ARES).

These efforts will provide significant productivity and efficiency gains in the defense manufacturing base.  These manufacturing technologies will accelerate delivery of technical capabilities to impact current warfighting operations, and manufacturing technologies to reduce the cost, acquisition time and risk of our major defense acquisition programs.

Advanced materials manufacturing technologies undergoing development include materials for ballistic survivability and materials for rapid fabrication of structural components.
Cold Spray Deposition: The objective for Cold Spray Deposition is to create a proven repair process and original equipment manufacturer applied corrosion/wear prevention treatment for magnesium gearbox housings and parts on numerous platforms. Inability to repair is causing significant readiness, sustainment, and safety issues (20% of the fleet is affected at any given time). Working with the original equipment manufacturer to transition the process to industry to treat new parts and to maintain, repair, and overhaul condemned gearboxes in storage.


Net-Shaped Field Assisted Sintering Technology (FAST): FAST will set the processing limits and qualify the process for the production of two ultra high temperature materials components that require full density materials with nano tailored microstructures that are not achievable via other processes.  This technology addresses near net shaped, thin walled axial rocket nozzle inserts (flute shaped) made from W (Tungsten) and TaC alloys and sharp leading edges with attachment features made from Hf-based ceramics.  This effort will mature the manufacturing readiness of conventional FAST while reducing costs and providing faster delivery times.

Fastener Fill: The F-35 Fastener Fill project will address the challenges incurred in the manual fastener fill installation process, which can take as long as 2 minutes per fastener and provides no indication of installation quality other than feel.  With over 40,000 fasteners per aircraft for F-35, this is a significant manufacturing issue.  In addition, excess materials must be manually skived to meet flushness requirements. The project objective is to refine the contractor’s prototype Rapid Intelligent Fastener Fill System which is an automated combination melt, compress, and skive tool capable of installing fastener fill material in less than 15 seconds per fastener. Automated and Rapid Boot Installation Process: This process will reduce the labor-intensive nature of boot installation procedures, which are not suitable for full-rate production and represent 40% of the cost in component finishing. A risk assessment analysis has identified the following areas to be targeted: (1) automation of the hand-cut/trimmed, multi-piece boot installations; (2) automation of additional trimming, bonding, and pasting activities currently performed manually; (3) improved quality of technician skill/training; and (4) reduction of the waste incurred in cutting/darting boots.

High Precision Air Vehicle Manufacturing:  The most advanced air vehicles for military applications require unprecedented levels of precision structural fabrication to meet production goals and mission requirements.  Precision fabrication simplifies assembly, reduces rework and enables improved weapon system cost and performance.  Furthermore, they simplify aircraft sustainment and maintenance by increasing the interchangeability of components.

Encapsulation of large hot pressed SiC ceramic tiles into: (1) a large cast steel metallic structure; (2)machined steel heavy metal assembly; (3) cast pocketed steel heavy metal assembly; (4) a braided preformed structure  to be infused with resin; (5) a large machined Ti metallic structure. Establish affordable casting parameters for large cast encapsulated tile panels with geometries required for upgrade of current and future combat vehicles requiring protection from medium and large caliber threats. 

Field Assisted Sintering of Armor &amp; Anti-Armor Components: Mature FAST manufacturing process for DoD components.  Finish ongoing modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) on subscale SAPI die.  Redesign subscale SAPI die set from M&amp;S results; design multi cavity die for near-net-shaped penetrators; sintering trials &amp; optimization; sinter subscale SAPI and penetrator prototypes; complete final project documentation, report, &amp; close out. Primary metric for armor materials will be cycle time as FAST can significantly reduce this (> 60%). Primary metric for advanced penetrators will be cost.

                                                        <r2:Description>Enterprise and Emerging Manufacturing is a series of efforts addressing advanced manufacturing technologies and enterprise business practices for defense applications.  Key focus areas include direct digital (or additive) manufacturing, advanced manufacturing enterprise, machining, robotics, assembly, and joining.  These manufacturing technologies and enterprise business practices will accelerate delivery of technical capabilities to impact current warfighting operations, and manufacturing technologies to reduce the cost, acquisition time and risk of our major defense acquisition programs.

With our adversaries forced to innovate rapidly to survive, it's become increasingly important for the U.S. military to improve its own agility and flexibility. The focus is to find a solution to overcome a burdensome acquisition cycle requiring a great amount of cost, time, security, and storage space. Through the use of secure satellite data links or a local parts database, warfighters can access CAD designs for replacement parts, allowing them to repair equipment without the need to establish supply chains or wait for shipments. It allows operators to modify a part's design based on its performance in the field.

Emerging manufacturing technologies undergoing development include:  Large-scale, challenge for advanced, interoperable machine tool applications, and methods for exchange of 3D official technical data throughout the supply chain and between government and contractors.


MTConnect Challenge: Focuses on developing enterprise manufacturing solutions (tools) using newly developed MTConnect interoperable protocol, for use on machining platforms and manufacturing enterprise communication development. MTConnect is an open communication standard that provides the capability to pass data from enterprise components to higher level systems for further processing using the XML based standard.

Framework for Assessing Cost and Technology (FACT): Producibility analysis tools will be matured so that component performance, manufacturing processing techniques and cost can be simultaneously considered to achieve an optimum design solution.  Current producibility analysis tools do not reuse and connect existing design, manufacturing and cost models. Sustainment and Maintenance will be impacted by maturing advanced sustainability analyses operating within FACT to reduce sustainment costs associated with spare parts acquisition and weapon system maintenance.  The technology will enable correct selection of a manufacturing process to minimize cost given the estimated spare part lot sizes. Block Upgrades or Recapitalization using FACT will be critical for performing analyses associated with integrating new requirements into an existing platform to highlight the manufacturing and lifecycle costs associated with the necessary changes to the weapon system in order to meet new operational requirements.

40mm M433 Warhead Producibility: This effort will improve anti-personnel lethality at the squad level, increasing grenadier first shot effectiveness against personnel targets.  Optimization of production process prior to transition to Full Rate Production will enable avoidance of significantly high cartridge unit costs.  New manufacturing process/techniques will be established to embed discrete fragments into over molded warhead bodies, replacing deep drawn pre-formed manufacturing techniques. Low Velocity 40mm M433 High Explosive Dual Purpose (HEDP) Grenades do not meet lethality requirement stated in FM 23-31.  The grenadier, an integral part of the squad, lacks lethality from the M433 HEDP grenade. The M433 HEDP lethality is restricted by the warhead manufacturing process and design. A new warhead design and manufacturing process is required to achieve lethality requirements and to increase lethality overmatch of the squad.  Currently the M433 HEDP warhead is a deep drawn body with pre-formed fragments.  The deep drawn warhead body, although cost effective, produces inconsistent fragment sizes, weights, and patterns which reduces warhead lethality.

Loading ALIMX-101 into 500 LB General Purpose Bombs: A promising new Insensitive Munitions, IM,  explosive has been selected for implementation into the 500 LB General Purpose Bomb used by the Navy and Air Force so an efficient manufacturing process needs to be developed early in the acquisition cycle in order to avoid costly delays in fielding the new IM-compliant system.</r2:Description>

                                                        <r2:Description>Technical innovation and leadership in manufacturing are essential to sustaining the foundations of economic prosperity to enable our military to maintain technological advantage and global dominance. To support these goals, Institutes for Manufacturing Innovation (IMI) will serve as regional hubs to accelerate technological innovation into commercial application and concurrently develop the educational competencies and production processes via shared public-private sectors.   Collaborative execution and funding by the Departments of Defense (DoD), Energy (DoE), and Commerce (DoC), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the National Science Foundation (NSF) to support the establishment of the IMIs will spur industry cost-share for manufacturing innovation and quickly develop a pathway for technology-focused regional hubs for collaboration among government, industry, and academia that will meet critical government and Warfighter needs.  The concept of these institutes is highlighted in the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) report titled “Capturing Domestic Competitive Advantage in Advanced Manufacturing,” published in July 2012.

IMI for 3D printing: The focus of the 3D printing IMI is to accelerate additive manufacturing technologies to the U.S. manufacturing sector and increase domestic manufacturing competitiveness by: 1) Fostering a highly collaborative infrastructure for the open exchange of additive manufacturing information and research 2) Facilitating the development, evaluation, and deployment of efficient and flexible additive manufacturing technologies 3) Engaging with educational institutions and companies to supply education and training in additive manufacturing technologies to create an adaptive, leading workforce, 4) Serving as a national institute with regional and national impact on additive manufacturing capabilities, 5) Linking and integrating US companies with existing public, private or not-for-profit industrial and economic development resources, and business incubators, with an emphasis on assisting small- and medium-sized enterprises and early-stage companies (start-ups). The 3D printing IMI was established in 2012.

IMI for digital manufacturing and design: Advanced design and manufacturing tools that are digitally integrated and networked with supply chains can lead to 'factories of the future,' forming an agile U.S. industrial base with significant speed to market advantage. A national institute focusing on the development of model-based design methodologies, virtual manufacturing tools, and sensor and robotics-based manufacturing networks will accelerate innovation in manufacturing, increasing U.S. competitiveness. The digital manufacturing and design IMI will provide the proving ground to link promising information technologies, tools, standards, models, sensors, controls, practices and skills, and then transition these capabilities to the industrial base for full-scale application.  For example, proving and progressing intelligent electro-mechanical design and manufacturing capabilities from laboratory to prototype factory environments would improve production efficiencies and costs. The focus is the smart and comprehensive use of the ‘digital thread’ throughout design, production and support.

IMI for lightweight metals: Advanced lightweight metals possess properties comparable to traditional materials while enabling much lighter components and products. A national institute will scale-up research to accelerate market expansion by applying integrated computational of materials and manufacturing approach.  New structural alloys face tremendous barriers to application due to lack of design guides and certifications as well as cost and scale-up challenges. The goal is to develop an advanced lightweight-metal U.S. supplier base, and to enable DoD to realize significant fuel reduction, increased payloads, and greater speed and agility of manned, unmanned, and soldier systems as well as benefits for commercial applications and energy savings. 

Two additional IMIs will be established in FY 2015, focusing investments in the key technical areas of Advanced Electronics and Optics Manufacturing, Advanced Materials Manufacturing, and Enterprise and Emerging Manufacturing.

Each Institute is projected to be financially self-sustaining within a five year period of performance.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementNote>The Emerging Capabilities Technology Development (ECTD) Program Element (PE) reflects a shift in focus throughout the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Rapid Fielding (DASD RF) on producing risk-reducing prototypes and demonstrations coordinated through interagency and Service partnerships.  The ECTD will support the Department's Countering Emerging Threats priority area through longer-term, mission-focused capability development.  The office will execute projects in collaboration with government labs, academia, and industry that target specific mission capability gaps across the Combatant Commands.

In FY 2015, Disruptive Demonstrations (Project P369) funding will be transferred from PE 0603699D8Z (Emerging Capabilities Technology Development) to PE 0603289D8Z (Advanced Innovative Analysis &amp; Concepts).</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This funding develops emerging capabilities and prototypes in support of near and mid-term irregular warfare and stability operations.  The framework is guided by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering, the DASD RF, and the Rapid Reaction Technology Office science and technology objectives and focus areas.  With an emphasis on interagency and service partnerships, initiatives are developed to pursue risk-reducing prototypes and demonstrations in order to produce capability options that anticipate and inform formal joint and interagency requirements and acquisition processes.  Individual projects generally span a two to four year period, typically at a cost of less than $4.000 million, and are demonstrated and fielded in spirals within the project timeline.  During FY 2014, the ECTD Program enhanced its focus on rapid prototyping of high-payoff technologies.  This program element has evolved from exclusive support of force transformation activities to the activities described above, which are more closely aligned with departmental goals.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                        <r2:Description>Overwatch is an overarching ground capability development effort which is leveraging technology and new concepts to develop prototypical capabilities to fill ground combat and interagency capability gaps.  It contains multiple initiatives seeking to cultivate and leverage emerging technologies and concepts to counter the current and future challenges characteristic of the irregular warfare environment.  Projects are oriented toward increasing warfighter effectiveness on the battlefield and/or the development/enhancement of “whole of government” irregular warfare capabilities.
  
The capability development effort furthers interagency capabilities by pursuing concept experimentation/validation, interoperability enhancements, and command and control development.  Ground capabilities focus on command and control, force protection, situational awareness, and networked, cooperative engagement for application in denied areas or low-cost, small footprint operations.  These solutions include completed operational assessments, equipment prototypes, or validated concepts which can be used to inform and drive formal procurement processes and/or policy decisions.</r2:Description>

                                                        <r2:Description>The Maritime Irregular Warfare portfolio investigates gaps and develops irregular warfare capabilities in the maritime domain, with a particular focus on prototype concepts and systems.  Projects explore the development of counter evolved non-state capabilities such as semi- and fully-submersible vehicles, countering unmanned swarms, maritime non-lethal weapons systems, and low cost littoral fire support, among other capabilities.  This expanded effort to address maritime capability gaps builds on and leverages the Stiletto dedicated maritime demonstration vessel.  Stiletto is a maritime demonstration platform designed to assist in the assessment of prototypes and the rapid transition of emerging technologies across the range of military operations to higher Technology Readiness Levels.  Stiletto, an 88-foot long boat, is an experimental, all carbon fiber craft that was purposefully designed to rapidly acquire, integrate, and employ new capabilities to explore the military utility of emerging technologies and concepts of operation for special and expeditionary forces.  The Stiletto program, managed in partnership with the Naval Surface Warfare Center’s Combatant Craft Division and the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division’s Warfare Innovation Cell, streamlines the experimentation process and helps facilitate the rapid demonstration, exploration, and risk reduction of emerging technologies and capabilities.  The demonstration process also encourages system developers to engage directly with the warfighter in the maritime environment to rapidly adapt technologies around warfighter needs.

The Inflatable Catamaran project continued its development to improve the existing design and construction processes for the Special Forces’ inflatable hull component of the Combatant Craft Light (CCL Mk 1) inflatable catamaran with an initial operating capability in FY 2016.  The improved hull form will increase durability, reliability and maintainability.  The new design will provide significantly increased speed, range, payload, and improved riding, supporting missions such as Maritime Area Denial.  The Common Maritime Technology Working Group (CMTWG) identified the lead organizations for Stiletto Capability Demonstrations and produced an analysis of common small craft technology needs in FY 2013.  CMTWG worked within its membership to bring an advanced Multi-Fuel Engine into the Navy catalog.  The Maritime Irregular Warfare focus area supported three Stiletto Capability Demonstrations of emerging Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR), Command and Control, and maritime Unmanned Vehicle Aerial Vehicle (UAV) launch and recovery capabilities on the boat in FY 2013, supporting Navy Expeditionary Combat Command (NECC), Trident Spectre 2013, and the UK Ministry of Defence.  Technology Demonstration periods also occurred throughout the year to support industry partners with emerging and innovative capabilities.</r2:Text>

The Navy and JIEDDO worked toward a successful prototype system that will lead to the development of an operationally deployable prototype.  The Maritime Irregular Warfare portfolio will continue to develop and demonstrate state-of-the-art capabilities in anticipation of future needs, such as the Spar Tactical Sensor Mast deployable ocean sensor system and advanced unmanned surface and undersea systems focused on ASD(R&amp;E), DASD RF, and RRTO objectives and focus areas.  Projects will focus on partnerships with the US Navy, US Coast Guard, US Army Watercraft Systems, US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), US Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM), the Intelligence Community, and other operational users.  The CMTWG and Stiletto Maritime Demonstration Program will continue, and will focus maritime efforts on unmanned, autonomous capabilities and electronic warfare/electronic protection.  Inflatable Catamaran Hull and Frame Development will complete testing towards its main objectives in FY 2014 and transition those capabilities to the Navy’s Combatant Craft Light Mark 1 program. The new design will provide significantly increased speed, range, payload, and improved riding, supporting missions such as Maritime Area Denial.  New Maritime Irregular Warfare projects for FY 2014 include development of the Spar Tactical Sensor Mast deployable ocean sensor system with the US Navy Director of Expeditionary Warfare and other interagency partners, which will increase situational awareness in limited access areas; and an effort to focus on maritime disablement technologies and prototypes to counter emerging threats.  Emerging capabilities will continue to be demonstrated on Stiletto during three Capability Demonstrations with operational commands and interagency partners, as well as joint operational demonstrations and exercises including Trident Warrior and Trident Spectre.  Stiletto’s FY 2014 Capability Demonstrations will focus on demonstrating integrated situational awareness capabilities to support expeditionary, coastal and riverine operations; mobile capabilities to support USSOCOM’s maritime activities; and maritime UAV launch and recovery demonstrations to support stakeholders including the UK Ministry of Defence and Naval Special Warfare.  Technology Demonstration opportunities will continue to be offered to non-traditional businesses to help mature their systems and increase engagement with the warfighter in the development process.</r2:Text>

                                                        <r2:Description>In 2008, the Department undertook an airship project called “Pelican”; with National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Ames Research Center providing technical and contractual oversight.  Pelican served as a non-deployable technology demonstrator that integrated several innovative technologies into a rigid aeroshell, variable buoyancy (RAVB) air vehicle.  The project’s goal was to mitigate long-term technical risks by integrating and demonstrating a suite of technologies with the potential to assist the development of future heavy-lift, airship programs.  The technology may enable the development of a nascent class of air vehicle which will reduce the energy use per ton-mile of airlift operations, permit high-payload operations directly into and out of austere regions with little infrastructure and enable long-endurance manned or unmanned air operations.  The key technologies demonstrated include: a buoyancy control system called Control of Static Heaviness (COSH), a rigid, lightweight-composite internal structure, a low-speed/hover control system and ground handling capabilities that allow operations without a traditional airship’s ground handling crew.  This project and its inherent technical progress were also monitored by the United States Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) and United States Transportation Command.</r2:Description>

FY 2013 funding was provided to produce technical data on Pelican’s subsystems that can be shared and used to guide future design and investment.  In March 2013, a report was submitted documenting project Pelican’s development.  In addition to a detailed analysis of the various subsystems, the report contained a theoretical scalability analysis as well as embedded lessons learned and development challenges.  The analytically detailed information gained from Project Pelican’s complete body of testing will help the DoD determine the best path forward with regard to airships in general and RAVB technology in particular.

In September 2013, project Pelican officially concluded with the submission of the final report on data and analyses conducted in FY 2013.  No follow-on work or funding is planned by the Department.</r2:Text>

                                                        <r2:Description>This portfolio examines and explores emerging technologies and prototypes to complement the US Air Force (USAF), the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), and other interagency initiatives in ISR.  In addition, the portfolio addresses the National Space Strategy objectives to preserve and protect the space environment with a focus on developing applications for employment by the tactical user.  The flagship project for this portfolio is Thunderstorm, an enduring multi-Intelligence technology demonstration for the Office of Secretary of Defense, interagency partners, Combatant Commands (COCOMs), Services, academia, government laboratories and commercial vendors.  Thunderstorm demonstrations provide an opportunity to evaluate and assess the capabilities of new, prototype, emerging and transformational ISR technologies, and related information collection, processing, exploitation, and dissemination (PED) capabilities in mission-related, geographically, and operationally relevant environments prior to full-scale employment.  Thunderstorm demonstration objectives, performance measures, lessons learned, post-demonstration assessments and data evaluation serve to inform future DoD ISR concepts of operations and remote PED capabilities.  Thunderstorm aims to identify new capabilities and/or new ways to employ existing capabilities that enhance our ability to “Deter, Predict, and Interdict” threats while assessing how to bridge capability gaps that cross multiple Departments and Agencies.</r2:Description>

Both spirals capitalized on the lessons learned from previous spirals.  In partnership with Joint Interagency Task Force South (JIATF-S), Customs and Border Protection (CPB), United States Coast Guard (USCG), United States Navy (USN), National Geo-Spatial Intelligence Agency (NGA), National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), United States Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM), United States Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) and the Texas Department of Public Safety, Spiral 13-1 technologies were utilized to detect and discriminate suspicious behavior in the open water, littoral and maritime-to-land transition space.  The highlight of this Spiral was the capability to share information in near real-time among eight data nodes.  Spiral 13-2 built upon lessons learned from Spiral 13-1, placed emphasis on the maritime-to-land transition activity and the ability to prosecute suspicious actors as they quickly meld themselves into urban or rural populations.  This information was gathered and then shared in near real time to the data nodes.  In FY 2013, Thunderstorm spirals demonstrated 28 emerging capabilities in operationally realistic environments with a broad range of potential operational users providing support.

In the space arena, a classified project in partnership with the NRO successfully demonstrated the ability to use commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) Satellite Communications (SATCOM) equipment for transferring large data files from theater to the U.S.  The project used a COTS SATCOM High Data Rate Modem to improve the bandwidth throughput by 100 percent.  This was a prototype demonstration and this concept of operations will be adapted to other satellites.</r2:Text>

All three FY 2014 Spirals will capitalize on the lessons learned from previous spirals with special emphasis on information sharing; barriers to information sharing and evaluating prototype technologies.  Spiral 14-1 is a stand-alone threat convergence analysis designed to explore existing and nascent technology in an effort to expose threats to our national security; specifically those described as “Black Swan” events.  Spiral 14-1 is intended to be a precursor to FY 2015 Spirals.  Spiral 14-1 will be conducted in March 2014.  Spiral 14-2 is a Distributed Tabletop effort that is directly associated with the 14-3 Field Demonstration and focuses on Countering Chemical and Biological Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD). Spiral 14-2 Distributed Tabletop exercise will be conducted in February 2014. The Spiral 14-3 Field Demonstration will take place in the southeast United States in the Spring/Summer 2014.  Key operational partners include the JIATF-S, USCG, Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), CBP, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), USN Intelligence Community (IC),  Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI), NRO, NGA, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), Joint Program Executive Office (JPEO) for Chemical and Biological  Defense, and Special Operations Command (SOCOM).

In the space arena, projects focus on increasing satellite utility, prototypes, developing transformational satellite capabilities for the tactical user and efforts to improve space situational awareness.  With the high value and long lead time to replace space assets, the goal is to preserve and protect these capabilities.
 In FY 2014, a project is underway to assess emerging technologies for managing the space environment.  Specifically, the project will provide a critical overview of credible technologies, prototypes, and concepts for understanding, observing, and managing the space environment through space debris mitigation, commercial space situational awareness capabilities, and space-based orbital servicing.  Other projects under consideration for FY 2014 include Flume, a software system that aims to enhance the speed of ISR data link communications for Global Hawk, and Multi-INT Activity Learning and Inferencing for Space Threat Prediction (MALISTP), a software system that produces indications and warnings of threats to space assets, attribute estimation, change detection, and proximity analysis.</r2:Text>

                                                        <r2:Description>This portfolio will focus on cost-effective, limited duration projects to design, develop and deliver prototypes of cutting-edge land, sea, air and space systems to meet the Department's goal to drive innovation in aviation, space, maritime and ground combat systems in a fiscally constrained environment through advanced rapid prototyping.  These prototypes will be delivered to joint and Service users to evaluate operational capabilities under realistic conditions and against current adversaries or anticipated threats.  Potential venues for prototype assessment include assets such as the Stiletto Maritime Demonstration Program, Thunderstorm integration exercises and the Joint Experimental Range Complex (JERC) in Yuma, Arizona.  (The JERC experimentation venue is supported in part by the Rapid Reaction Technology Office’s Rapid Reaction Fund.)  Knowledge and experience gained through those demonstrations will help develop new warfighting concepts and inform requirements and technical feasibility of future acquisition programs.  These initial prototype efforts will help reduce the cost of future acquisition programs and stimulate efforts beyond traditional defense industrial base activities.  Development of advanced prototypes will involve partnerships with industry and academia and permit operational users to gain insight into future technology-enabled strategies and tactics.  Advanced rapid prototyping provides a mechanism to guard against technological surprise, preserve industrial base capabilities, impose asymmetric strategic costs on potential adversaries, and explore innovative, technology-enabled military capabilities.</r2:Description>

Plans for FY 2014 include pursuing development of concepts and designs that will result in ready-to-field prototype systems in one to three years.  Candidate efforts will address the Department’s Science and Technology priorities, including unmanned air, ground, and underwater systems; low-cost space access; advanced rotorcraft capabilities; directed energy; energy efficient engine technology; electronic warfare; global access Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (ISR) systems; dismounted soldier systems; vehicle active protection; and installation/base efficiency, sustainment and protection.  New prototype efforts in FY 2014 include: Advanced Countermeasure Prototype Phase III – Forward Operating Base (FOB) and Convoy Active Protection System (ACP Phase III: F&amp;C APS) which will provide an active protection system against rocket propelled grenades for ground assets—FOBs and vehicles; and establishment of a focus on Electromagnetic Environmental Understanding, which will allow tactical units to automatically identify and exploit electromagnetic spectrum or signals of interest.  A project under consideration in this focus area is Quantum Weak Value Amplifier (QWVA), which will amplify electromagnetic signals of interest.  Other potential new prototype efforts in FY 2014 include Small Fast Interceptor, a classified program addressing Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2/AD) capability gaps, and North American Arctic Next Generation Over-the-Horizon Radar (Arctic OTHR), which will demonstrate and mature advanced bi-static and multi-static OTHR concepts and techniques to support development of a persistent, scalable, wide-area Arctic surveillance capability in both the air and maritime domains.  Advanced prototype efforts will leverage joint or Service partnerships and involve operational commands in the evaluation of field-ready prototypes in realistic military environments.  Additional new efforts will examine and find possible leverage points to improve the state of the art for rapid prototyping.  Potential efforts may include improved materials, reduced prototyping costs and/or improved cycle times for prototyping activities.</r2:Text>

Disruptive demonstrations can be stand-alone technology, new processes, services, or concept demonstrations.  Projects will be selected in the execution year based on evolving iterative requirements from Joint and Service participants.  

These include demonstrations to examine and characterize DoD networks; cognitive Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) projects to enhance metrics of Theater Security Cooperation Plan (TSCP) activities; Command and Control (C2) tools during pre-conflict periods; and enhanced Operations Security (OPSEC) procedures to protect acquisition and operational data. Additional plans include:
- Complete high-fidelity model development of four prototype to address urgent Combatant Command needs to support land-based defense assessments.
- Evaluate performance of alternative uses of Service systems in response to a Joint Chiefs of Staff tasking to support land-based defense assessments.
- Evaluate undersea capability options, and develop necessary models to respond to a Combatant Command tasking to support land-based defense assessments.
- Leverage previously developed hypervelocity projectile models to evaluate Powder Gun defense in partnership with the Navy and Army; inputs risks and performance drivers into Land-based Railgun and Powder Gun test plans to support land-based defense assessments. 
- Expand development of and end-to-end Railgun and Powdergun engagement models that can be integrated with higher-fidelity threat models, to support land-based defense assessments.</r2:Text>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Congress established the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) in 1990 (10 U.S.C. Section 2901-2904) to address Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of Energy (DOE) environmental concerns.  It is conducted as a DoD program, jointly planned and executed by the DoD, DOE, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), with strong participation by other Federal agencies, industry, and academia.  SERDP`s objective is to improve DoD mission readiness and environmental performance by providing new scientific knowledge and cost-effective technologies in the areas of Environmental Restoration, Munitions Response, Resource Conservation and Climate Change, and Weapons Systems and Platforms.  SERDP does this by addressing high priority DoD environmental technology requirements.  SERDP enhances military operations, improves military systems` effectiveness, enhances military training/readiness, sustains DoD’s training and test ranges and installation infrastructure, and helps ensure the safety and welfare of military personnel and their dependents by eliminating or reducing the generation of pollution and use of hazardous materials and reducing the cost of remedial actions and compliance with environmental laws and regulations.  As a secondary benefit, SERDP helps solve significant national and international environmental problems.  The keys to a growing list of SERDP technological successes are the ability to respond aggressively and proactively to priority defense environmental needs; the pursuit of world-class technical excellence; and an emphasis on constant technology transfer.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Joint Warfighting Program (JWP) is a relatively small but pivotal resource that synchronizes two Department-wide domains, military requirements and acquisition, with shared analyses and actionable assessments.  The account underwrites two related activities supporting development of the Department's joint warfighting capability.  These resources are a slim residual of much larger accounts supporting unique warfare capability analyses for joint customers including major combatant commander staffs and the Joint Staff.  These analyses and assessments deliver independent perspectives on ways to align Service and Agency investments and potential solutions for capability gaps created by evolving threats not aligned to single Component missions.  Iterative military budget reductions to joint mission support programs significantly increased demand for JWP support from joint staffs and “units in the field” assigned to joint missions. 

The JWP resources are dedicated to analytic support for joint capability analysis and joint customers.  JWP provides a safety net for analytic support responding to emergent joint capability requirements and capability gaps for identifying potential material solutions.  Typical projects funded with JWP include translation of capability gap assessments into actionable military needs statements, identification of candidate solutions via experimentation, translation of solution concepts into field demonstrations, and remedy of joint capability gaps in partnership with Defense agents for doctrine changes and technology development.  JWP resources dedicated to direct support joint commands provides analytic expertise not normally allocated via formal staffing billets.  In this activity, JWP underwrites small grants to invigorate employment of experimentation and analysis, to formulate strategies to resolve joint capability gaps, and to stimulate participation in the Department enterprises for joint experimentation and joint capability development.  JWP resources also support Mission Area Portfolio Assessments (MAPA), and the development of tools supporting joint analytic efforts.

The balance of JWP funds contributes resources to examination of potential remedies for joint mission capability gaps.  These early assessments of potential capability gap solutions can accelerate engineering development, subsequent field experiments, and capability demonstrations in field conditions.  This segment of JWP often represents the first effort to define alternative solutions across the range of Doctrine, Organization, Training, Material, Leadership and Personnel-Facilities.  The resources sustain a small segment of civilian operation research analysis (currently hosted by the Institute for Defense Analysis – IDA and the Naval Postgraduate School - NPS).  Administered by the Joint Operations Support (JOS) division within OSD’s AT&amp;L organization, JOS works closely and continuously with joint customers around the world.  Analytic project selection is undertaken in consultation with the OSD staffs serving AT&amp;L and Policy and with elements of the Joint Staff.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The OSD JWP account underwrites two related activities supporting development of the Department's joint warfighting capability.  These are resources dedicated to support joint capability analysis for joint customers and undertaken by Combatant Command staffs, and resources dedicated for independent analysis of joint warfare (currently conducted by the Institute for Defense Analysis – IDA and the Naval Postgraduate School - NPS).  Iterative military budgets decrements leave JWP as the primary resource dedicated to analytic assessment of joint capability gaps and potential solutions.  During a period of force resetting and realignment, this resource becomes even more essential to staffs and military units dedicated to evolving joint missions.

The JWP resources are dedicated to analytic support for joint capability analysis and joint customers.  JWP provides a safety net for analytic support responding to emergent joint capability requirements and capability gaps for identifying potential material solutions.  Typical projects funded with JWP include translation of capability gap assessments into actionable military needs statements, identification of candidate solutions via experimentation, translation of solution concepts into field demonstrations, and remedy of joint capability gaps in partnership with Defense agents for doctrine changes and technology development.  JWP resources dedicated to projects in partnership with joint commands provide analytic expertise not normally allocated via formal staffing billets.  In this activity, JWP underwrites small grants to invigorate employment of experimentation and analysis, to formulate strategies to resolve joint capability gaps, and to stimulate participation in the Department enterprises for joint experimentation and joint capability development.  JWP resources also support Mission Area Portfolio Assessments (MAPA), and the development of tools supporting joint commander analytic efforts.

The balance of JWP funds resource the Joint Warfare Independent Analysis segment, an independent source to examine potential remedies for mission capability gaps.  This segment of JWP often represents the first effort to define alternative solutions across the range of Doctrine, Organization, Training, Material, Leadership and Personnel-Facilities.  The resources sustain a small segment of operation research analysis (currently hosted by the Institute for Defense Analysis – IDA).  Administered by the Joint Operations Support (JOS) division within OSD/AT&amp;L, JOS works closely and continuously with joint customers around the world.  Analytic project selection is undertaken in consultation with the OSD staffs serving AT&amp;L and Policy and with elements of the Joint Staff.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Software is key to meeting the DoD’s increasing demand for high-quality, affordable, and timely national defense systems.  Systemic software issues are significant contributors to poor program execution, and reliance on software-intensive mobile and net based products and systems has been increasing (e.g., Joint Tactical Radio System, DDG-1000, Joint Strike Fighter, F-22, and Army Modernization).  As stated in the 2010 National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences report entitled Critical Code, “It is dangerous to conclude that we are reaching a plateau in capability and technology for software producibility.”  The report notes that software is “…unconstrained by traditional physical engineering limitations…” and what we can accomplish is derived “…from [the] human intellectual capacity to conceptualize and understand systems….”  With growing global parity in software engineering, the DoD must maintain leadership to avoid strategic surprise.  The Software Engineering Institute (SEI) Program Element (PE) addresses the critical need to research, develop, and rapidly transition state-of-the-art software technology, tools, development environments, and best practices to improve the engineering, management, fielding, evolution, acquisition, and sustainment of software-intensive DoD systems.  The SEI PE’s program of work seeks to coordinate across the Department and the Services and leverages expertise in industry and academia to enable the development of joint capabilities.

Software is more pervasive than ever and computer programs are growing in size and complexity.  Designing, managing, and securing integrated, complex, and large-scale mission-critical systems are abilities that the DoD and Defense Industrial Base (DIB) have not yet mastered.  To address this, the P781 project within this PE funds research and development within the SEI Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) and, to access particular expertise, in the Services, industry, and academia.

The SEI FFRDC is the DoD’s dedicated source for software research and development.  It is an institute which enables the exploitation of emerging software technology by bringing engineering, management, and security discipline to software acquisition, development, and evolution.  The SEI FFRDC focuses on software technology areas judged to be of the highest payoff in meeting defense needs.  To ensure that the DoD retains a differential advantage over potential adversaries, funding at the SEI FFRDC will include a new Budget Activity 2 funding line beginning in FY 2014.  The reduction in P781 in this line beginning in FY 2014 is offset by the creation of the new line, the SEI Applied Research PE.  The creation of this new line represents a pivot toward more fundamental research that will enable the DoD to address longer-term challenges in software technology and engineering.  The SEI Applied Research PE will also increase the collaboration opportunities for the SEI FFRDC with academia and attract top research talent to the SEI.  

Private sector investment has created rapid advances in information technologies, but the pace of transition to DoD applications is often very slow or the commercial applications do not meet DoD unique needs, e.g., high assurance software or large-scale integrated systems.  The DoD needs to create opportunities to discover emerging technologies, to evaluate their potential to fit DoD needs, and where appropriate, conduct critical tests of the technologies under DoD conditions.  The P783 project within this PE funds the Software Producibility Initiative.  The Software Producibility Initiative works across the Services, industry, and academia to research and transition software science and tools that address the capacity to design, produce, assure, and evolve software-intensive systems in a predictable manner while effectively managing risk, cost, schedule, quality, and complexity.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The SEI maintains unique software research and program support capabilities in a space where the Defense Industrial Base (DIB) and academia cannot as readily address challenges.  The mission of the SEI is to provide DoD with technical leadership and innovation through research and development to advance the practice of software engineering and technology.  The Institute works across Government, industry, and academia to improve the state of software engineering from the technical, acquisition, and management perspectives.  The SEI engages in research and development of critical software technologies and tools, and collaborates with the larger software engineering research community. It facilitates rapid transition of software engineering technologies into practice, and evaluates emerging software engineering technologies to determine their potential for improving software-intensive DoD systems.  Since its inception, the SEI has helped to transform the fields of software engineering and acquisition, network security, real-time systems, software architectures, and software-engineering process management.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

These shortcomings can frequently be traced to software development technologies which are not capable of addressing the scale and complexity of the software needed in today’s systems.  The Software Producibility Initiative seeks to conduct an integrated program of research from applied research through demonstration and evaluation to advance the state-of-the-art in the producibility of software for DoD systems, particularly those systems characterized by high complexity, need for robustness, information assurance, real-time performance, and physical distribution.  The Initiative maintains a portfolio of work relevant to the Warfighter and DoD needs by periodically evaluating technology development efforts, retiring those that are under performing, and starting new efforts based on risk-reward priority.  The Initiative demonstrates new underlying software technology and tools in various domains, e.g., Networks, Modeling and Simulation, Avionics, Signal Intelligence, where DoD can benefit and enhance the transition paths for the underlying technology.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementNote>The Quick Reaction Special Projects (QRSP) Program Element is being recast with a focus on producing risk-reducing prototypes designed to address Combatant Command (COCOM) threats.  QRSP efforts will support the Department goal to provide a Hedge Against Technical Uncertainty by leveraging insights gained through mission-focused efforts and by fostering collaboration among government laboratories, academia, and commercial research.  The QRSP portfolio will develop technology that anticipates adversaries’ capabilities through short-term, innovative science and engineering initiatives.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Quick Reactions Special Projects (QRSP) Program supports five separate projects that provide rapid funding to expedite development and transition of new technologies to the warfighter.  These projects are:  1) Quick Reaction Fund (QRF); 2) Rapid Reaction Fund (RRF);  3) Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) Architecture and Integration (RAI) 4) Joint Rapid Acquisition Cell (JRAC) support; and 5) Strategic Multi-Layered Assessment (SMA) support.  QRSP provides the flexibility to respond to emergent DoD issues and address technology surprises and needs within the years of execution outside the two year budget cycle.  These efforts field new capabilities at low cost in short time-frames, inform the traditional acquisition cycle, and inject innovative technology into programs of record.

The QRF Program objectives are to develop prototypes in response to emergent conventional warfare needs during the execution years that take advantage of breakthroughs in rapidly evolving technologies.  The QRF is executed by the Rapid Reaction Technology Office.  Examples of the types of projects that are envisioned include: force protection projects to enhance anti-access and area denial capabilities, undersea offensive capabilities and broad electronic warfare capabilities.  The QRF focuses on maturing technologies critically needed for the COCOMs.  QRF projects are typically 12 months in duration and produce prototypes with new capabilities for demonstration and evaluation.
 
The Rapid Reaction Fund (RRF) objectives are to leverage the DoD science and technology (S&amp;T) base and those of the other federal departments, as well as academia and the commercial sector to identify emerging capabilities and counter evolving threats.  The RRF is executed by the Rapid Reaction Technology Office (RRTO).  RRTO works to anticipate adversaries’ exploitation of new technologies and advanced capabilities and develop cost saving prototype capabilities to counter emerging threats.  Additionally, RRTO works to leverage technology developed outside of the DoD in the commercial sector, academia, international arenas, and small, non-traditional businesses to address specific DoD needs areas as identified by Combatant Commanders, Military Service organizations, other Defense agencies and interagency organizations.  Typical RRF programs are 6-18 months in duration and aim to mature a capability to demonstration.  The RRF consistently exceeds the transition objective of 40 percent for demonstration programs (DoD Strategic Objective 3.5.2D).      

The Architecture and Integration (RAI) program objectives are to enhance and expand rapid technology architecture and assessment capabilities in general; and, to enhance the Joint Experimentation Range Complex (JERC), Stiletto maritime test platform and the Thunderstorm Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) exercise series.  The JERC provides a venue to evaluate a wide range of new technologies in a dessert environment.  RAI funding also supports Stiletto, a maritime test vessel that routinely hosts numerous new technologies for evaluation in a maritime environment.  Thunderstorm, an ongoing ISR exercise series, is also supported by this budget line.  Thunderstorm brings emerging ISR technologies together in a common architecture for exercise and operational demonstration.  Due to the draw down in Afghanistan in FY 2014, projects in RAI are either being concluded or aligned to other QRSP programs  
 
The Joint Rapid Acquisition Cell (JRAC) Program objectives focus on responding to Joint Urgent Operational Needs (JUONS) that have been submitted by Combatant Commanders and validated by the Joint Staff.  In addition, the JRAC’s objectives are to manage the delivery of capabilities as requested by the Combatant Command (COCOM) in a time frame acceptable to the COCOM.  Efforts, in most instances, are conducted outside of the processes described in the Defense Acquisition System in DoD Directive 5000.1 and utilize contingency and other rapid acquisition authorities.

The Strategic Multi-Layered Assessment (SMA) cell program objective is to support all COCOMs, Joint Force Commanders, and other government agencies by assessing complex operational/technical challenges which require multi-agency and multi-disciplinary approaches.  With input from across the United States Government, academia, and the private sector, the SMA cell develops solution options to COCOM generated challenging problems and informs the command’s senior leadership.  Each SMA cell effort is initiated at the request of COCOM senior leadership.  Priorities for SMA Cell programs are set by the Joint Staff Deputy for Operations.  Products are typically produced within six months and directly contribute to the decision-making process of the COCOM’s senior leaders.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The Quick Reaction Fund (QRF) Program provides the Services, Components, Combatant Commands (COCOMs), and force providers opportunities to capitalize on technologies that are at a relatively high Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and to rapidly field-test promising new developmental and operational prototypes that can have immediate impact on military operations.  QRF initiatives are limited to those that will deliver a prototype application within twelve months of being funded.

The QRF Program also focuses on projects that have the potential to address conventional, disruptive, catastrophic and irregular threats.  More specifically, initiatives that serve to maintain a technical advantage over potential adversaries and reduce technical risk barriers in the following interest areas: Anti-Access and Area Denial; Base Protection; Electromagnetic Bandwidth and Spectrum Enhancement; Persistent Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance; Newly Emerging National Threats; Directed Energy Capabilities; Low-Cost Precision Engagement Capabilities; Operational Field Demonstrations; Unmanned and Robotics Systems; Over the Horizon-Radar Technologies; and Counter-Electronic Warfare Technologies.  

In FY 2014 and FY 2015, the QRF Program will continue to identify and fund new projects and prototypes that respond to critical operational needs and new technology development.  Current and future efforts that show significant effectiveness can be leveraged by additional investments in order to accelerate transition to operational forces.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Quick Reaction Special Projects (QSRP) Program supports five separate projects that provide rapid funding to expedite development and transition of new prototypical technologies to the warfighter.  The QSRP Program provides the flexibility to mitigate emerging threats and address technology surprises and needs that may arise outside the two-year budget cycle. 

The Rapid Reaction Fund (RRF) is fully executed through the Rapid Reaction Technology Office (RRTO).  The RRTO was established to accelerate the transition of high-potential science and technology (S&amp;T) projects into operationally useful prototypes in the execution years.  The RRTO leverages the Department of Defense (DoD) S&amp;T base and those of the other Federal Departments, academia, and industry; stimulates interagency coordination and cooperation; accelerates the fielding of prototypical capabilities and concepts to counter emerging threats; and, provides feedback to the S&amp;T community to guide long term developmental strategies.  With projects supporting each Combatant Command and with a global perspective, the RRTO anticipates adversaries' exploitation of technology, including available and advanced commercial capabilities.  Prototypes delivered by RRTO provide cost effective capabilities to operational users faster than the typical acquisition cycle.

In prior years, RRTO has explored methods and approaches of persistent surveillance stimulation for counter-insurgency; developed alternate power sources for sensors and systems; provided low-cost capabilities for small-footprint operations; expanded human, social and cultural knowledge; increased small unit situational awareness; advanced the interface between law enforcement and military operations; developed biometrics and forensics capabilities; supported denied area operations; strategic multi-layer assessments; and, established an innovation outreach cell that is facilitating better interactions with small companies with emerging technologies that do not normally do business with the DoD.  

In FY 2014 and FY 2015, RRTO will continue to explore new and emerging capabilities to support irregular warfare operations while working to support the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition Technology &amp; Logistics), the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering) and the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Rapid Fielding goals.  With project selection occurring during the execution year, the RRTO's potential focus areas for FY 2014 and FY 2015 projects include:  capabilities to operate in denied areas, navigation in Global Positioning System denied environments,  persistent Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) architecture; ISR sensors; global warming’s impact on operations in the Arctic, novel power sources for unmanned vehicles, interface of law enforcement and military operations; commercial product vulnerabilities and applications; biometrics and forensics S&amp;T; autonomous operations; data processing, exploitation and dissemination; cyber security; exploitation of new and emerging cell phone technologies; counter proliferation initiatives;  strategic communications and multi-layer assessments; and, non-traditional approaches to leverage innovative businesses.  

The typical length of a RRTO project falls within a 6 to 12 month range in order to more effectively respond to the Warfighter.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This collection provided a fundamental database for evaluating approaches for detecting and unraveling nefarious activity hidden in realistic civilian clutter.  Bluegrass data has been provided to more than 150 organizations to facilitate development of new Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities.  In FY 2013, RRTO collaborated with the intelligence community and subject matter experts to make final plans to execute the Bluegrass II data collect which will explore the applications of low cost, low-access sensing such as urban video networks and social media to augment or replace traditional ISR sensors.  These efforts inform and enable development of ISR capabilities needed for future military operations in denied or austere areas.  Specific Bluegrass II objectives include developing an algorithm to track an individual across a dense urban video network, developing a technique to discover threat communications in social media, and developing a methodology to discover and characterize all Red Team nodes.</r2:Description>

Additionally, the biometrics and forensics projects will collaborate with interagency partners to attribute enemy activity to a specific individual; and, will operationally evaluate and test biometrics and forensics systems and technologies.  The biometrics and forensics projects will develop emerging technologies that support evolving identity operations and forensic capabilities required by commanders and warfighters in ongoing and future military activities.  Projects for both portfolios are selected after coordination throughout the DoD and across other US Government Departments and Agencies to maximize collaborative investment and prevent redundant research.  Deliverables are shared throughout the biometrics and forensics communities.</r2:Description>

                                                        <r2:Description>ISR sensors span a wide range of sensing modalities and generally produce very large data sets that are difficult to analyze in a cluttered environment.  Efforts in this area will develop better sensors and tools to more effectively analyze or visualize ISR data.  New start projects include improved surveillance sensors, tools to facilitate analysis of large data sets, methods to harvest meaningful intelligence from open and classified sources and establishment of more effective processing, exploitation, and dissemination capabilities to facilitate integration of new and existing systems.  Projects in this area generally involve high risk and have high potential reward; and, are not being addressed by other organizations.  Projects will also explore technologies to improve ISR in denied areas.  ISR projects will also evaluate methods of increasing the effectiveness of ISR architectures to maximize the capability delivered to the user and to reduce the amount of human analyst manpower required to produce actionable intelligence.</r2:Description>

The JERC provides a venue to evaluate a wide range of new technologies in a dessert environment.  The funding will also support Stiletto, a maritime test vessel that routinely hosts numerous new technologies for evaluation in a maritime environment.  Thunderstorm, an ongoing ISR exercise series, is also supported by this budget line.  Thunderstorm brings emerging ISR technologies together in a common architecture for exercise and operational demonstration.   

With the drawdown of operations in Afghanistan in FY 2014, the requirements for many of the assessments supported by this budget line have been greatly reduced.  The remaining assessment requirements will be addressed by other Program Elements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                        <r2:Description>The Maritime Irregular Warfare portfolio investigates gaps and develops irregular warfare capabilities in the maritime domain, with a particular focus on prototype concepts and systems.  Projects explore the development of counter evolved non-state capabilities such as semi- and fully-submersible vehicles, countering unmanned swarms, maritime non-lethal weapons systems, and low cost littoral fire support, among other capabilities.  This expanded effort to address maritime capability gaps builds on and leverages the Stiletto dedicated maritime demonstration vessel.  Stiletto is a maritime demonstration platform designed to assist in the assessment of prototypes and the rapid transition of emerging technologies across the range of military operations to higher Technology Readiness Levels.  Stiletto, an 88-foot long boat, is an experimental, all carbon fiber craft that was purposefully designed to rapidly acquire, integrate, and employ new capabilities to explore the military utility of emerging technologies and concepts of operation for special and expeditionary forces.  The Stiletto program, managed in partnership with the Naval Surface Warfare Center’s Combatant Craft Division and the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division’s Warfare Innovation Cell, streamlines the experimentation process and helps facilitate the rapid demonstration, exploration, and risk reduction of emerging technologies and capabilities.  The demonstration process also encourages system developers to engage directly with the warfighter in the maritime environment to rapidly adapt technologies around warfighter needs.  The Stiletto vessel is home-ported in Norfolk, Virginia.</r2:Description>

The Inflatable Catamaran project continued its development to improve the existing design and construction processes for the Special Forces’ inflatable hull component of the Combatant Craft Light inflatable catamaran with an initial operating capability in FY 2016.  The improved hull form will increase durability, reliability and maintainability.  The new design will provide significantly increased speed, range, payload, and improved riding, supporting missions such as Maritime Area Denial.  The Common Maritime Technology Working Group (CMTWG) identified the lead organizations for Stiletto Capability Demonstrations and produced an analysis of common small craft technology needs in FY 2013.  CMTWG worked within its membership to bring an advanced Multi-Fuel Engine into the Navy catalog.  The Maritime Irregular Warfare focus area supported three Stiletto Capability Demonstrations of emerging Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR), Command and Control, and maritime Unmanned Vehicle Aerial Vehicle (UAV) launch and recovery capabilities on the boat in FY 2013, supporting Navy Expeditionary Combat Command (NECC), Trident Spectre 2013, and the UK Ministry of Defence.  Technology Demonstration periods also occurred throughout the year to support industry partners with emerging and innovative capabilities.</r2:Text>

                                                        <r2:Description>This portfolio examines and explores emerging technologies and prototypes to complement the US Air Force (USAF), the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), and other interagency initiatives in ISR.  In addition, the portfolio addresses the National Space Strategy objectives to preserve and protect the space environment with a focus on developing applications for employment by the tactical user.  The flagship project for this portfolio is Thunderstorm, an enduring multi-Intelligence technology demonstration for the Office of Secretary of Defense, interagency partners, Combatant Commands (COCOMs), Services, academia, government laboratories and commercial vendors.  Thunderstorm demonstrations provide an opportunity to evaluate and assess the capabilities of new, prototype, emerging and transformational ISR technologies, and related information collection, processing, exploitation, and dissemination (PED) capabilities in mission-related, geographically, and operationally relevant environments prior to full-scale employment.  Thunderstorm demonstration objectives, performance measures, lessons learned, post-demonstration assessments and data evaluation serve to inform future DoD ISR concepts of operations and remote PED capabilities.  Thunderstorm aims to identify new capabilities and/or new ways to employ existing capabilities that enhance our ability to “Deter, Predict, and Interdict” threats while assessing how to bridge capability gaps that cross multiple Departments and Agencies.</r2:Description>

Both spirals capitalized on the lessons learned from previous spirals.  In partnership with Joint Interagency Task Force South, Customs and Border Protection, United States Coast Guard, United States Navy, National Geo-Spatial Intelligence Agency, National Reconnaissance Office, United States Southern Command, United States Northern Command and the Texas Department of Public Safety, Spiral 13-1 technologies were utilized to detect and discriminate suspicious behavior in the open water, littoral and maritime-to-land transition space.  The highlight of this Spiral was the capability to share information in near real-time among eight data nodes.  Spiral 13-2 built upon lessons learned from Spiral 13-1, placed emphasis on the maritime-to-land transition activity and the ability to prosecute suspicious actors as they quickly meld themselves into urban or rural populations.  This information was gathered and then shared in near real time to the data nodes.  In FY 2013, Thunderstorm spirals demonstrated 28 emerging capabilities in operationally realistic environments with a broad range of potential operational users providing support.

In the space arena, a classified project in partnership with the NRO successfully demonstrated the ability to use commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) Satellite Communications (SATCOM) equipment for transferring large data files from theater to the U.S.  The project used a COTS SATCOM High Data Rate Modem to improve the bandwidth throughput by 100 percent.  This was a prototype demonstration and this concept of operations will be adapted to other satellites.</r2:Text>

This project consisted of three components.  The first component was a research study into methods of conducting socio-cultural analysis including remote sensing techniques for collecting indicator variables of resilience and vulnerability within interrelated megacity and rural systems.  The second component was a case analysis of the drivers of buffers to political, social, economic and environmental instability in the Dhaka, Bangladesh population center.  The third component of the study was an assessment and testing of novel ways to present and visualize megacity stability data.  This benefited COCOM planners with forecasting socio-cultural trends affecting state, regional, or community level stability.  Also, this effort answered the need for quantitative stability assessment approaches to address key national security considerations including the potential for resurgence of violent extremism; humanitarian crisis; reinforcement of outlier state behavior and consideration of partner and ally relations.</r2:Text>

Goal Two. Policies at the enterprise level that:
o Promote interoperability and the use of common M&amp;S capabilities.
o Minimize duplication and encourage reuse of M&amp;S capabilities.
o Encourage research and development (R&amp;D) to respond to emerging challenges.
o Limit the use of models and data encumbered by proprietary restrictions.
o Leverage M&amp;S capabilities across DoD, other government agencies, International partners, industry, and academia.

Goal Three. Management processes for models, simulations, and data that:
o Enable M&amp;S users and developers to easily discover and share M&amp;S capabilities and provide incentives for their use.
o Facilitate the cost-effective and efficient development and use of M&amp;S systems and capabilities.
o Include practical validation, verification, and accreditation guidelines that vary by application area.

Goal Four. Tools in the form of models, simulations, and authoritative data that:
o Support the full range of DoD interests.
o Provide timely and credible results.
o Make capabilities, limitations, and assumptions easily visible.
o Are useable across communities.

Goal Five. People that:
o Are well-trained.
o Employ existing models, simulation, and data to support departmental objectives.
o Advance M&amp;S to support emerging departmental challenges.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Test and Evaluation/Science and Technology (T&amp;E/S&amp;T) Program seeks out and develops test technologies to stay in pace with evolving weapons technologies.  This program is critical to ensure that the Department of Defense (DoD) has the ability to adequately test the advanced systems that will be fielded in the future.  To meet this objective, the T&amp;E/S&amp;T Program performs the following activities:
• Exploits new technologies and processes to meet important test and evaluation (T&amp;E) requirements.
• Expedites the transition of new technologies from the laboratory environment to the T&amp;E community.
• Leverages industry advances in equipment, modeling and simulation, and networking to support T&amp;E.
Additionally, the T&amp;E/S&amp;T Program examines emerging T&amp;E requirements resulting from Joint Service initiatives to identify T&amp;E technology needs and to develop a long-range roadmap for technology insertion.  The program leverages and employs applicable applied research efforts from the highly developed technology base in DoD laboratories and test centers, other government agencies, industry, and academia to accelerate development of new test capabilities.  This program provides travel funds for T&amp;E/S&amp;T program oversight, special studies, analyses, and strategic planning related to test capabilities and infrastructure.
  The DoD established seven strategic science and technology (S&amp;T) investment priorities: 1) Data to Decisions, 2) Engineered Resilient Systems, 3) Cyber Science and Technology, 4) Electronic Warfare/ Electronic Protection, 5) Counter Weapons of Mass Destruction, 6) Autonomy, and 7) Human Systems.  The T&amp;E/S&amp;T Program has been aligned and prioritized to prepare the T&amp;E community to test warfighting capabilities that emerge from these S&amp;T priority investments.
  The T&amp;E/S&amp;T Program is funded within the Advanced Technology Development Budget Activity because it develops and demonstrates high payoff technologies for current and future DoD test capabilities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>High-speed/hypersonic weapons are being developed to ensure the continued military superiority and strike capability of the United States including freedom of movement and freedom of action in areas protected by anti-access/area denial defenses.  Current weapon system demonstrations and technology development programs include high-speed and hypersonic air-breathing missiles, maneuvering reentry and boost-glide weapons, hypersonic gun-launched projectiles, and air-breathing space access vehicles.  These systems require development of conventional and high-speed turbine, ramjet, scramjet, and combined cycle engines; high temperature materials; thermal protection systems (TPS); and thermal management systems.  
  The High Speed Systems Test (HSST) project addresses test technology needs including propulsion, aerodynamic and aerothermal testing, so the test community has the technology to support the required test scenarios for concepts under development in the science and technology (S&amp;T) community.  The technology developments within the HSST project align with the Department of Defense (DoD) S&amp;T priority investments.  As such, the HSST project is developing, validating and transitioning advanced test and evaluation (T&amp;E) technologies for ground test, open-air range flight test, and advanced computational tools, along with instrumentation and diagnostics systems for use in both ground tests and flight tests of high speed systems.
  The HSST project develops technologies to enable robust, accurate, and timely T&amp;E of these future weapon systems.  DoD acquisition regulations require weapon systems to undergo a thorough T&amp;E process to detect deficiencies early and to ensure system suitability and survivability.  However, the extreme environments in which these weapons operate preclude accurate determination of their performance and operability with today’s T&amp;E assets.  Current national test capabilities have deficiencies in data accuracy, flight condition replication and simulation, test methods, productivity, modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) fidelity, and range safety.
  The HSST mission is to address these national test capability gaps by providing test technology solutions that will enable high-speed and hypersonic weapon systems to be successfully developed through accurate, robust, and efficient T&amp;E.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                                <r2:Text>The HSST project continued to advance ground and flight test technologies, techniques, instrumentation and M&amp;S capabilities required for the development of high speed air-breathing propulsion and boost/glide weapons.
  Important progress was made toward addressing the two most significant technology shortfalls in current hypersonic aero propulsion ground test capabilities: clean air heat addition (i.e. non-vitiated air) and variable Mach number capability.  Current production ground test facilities could only create the high temperature inlet conditions necessary for scramjet engine tests by burning fuel in the airflow prior to entering the engine.  As demonstrated by HSST FY 2011 tests, the resulting “vitiated air” had different gas properties than clean air and was not representative of what the vehicle would experience during flight.  This significantly affected the engine’s performance and operability in the test environment resulting in erroneous flight performance predictions.  Variable Mach number capability is required to “fly the mission” and determine the critical transient operability effects throughout the flight envelope.  Incorporation of component technologies, previously developed by the T&amp;E/S&amp;T program, were initiated into a small-scale, clean air, true temperature, variable Mach number 5-8 aero propulsion test facility.  Completion of this facility will demonstrate component technologies have reached Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6, provide an on-going test asset to the DoD, and reduce risk for construction of a full-scale facility.  Significant progress was made this year in Phase I of the facility development including the completed installation of the clean air regenerative storage heater, associated support systems, instrumentation and controls required for facility operation.  Design efforts for subsequent phases progressed including the critical design of the air delivery system and preliminary design of a variable Mach number nozzle.  Another FY2013 effort examined the incorporation of advanced morphing ceramic materials into the design of common facility nozzle and ducting hardware to achieve a variable Mach number capability and variable inlet distortion patterns representative of flight-like inlet systems.  This capability reached critical design and promises to provide a significant advantage over current rigid, stationary facility hardware by providing a “first-ever” realistic variable Mach flight distortion simulation test capability, while reducing test cost and increasing productivity.
  Ground test accomplishments included continued progress in determining the capability of existing ground test facilities and methodologies to evaluate and develop large-scale hypersonic propulsion systems.  Following the successful completion of the benchmark freejet test series utilizing an advanced hydrocarbon fueled missile scale scramjet in a larger facility, the semi-freejet and direct-connect test configurations were initiated in a smaller facility. The resulting analysis comparing tests between the larger and smaller facilities will allow the optimized utilization of existing facilities.  In addition this effort will help define the size and type of investments needed for future large-scale scramjet vehicle development and reduction of flight test and acquisition risks.  The hypersonic community’s first rigorous assessment of data uncertainty was completed on the freejet test series per the US National Standard on measurement uncertainty, which will serve as a precedent for future high-speed propulsion system development. Another task was initiated to examine the unique and extensive set of ground and flight test data collected by the X-51 program so that it can be utilized in the development of state-of-the-art techniques for high speed engine design, development and testing. The HSST project initiated an effort to address critical arc heater technologies and flow quality gaps; this development will improve the service lives of the electrodes and improve nozzle flow quality.  Improved computational and numerical simulation models were completed involving magnetic field and arc column interactions with the air flow in the heater necessary to investigate advanced designs and allow for time/memory efficient parallel computing of the simulations.
  The autonomous flight safety technology was matured to TRL 6 and prototype units were designed and delivered for service certification onboard two Operationally Responsive Space Office flight tests.  Another flight test technology effort completed the successful development and programing of advanced parameter identification maneuvers into the flight computer of the fourth X-51 flight.  Subsequent analysis of these optimized test maneuvers demonstrated the ability to collect substantially more stability and control data per flight than is possible using traditional methods, thus reducing the number of flight tests and costs for future development systems.
  Progress was also made in advanced high speed system ground and flight test instrumentation.  The initial phase was completed on a ground based, portable Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) system to measure atmospheric conditions (density, temperature, pressure, wind speed/direction, O2 content) along a hypersonic vehicle’s flight path from altitudes of 60k to 250k feet.  This initial phase demonstrated the ability to measure these conditions using the LIDAR system at the GroundWinds facility in Mauna Loa, Hawaii at altitudes representative of hypersonic vehicle flight trajectories. This capability will be a significant advancement over current technologies, improving the accuracy of determining atmospheric conditions at high altitudes needed for assessing the performance and operability of air-breathing missiles and boost-glide vehicles during development.  A project was initiated to develop a force balance system with high stiffness and frequency response to make measurements in hypervelocity flows with test times of 1-2 milliseconds.  This will substantially increase the accuracy of high Mach force measurements that are required to evaluate and improve models of air chemistry in design and prediction codes. An advanced system to measure gas properties in high speed flows was constructed utilizing lasers operating in the mid-infrared spectrum.  This system, which significantly lowers gas property measurement uncertainty, was transitioned to a DoD ground test center and a DoD research laboratory.  A miniaturized, temperature-compensated wind tunnel balance for supersonic store separation testing was constructed and transitioned.  Design, fabrication and demonstration of a non-intrusive laser hygrometer and a non-intrusive optical mass flow measurement system were completed.  Testing of a fiber optic heat flux gauge and a high temperature shear stress sensor were also successfully completed.
  Advances were achieved in the development of a state-of-the-art validated computational M&amp;S tools.  An advanced three-dimensional boundary layer transition code and hypersonic nozzle Characteristics Based Grid Generation code have been developed and transitioned to the hypersonic community for beta testing.  Recent wind tunnel and flight tests have provided data demonstrating that a fully three-dimensional flow boundary layer stability and transition prediction code is an essential engineering tool needed to evaluate and predict boundary layer instability and transition on maneuverable boost-glide vehicles currently under development by the DoD. Computed tomography methods for optical absorption measurements were completed; these create two-dimensional spatial maps of exhaust gas properties from multi-line-of-sight Tunable Diode Laser Absorption Spectroscopy (TDLAS) measurements for verifying computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code predictions and for determining combustion efficiency for turbine and scramjet engines.  This capability will greatly increase the diagnostic value of measurements from miniature, robust TDLAS gas diagnostic sensor systems now routinely used for engine ground and flight testing</r2:Text>

  The clean-air, variable Mach number demonstration facility will continue to develop and demonstrate air delivery system technologies to provide uniform flow with variable pressure and temperature from multiple air sources through a fixed nozzle up to Mach 8 conditions. The project activities will include completion of the Phase 1 system checkouts and activation of the clean air regenerative storage heater technology.
  Scramjet ground tests in semi-free jet, and direct connect test modes will be concluded and compared to free-jet test results to quantify their respective accuracies and identify optimal test methods for larger, next generation scramjet engines.  Vitiation effects data will be collected to increase the high speed systems community’s knowledge base.   
  Ceramic morphing components suitable for missile-scale high speed ground test facilities will be designed and fabricated to maintain well-conditioned flow while varying the flight Mach number and inlet distortion levels.
  Improved arc jet facility spin coil designs will be advanced enabling improved T&amp;E of maneuvering reentry and boost/glide vehicles. 
  The ground based LIDAR atmospheric sensing system will begin conversion into a mobile platform to support various flight test programs at multiple flight ranges. 
  Verification and improvement of CFD codes will continue, making use of the unique data sets obtained from the HSST scramjet engines tests described above.  A boundary layer transition prediction tool for 2-dimensional and axisymmetric bodies will be enhanced allowing for application to complex, 3-dimensional boost-glide vehicle geometries.</r2:Text>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Weapon systems have become increasingly complex in recent years, resulting in the need for significantly more data to be passed among these systems, and between the systems and our test infrastructure.  A vast amount of data must be collected, transmitted, and analyzed, which requires a large amount of radio frequency (RF) spectrum resources.  However, the amount of RF spectrum designated to support test and evaluation (T&amp;E) is decreasing, most notably due to reallocation of spectrum for commercial use.  The combination of decreasing RF spectrum and increasing data requirements results in an urgent need to create test technologies that maximize the use of spectrum resources for Department of Defense (DoD) T&amp;E operations.
  The L and S frequency bands are the traditional spectrum allotted for military use.  The explosive need for spectrum in the commercial sector has resulted in reallocation of portions of these bands to industry.  To compensate, DoD is now authorized to use the C-Band spectrum which offers numerous benefits, including a three-fold increase in available bandwidth, but C-Band comes with technical challenges.  Most notably, our current test infrastructure for telemetry is not designed to accommodate C-Band.  Technologies are required to implement innovative techniques that efficiently facilitate our use of C-Band without a major overhaul to our national test infrastructure.  For instance, commercial telemetry transmitters operate in C-Band but do not have the form factor (size and weight) or rugged packaging to survive airborne test applications.
  Traditional telemetry applications employ streaming telemetry where data is moved one-way from the instrumented system under test to our test infrastructure.  Modern network based telemetry capabilities, like those being developed by the Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program (CTEIP) integrated Network Enhanced Telemetry (iNET) effort, enable more robust, efficient bidirectional transfer of data.  DoD’s strategy is to create technologies for streaming telemetry capability in C-Band while opening up legacy L- and S-Bands for networked telemetry.
  The Spectrum Efficient Technology (SET) project is developing test technologies that enable more efficient use of legacy telemetry bands and expansion into non-traditional areas of the RF and optical spectra at DoD test ranges.  The technology development efforts within the SET project have been prioritized to align with Department of Defense guidance on science and technology priority investments. As such, the SET project is focusing on growing data requirements of warfighting systems and the limited availability of spectrum for testing.  The SET project is structured to develop test technologies to advance range communications, networked telemetry capabilities, and enhanced management of spectrum at DoD test ranges.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Technology enabling the dynamic reconfiguration of transmitted test data over a telemetry network was further matured.  Technology to improve the efficiency of a telemetry network utilizing the advanced Shaped Offset Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (SOQPSK) modulation scheme continued.  Development of a multi-band transceiver operating in the L/S/C-Band spectrum employing multiple advanced waveforms continued.  
  The SET project investigated techniques to expand telemetry operations into non-traditional spectrum bands by characterizing multipath effects in multiple range environments, specifically regarding missile test missions.  Additionally, the SET project continued efforts to develop the required hardware components (antenna, transmitter) required to conduct a missile test mission.  Testing of this hardware began to characterize the telemetry link performance of the C-Band spectrum versus the legacy S-Band spectrum. SET continued efforts to develop airborne phased array antenna technology to enable flexible scheduling of the T&amp;E spectrum by incorporating both the traditional L/S bands and recently permitted C-Band frequencies.  Some of these technologies will reduce the technical risk associated with beam steering in the C-Band frequencies, reduce the amount of infrastructure modifications needed to implement a C-Band telemetry capability, and provide over-the-horizon data connectivity to test large-footprint weapons, such as long range missiles.
  The SET project completed the development of a three dimensional channel model tool for modeling and simulation of telemetry channels in various environments.  This tool provides higher fidelity simulations for use in researching the effects of terrain, environmental, and various other factors on telemetry channels.  This tool was transitioned to the Edwards Air Force Flight Test Center to support pretest analysis of mission flight profiles.  The SET project completed the development of a scheme to improve the efficiency of a networked telemetry system.  This software scheme was transitioned to the CTEIP iNET program for incorporation into the iNET network link manager to address end-to-end system quality of service requirements.  The SET project completed the development of an advanced RF spectrum management system to more efficiently manage spectrum resources at test ranges.  This management system was tested at and transitioned to Naval Air Warfare Center – Aircraft Division, Patuxent River to aid in test planning and the assignment of RF spectrum resources.   
  The SET project initiated an effort to develop a non-blocking Ethernet switch capable of operation on an airborne platform.  This technology will serve as the network backbone which will tie all onboard instrumentation together with the onboard transmitter.  SET initiated an effort to autonomously analyze collected telemetry data and based on priority, select which data to transmit over the telemetry network.  Additionally, SET initiated several efforts to improve the performance of telemetry data links.  SET initiated an effort to improve the performance of a serial streaming telemetry link in a multipath environment by developing a sync marker for the telemetry data.  This technology will enable analysis of the data in the event of a data dropout and permit filling in of holes in transmitted data.  SET initiated an effort to develop a telemetry transceiver capable of dynamically reconfiguring the data modulation scheme based on telemetry link conditions.</r2:Text>

Technology to improve efficiency of a telemetry network utilizing the SOQPSK modulation scheme will be matured. Development of a non-blocking Ethernet switch for airborne platforms will be completed, demonstrated, and transitioned to support the deployment of a networked telemetry system.
  Phased array antenna technology utilizing both the traditional and C-Band frequencies will continue to be matured to enable flexible spectrum scheduling and alleviate technical risk associated with tracking and beam steering in the C-Band.  The SET project will initiate efforts to develop an airborne multiband transceiver to support networked telemetry, increase spectrum scheduling efficiency, improve efficiency in ground telemetry and antenna systems, and support data transmission in both traditional L/S and C-bands. 
  The effort investigating the telemetry link performance of the C-Band versus S-Band spectrum for a missile test mission will be completed and the results transitioned to the test ranges.  The resulting telemetry antenna technology will be transitioned to Naval Air Warfare Center – Weapons Division, China Lake, but is designed to be extensible, enabling its widespread use across the Major Range and Test Facility Base.  
  SET will initiate efforts to develop phased array technology for use on the ground as well as in airborne applications.  The high directionality of phased array antenna technologies on aircraft will enable the ability to leverage spectrum spatial reuse techniques for more effective spectrum scheduling.  Additionally, SET will initiate efforts to develop schemes to manage and provide access to telemetry links that are comprised of both contiguous and non-contiguous blocks of spectrum in the upper C-band.  This portion of spectrum allocated for T&amp;E is highly non-contiguous due to sharing with satellite and television uplinks in the spectrum band.</r2:Text>

Our ability to counter such threats is essential to owning the airspace in theater.  Therefore, the ability to test missile warning systems (MWS), hostile fire indicators, IR countermeasures (IRCM), and advanced threat sensors is critical to our national defense.  Additionally, a new generation of enemy radio frequency (RF) missile seekers is both currently fielded and in further development, requiring a correspondingly new generation of test technologies to test the latest countermeasures.  The test and evaluation (T&amp;E) community is required to test IRCM and RF countermeasure systems in a repeatable manner with ground-truth data before and after integration into warfighting systems.  Without new test technologies, the Department of Defense (DoD) will be unable to perform adequate T&amp;E of advanced warning and countermeasure systems.
  The technology development efforts within the EWT project have been prioritized to align with DoD guidance on science and technology priority investments.  As such, the EWT project is focusing on the test needs in both the electro-optic (EO), including IR, and the RF threat domains.  Additionally, development of core test technologies in this area can be leveraged to meet other EO and RF test requirements, such as in fire control systems, reconnaissance sensors, and missile seeker subsystems.
  The EWT project develops test technologies to stimulate IRCM and RF system sensors through the high-fidelity simulation of scenes viewed by the sensors.  Stimulation can be as simple as testing to see if a system under test responds to an image or as complex as simulating complex battle space phenomena to measure the response of a system under test in a more relevant, cluttered scenario.  Simulations and stimulations are used at open air ranges and in installed system test facilities (ISTF), and in hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) test beds.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This technology provides two-color, high-temperature scenes with a frame rate fast enough to test new IRCM and MWS and is critical to improving DoD test capabilities for directional IR countermeasure (DIRCM) systems.  EWT continued to develop a high temperature scene projector using resistive elements, including a method for tiling smaller arrays into a large array up to 2K x 2K pixels.
  The EWT Project completed development of a fiber optics technology for transmitting a scene to a gimbaled projector.  EWT also completed testing of a laser radar scene projection technology.  These provide the technology to transfer high power laser countermeasure emissions to instrumentation and target boards.
  The EWT project continued development of a hyperspectral imaging projector, which will allow characterization and testing of hyperspectral imaging cameras used for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance.
  The EWT project continued an effort to develop a breadboard technology to produce high-fidelity electronic counter-countermeasures (ECCM) radar signal processing techniques that employ sophisticated waveforms with algorithms, such as adaptive filtering.  This test technology development addresses a need, which is identified by the Navy-led, CTEIP-sponsored Tri-Service Electronic Warfare Test Capabilities Study.  The technology will improve testing against modern surface-to-air missile threats. Moreover, EWT continued efforts to develop a surrogate missile technology for testing of missile warning sensors.

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Advanced Instrumentation Systems Technology (AIST) project addresses the test technology gaps resulting from emerging weapon systems that need to be tested at Department of Defense (DoD) open air ranges, undersea ranges, installed systems test facilities, hardware-in-the-loop laboratories, and measurement test facilities.  Instrumentation requirements for systems under test are increasing exponentially for new weapons systems.  Vehicle on-board and warfighter wearable instrumentation packages are required.  This instrumentation is for sensing and collecting critical performance data; determining accurate time, space, position information (TSPI)and attitude information; interfacing with command and control data links; monitoring and reporting system-wide communications; recording human operator performance; and storing and transmitting data.
  The technology development efforts within the AIST project have been prioritized to align with DoD guidance on science and technology (S&amp;T) priority investments, particularly in support of human systems, engineered resilient systems, and counter weapons of mass destruction.  The AIST project is focused on supporting technology developments for advanced TSPI instrumentation (especially with limited or no use of the Global Positioning System (GPS)), advanced sensors, advanced energy and power systems for instrumentation, non-intrusive instrumentation, mitigating range encroachment issues, and measuring warfighter cognitive performance.  
  The AIST project addresses requirements for miniaturized, non-intrusive instrumentation suites with increased survivability in harsh environments.  Such instrumentation is an urgent need because minimal space is available to add instrumentation to new or existing weapon systems subsequent to their development; furthermore, additional weight and power draw for instrumentation can adversely affect weapon system signature and performance.  Instrumentation for humans-in-the-loop, such as dismounted soldiers, must not adversely affect soldier performance, induce artificiality in the test environment, nor create operational burden.  New technologies can be exploited to integrate small, non-intrusive instrumentation into emerging platforms during design and development, and, in some cases, into existing platforms.  This class of instrumentation will provide critical system performance data during test and continuous assessment throughout a system’s lifecycle.  Technology developed under AIST can also benefit training and combat missions by enabling a continual feedback loop between the developer, training staff, operators and commanders.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Consequently, a continued major thrust for FY 2013 included the development of test technologies to support collection of TSPI for warfighter systems (manned or unmanned), particularly in GPS-denied or degraded environments, such as in urban canyons and tunnels.  Efforts to test systems that operate in a GPS-denied environment included technology that employs a layered system of sensors leveraging collaborative navigation, existing radio frequency (RF) ranging technology, and a Doppler velocimeter to achieve more precise TSPI under GPS-impaired conditions.  Preliminary testing in a realistic environment was successfully conducted in both open-air and RF-challenged environments achieving sub-meter tracking accuracies.  An inertial tracking system for dismounted warfighters continued in development; the system employs boot-mounted sensors to provide sub-meter geolocation over GPS-denied durations of greater than 2 hours.  System integration and performance testing were conducted; design improvements are ongoing.
  To support testing of high-speed, high-acceleration systems, an ultra-high dynamics GPS receiver was developed.  The receiver performs significantly better than existing test instrumentation.  The AIST project gathered requirements for future test and evaluation GPS dependent TSPI activities, conducted analyses and mapped a way forward with respect to the development of application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) design architectures for next generation solutions.
  In support of other instrumentation solutions, an electro-releasable attachment technology development effort continued.  This included investigation of new adhesive formulations that employ an electrically releasing foil patch to allow attachment of sensors to non-conductive, painted exterior surfaces of aircraft and other combat vehicles.  The goal is to provide immediate attachment for a test and significantly reduce the time to restore the system under test to its operational configuration.  
  To support Electromagnetic Rail Gun (EMRG) developments, AIST continued development of a fiber-optic instrumentation suite to integrate into test projectiles to measure magnetic field strength in the harsh environment of an EMRG test firing.  Powered air gun testing was successfully conducted at 50,000G levels at the Army Research Lab’s Adelphi site.  Preparations are underway to support full-up testing of an EMRG shot at the Naval Surface Warfare Center-Dahlgren Division.  
  The AIST project developed algorithms and methods for automated detection and classification of marine mammal vocalizations from ocean floor range sensors (e.g., hydrophones) to improve testing at DoD undersea range complexes.  Testing has been successfully conducted at undersea ranges and a baseline classifier for 6 marine mammal species is currently running real-time, range-wide at the Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center, Pacific Range Missile Facility, and the Southern California Offshore Range.  This test technology allows the Navy to conduct critical test and evaluation (T&amp;E) events without adversely impacting marine mammal populations, and to support the Navy’s Integrated Comprehensive Monitoring Program (ICMP) ensuring adherence to the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA).
  Several efforts were initiated to develop technologies to:  (1) measure position and attitude (six degrees of freedom) of high-velocity, spinning projectiles at accuracies that significantly exceed the system under test guidance system; (2) measure soldier/soldier system indoor location (GPS-denied environment) at sub-meter accuracies using ambient AM radio broadcast signals; (3) provide seamless transition between outdoor and indoor environments to accurately track systems under test using modified GPS receivers, relayed GPS signals, and multi-lateration and multipath mitigation techniques; (4) use passive imaging to characterize munitions/warhead fragment size, velocity, and distribution, and significantly reduce set-up times and data analysis costs of current warhead arena test techniques; (5) accurately provide dynamic measurements and display the warfighter body posture, head and weapon orientation using fiber optic shape sensing of fibers integrated into uniforms and equipment; and (6) assess warfighter cognitive states using algorithms and measurements of brain electrical activity and brain blood oxygen levels. 
  An effort was initiated to investigate mitigation of the impacts of wind energy system interference on test range radars.  
  Efforts continued to assess and leverage microsystems technology under development at universities, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), and government laboratories.  These efforts will provide significant advances to T&amp;E of modern war fighting systems.</r2:Text>

These systems involve operations in extreme conditions, over long distances, for long durations, and often with very small physical footprints (i.e. microsystems).  Furnishing adequate energy and power to instrument such systems for testing is a significant technological challenge.
  Major thrusts for FY 2014 include continuing ongoing efforts in advanced sensors, TSPI instrumentation, warfighter cognition assessment under various workloads, and test range encroachment mitigation.  Additionally, AIST will continue to pursue test technologies for non-intrusive, advanced data acquisition and transformation that operate on reduced power along with the development of advanced power sources for test instrumentation.  The AIST project will complete its assessment of emerging microsystems technology and develop a roadmap for potentially leveraging microsystems technologies in instrumentation at DoD ranges.
  The AIST project will complete: the development and testing of classifiers to identify specific sea mammals (e.g., various dolphins and whales species) found at undersea ranges; the development and testing of magnetic field sensors for the harsh environment of electromagnetic rail gun test firings; an attachment technology that does not require any solvents to restore test articles to operational condition; and several efforts for collecting TSPI on dismounted warfighters and related systems in GPS-denied or degraded environments such as those found in urban and subterranean operations.</r2:Text>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Department of Defense (DoD) is exploring the military utility, safety, and suitability of directed energy weapons.  A robust test capability to assess directed energy weapons is essential to understanding their effectiveness and limitations, including determining their effectiveness in performing counter improvised explosive device (C-IED) operations.  Such assessments will depend upon knowledge acquired through the test and evaluation (T&amp;E) of directed energy technologies and testing of operational concepts.  Directed energy weapon technologies, primarily consisting of high energy lasers (HEL) and high powered microwaves (HPM), are outpacing available test capabilities.  Traditional test techniques for evaluating conventional munitions (with flight times ranging from seconds to minutes) are not sufficient for the T&amp;E of directed energy weapons that place energy on target instantaneously.  Consequently, new test technology solutions are needed to ensure that adequate developmental, live-fire, and operational test capabilities are available when directed energy programs are ready to test.
  Directed energy system and component testing requires three principal assessments:  (1) energy or power on target; (2) the effects on the target; and (3) the propagation of the directed energy to the target through the atmosphere.  In addition, the vulnerabilities of DoD systems to directed energy threats are required to be characterized in accordance with Military Standard (MIL-STD)-464C.  Equally as important, current test capabilities do not provide the detailed data required to understand U.S. directed energy system performance and effects.
  The technology development efforts within the Directed Energy Test (DET) project have been prioritized to align with DoD guidance on science and technology priority investments.  As such, the DET project is developing the technologies necessary for quantitative assessment of United States HEL and HPM performance, as well as the vulnerability of DoD weapon systems to enemy directed energy threats.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

  Fabrication continued on a prototype adaptive optics system designed to be readily adaptable to telescopes at various test facilities.  The test technology will allow improved imaging of an HEL spot on a remote target.  Regarding HEL atmospheric propagation, a multi-light detection and ranging system to measure important atmospheric profiles along a slant path adjacent to the HEL beam propagation path continued.  This technology simultaneously measured profiles for three parameters: optical turbulence, water vapor content, and aerosol attenuation.  Measuring these profiles will enable understanding of how atmospheric effects distort HEL beam propagation.  A maritime version of this technology was initiated.
   Testing of electric field sensors continued in support of electromagnetic rail gun T&amp;E and identified a prime source for indicating rail wear, a key issue for rail gun systems.  To better support HPM C-IED testing, DET completed a test technology development to measure soil electrical properties using a brass board sensor with three interchangeable heads to cover the required frequencies.  
  A demonstration of HEL sensor technologies on an unmanned aerial vehicle was completed; the demonstration verified the ability of the sensors to measure HEL energy on target while the HEL illuminated the aircraft to disable its intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance systems.</r2:Text>

Efforts will continue to address identified test technology shortfalls, including HEL test safety and HEL collateral effects.  This includes efforts to improve the understanding of HEL reflection hazards so that testing of HEL systems can be accomplished safely without risk to observers and sensors.  Furthermore, efforts to characterize beam propagation through the atmosphere will continue in the maritime environment to support emerging needs of the Navy. 
  Initiatives to achieve very small, non-intrusive current and voltage sensors to measure HPM effects inside a target will be completed.  These technologies will be transitioned to at least two locations to demonstrate the flexibility of these approaches.  A small, minimally intrusive data acquisition device with a wide bandwidth to match that of the non-intrusive electric and magnetic field sensors will be continued.
  A HPM test risk reduction effort will be continued to determine the best approach to construct a more durable pressurized, radio frequency transmitting dome that does not leak over time for a test capability that emulates wideband HPM threats.  An effort to develop an HPM source for use in a chamber to address survivability of munitions in an HPM environment will be continued.
  A new study investigating technologically-viable, more cost effective alternatives to provide the neutron radiation required for nuclear survivability testing will be continued.</r2:Text>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Net-Centric Systems Test (NST) project is pursuing test technologies to emulate multi-Service, Joint, and coalition net-centric operations in a system of systems test and evaluation (T&amp;E) environment.  Additionally, the NST project develops technologies to analyze and evaluate the increasingly massive amounts of structured and unstructured data generated by complex net-centric tests.  The technology to conduct T&amp;E on net-centric systems is challenged by sensor platforms, command and control systems and weapon platforms that support the kill chain in a Joint operation.  These systems must be evaluated for their ability to provide an accurate, timely transfer of data (e.g., target tracks, weapons allocation, mission tasking and situational awareness), as the data passes among different systems of Service and coalition participants.  The NST technologies advance test automation (test planning, test execution, test control, and analysis) that enable the virtual integration of Department of Defense (DoD) weapon laboratories and open air ranges.  Using models and simulations along with hardware-in-the-loop laboratories, the effectiveness of Joint missions can be assessed in terms of system-of-systems interoperability and effectiveness in executing Joint mission operations, including testing of weapons and Command and Control systems accessing and providing information to the Global Information Grid.  The technology development efforts within the NST project have been prioritized to align with DoD guidance on science and technology priority investments, particularly in measuring “Data to Decision” techniques and warfighting capabilities.  Ultimately, the NST portfolio enables the T&amp;E community to “test like we fight” by replicating net-enabled, Joint mission operations within a T&amp;E environment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Technology development to automate the processes that analyze and evaluate multiple SoS in a joint cross-Service mission context were also initiated. Other efforts included technology development for planning a complex, multi-system, mission-level net-centric test in a distributed live-virtual-constructive (LVC) environment and controlling test execution through management of the mission scenario.  The NST project developed test planning technologies to address test integration and interoperability issues.  Machine reasoning capabilities were extended and integrated to automate test planning tasks.  The NST project continued development of a planning and visualization technology to support joint mission thread testing to better correlate test data to the effectiveness of mission operations.
  The NST project advanced technologies to support the execution of distributed tests with active network control, enhanced the dynamic management of the test infrastructure, and improved the integration of Service laboratories and test ranges.  These technologies were transitioned and integrated into the Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program (CTEIP) Test and Training Enabling Architecture (TENA) that was used by the Joint Mission Environment Test Capability (JMETC) Program and at test facilities and training ranges.  
  The NST project developed predictive smart dead-reckoning technology to address the challenge to adequately synchronize the distributed test environment.  This effort provided the necessary distributed intelligence to manage time space position information (TSPI) updates in the net-centric test battlespace with a distributed LVC architecture.  The NST project built upon previously developed NST technologies to solve the test challenges of producing accurate TSPI predictions under all network conditions, to include both unpredictable network latency and missing information.  Since the predictive smart dead-reckoning technology is built on top of the policy-enabled agent, it will be able to provide fast response under complex test event conditions.  The CTEIP Joint Distributed Infrared Countermeasures Ground-Testing System (JDIGS) project tested and validated this NST project to further improve the error performance for JDIGS testing over the JMETC network.  
  The NST project also developed technologies for the next generation of TENA middleware that supported a broad range of networks, including wireless networks, and provided native support for handheld and embedded computing platforms.  Global Positioning System and accelerometer test data were successfully transmitted over commercial cellular carriers using an encrypted virtual private network.  The NST project transitioned technology to the Edwards Air Force Base Instrumentation Group by successfully demonstrating TENA connectivity through wireless networks providing a live or file replay of flight line instrumentation data on wireless tablet devices with real-time synchronization.</r2:Text>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Unmanned and Autonomous Systems (UAS) support every domain of warfare.  They operate in space, in air, on land, on the sea surface, undersea and in subterranean conditions to support a vast variety of missions.  The emergence of unmanned systems brings a host of revolutionary capabilities that will profoundly influence warfare.  The Unmanned and Autonomous Systems Test (UAST) project addresses current and emerging challenges associated with the test and evaluation (T&amp;E) of these critical warfighting capabilities.  The technology development efforts within the UAST project have been prioritized to align with Department of Defense (DoD) guidance on science and technology priority investments, particularly in assessing autonomy.  As such, the UAST project is developing test technologies to simulate, stimulate, instrument, measure, and assess autonomous systems’ ability to perceive its environment, process information, adapt to dynamic conditions, make decisions, and effectively act on those decisions in the context of mission execution.
  The UAST project will provide the test technologies to effectively measure performance and characterize risk, thereby increasing warfighter trust in autonomous systems.  Current DoD test capabilities and methodologies are insufficient to address the testing of increasingly autonomous units and teams of unmanned systems operating in unstructured, dynamic, battlespace environments.  Furthermore, advancements are being made in developing collaborating system-of-autonomous-systems, working in concert as a swarm or pack and in close proximity with humans.  New test technologies are needed to stress the collective set of autonomous systems under realistic conditions, predict emergent behavior of autonomous systems, emulate the complex environment, and assess mission performance of these highly coupled and intelligent systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                                <r2:Text>The UAST project focused on predicting and assessing the autonomy functions of unmanned and autonomous systems through the initiation of new technology developments.  The complexity of operational unmanned and autonomous systems, with all possible interactions occurring between sensing, perception, reasoning, mapping, decision making and action, resulted in an almost infinite set of potential interactions and correspondingly, an almost infinite set of test conditions.  An effort was initiated to employ evolutionary/genetic algorithms in a software-in-the-loop environment to accurately predict the fault conditions of a complex, long-duration autonomous system.  Initially supporting testing of the Large Displacement – Unmanned Underwater Vehicle, this test technology was extended to improve the ability to predict fault conditions and focus test strategies for other types of unmanned vehicles. The UAST project effort initiated work to enhance safety of autonomous system testing to prevent unsafe UAS operations/actions. Additionally, work began to develop methods to measure autonomous system reliability and performance by providing complex and interactive live, virtual, constructive (LVC) test environments to stimulate UASs so their response and performance can be observed, recorded, and compared to pre-test simulations.
  In the area of autonomous system performance assessment, test technology development continued to enable automated autonomy architecture stress testing, with a focus on UAS software and the interfaces of the core components without requiring source code.  The approach was agnostic to the specific component interface.  This technology provided the tester with a perspective of system performance and a previously unavailable prediction of behavior.  Recent stress-testing of a representative ground-based UAS system identified vulnerability issues at the command interface layer of the system.  Additionally, in the area of autonomous system performance assessment, a virtual UAS proving ground was designed that used environmental data from external sources (to include imagery from operational areas of interest) and injected that data into simulations of a given UAS to predict the behavior of the system in the operational environment.  An initial demonstration of this test technology facilitated efficient testing in operationally representative environments at Savannah River Test Site and Aberdeen Test Center and allowed for safe operations at “edge of the envelope” performance parameters.</r2:Text>

The UAST project will further explore test technologies to meet the challenges of testing autonomy by leveraging advances made in the standardization of UAS architectures, functional components, and interfaces.
  The test technology to adapt evolutionary algorithms to predict fault conditions will be expanded to address evaluation functions for multiple missions of a long duration UAS.  The UAST project will deliver a roadmap of potential test technology needs for testing autonomous systems at DoD ranges. The effort investigating the stress testing of autonomy architectures will be completed and the results transitioned to the test ranges.  The resulting autonomy architecture stressing technology will be transitioned initially to Army Test and Evaluation Command, Aberdeen Test Center, but is designed to be extensible, enabling widespread use across the Major Range and Test Facility Base.  Additionally, a virtual prototyping technology will be transitioned to test ranges to characterize UAS performance, reducing cost and time associated with open air range testing.</r2:Text>

Additionally, the UAST project will focus on enhancing the test environment to assess unmanned threat systems.  The UAST project will develop instrumentation and analysis technologies to enable UAS testing that furnishes data to support the evaluation of overall mission performance in a Joint context.  The UAST project will initiate efforts to enable dynamic construction, control, measurement of complex systems-of-autonomous-systems and tactically meaningful counter-unmanned systems analysis.  Test requirements will expand to integrate multi-UAS test beds that support a simulation-based methodology to seamlessly integrate constructive simulation, UAS-in-the loop simulation, and live UAS tests.  The UAST project will deliver complementary tools to predict UAS behavior by monitoring how autonomous systems process data in response to environmental changes.  Simulated systems will replicate multiple platforms for the evaluation of multi-platform behaviors and detailed system/event logging.  Modeling and simulation techniques will be expanded to provide high fidelity representations of appropriate environmental complexity in order to stress the UAS and establish confidence in the safety and capabilities of future systems.</r2:Text>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The basic mission of this program element is to fund innovation that will improve the Department’s operational effectiveness via targeted operational energy science and technology investments. It contains two projects.

P455, the Operational Energy Capability Improvement Fund (OECIF), incentivizes science and technology to promote long term change in the Department's capabilities to be better aligned with the Operational Energy Strategy. It generally fosters innovation to improve operational energy performance. This mission has two key aspects.  First, to develop and/or demonstrate, and rapidly transition into, use operational energy technologies or practices that will improve the Department’s military capabilities and/or reduce its costs. Second, to establish within the military Services sustainable, institutional capacity to continue to research, develop and adopt operational energy innovations. OECIF funds serve as “seed money” to consolidate or start promising operational energy programs, directions or changes to be sustained by the Services; accordingly, OECIF generally emphasizes supporting or establishing programs, rather than one-off projects.

P456, the Hybrid Energy Storage Module, co-sponsored by ASD(R&amp;E) and ASD(OEPP), develops advanced technology in energy storage to maximize performance and reliability, and enable future high power weapons and sensor systems on legacy and next generation vehicles, aircraft and ships. The goals of this program are to (1) demonstrate energy storage systems with high power and energy densities, scalable to all power levels, that reduce total logistics demand, increase platform ability to sustain operations during engagement, and (2) reduce maintenance. Once demonstration is complete, this technology will be sustained by the Services. This program is closely coordinated with the Advanced Management and Protection of Energy-storage Devices (AMPED) program of the Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency – Energy (ARPA-E). AMPED technology will be used to potentially extend the operational performance benefits and safety for these applications beyond the hybrid storage module baseline design configurations.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The Army/ Navy cooling technology program awarded contracts for pursuing mid and long-term ECU technologies, and evaluated commercial cooling units and components for comparison. The Navy/ARPA-E cooling technology program completed feasibility studies of two competing prototypes to efficiently remove humidity from the air before cooling.  It also began three other projects based on innovative cooling technologies. The Army/Air Force soft shelters/tent program completed design of selected shelter configurations; conducted field demos of shelter systems in Kuwait which showed a 50 percent energy savings; and worked on advanced component technologies to be used in future designs. The super energy efficient Containerized Living Unit (SuperCLU) program built a Phase 1 prototype SuperCLU and continued improving the design. They completed testing improved CLUs and the prototype SuperCLUs at 29 Palms, CA, and existing CLU ECUs and coatings in Camp Lemonnier, Africa. The PACOM/DOE program that tests load reduction technologies in tropical environments participated in operations in Thailand and Philippines, gathering energy usage data. They also developed and promoted their I-Net technology assessment capability and completed 2-dozen technology assessments. The Waste-to-Energy program completed syngas-cleaning prototype fabrication which is now being tested.  The program also completed rotary kiln hardware assembly and fabrication of the first prototype Shredded Waste Gasifier.

The new programs, started in FY 2013, are broad, comprehensive efforts to improve DoD’s operational energy performance, particularly by involving non-traditional innovators and small businesses in meeting DoD’s operational energy challenges through mechanisms such as consortia. These four new programs focus on: developing DoD standards for tactical microgrids; tools and training for more efficient planning and control of the energy resources at expeditionary outposts; technologies and systems engineering techniques to better manage soldier and small unit power and reduce their battery burden; and reducing aircraft fuel consumption by reducing drag through engineered surfaces and materials.</r2:Text>

The Army/Navy cooling technology program will complete ECU system design; construct, test and demo a prototype for Technology Enabled Capability Demonstration (TeCD); continue research on integrated power and environmental control technologies. The Navy/ARPA-E cooling technologies program will complete developments for a transition demo at TRL 6 in FY 2015. The Army/Air Force soft shelter tent program will complete initial demonstrations and validate mathematical models and simulations. The Navy Containerized Living Unit program will complete testing both advanced and upgraded CLUs.  The PACOM/DOE program will continue lab and field assessment of promising technologies, probably in Guam, and continue to seek fee for service partners for long term sustainment of the program, while nurturing relationships with existing partners. For the Waste-to-Energy program, detailed designs for new devices will be prepared and operational tests will be performed.

Regarding the consortia programs begun in FY 2013: The Army led program in tactical microgrid standards will focus on identifying gaps in standards, policy, and practices that pose obstacles for system implementation. These gaps will be categorized into a development agenda for the project. The need for standards for small, medium, and large forward operating bases will be documented and the similarities and differences identified.  The Navy led program for energy efficient expeditionary outposts will begin verifying models and defining dashboard requirements. The Army led soldier/small unit program will establish a consortium that will formulate a next-generation Soldier/Small Combat Unit Power and Energy architecture for the future. The program will also develop a return on investment tool to enable traditional defense contractors, non-traditionals, and small businesses to evaluate the ROI for their innovative soldier power and energy concepts. The Air Force drag reduction program will form a consortium; issue RFPs, and award studies for drag reduction technologies. 

FY 2014 new starts will focus on filling operational energy technology gaps identified in a technology gap assessment effort completed by ASD(R&amp;E) in FY 2012. For FY 2014, the planned focus is methods and tools, including modeling and simulation, to embed energy considerations throughout DoD's planning processes, before engineering particular systems or platforms. This will facilitate making operational energy a consideration during such processes as war-games, force planning, requirements development and acquisition planning. With better methods and tools for understanding the burdens and vulnerabilities imposed by operational energy needs and how those needs affect our military effectiveness, planners and decision makers will be able to make choices that are better informed by operational energy considerations.</r2:Text>

The Navy/ ARPA-E program for cooling technologies will complete testing and optimization of the Absorption Heat Pump, Genset Heat Recovery Adsorption Chiller, and Stirling Air Conditioner prototypes, and hold TRL 6 transition demonstrations. The PACOM/DOE testbed plans to complete the transition to a fee-for-service model for long-term viability.

Regarding the consortia programs: The Army-led program in tactical microgrid standards will prepare draft standards for tactical microgrids that will include (a) interconnection and islanding, (b) communication and controls, and (c) safety, protection and human factors. The Navy led program for planning and operating energy efficient expeditionary outposts will refine power models based on testing and feedback and will implement an alpha version of the dashboard for testing and feedback for extended development. The Army-led soldier/small unit program will use the Architecture developed in FY 2014 to develop technologies to demonstrate electrical load reduction, improved energy supply, and power management and distribution techniques.  These will reduce the operational, fiscal, and human burdens imposed by batteries/energy technologies. The Air Force drag reduction program will hold a second workshop to review progress and to choose awardees for a second round of research awards. Lab, wind tunnel, and flight testing of surfaces and coating technologies will occur throughout the year as needed. In addition, the FY2014 new starts will be ramping up.  These programs will be aimed at developing methods and tools, including modeling and simulation, to embed operattional energy considerations throughout DoD’s planning processes.

Generally, FY 2015 new starts will be focused on filling one or more of the operational energy technology gaps identified in a technology gap assessment  completed by ASD(R&amp;E) or other significant gaps OEPP identifies in Service S&amp;T funding.  Consistent with the mission of this funding , these programs will aim to fill some of the gaps by funding the startup of sustainable S&amp;T programs within the Services. The five top priority gaps are: High Efficiency Energy Conversion and Harvesting; Energy Integrated Design and Simulation; High Efficiency Propulsion and Platform Design; Environmental Control Systems; Flexible and Adaptive Power Distribution.</r2:Text>

Further effort established system level metrics for HESM demonstrations and concept of operations in all demonstration areas. Efforts associated with Army and USMC battlefield generator and vehicle HESM demonstrator development were continued. Key new initiatives in FY 2013 were initiated for Air Force and Navy aircraft, and Navy ships HESM demonstrator development. Further energy storage technology demonstration effort associated with safe operation of energy storage impacting all three military application areas was initiated. The goal of this effort is to develop and demonstrate a safe energy storage structure which is capable of not only buffering against life-reducing high operating temperatures due to aggressive cycling operations but also preventing or limiting thermal runaway conditions. These efforts are executed by the Services.</r2:Text>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program addresses developing an integrated and interconnected CWMD capabilities-based system that defines and enables a comprehensive, global awareness and readiness for CWMD steady-state and surge postures. The diverse and complex Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) – nuclear, biological and chemical threats – mission space requires an integrated approach towards capability development. Capability development must be based on a systems perspective that links strategic objectives with interrelated tasks and associated capabilities. The broad CWMD military strategic objectives and mission areas encompass many nontraditional capabilities for the Warfighter, and CWMD is not an isolated mission set unique to DoD – it is intertwined with counter-terrorism and homeland defense. Accordingly, developing an overall CWMD capability should and must leverage complementary capabilities through integration and synchronization. A global CWMD situational awareness capability will be established and deployed worldwide via current communications systems and common operating pictures in support of this mission.  This program will incorporate portfolio management tools and comprehensive analyses to enable a balanced and integrated CWMD systems portfolio, an optimized CWMD force structure, and the integration with and utilization of existing military assets to fill intelligence, sensor and reconnaissance gaps in CWMD.

This program also responds to the strategic needs outlined in the President's initiative, stated in his April 2009 speech in Prague; the US Combatant Commands integrated priorities and requirements; the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review; and the FY12-16 Defense Planning and Programming Guidance by providing improved timeliness and relevance through modernizing CWMD support to the Combatant Commands, Office of the Secretary of Defense, Joint Staff, Intelligence Community (IC), and other U.S. Government agencies as required. This program is designed to leverage existing DoD resources and proven approaches to achieve its goals and rapidly deliver a capability to the Warfighter. It will ensure sufficient funding is available for travel to support the requirements of this program element.

This Program Element can fund travel to support the requirements of this program.

This appropriation will finance work, including manpower, performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant arrangement with the government who conduct research (systematic study directed toward fuller scientific knowledge or understanding of the subject studied), development (systematic use of the knowledge and understanding gained from research, for the production of useful materials, devices, systems, or methods, including the design and development of prototypes and processes) and test and evaluation efforts.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program addresses developing an integrated and interconnected CWMD capabilities-based system that defines and enables a comprehensive, global awareness and readiness for CWMD steady-state and surge postures. The diverse and complex Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) – nuclear, biological and chemical threats – mission space requires an integrated approach towards capability development. Capability development must be based on a systems perspective that links strategic objectives with interrelated tasks and associated capabilities. The broad CWMD military strategic objectives and mission areas encompass many nontraditional capabilities for the Warfighter, and CWMD is not an isolated mission set unique to DoD – it is intertwined with counter-terrorism and homeland defense. Accordingly, developing an overall CWMD capability should and must leverage complementary capabilities through integration and synchronization. A global CWMD situational awareness capability will be established and deployed worldwide via current communications systems and common operating pictures in support of this mission.  This program will incorporate portfolio management tools and comprehensive analyses to enable a balanced and integrated CWMD systems portfolio, an optimized CWMD force structure, and the integration with and utilization of existing military assets to fill intelligence, sensor and reconnaissance gaps in CWMD.

This program also responds to the strategic needs outlined in the President's initiative, stated in his April 2009 speech in Prague; the US Combatant Commands integrated priorities and requirements; the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review; and the FY12-16 Defense Planning and Programming Guidance by providing improved timeliness and relevance through modernizing CWMD support to the Combatant Commands, Office of the Secretary of Defense, Joint Staff, Intelligence Community (IC), and other U.S. Government agencies as required. This program is designed to leverage existing DoD resources and proven approaches to achieve its goals and rapidly deliver a capability to the Warfighter. It will ensure sufficient funding is available for travel to support the requirements of this program element.

This Program Element can fund travel to support the requirements of this program.

This appropriation will finance work, including manpower, performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant arrangement with the government who conduct research (systematic study directed toward fuller scientific knowledge or understanding of the subject studied), development (systematic use of the knowledge and understanding gained from research, for the production of useful materials, devices, systems, or methods, including the design and development of prototypes and processes) and test and evaluation efforts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

It involved information on a range of drivers of proliferation, including key actors, networks, sensitive materials, and extensive contextual information.  It assisted DoD in both preventing the loss of sensitive materials and technologies (and the deliberate or natural spread of disease), and responded to attacks and outbreaks when they  occurred.  It integrated with information systems that the combatant commands and Services already used in their day-to-day operations.

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) addresses the need to defend and deter against weapons of mass destruction (WMD) threats and to safeguard personnel; prevent unauthorized access to equipment, installations, material, and documents; and to safeguard the foregoing against espionage, sabotage, damage, and theft.  This program oversees advanced engineering development throughout DoD for an integrated and systemic RDT&amp;E approach for countering nuclear threats and nuclear and conventional physical security technology and systems.  The funding has been centralized in this Defense-wide PE since the early 1990s and represents a substantial portion of all DoD physical security RDT&amp;E funding.  Priorities for this PE RDT&amp;E efforts are driven by inputs from Quadrennial Defense Review guidance, Combatant Command and Service requirements, analysis reports such as “Protecting the Force:  Lessons from Fort Hood," January 2010, the Integrated Unit, Base, and Installation Protection Cost Benefits Analysis, Multi-national Work Plans established through the Nuclear Security Summit process, and DoD Directive 5210.41, Security Policy for Protecting Nuclear Weapons-directed requirements and associated security deviation reports.  

Under this integrated approach, funds are used to provide advanced component development and prototypes for the Department in seven capability areas:  (1) Detection and Assessment; (2) Access Controls; (3) Installation and Transport Security; (4) Storage and Safeguards; (5) Prevention; (6) Decision Support Systems; and (7) Analytical Support.  This program will evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment.  The projects under the Program Element either (a) lead to Programs of Record which can transition to Program Element 0604161D8Z for systems development and demonstration (SDD); (b) become technology insertions into existing programs; or (c) advance to being a certified Commercial/Government off-the-shelf product.  The PE initiatives are coordinated by the Physical Security Enterprise and Analysis Group.  This group is responsible for avoiding duplication of effort and when applicable ensure systems integration and promote interoperability and sustainability.  

This PE can fund travel to support the requirements of this program.

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) addresses the need to defend and deter against weapons of mass destruction (WMD) threats and to safeguard personnel; prevent unauthorized access to equipment, installations, material, and documents; and to safeguard the foregoing against espionage, sabotage, damage, and theft.  This program oversees advanced engineering development throughout DoD for an integrated and systemic RDT&amp;E approach for countering nuclear threats and nuclear and conventional physical security equipment (PSE) technology and systems.  The funding has been centralized in this Defense-wide PE since the early 1990s and represents a substantial portion of all DoD PSE RDT&amp;E funding.  Priorities for this PE RDT&amp;E efforts are driven by inputs from Quadrennial Defense Review guidance, Combatant Command and Service requirements, analysis reports such as “Protecting the Force:  Lessons from Fort Hood," January 2010, the Integrated Unit, Base, and Installation Protection Cost Benefits Analysis, Multi-national Work Plans established through the Nuclear Security Summit process, and DoD Directive 5210.41, Security Policy for Protecting Nuclear Weapons-directed requirements and associated security deviation reports.  

Under this integrated approach, funds are used to provide PSE advanced component development and prototypes for the Department in seven capability areas:  (1) Detection and Assessment; (2) Access Controls; (3) Installation and Transport Security; (4) Storage and Safeguards; (5) Prevention; (6) Decision Support Systems; and (7) Analytical Support.  The projects under the Program Element either (a) lead to Programs of Record – which can transition to Program Element 0604161D8Z for systems development and demonstration (SDD); (b) become technology insertions into existing programs; or (c) advance to being a certified Commercial/Government off-the-shelf product.  The PE initiatives are coordinated by the Security Policy Verification Committee and the Physical Security Equipment Action Group.  These groups work together to avoid duplication of effort and when applicable ensure systems integration and promote interoperability and sustainability.  

This PE can fund travel to support the requirements of this program.

This appropriation will finance work, including manpower, performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant
arrangement with the government who conduct research (systematic study directed toward fuller scientific knowledge or understanding of the subject studied),
development (systematic use of the knowledge and understanding gained from research, for the production of useful materials, devices, systems, or methods, including the design and development of prototypes and processes) and test and evaluation efforts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Nuclear forensics is the thorough collection, analysis and evaluation of radiological and nuclear material in a pre-detonation state and post-detonation radiological or nuclear materials, devices and debris, as well as the immediate effects created by a nuclear detonation.  The ability to identify the source of nuclear material from radioactive debris is critical to our national defense and security. Swift and accurate forensic and attribution (identification) capabilities are vital to developing an appropriate national response to a nuclear event and preventing future attacks in a timely manner.

Nuclear Terrorism is one of the most significant and pressing threats identified by national leadership.  A credible nuclear forensics program is essential to preventing nuclear terrorism by deterring nations from sponsoring nuclear terrorism.  During the Deputy Management Advisory Group process shortfalls and resources to close these gaps were identified and supported by the Deputy Secretary of Defense.  The purpose of this program is to develop systems such as ground based Prompt Diagnostic sensors and Particulate Airborne Collection Systems to provide timely and accurate information to national leadership in the area of Nuclear Forensics. 

Per DoDI 2060.04 OSD AT&amp;L NCB is the program lead for the Department of Defense in Nuclear Forensics.  NCB represents DoD interests in all areas of nuclear forensics but focuses heavily on post-detonation applications due to Presidential guidance assigning the department the lead role in develop, providing, and maintaining post detonation Nuclear Forensics capability.  

This PE can fund travel to support the requirements of this program.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>(U) ESTCP demonstrates and validates the most promising innovative environmental and energy technologies that target DoD's most urgent needs.   Technologies selected are projected to provide a return on the investment through cost savings and improved efficiencies. The program responds to: (1) Congressional concern over the slow pace of remediation of environmentally polluted sites on military installations, (2) Congressional direction to conduct demonstrations specifically focused on emerging new technologies, and (3) the need to improve defense readiness by reducing the drain on the Department's operation and maintenance dollars caused by environmental restoration, waste management, and the cost of energy. Preference for demonstrations is given to technologies that have successfully completed all necessary research and development objectives, and address the highest priority DoD requirements.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>(U) ESTCP demonstrates and validates the most promising innovative environmental and energy technologies that target DoD's most urgent needs.   Technologies selected are projected to provide a return on the investment through cost savings and improved efficiencies. The program responds to: (1) Congressional concern over the slow pace of remediation of environmentally polluted sites on military installations, (2) Congressional direction to conduct demonstrations specifically focused on emerging new technologies, and (3) the need to improve defense readiness by reducing the drain on the Department's operation and maintenance dollars caused by environmental restoration,waste management, and the cost of energy. Preference for demonstrations is given to technologies that have successfully completed all necessary research and development objectives, and address the highest priority DoD requirements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The test bed program is validating and testing the operational cost and performance of innovative energy technologies in a real-world integrated building environment so as to reduce risk, overcome the barriers to deployment, and facilitate wide-scale deployment.  The DoD test bed program exploits the Department's existing built infrastructure to test energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies in three areas: component technologies (i.e., HVAC, lighting, distributed energy generation); system approaches to building energy design, control, and management; and installation-level smart micro-grid technologies.  It is a distributed test bed designed to evaluate energy technologies under the varied climatic conditions and building types DoD manages. The test beds key elements are: 1) competitive selection of new technologies, 2) systematic and consistent evaluation to determine performance, operational readiness and life cycle costs, and 3) development of guidance and design information for future deployment across installations.

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Humanitarian Demining Research and Development (HD R&amp;D) program element rapidly develops, demonstrates and validates new technologies for DoD-supported nations to detect and clear landmines and unexploded ordnance (UXO), and to contribute to US military countermine R&amp;D.  The HD R&amp;D Program focuses on development of new technologies to improve the efficiency and safety of indigenous nation-conducted, post-conflict clearance of residual mines and UXO, which pose a serious threat to US forces conducting stability operations, and to the host nation’s population and economy.  

Evaluations of HD R&amp;D Program-developed technologies in actual minefields are conducted by host nation demining partners (foreign military, non-governmental organizations and mine action centers) and provide valuable data for US military countermine R&amp;D and next generation HD technology developments while directly contributing to world-wide mine and UXO clearance.  Since 1995 the program has fielded technologies for 166 evaluations in 36 countries, including Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq.  The program’s technologies have cleared 23 million sq meters of the world’s toughest minefields, and found or destroyed 109,000 mines and UXO

Under the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict (OASD SO/LIC), the HD R&amp;D Program works closely with the COCOMS and the Humanitarian Demining Training Center (HDTC) to support the Warfighter by developing and implementing mine/UXO detection and clearance technologies; speeding improvements to technologies used by U.S. forces in support of USG operations; reducing the threat to host nation population and US forces; reducing insurgent access to explosives (landmines and UXO); enhancing mine action capacity of non-governmental organizations and mine action centers in mine-affected countries; and providing engagement opportunities for DoD personnel in mine-affected countries. 
 
Areas of emphasis are identified and validated at a biennial Requirements Workshop held by OASD SO/LIC.  The Requirements Workshop involves representatives from Department of State (DoS), U.S. combatant commands (COCOMS) and mine-affected nations.  

The program element’s work is consistent with the Department of Defense’s strategic guidance to address instability and reduce the demand for significant US force commitments to stability operations; with DODI 3000.05 to foster security, economic security and development, and build indigenous capacity; and with § 407 and CJCSI 3207.01C to reduce the social, economic and environmental impact of landmines, unexploded ordnance and small arms ammunition.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

This approach is required due to the immediate need for new demining technologies in the face of ongoing U.S. forces and host nation citizen casualties in mine-affected countries.  The program evaluates prototype equipment by acquiring it off-the-shelf from industry using competition to the extent possible, by leveraging ongoing countermine R&amp;D efforts in other U.S. and foreign R&amp;D activities, and by taking advantage of extensive in-house fabrication capabilities at the Army's Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Division (NVESD).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

Coalitions provide a broad base of technological, operational, and logistical support for military operations and ease the U.S. financial and manpower burdens associated with meeting military goals and objectives. U.S. strategic guidance confirms that coalitions and relationships with international partners are high priorities for the nation and the Department of Defense.

The Coalition Warfare Program (CWP) responds to this guidance by supporting DoD organizations that:  1) work with foreign partners to collaboratively address strategic technology gaps for current and future missions; 2) develop interoperability solutions for coalition operations; and 3) develop and strengthen defense relationships. CWP is the only Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) program with this mission. CWP supplements a U.S. Government proponent’s funding for cooperative efforts, ensuring U.S. funds are sufficient to complete the engagement with the foreign partner(s).  When CWP funds are used to help fund a cooperative project, that project leverages technical and financial contributions of the foreign partner(s) and speeds up the development and delivery of technical solutions to the warfighter.  In its thirteen-year history, CWP has leveraged $4 of foreign partner funding for every $1 of U.S. Government investment, and $3 of other U.S. Government funding for every $1 CWP has invested in cooperative projects. 

CWP funding enables DoD project teams to move a technology into the next stage of development or to complete and transition a technology to operational forces. These projects may also form the basis for future cooperation with international partners.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

CWP funding enables DoD project teams to move a technology into the next stage of development or to complete and transition a technology to operational forces. These projects may also form the basis for future cooperation with international partners.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>(U) The purpose of this program is to develop a comprehensive capability to prevent and mitigate corrosion and its effects on Department of Defense (DoD) weapon systems and infrastructure.  Corrosion severely impacts system and facility reliability, readiness and safety, and consumes a disproportionate amount of material and labor hours for repair and treatment of corrosion damaged systems and facilities.  The cost of corrosion across the DoD has been estimated at over 23 billion each year. The impact and cost of corrosion are so pervasive that Congress enacted Public Law 107-314 Sec: 1067 [portions codified in 10 U.S.C. 2228]: Prevention and mitigation of corrosion of military infrastructure and equipment.  This legislation requires that DoD develop a long-term corrosion strategy to include establishment of a coordinated R&amp;D program with transition plans.  The legislation also requires that DoD designate a responsible official or organization to oversee a corrosion prevention and mitigation program.  The responsibilities of the Director, Corrosion Policy and Oversight and the Military Department Corrosion Prevention and Control Executives were further delineated in DODI 5000.67 "Prevention and Mitigation of Corrosion on Military Equipment and Infrastructure" of 01 February 2010.
 
(U) The Deputy Secretary of Defense designated the Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics) (PDUSD(AT&amp;L)) as the DoD Corrosion Executive in May 2003.  The DoD Corrosion Executive subsequently established a Corrosion Control and Oversight office to implement the program.  Subsequently, in accordance with Section 371 of the 2008 National Defense Authorization Act, the Under Secretary of Defense (USD(AT&amp;L)) designated a Director, Corrosion Policy and Oversight to perform the duties of the DoD Corrosion Executive with responsibilities as described in the 2008 NDAA legislation.  A major responsibility of the Director, Corrosion Policy and Oversight is to select high payoff research and development projects that promise to prevent or mitigate corrosion and significantly reduce the total cost of corrosion along with the adverse impact of corrosion effects on weapon system and infrastructure operational capability.  This office chartered a Corrosion Prevention and Control Integrated Product Team (CPCIPT) that has selected and funded Operation and Maintenance projects for each Fiscal Year (FY) commencing in FY 2005. However, the DoD CPCIPT has determined that the biggest payoff in corrosion prevention and mitigation will come from investing in up-front prevention technologies, materials, and processes to leverage downstream cost avoidance in corrosion maintenance and repair.  Likewise, development of improved predictive and prognostic techniques can eliminate unseen failure and reduce unnecessary maintenance and repair costs.  Thus, technology development, demonstration, and transition projects have been selected and funded since FY 2006.   In addition, the University Corrosion Collaboration (now the Technical Corrosion Collaboration (TCC)) was formed as a collaboration between universities, academies and research laboratories, focused on corrosion technology research and development to provide solutions to long-term, complex corrosion prevention and control problems, including metallic-non-metallic interactions, advanced surface coatings and treatments for non-traditional use of materials . This advanced corrosion research has been funded since FY 2008 and performed by teams from TCC participating organizations.

In FY 2009, the Military Departments assigned corrosion executives and began submitting reports to Congress on inserting corrosion planning into the acquisition process. The FY 2011 NDAA added a requirement for the DoD to report the amount of funds requested in the preceding year budget for each planned project or activity, as compared to the funding required for each project or activity.  These funds provide a portion of the funds used to implement associated corrosion control projects and activities.

(U) The Corrosion Prevention Control Integrated Product Team membership consists of both the equipment and infrastructure corrosion control experts from the Services, the Joint Staff, the Coast Guard, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.  The Services are given technology development, demonstration, and transition project submission instructions, evaluation procedures and selection criteria.  The CPC project selection board, chaired by the Director, Corrosion Policy and Oversight, reviews the projects and makes recommendations to the USD(AT&amp;L) for final approval.  Likewise, members of the TCC are notified of advanced research requirements and provided instructions for submitting white papers and subsequent project proposals to the Science and Technology Working Integrated Product Team (WIPT) for evaluation, selection and funding.

(U) The former DoD Corrosion Executive issued a policy letter that states: "Basic systems design, materials and processes selection, and intrinsic corrosion-prevention strategies establish the corrosion susceptibility of Defense material.  The early stages of acquisition provide our best opportunity to make effective trade-offs among the many competing design criteria. . ."  The Congress and former DoD Corrosion Executive made it clear that research and development into materials and methods to prevent or mitigate corrosion should receive high priority.  Since Congress has clearly established this program as one of its highest priorities, and has reiterated its expectations regarding funding levels and methods, our budget request is designed to reflect both fiscal realities of one or more on many proposed projects over the next five to ten years.
 
These projects address critical corrosion issues in both Department of Defense infrastructure as well as warfighting systems.  A number of low-risk, high-payoff technologies promise to vastly improve the service life and significantly reduce the maintenance costs of storage tanks and other mission support facilities essential to maintain support for the warfighter.  Each of the services has identified important projects that vastly increase operational readiness and reduce operations and maintenance costs.  All services are studying corrosion inhibitors that improve reliability and life of electrical and avionics equipment.  Likewise, an array of highly effective, rapid cure coatings that are easy to apply and can forestall corrosion for many years on aircraft and ships are being developed.  Other vital projects being considered include sealants, wash down systems, sensors and prognostic technologies that have joint service applications and potential to prevent and mitigate corrosion and its effects over a wide range of systems.  The FY 2014 budget request will provide a critically needed resource to trigger even larger investment and cost avoidance.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>U) The purpose of this program is to develop a comprehensive capability to prevent and mitigate corrosion and its effects on Department of Defense (DoD) weapon systems and infrastructure.  Corrosion severely impacts system and facility reliability, readiness and safety, and consumes a disproportionate amount of material and labor hours for repair and treatment of corrosion damaged systems and facilities.  The cost of corrosion across the DoD has been estimated at over 23 billion each year. The impact and cost of corrosion are so pervasive that Congress enacted Public Law 107-314 Sec: 1067 [portions codified in 10 U.S.C. 2228]: Prevention and mitigation of corrosion of military infrastructure and equipment.  This legislation requires that DoD develop a long-term corrosion strategy to include establishment of a coordinated R&amp;D program with transition plans.  The legislation also requires that DoD designate a responsible official or organization to oversee a corrosion prevention and mitigation program.  The responsibilities of the Director, Corrosion Policy and Oversight and the Military Department Corrosion Prevention and Control Executives were further delineated in DODI 5000.67 "Prevention and Mitigation of Corrosion on Military Equipment and Infrastructure" of 01 February 2010.
 
(U) The Deputy Secretary of Defense designated the Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics) (PDUSD(AT&amp;L)) as the DoD Corrosion Executive in May 2003.  The DoD Corrosion Executive subsequently established a Corrosion Control and Oversight office to implement the program.  Subsequently, in accordance with Section 371 of the 2008 National Defense Authorization Act, the Under Secretary of Defense (USD(AT&amp;L)) designated a Director, Corrosion Policy and Oversight to perform the duties of the DoD Corrosion Executive with responsibilities as described in the 2008 NDAA legislation.  A major responsibility of the Director, Corrosion Policy and Oversight is to select high payoff research and development projects that promise to prevent or mitigate corrosion and significantly reduce the total cost of corrosion along with the adverse impact of corrosion effects on weapon system and infrastructure operational capability.  This office chartered a Corrosion Prevention and Control Integrated Product Team (CPCIPT) that has selected and funded Operation and Maintenance projects for each Fiscal Year (FY) commencing in FY 2005. However, the DoD CPCIPT has determined that the biggest payoff in corrosion prevention and mitigation will come from investing in up-front prevention technologies, materials, and processes to leverage downstream cost avoidance in corrosion maintenance and repair.  Likewise, development of improved predictive and prognostic techniques can eliminate unseen failure and reduce unnecessary maintenance and repair costs.  Thus, technology development, demonstration, and transition projects have been selected and funded since FY 2006.  In FY 2009, the Military Departments assigned corrosion executives and began submitting reports to Congress on inserting corrosion planning into the acquisition process. The FY 2011 NDAA added a requirement for the DoD to report the amount of funds requested in the preceding year budget for each planned project or activity, as compared to the funding required for each project or activity.  These funds provide a portion of the funds used to implement associated corrosion control projects and activities.
 
(U) The Corrosion Prevention Control Integrated Product Team membership consists of both the equipment and infrastructure corrosion control experts from the Services, the Joint Staff, the Coast Guard, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.  The Services are given project submission instructions, evaluation procedures and selection criteria.  The CPC project selection board, chaired by the Director, Corrosion Policy and Oversight, reviews the projects and makes recommendations to the USD(AT&amp;L) for final approval.

(U) The former DoD Corrosion Executive issued a policy letter that states: "Basic systems design, materials and processes selection, and intrinsic corrosion-prevention strategies establish the corrosion susceptibility of Defense material.  The early stages of acquisition provide our best opportunity to make effective trade-offs among the many competing design criteria. . ."  The Congress and former DoD Corrosion Executive made it clear that research and development into materials and methods to prevent or mitigate corrosion should receive high priority.  Since Congress has clearly established this program as one of its highest priorities, and has reiterated its expectations regarding funding levels and methods, our budget request is designed to reflect both fiscal realities of one or more on many proposed projects over the next five to ten years.
 
These projects address critical corrosion issues in both Department of Defense infrastructure as well as warfighting systems.  A number of low-risk, high-payoff technologies promise to vastly improve the service life and significantly reduce the maintenance costs of storage tanks and other mission support facilities essential to maintain support for the warfighter.  Each of the services has identified important projects that vastly increase operational readiness and reduce operations and maintenance costs.  All services are studying corrosion inhibitors that improve reliability and life of electrical and avionics equipment.  Likewise, an array of highly effective, rapid cure coatings that are easy to apply and can forestall corrosion for many years on aircraft and ships are being developed.  Other vital projects being considered include sealants, wash down systems, sensors and prognostic technologies that have joint service applications and potential to prevent and mitigate corrosion and its effects over a wide range of systems.  The FY 2014 budget request will provide a critically needed resource to trigger even larger investment and cost avoidance.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The Corrosion Prevention and Control Integrated Project Team (CPCIPT) receives project plans and engages an evaluation panel to review proposed projects and make recommendations regarding project selection.  Projects are also evaluated using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to rank projects by relative efficiency.  DEA factors include project performance period, ratio of OSD funding to Service funding, return-on-investment (ROI), degree to which the proposed technology addresses high-cost corrosion problems, potential benefits, and joint service applicability.  DEA efficiency scores are provided to the evaluation team to assist in their prioritization of projects for funding.  In addition, evaluators consider the following in recommending final priorities:
1. Return on investment credibility: Degree to which there is evidence that the project will achieve an acceptable return on investment
2. Technology maturity:  Degree to which proposed technology has been developed or demonstrated and will satisfy project objectives 
3. Schedule confidence:  Degree to which the project is likely to be completed on time
4. Budget confidence:  Degree to which the project is likely to be completed within the proposed budget
5. Management support: Degree to which management actively supports this project and has committed program resources to both manage and support this project
The project priority ranking is finalized and sent to the CPCIPT lead for a final decision..  Upon acceptance and approval of the projects by the CPCIPT, the projects are briefed to the Corrosion Forum.  Funding is distributed between the Services based on funding priorities associated with the evaluation process results.     
   
Upon selection by CPCIPT of the highest priority projects and final funding approval, Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) transfers individual project funding to the appropriate funding sites that are provided by the Services.  After receiving the project funding, the Services are responsible for the funding and management of the projects.  OSD retains oversight and direction of the Corrosion Prevention and Control initiative through the CPCIPT.  Project oversight includes the review of quarterly status reports which address progress summary, performance goals and metrics and upcoming key events, as well as reports to periodic Corrosion Forums.   
   
The quarterly project report (PR) format has been defined and requires the following input:   
1. Statement of progress 
2. Outstanding issues 
3. Performance goals and metrics 
4. Upcoming events
5. Schedule status 
6. Current return on investment (ROI) status 
These project reports (PRs) are submitted to the CPCIPT.  The CPCIPT analyzes project status, progress and project statistics and informs the Service points of contact (POCs) of any project problems.  Projects are also required to report verbally at Corrosion Forums, as appropriate.   

In addition to the project plans described above, advanced research white papers and subsequent proposals are solicited from universities, academies and research laboratories that constitute the TCC.  The proposed efforts must include collaboration between two or more members of the TCC and address significant corrosion problems that call for ground-breaking science and technology and/or complex research and development in the five areas corrosion program areas cited above. Not only does the TCC produce technologies, advanced components, and products that reduce the impact of corrosion on DoD weapons systems and infrastructure and increase their sustainability; but it also provides participants with advanced education and skills to form the core of the future corrosion prevention and control technical community, its support network, and its suppliers.   

Corrosion Prevention and Control (CPC) Program direction, control and oversight include the following activities to be performed by staff and support contractors:   
1. Plan and schedule Corrosion Forums and oversee Corrosion Forum activities and working Integrated Product Team (IPT) meetings.   
2. Oversee project performance including review of quarterly status reports which address progress summary, performance goals and metrics and upcoming key events, as well as reports to periodic Corrosion Forums.   
3. Perform Department of Defense (DoD) cost of corrosion study.   
4. Develop improved, standard DoD-wide specifications, standards and qualification processes.   
5. Develop corrosion training courses.   
6. Prepare and publish Corrosion Prevention and Control Planning Guidebook spirals.   
7. Prepare and publish annual Reports to Congress. 
8. Update short-term and long-term metrics.   
9. Develop corrosion control program management guide for selecting materials.   
10. Develop, implement, and update the DoD Corrosion Prevention and Mitigation Strategic Plan.   
11. Develop and maintain Roadmaps of IPT activities and accomplishments.   
12. Assist in the annual project plan implementation and evaluation process, including the assessment of return on investment associated with proposed projects. 
13. Respond to Congressional, Government Accountability Office and DoD inquiries regarding the CPC Program. 
14. Perform CPC Program communication and outreach to services, agencies and other organizations. 
15.  Develop and implement corrosion prevention and control policies applicable for acquisition and sustainment of both weapons systems and infrastructure.
16.  Perform reviews of major programs to ensure they are in compliance with corrosion prevention and control policy.
17.  Provide oversight of the corrosion programs of the Military Departments and Chair the DoD Corrosion Board of Directors (which includes the Corrosion Control and Prevention Executives from each of the Military Departments).
18.  Interact with industry, technical societies, trade associations, government personnel, and foreign allies to identify promising corrosion control technologies and assist in technology transition and insertion</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

Cost-effective land-based defense will be demonstrated by closing the fire control loop between existing sensors and prototype ground-launched Railgun projectiles. To facilitate this, LBRG will integrate the Railgun launcher, power, projectile, and sensor so that projectiles may be command guided during a series of flight tests. These tests will verify performance and lethality results from modeling and simulation. Testing will conclude by demonstrating projectile fly-out and control, sensor tracking of projectiles, communication from sensor to projectile, integrated guidance, navigation and control, culminating in an FY2015 live-fire, closed-loop, command-guided launch from a 20 mega-joule Railgun.

This is a new PE for FY 2014 that contains OSD land-based Railgun investments to accelerate fire control loop closure. In FY 2011 and FY 2012, ramp investments were provided from alternate RDT&amp;E PEs to enable the following accomplishments:
• Initiated development of high fidelity models and simulations for gun launched guided projectile engagements.
• Anchored projectile models with wind tunnel and flight test data in collaboration with the Navy’s Office of Naval Research (ONR).
• Analyzed several effective sensor architectures using existing sensors to support gun launched guided projectile engagements.
• Selected sensors to support FY 2014 flight tests of prototype projectile airframes.
• Conducted several projectile airframe flight tests in the first quarter—a quarter ahead of schedule—in collaboration with ONR.
• Installed tracker hardware and successfully tracked a projectile flight with tactically relevant measurement accuracies in the first quarter in collaboration with ONR and the Army’s Armament Research Development and Engineering Center.</r2:Description>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Global Hawk (GH) and the Triton, as well as other Group 3-5 UAS, need a sense-and-avoid (SAA) capability as an alternate means of compliance to Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 91.111 and Part 91.113, requirement to see-and-avoid other aircraft.  The Air Force is leading the effort to develop an Airborne Sense and Avoid (ABSAA) system that is suitable to support operations within US and foreign national airspace. The RQ-4 Global Hawk, MQ-4C Triton, MQ-1B Predator, MQ-1C Gray Eagle, and MQ-9 Reaper all have a requirement for SAA capability and will leverage the technology being developed by the Air Force. The Army is leading the development of a Ground Based Sense-and-Avoid (GBSAA) system using existing technology to provide a near-term solution for improved airspace access, both for terminal operations and for operations/training within the GBSAA system's coverage area (e.g., Gray Eagle at El Mirage, Shadow operations at Cherry Point).

Standards Development - Completed update of MIL-HDBK-516 for airworthiness criteria, standards, and methods of compliance for both fixed and rotary wing UAS, and began finalizing all Proof of Concurrence Reports for Tri-Service Technical Airworthiness Authority (TAA) signatures. Kicked off SAA systems airworthiness criteria, standards, and methods of compliance development. Conducted a detailed study of the certification of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components in safety critical applications to satisfy a high priority safety gap identified by the Sense and Avoid Science Research Panel (SARP).  Leveraged Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) methodologies to support the development of a safety case for integrating UAS in the NAS. Developed a potential methodology for evaluating the effectiveness of SAA system algorithms.  Started updating the current UAS Airspace Integration Concept of Operations (CONOPS) and conducted operational analysis to assist DoD in overcoming UAS AI challenges.  

Modeling &amp; Simulation (M&amp;S) - Supported analysis of modeling and simulation requirements to address high priority research gaps, as identified by the SARP.
 
GBSAA – The GBSAA SIPT continued efforts to develop a common GBSAA system applicable across all Services. The efforts included Common Display work, development of top-level requirements, and participation in the SARP workshops - leading the development of SAA concepts, definitions and requirements. The display work included Display Usability Tests conducted with UAS operators in Huntsville, AL and at Ft Huachuca, AZ to refine the Alert &amp; Traffic Display subsystem. In addition to the usability tests, a Common Display Quick Study utilizing 15 Army participants – including manned pilots, unmanned operators and air traffic control personnel - was conducted with a focus on intruder prioritization schemes for a common display. Army's top level GBSAA requirements and a high-level description of its approval process were submitted to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to provide a framework for a written agreement between DoD/Army and the FAA on full integrated GBSAA operations, starting with Ft Hood, TX. Army GBSAA is considered a “pathfinder” for SAA system certification by the FAA. Army GBSAA Block 0 system requirements are base-lined and the development of software certification is underway with integration testing scheduled to begin in July 2014. Cherry Point MCAS began flying segregated transit GBSAA operations under a Certificate of Authorization (COA) in June 2013.  Cherry Point’s COA approval provides a path for the Services to follow for self-certification and safety risk management.</r2:Text>

OSD completed development and deployment of the UCS Repository. The UCS Repository allows the rapid re-use of UAS "apps" across tri-Services. UCS was demonstrated in a live Army Bi-Directional Remote Video Terminal (BDRVT) Shadow Flight Test; this provided risk reduction and expedited Army BDRVT/ One System Remote Video Terminal (OSRVT) program of record delivery. UCS was expanded/adopted beyond UAS into the maritime domain.</r2:Text>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The OSD HSCB Modeling Program is a vertically integrated effort to research, develop, and transition technologies, tools, and systems to programs of record and users in need.  The Program exists to optimize U.S. forces’ ability to perform population-centric sensing, understand behaviors driven by social and cultural variables, and select effective courses of action in the full range of military operations.  Program research will enhance population-centric intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities for understanding the increasingly complex global environment to address national strategic challenges such as instability, aggression, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and violent extremism.  In three integrated program elements (PEs), the Program will conduct applied research, mature and demonstrate advanced technology, and develop transitionable methods, technology, tools, and prototypes.  Work under PE 0604670D8Z will create transition ready software tools that will help intelligence analysts, operations analysts, operations planners, wargamers, and others represent, understand, and forecast sociocultural behavior at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels.  This program focuses on maturing, hardening, and validating human, social, culture, and behavior modeling software for transition to meet the needs of the warfighter, integration into the architectures of existing programs of record, and/or maturing software via open architectures to allow broad systems integration.  The Program provides a development to product transition pathway for sociocultural models, tools, and capabilities to rapidly meet immediate and emerging warfighter needs.  The work supports the testing, validation, and transition of model-based technology into existing and developing systems in coordination with Program Executive Offices/Program Managers, Combatant Commanders, Joint and Service organizations, warfighters in need, and other transition customers.  The Program will mature sociocultural relevant data and tools to provide essential sociocultural understanding and forecasting capabilities at the strategic, operational and tactical levels.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) addresses the need to defend and deter against weapons of mass destruction (WMD) threats and to safeguard personnel; prevent unauthorized access to equipment, installations, material, and documents; and to safeguard the foregoing against espionage, sabotage, damage, and theft.  This program oversees advanced engineering development throughout DoD for an integrated and systemic RDT&amp;E approach for countering nuclear threats and nuclear and conventional physical security technology and systems.  The funding has been centralized in this Defense-wide PE since the early 1990s and represents a substantial portion of all DoD physical security RDT&amp;E funding.  Priorities for this PE RDT&amp;E efforts are driven by inputs from Quadrennial Defense Review guidance, Combatant Command and Service requirements, analysis reports such as “Protecting the Force:  Lessons from Fort Hood,” January 2010, the Integrated Unit, Base, and Installation Protection Cost Benefits Analysis, Multi-national Work Plans established through the Nuclear Security Summit process, and DoD Directive 5210.41, Security Policy for Protecting Nuclear Weapons-directed requirements and associated security deviation reports.  

Under this integrated approach, funds are used to provide system development and demonstration for the Department in seven capability areas:  (1) Detection and Assessment; (2) Access Controls; (3) Installation and Transport Security; (4) Storage and Safeguards; (5) Prevention; (6) Decision Support Systems; and (7) Analytical Support. The program will develop systems that are producible, supportable, and affordable and to demonstrate system integration, interoperability, and utility prior to full-rate production.  The projects under the PE become technology insertions into existing programs or advance to being a certified Commercial/Government off-the-shelf product.  The PE initiatives are coordinated by the Physical Security Enterprise and Analysis Group.  This group is responsible for avoiding duplication of effort and when applicable ensure systems integration and promote interoperability and sustainability.  

This PE can fund travel to support the requirements of this program.

This appropriation will finance work, including manpower, performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant
arrangement with the government who conduct research (systematic study directed toward fuller scientific knowledge or understanding of the subject studied), 
development (systematic use of the knowledge and understanding gained from research, for the production of useful materials, devices, systems, or methods, including the design and development of prototypes and processes) and test and evaluation efforts.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The level of resourcing for the Prompt Global Strike Capability Development program reflects iterative reductions from efficiencies and budget reductions, which reduces the Department's ability to develop flexible responsive solutions to emerging war fighter needs.  This Program Element (PE) was established to develop and demonstrate technologies and applications that advance conventional prompt global strike (CPGS) warfighting capabilities. The program uses a national team with coordination between the Services, Agencies and national research laboratories to pursue integrated portfolio objectives of the acquisition and operation of a CPGS system.  This program funds the design, development, and experimentation of boosters, payload delivery vehicles (PDVs), non-nuclear warheads, guidance systems, and mission planning and enabling capabilities. To support these development activities, the program procures modeling and simulation capabilities, command and control interfaces, test range support, and launch system infrastructure.  Additionally, expert resources address strategic policy and treaty issues. Program emphasis is on demonstrating component and subsystem technology maturity with risk reduction initiatives.  Program timing will be driven by the outcome of flight test events and DoD budgets.  In FY 2015, funding for the individual service initiatives will be contingent upon their abilities to execute and achieve satisfactory progress towards project goals as determined by the CPGS portfolio manager.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

This Program Element (PE) was established to develop and demonstrate technologies and applications that advance conventional prompt global strike (CPGS) warfighting capabilities. The program uses a national team with coordination between the Services, Agencies and national research laboratories to pursue integrated portfolio objectives of the acquisition and operation of a CPGS system.  This program funds the design, development, and experimentation of boosters, payload delivery vehicles (PDVs), non-nuclear warheads, guidance systems, and mission planning and enabling capabilities. To support these development activities, the program procures modeling and simulation capabilities, command and control interfaces, test range support, and launch system infrastructure.  Additionally, expert resources address strategic policy and treaty issues. Program emphasis is on demonstrating component and subsystem technology maturity with risk reduction initiatives.  Program timing will be driven by the outcome of flight test events and DoD budgets.  In FY 2014 and FY 2015, funding for the individual service initiatives will be contingent upon their abilities to execute and achieve satisfactory progress towards project goals as determined by the CPGS portfolio manager.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                        <r2:Description>This sub-project develops technologies and applications that could lead to a system with the following characteristics: effects on targets in a very short-period of time from execution order; non-ballistic flight over the majority of the flight path; positive control from launch to impact; adequate cross-range/ maneuverability to avoid overflight issues; controlled stage drop over Broad Ocean Area (BOA), and  provides for in-flight target updates.  This sub-project also develops warhead technologies to defeat time-sensitive targets for near and longer-term CPGS applications.  The technologies developed will have cross-service and cross-concept applicability and will be developed through close coordination among DoD components. This activity will support both ground and flight tests, and provide all national data to the competitive acquisition program.

The objectives of this sub-project are to: 
- Assess boost-glide technologies in light of ground and flight test events and associated modeling and simulation.
-Analyze the military utility of multiple, 3-axis stabilized vehicles performance with respect to thermal protection materials, aerodynamics and control surfaces, navigation, guidance, control (NG&amp;C), boosters and weapons performance.
-Assess the feasibility of producing an affordable solution to fill the CPGS capability gap.
-Continue systems definition/engineering/development of integrated weaponized payload delivery vehicles and subsystems in order to identify and reduce risks and mature technologies for a global range competitive acquisition program.</r2:Description>

                                                        <r2:Description>This sub-project will test and evaluate alternative booster and delivery vehicle options and will assess the feasibility of producing an affordable alternate solution to fill the CPGS capability gap.  It will mature technologies that could lead to advanced systems with the following characteristics: effects on targets in a very short-period of time from execution order; non-ballistic flight over the majority of the flight path; positive control from launch to impact; adequate cross-range/maneuverability to avoid over flight issues; and controlled stage drop over BOA.  The technologies developed will have cross-service and cross-concept applicability and will be developed through close coordination among DoD components.  This activity will support both ground and flight tests, and provide all national data to a potential acquisition program.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Funds will be used to provide technical, systems engineering and acquisition management oversight of programs, projects and activities to maximize the Department’s return on investment in information technology resources and to effect a comprehensive approach for assessing and procuring critical information systems from initial design, through development to capability delivery in support of improved weapons systems performance and military operations. Resources will be allocated for architecture design and development, portfolio management, enterprise-wide systems engineering and operational impact analyses related to C3 and non-intelligence space systems. The Common Joint Tactical Information funding line responds to the Department's requirement for joint and combined network-enabled tactical data link (TDL) capabilities and for communications which meet net-centric standards to ensure interoperability and seamless integration with joint communication systems. It will be used to assess and promote competition across TDLs DoD-wide and to provide acquisition oversight of TDL-related activities such as CDL waveforms, Joint Aerial Layer Network (JALN) narrowband TDL gateways, Multifunction Advanced Data Link (MADL) and datalink roadmaps to guide future investments. This funding line provides resources for acquisition support and management oversight of critical command, control, communications (C3) and non-intelligence space capabilities as the Department migrates to netcentric operations.They will also be used to provide expertise required for exercising technical direction over design, performance and cost parameters of key systems and their dependencies. The goal of this funding is to eliminate redundancy, reduce time to the field, evaluate projects and concepts for adherence to net-centric guidelines, minimize performance and operational risk of developing and fielding complex major systems which rely on networks and supporting applications, ensure program dependencies are documented and included in acquisition decisions and address interoperability requirements, gaps and best value technical solutions. Typical deliverables associated with the instantiation of net-centric capabilities for these mission areas include network and vulnerability assessments, migration plans, investment strategies, roadmaps and technical guidance documentation.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The focus for FY 2014 for the DEF pilot program will be to execute feasibility studies for FY 2013 pilot programs that have yet to receive DEF funding, and to review the next phases on FY 2012-13 DEF pilot programs.  As with the FY 2013 programs, FY 2014 feasibility studies will define the required actions for implementing DEF and assess the potential costs of those actions.  OUSD (AT&amp;L) will engage with program offices through the Military Departments, and serve as a liaison among the program offices, the Military Departments, and other Technology Security and Foreign Disclosure offices to facilitate the feasibility studies.  For pre-MS A systems, the DEF feasibility studies will be addressed in the Technology Development Strategy and the Program Protection Plan (PPP).  For the systems that are in the pre-MS B development stage, the DEF feasibility studies will be addressed in the Acquisition Strategy and the PPP.  For Post-MS B platforms, when there is already a contract in place, OUSD (AT&amp;L) will work with the program managers and contracting officers to implement the necessary contractual modifications to ensure that the feasibility studies are executed.  Depending on the maturity of each program and where it is in the acquisition life cycle, the feasibility studies may be addressed in the Requests for Proposals (RFPs).      

OUSD (AT&amp;L) will conduct a follow-up industry round-table meeting to discuss the DEF concept, capture government and industry perspectives, and to identify further corresponding government and industry strategic choices. Government and industry participants will also identify mutual risks and challenges in implementing defense exportability features, and identify legislative, regulatory, or policy change proposals.  This will take place in the spring of 2014.

OUSD (AT&amp;L) will continue to develop recommended procedures and guidance to be incorporated in the DAG regarding incorporating DE business case analyses into contract and acquisition strategies, as well as procedures to cost share DEF implementation with industry and recoupment of these costs though foreign sales.  OUSD (AT&amp;L) will also develop policies and processes to identify additional DoD funding sources for the next phases of DEF activities, as well as cost-sharing with contractors for the initial and follow-on research and development costs of DEF pilot programs, in accordance with Section 252 of the NDAA for FY 2012.</r2:Text>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Department’s budget focuses on institutionalizing and financing our capabilities to fight the wars we are in today and the scenarios we are most likely to face in the years ahead, while at the same time mitigating risk and providing for contingency operatioins. It also includes a fundamental overhaul of the DoD’s approach to procurement, acquisition, and contracting.  As such, the complex details of budgeting and tracking of funds become increasingly critical to senior leader decision making and to provide accountability to the taxpayer.  Incorporating information technology toward current and emerging business processes manifesting into a state-of-the art system of systems will result in increasing efficiencies, timely diagnostics, and reducing lifecycle costs to maintain, sustain and repair.

Today, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense Comptroller OUSD(C) and the Cost Analysis and Program Evaluation (CAPE) uses various distinct automated systems (Comptroller Information System (CIS), PBD Wizard, Program Resource Collection Process (PRCP), Supplemental Resource Collection Process (SRCP), Budget Exhibits Generator and Standard Data Collection System (SDCS) to formulate, justify, and execute DoD budgets.  These six or more systems interact with at least several computer-based systems controlled by external organizations and agencies.  These systems manage very similar financial information, yet each uses its own scheme for representing information.  Much of the information managed by these systems is redundant.  Cross-system data representations and redundancies make it difficult to exchange and to reconcile information.  The capabilities provided by Comptroller systems, in some cases, fail to deliver services needed by its users, or fail to operate in ways that complement current and emerging business practices.  They fail to give executives information in a comprehensible form, making it difficult to draw conclusions.  Data disparities and functional redundancy make these systems more costly to keep than they need to be.

There is a critical need for the development of a state-of-the-art information technology system to modernize and replace multiple, antiquated legacy systems and processes used to formulate, justify, present and defend the entire Department of Defense Budget in the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) (OUSD(C)) to meet Title 10 and Title 31 mission and reporting requirements.  The Comptroller’s plan for mitigating the deficiencies and capability gaps associated with current systems is development of the Next Generation Resource Management System.  

This initiative exploits emerging technology, processes, trends, capabilities, and techniques to incorporate state-of-the-art information technology enabling the ability, agility, and level of fidelity to collect, process, administer and report resource management data and to automate business processes within a more robust analytical environment within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) OUSD(C). Funded efforts will improve the timeliness of resource management reviews and decisions for senior leaders and Congress.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The CMS Program increase is to expand the pilot program to close out services for cost-type contracts, and a portion is to be used to sustain existing AbilityOne closeout support teams. This funding plus up is not related to the Defense Electronic Procurement dollars however the funds were placed here because AT&amp;L/DPAP does not own another RDT&amp;E PE.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>A key part of DoD’s strategy to meet its energy goals is to develop an energy information management environment that will enable the Services and OSD to track energy production and usage across the real property portfolio.  Information on energy usage is critical for day-to-day management and accountability, troubleshooting building systems, and planning for capital investments.  These funds will support the development and procurement of an enterprise-wide energy data warehouse that will be integrated with existing and future real property systems.  AT&amp;L has already conducted a comprehensive requirements analysis for this prospective warehouse using funds provided through the now-disestablished Business Transformation Agency.  We have defined a standard set of energy information management requirements and are now assessing and planning which information management technologies (future and current) will best support them.  Funding is required to keep this project on track and ensure that the DoD-wide energy management data environment becomes a reality.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Information on energy usage is critical for day-to-day management and accountability, troubleshooting building systems, and planning for capital investments.  These funds will support the development and procurement of an enterprise-wide energy data warehouse that will be integrated with existing and future real property systems.  AT&amp;L has already conducted a comprehensive requirements analysis for this prospective warehouse using funds provided through the now-disestablished Business Transformation Agency.  We have defined a standard set of energy information management requirements and are now assessing and planning which information management technologies (future and current) will best support them.  AT&amp;L funding is required to keep this project on track and ensure that the DoD-wide energy management data environment becomes a reality.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This is critical both from  audit readiness and program management perspectives.  New policies are in place, but business systems must be modified to support data requirements.  This funding is used to determine requirements for the Department's Real Property inventory records as well as to develop and procure an enterprise wide data warehouse that will be integrated with existing and future energy and real property systems.  This warehouse will collect, maintain, and report on the inventory and assist the Components to implement inventory requirements, including data accuracy and completeness.  Without funding the components will return to services agency centric processes that do not allow for total DOD accountability.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The transformation of readiness reporting into a new, more comprehensive system presents a number of significant challenges. First, there are thousands of new potential reporting entities to include in DRRS, such as Combatant Commands, Joint Task Forces, Services, Active and Reserve component units, installations, depots, ports, and major elements of the industrial base. These entities must not only define and implement reporting based on specific readiness metrics, but they must make their readiness status continuously available in near real time to DRRS. Second, the shift from resource centric readiness reporting to a mission/ capabilities based reporting system oriented towards the National Military Strategy (NMS) makes substantially more complex demands on readiness reporting. DRRS allows the Department to assess readiness globally based on our integrated ability to project and sustain a mix of constructed forces in simultaneous engagements. Finally, the challenges associated with sourcing and evaluating the readiness of our forces engaged in on-going real operations mean that force managers need applications that will query the entire Department for suitable, available organizations to meet current needs. The need for these applications and the underlying data are a top priority for the DRRS project.

The realization of DRRS requires integrating a host of key technologies in order to achieve an information system that supports distributed, collaborative, and dynamic readiness reporting in addition to continuous tool-based assessment. The primary technical goal is the creation of a highly reliable and securely integrated readiness data environment to leverage and extend current readiness information systems. This system is based on intelligent agents, dynamic databases, semantic middleware, and publish/subscribe concepts; providing a logically uniform view into the multiple databases and information sources that feed DRRS. Through this type of advanced information environment, the DRRS dramatically expands the range of readiness information available to manage the force. This environment supports a suite of analysis tools that allow users to explore the consequences of readiness deficiencies in terms of the ability to generate forces and assess transportation feasibility as it pertains to specific scenarios. These tools and tool suites harness the power of the information environment to make possible the kind of quick-turnaround, excursion-driven readiness assessment that is at the heart of DRRS.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) and acquisition reform initiatives call for top down, national security strategy-driven capabilities-based planning. Department of Defense (DoD) Instruction 5000.02 and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 3170.01 promulgate capabilities-based requirements and acquisition processes. The JSAD program enables collaborative efforts to achieve these goals with a focus on Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAPs). These efforts include warfighting capability-based analyses; assessments of joint capability areas and joint integrating concepts; development of system-related data; integrated roadmaps to support acquisition investment decisions; and assessments of MDAPs and Major Automated Information Systems (MAIS) in a capability area context.  Activities in the JSAD project are divided into three areas:  (1) capability-based analysis; (2) roadmaps; and (3) support tools and guidance. Capability-based analysis provides analysis of the different technology, functionality, and integration impacts of systems on warfighting capability.  Acquisition roadmaps guide systems development and associated investment plans.  JSAD support tools and guidance initiatives develop systems data, and tools, exploit modeling and simulation and architecture efforts to improve DoDs overall assessment capability.  These efforts guide the development and improve the testing and fielding of integrated systems of systems in order to achieve Joint mission capabilities.  The QDR also lays out the need for an institutional reorientation or shift in emphasis from organization-specific to enterprise-wide approaches. This means:  (1) horizontal integration within the Department and unity of effort through greater interagency collaboration; (2) engaging in a coordinated and portfolio-based approach to planning,  programming, budgeting and execution; and (3) significant reforms at the governance, management and execution levels.  To accomplish this direction, there needs to be a focused  goal and concerted emphasis on shifting from systems acquisition to capabilities-based portfolio management (or portfolio systems acquisition).  This  program enables collaborative efforts to implement the QDR direction outlined above in order to achieve portfolio systems acquisition goals.  The program is broken up into two focus areas (Portfolio Management and Reform Initiatives) and consolidates work previously performed under various other Program Elements.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Departments 2005 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) laid out the need for an institutional reorientation or shift in emphasis from organization-specific to enterprise-wide approaches.  This meant:  (1) horizontal integration within the Department and unity of effort through greater interagency collaboration; (2) engaging in a coordinated and portfolio-based approach to planning, programming, budgeting and execution; and (3) significant reforms at the governance, management and execution levels.  The Department’s 2010 QDR report further addressed reforming how we buy, noting that the conventional acquisition process is too long and too cumbersome to fit the needs of the many systems that require continuous changes and upgrades—a challenge that will become only more pressing over time. The Department will improve how it matches requirements with mature technologies, maintains disciplined systems engineering approaches.   To accomplish this direction, there needed to be a focused goal and concerted emphasis on shifting from acquisition of individual systems to portfolio management (or portfolio systems acquisition).  This program enables collaborative efforts to implement the QDR direction outlined above and to achieve portfolio systems acquisition goals and to develop and implement acquisition reform initiatives.

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Since its inception in FY 1990, this program element has been used to fund the development of critically needed, high priority Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) capabilities for joint/multi-Service requirements.  The Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program (CTEIP) uses a corporate investment approach to combine Service, Defense, and other government agencies T&amp;E needs, maximize opportunities for joint efforts, and avoid unwarranted duplication of test capabilities.  CTEIP focuses investments on projects that will have high productivity returns on investment.  Projects under the CTEIP Program Element (PE) support two basic tasks: investments to improve the test capabilities base (Joint Improvement and Modernization (JIM) projects) and development of near-term solutions to test capability shortfalls in support of ongoing operational test programs (Resource Enhancement Project (REP)).
JIM projects address critically needed T&amp;E investments in the major functional areas of: air combat; armament and munitions; Command, Control Communication, Computer and Intelligence (C4I) and networks; common range instrumentation; electronic combat; land combat; sea combat; space combat; threat simulators; and test environments.  Examples of project subject matter include: highly accurate time-space-position information, network enhanced telemetry, miniaturized flight safety systems, realistic urban test environments, ground testing for manned and unmanned aerial platforms and satellites, and end-to-end testing of infrared countermeasure and electronic warfare systems.  CTEIP continues as the focal point for fostering common architectures throughout the test and training communities to enhance the sharing of resources and links between test and training ranges.
CTEIP has provided special focus to institutionalize the use of modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) as a practical test tool; to link ranges through internetting to enhance inter-range and inter-Service cooperation and resource sharing; and, to ensure development and acquisition of common instrumentation necessary for a more efficient test infrastructure.
Analyses of alternative solutions are conducted for each investment project to validate T&amp;E requirements, to define integrated support systems, and to determine overall cost effectiveness of the proposed test investments.  The use of Department of Defense (DoD)-wide processes for requirement validation, prioritization, and risk assessment ensures an effective test resource investment program.

The REP funds development of near-term solutions for critical ongoing operational tests supporting decisions on major, high priority defense acquisition programs.  These unanticipated operational test (OT) capability requirements arise from several sources such as a new threat system identified during OT planning, acquisition of foreign military assets that are critical in determining weapon system operational effectiveness, short timelines between system design maturity and scheduled OT, and emerging technologies and test requirements resulting from operational concept changes mandated by Congress or Director, Operational Test &amp; Evaluation (DOT&amp;E), or system-of-systems testing.  Funding these activities under the CTEIP provides the opportunity to coordinate and integrate these near-term test requirements with the total DoD test and evaluation investment planning, and ensures their availability and legacy for other programs that may have similar testing requirements.
This Research Category 6.4 PE includes special studies, analyses, and strategic planning related to test capabilities and infrastructure, and supports the development and application of proven technologies to provide major test and evaluation capabilities required to meet DoD component weapon system test requirements.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Since its inception in FY 1990, this program element has been used to fund the development of critically needed, high priority Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) capabilities for joint/multi-Service requirements.  The Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program (CTEIP) uses a corporate investment approach to combine Service, Defense, and other government agencies T&amp;E needs, maximize opportunities for joint efforts, and avoid unwarranted duplication of test capabilities.  CTEIP focuses investments on projects that will have high productivity returns on investment.  Projects under the CTEIP Program Element (PE) support two basic tasks: investments to improve the test capabilities base (Joint Improvement and Modernization (JIM) projects) and development of near-term solutions to test capability shortfalls in support of ongoing operational test programs (Resource Enhancement Project (REP)).

    The JIM funds critically needed T&amp;E investments in the major functional areas of: air combat; armament and munitions; Command, Control Communication, Computer and Intelligence (C4I) and networks; common range instrumentation; electronic combat; land combat; sea combat; space combat; target systems; and test environments.  Examples of project subject matter include: highly accurate time-space-position information, network enhanced telemetry, miniaturized flight safety systems, realistic urban test environments, ground testing for hypersonic systems and satellites, and end-to-end testing of infrared countermeasure systems.  CTEIP continues as the focal point for fostering common architectures throughout the test and training communities to enhance the sharing of resources and links between test and training ranges.

   CTEIP has provided special focus to institutionalize the use of modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) as a practical test tool; to link ranges through internetting to enhance inter-range and inter-Service cooperation and resource sharing; and, to ensure development and acquisition of common instrumentation necessary for a more efficient test infrastructure.

   Analyses of alternative solutions are conducted for each investment project to validate T&amp;E requirements, to define integrated support systems, and to determine overall cost effectiveness of the proposed test investments.  The use of Department of Defense (DoD)-wide criteria for requirement validation, prioritization, and risk assessment ensures an effective test resource investment program.
The REP funds development of near-term solutions for critical ongoing operational tests supporting decisions on major, high priority defense acquisition programs.  These unanticipated operational test (OT) capability requirements arise from several sources such as a new threat system identified during OT planning, acquisition of foreign military assets that are critical in determining weapon system operational effectiveness, short timelines between system design maturity and scheduled OT, and emerging technologies and test requirements resulting from operational concept changes mandated by Congress or Director, Operational Test &amp; Evaluation (DOT&amp;E), or system-of-systems testing.  Funding these activities under the CTEIP provides the opportunity to coordinate and integrate these near-term test requirements with the total DoD test and evaluation investment planning, and ensures their availability and legacy for other programs that may have similar testing requirements.

   This Research Category 6.4 PE includes special studies, analyses, and strategic planning related to test capabilities and infrastructure, and supports the development and application of proven technologies to provide major test and evaluation capabilities required to meet DoD component weapon system test requirements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Joint Mission Environment Test Capability (JMETC) program was established for the purpose of implementing the Department’s strategy to move to an enterprise-centric, distributed test capability that results in acquisition systems fielded with enhanced joint capabilities, reduced program costs, and improved acquisition timelines.  The JMETC program implements the infrastructure capabilities defined in the DoD’s “Testing in a Joint Environment Roadmap” to provide acquisition program managers a robust nation-wide capability to “test like we fight.”  JMETC provides a persistent, distributed test and evaluation (T&amp;E) capability; supporting system development, interoperability testing, and cyber testing; that otherwise would not be readily available to Service/Component acquisition programs.  USD (AT&amp;L) directed TRMC to take responsibility for operations and resources of the National Cyber Range (NCR) beginning October 1, 2012. The Director of TRMC assigned NCR to JMETC.  The JMETC program is funded within the RDT&amp;E Management Support Budget Activity because it is intended to provide test capability in support of RDT&amp;E programs.  JMETC creates a common corporate capability to link live systems with virtual and constructive representations in order to generate a realistic joint mission test environment for the system(s) being tested.  To support the DoD guidance on cyber defense and attack operations, the JMETC environment includes a distributed cyberspace interoperability testing capability for systems under test.  JMETC is a widely applicable, persistent, service provider for the Department’s acquisition and net-centric programs.  Key JMETC products include readily available connectivity over existing networks, standardized data transport solutions, tools and utilities for planning and conducting distributed integrations, DoD corporate distributed testing expertise, and a reuse repository.  This common integration capability, through the use of the Test and Training Enabling Architecture (TENA), provides compatibility between JMETC and the Joint National Training Capability (JNTC), streamlining reuse of technical resources across the test and training communities.  In turn, this integration capability enables combined test and training exercises.
 
       By linking distributed facilities, JMETC allows acquisition programs to efficiently evaluate their warfighting capability in a realistic joint mission environment.  This enables a customer-defined joint mission test environment for systems engineering and testing, extensible to training and experimentation, in a timely and cost effective manner.
 
       JMETC’s institutional funding builds, maintains, and operates the JMETC infrastructure and pays for persistent availability of national connectivity for testing; data communications middleware; identification and development of interface standards; common software tools and components; and a reuse repository.  It also funds JMETC program management, facilities, equipment, operating costs, and special studies and analysis related to distributed test capabilities and infrastructure.  Key attributes of the JMETC include:  persistency; interoperability; reuse; various combinations of distributed capabilities (reconfigurable infrastructure to meet customer requirements to include distributed cyber testing); modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) linkage; Live-Virtual-Constructive (LVC) test resource integration; and distributed test support to satisfy both Service and Joint needs.  System engineering, training, and experimentation all benefit from a corporate JMETC developed for T&amp;E.
       
The Test Resource Management Center (TRMC) is the Department’s lead for the JMETC program and oversees both its development and its operations.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Joint Mission Environment Test Capability (JMETC) program was established for the purpose of implementing the Department’s strategy to move to an enterprise-centric, distributed test capability that results in acquisition systems fielded with enhanced joint capabilities, reduced program costs, and improved acquisition timelines.  The JMETC program implements the infrastructure capabilities defined in the Department of Defense’s “Testing in a Joint Environment Roadmap” to provide acquisition program managers a robust nation-wide capability to “test like we fight.”  JMETC provides a persistent, distributed test and evaluation (T&amp;E) capability; supporting system development, interoperability testing, and cyber testing; that otherwise would not be readily available to Service/Component acquisition programs.  Under Secretary Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (USD(AT&amp;L)) directed Test Resource Management Center (TRMC) to take responsibility for operations and resources of the National Cyber Range (NCR) beginning October 1, 2012. The Director of TRMC assigned NCR to JMETC.  The JMETC program is funded within the RDT&amp;E Management Support Budget Activity because it is intended to provide test capability in support of RDT&amp;E programs. 
   JMETC creates a common corporate capability to link live systems with virtual and constructive representations in order to generate a realistic joint mission test environment for the system(s) being tested.  JMETC is a widely applicable, persistent, service provider for the Department’s acquisition and net-centric programs.  Key JMETC products include readily available connectivity over existing networks, standardized data transport solutions, tools and utilities for planning and conducting distributed integrations, Department of Defense (DoD) corporate distributed testing expertise, and a reuse repository.  This common integration capability, through the use of the Test and Training Enabling Architecture (TENA), provides compatibility between JMETC and the Joint National Training Capability (JNTC), streamlining reuse of technical resources across the test and training communities.  In turn, this integration capability enables combined test and training exercises.

   By linking distributed facilities, JMETC allows acquisition programs to efficiently evaluate their warfighting capability in a realistic joint mission environment.  This enables a customer-defined joint mission test environment for systems engineering and testing, extensible to training and experimentation, in a timely and cost effective manner.

    JMETC’s institutional funding builds, maintains, and operates the JMETC infrastructure and pays for persistent availability of national connectivity for testing; data communications middleware; identification and development of interface standards; common software tools and components; and a reuse repository.  Additionally, in FY 2013 funding was added to the JMETC program to provide improved cyber test capability.  Also, in FY 2013, responsibility for the National Cyber Range (NCR) was given to the Test Resource Management Center (TRMC) and subsequently put under the JMETC management team.  The NCR was funded in FY 2013 through funds provided by Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), Director, Operational Test &amp; Evaluation (DOT&amp;E), Assistant Secretary of Defense (Research &amp; Engineering)(ASD(R&amp;E)) reprogramming, and the TRMC investment programs.  JMETC program funding also provides JMETC program management, facilities, equipment, operating costs, and special studies and analysis related to distributed test capabilities and infrastructure.  Key attributes of the JMETC include:  persistency; interoperability; reuse; various combinations of distributed capabilities (reconfigurable infrastructure to meet customer requirements); modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) linkage; Live-Virtual-Constructive (LVC) test resource integration; and distributed test support to satisfy both Service and Joint needs.  System engineering, training, and experimentation all benefit from a corporate JMETC developed for T&amp;E.

- Continued to expand the JMETC persistent infrastructure to 72 sites with an additional 15 planned.  Increased our network connectivity to industry and academia with the addition of peering points to MITRE Corporation, Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI) and Lockheed Martin Corporation.

- Supported 48 distinct customer distributed live-virtual-constructive (LVC) test activities to Department of Defense (DoD) acquisition programs and events as follows:  MQ-4C Triton (formerly referred to as Broad Area Maritime Surveillance [BAMS]) Environment Integration; Air Force Systems Interoperability Tests (AFSIT)(five test events); Aegis Accelerated Mid-Term Interoperability Improvement Program (AMIIP) (later to be called Aegis Performance Assessment Verification (PAV) and Multi-site Test Bed (MST); Joint Integrated Air and Missile Defense Organization’s (JIAMDO) Correlation/De-correlation Interoperability Test (C/DIT); JIAMDO Joint Tactical Air Picture Mission Environment – 12A (JTAP – ME); Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC) Joint Interoperability Tests (four actual test events); Air Ground Integrated Layer Exploration (AGILE) Fire VII and VIII; E-2D tests; Joint Track Manager Capability /Composite Track Management (JTMC-D/CTM); Distributed Common Ground System – Army (DCGS-A); Air Intercept Missile (AIM-9X); Joint Distributed Infrared Countermeasures (IRCM) Ground Test System (JDIGS); US Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) Integrated Warfare Capability (IWC); Marine Corps Virtual Rapid Prototyping Laboratory (VRPL); Interoperability Test and Evaluation Capability (InterTEC) System Integration Test; Aegis Performance Assessment Verification (PAV), and the Integrated Cyber Event (ICE).

- Continued to provide general distributed test planning and execution support to the following customers; MQ-4C Triton, Joint Tactical Networking Center (JTNC) formerly the Program Executive Office (JPEO), JTMC-D/CTM, Aegis PAV and Multi-site Test Bed (MST) (formerly AMIIP), AFSIT, NAVAIR IWC events, InterTEC development and fielding, and numerous other smaller test activities.

- Continued planning support to new and on-going acquisition program customers, particularly MQ-4C Triton, Apache Block III, P-8A Poseidon (Increment 3), Unmanned Carrier Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike (UNCLASS), F-35, F-22, Small Diameter Bob II, Air Intercept Missile (AIM-9X), Integrated Defensive Electronic Countermeasures (IDECM), Army Network Integration Event/Brigade Modernization (NIE), JTNC Joint Reference Implementation Laboratory (JRILs), Common Aviation Command and Control System (CAC2S), Joint Operational Test Approach (JOTA-2) Mode V IFF, Dismounted Detection Radar (DDR), Electromagnetic Rail Gun, Three-Dimensional Expeditionary Long Range Radar (3DELRR), Counter Remote Controlled Improvised Explosive Device (IED) Electronic Warfare (CREW), and Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile (AARGM).

- Enhanced the User Interface and content of the web-based JMETC Reuse Repository to store distributed test tools, utilities, lessons learned, and test metadata making all available to the DoD test community.

- Supported JIAMDO in the successful renegotiation of the International Agreement between the United States and United Kingdom for C/DIT.

- Collaborated and supported the JTNC program in the development of a Radio Frequency (RF) over Fiber capability to digitize and extend an RF signal over the JMETC network, enabling remote radio play in geographically separated networks.  The design and development for this project has been completed and initial, early testing of the device with various waveforms has shown that this project will achieve it designed goals.  This capability will result in a significance cost avoidance (estimated in the millions of dollars) to the JTNC program.

- Assisted and supported customers with distributed test tools and expertise for planning and executing their distributed events.

- National Cyber Range:

- Received responsibility for the National Cyber Range in Orlando, FL, a cyber test facility, a majority of which is a fully accredited Secure Compartmentalized Information Facility (SCIF).   The facility is comprised of an array of servers, networking, storage devices and an integrated tool suite.  During the year, the NCR was accredited by the Defense Intelligence Agency to operate at the Top Secret, Sensitive Compartmented Intelligence level of security, making the NCR fully test capable through the range of classification levels.  The NCR provides the ability to rapidly design, deploy and sanitize large scale, high fidelity test and training environments in which extremely malicious threats can be unleashed on operationally, representative systems and networks to assess the impact on the network, networked weapon systems, and the associated mission.   Considerable technological advancements were incorporated into the integrated tool suite which is highlighted by the significant level of automation and the ability to support up to four concurrent events, executed in completely isolated testbeds, at different levels of classification.

- The NCR supported users in FY 2013 included Office of the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation, US Pacific Command, US Cyber Command, other Defense Agencies, and DoD development programs.  Their objectives have included testing for vulnerabilities, scalability, malware propagation, and effective defenses.  Even though the primary focus has been on functionalizing, refining and accrediting the capabilities, the NCR conducted 8 events through August of FY 2013, has another 8 events scheduled into FY 2014, and is planning additional tests to be executed after the end of the calendar year.  An event normally consists of a week for integration and set-up, a week or two of testing, and a week for analysis.

- Cyber Test and Evaluation

- Initiated the Cyber Range Interoperability Standards (CRIS) effort, developing a common lexicon, developing a standard cyber test process, and beginning the effort to prioritize needed standards which will result in efficiencies through improved interoperability and scalability.  This effort was executed through participation by representatives from across the cyber range community.

- Worked with the Deputy Assistant Secretary Defense Developmental Test &amp; Evaluation (DASD DT&amp;E), Army Threat Systems Management Office, and the Air Force 46th Test Squadron to conduct an Integrated Cyber Event (ICE).  This cyber test event proved that the infrastructure is adequate to test a command and control system.  However, it also pointed out the significant need for improvements in areas such as red and blue environments, cyber test instrumentation, and a cyber visualization capability.

- Deployed the first of several production Regional Service Delivery Points (RSDP).  This first system resides at the Threat System Management Office (TSMO) and will provide enterprise resources for computing, storage, and common services.  Funded the development of the second Regional Service Delivery Point (RSDP) which will provide increased capacity for cyber test and training.   The RSDPs will also promote efficiencies by providing enterprise services, such as realistic traffic generation, visualization tools, instrumentation, and other tools.

- Developed Cyber T&amp;E Use Cases, a set of operational and system architecture driven products, that helps identify potential threat vectors and test concepts needed to identify Cyber T&amp;E infrastructure requirements for testing representative C2 Systems, Combat Systems, Weapon Systems, and Business IT Systems.

- Initiated planning for significant distributed test infrastructure enhancements that will support multiple, concurrent classification up to and including TS//SCI with a focus on leveraging the RSDP capabilities and incorporating both kinetic and non-kinetic assets to address growing interoperability and cyber T&amp;E requirements.</r2:Text>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program is a key source of funding for the Office of the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Staff to manage studies, analysis, management, and technical support efforts strategically to improve and support policy development, decision making, management and administration of DoD programs and activities. Studies and analysis will examine current and alternative policies, plans, operations, strategies and budgets, and are essential for managing and responding to the ever-changing complex international, political, technological, economic, military, and acquisition environments in which national security planning decisions are made.  The need for independent analysis has become particularly acute with the evolution of requirements for planning the strategic redeployment of forces in the face of technological challenges and resource constraints, and there is a strong need to incorporate the effects of operational analysis in force planning assessments. With the persistently complex security, threat, and economic environment, the need for objective analysis and forward looking planning for the mid and long-term is vital.

In FY 2014 the budget request for the Global Theater Security Cooperation Management Information Systems (TSCMIS) program will be transferred to the Defense Security Cooperation Agency.  TSCMIS is an existing program that will be executed by the Joint Staff separately from the Technical Studies, Support, and Analysis program. The Global Theater Security Cooperation Management Information Systems program responds to OSD's Guidance for Employment of the Force so that Combatant Commanders, Military Department Chiefs, CSA Directors, and applicable Defense Agency and Field Activity Directors are able to use a tracking mechanism to account for their steady-state activities that is accessible to other DoD components. Together these tracking mechanisms will provide a global view of all steady-state activities conducted by DoD components. The intent of this program is to encourage further development of tracking mechanisms in order to achieve full visibility of Defense Department activities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program is a key source of funding for the Office of the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Staff for studies, analysis, management, and technical support efforts to improve and support policy development, decision making, management and administration of DoD programs and activities. Studies and analysis will examine current and alternative policies, plans, operations, strategies and budgets, and are essential for managing and responding to the ever-changing complex international, political, technological, economic, military, and acquisition environments in which national security planning decisions are made.  The need for independent analysis has become particularly acute with the evolution of requirements for planning the strategic redeployment of forces in the face of technological challenges and resource constraints, and there is a strong need to incorporate the effects of operational analysis in force planning assessments. With the persistently complex security, threat, and economic environment, the need for objective analysis and forward looking planning for the mid and long-term is vital.

From FY 2010 through FY 2013 this program element included funding for the Global Theater Security Cooperation Management Information Systems (TSCMIS) Program, which is a separate program from the OSD Technical Studies, Support &amp; Analysis program.  TSCMIS is an existing program which provides a global view of all steady-state activities conducted by DoD components and enables that information to be accessible by other DoD components.  Proposed enhancements to TSCMIS will enable all of the Services and Combatant Commands to access information in this system and will allow the incorporation of data provided by other interagency partners.    The budget request for the TSCMIS program was transferred to the Defense Security Cooperation Agency beginning in FY 2014.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This program conducts approximately one-hundred actions per fiscal year to support a wide variety of national security goals of the Department and is designed to encourage a collaborative research approach among the components of OSD and the Joint Staff.  The research and study projects supported by this program are closely integrated with the strategic goals of the Department of Defense.  The focus of studies varies across a wide spectrum including weapons systems cost analysis, strengthening and leveraging alliances, human resource and military personnel management, examination of innovative technologies, application of technology to operational doctrine, and many other issues of emerging importance.  Most of the actions are long to intermediate-range in outlook, and the program allows organizational leaders to plan and guide their research toward meeting their highest-priority goals and other high-level guidance such as executive branch performance management objectives, the Quadrennial Defense Review, and the National Security Strategy of the United States of America.

In following the program efficiencies guidance of the Secretary of Defense, the scope and detail of studies and analyses will be abridged in order to focus upon issues of the highest strategic importance to the Department of Defense while continuing to make every effort to support requirements from legislative direction.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>(1) Export Control Program:
The Militarily Critical Technologies Program (MCTP) provides the technical reference guidance in support of development and implementation of Department of Defense (DoD) technology security policies on international transfers of defense related goods, services, and technologies.  The export control program provides an ongoing assessment and analysis of global goods and technologies.  Determines significant advances in the development, production, and use of military capabilities by potential adversaries.  Determines goods and technologies being developed worldwide with potential to significantly enhance or degrade U.S. military capabilities in the future.  Identified in the Export Administration Act of 1979 and extended by Presidential Executive Order to review militarily critical goods and technologies and to consider worldwide technology capabilities.  The Militarily Critical Technologies List (MCTL) is a congressionally mandated source document for identification of leading edge and current technologies monitored worldwide for national security, nonproliferation control of weapons of mass destruction, and advanced conventional weapons.

Specific activities include:
- Develop and publish in electronic form (including Internet version) restricted editions of the MCTL document that describe the military and proliferation significance of various technologies.
- Monitor and assess dual-use and military technologies worldwide.
- Assist in the development of proposals for negotiation in various multilateral export control regimes.
- Limited worldwide technology capability assessments for the MCTL and other U.S. international critical technologies efforts.
- Identification and determination of technical parameters for proposals for international control of weapons of mass destruction.
- Identification of foreign technologies of interest to the DoD and opportunities for international cooperative research and development.

(2) The DoD Damage Assessment Management Office (DAMO) Program:
The Defense Industrial Base (DIB) secures critical DoD programs and technology by protecting DoD unclassified information resident on and transiting DIB unclassified networks.  This project further establishes the DoD DAMO to coordinate the conduct of assessments involving the loss of DoD information requiring controls resulting from the unauthorized access and/or exfiltration of technical data maintained on unclassified DIB networks.  The DAMO identifies and categorizes the impact of the loss of acquisition information contained on the affected systems, organizes, and coordinates the assessment reports with all affected components and DIB members, and establishes a process to appropriately share collected information with all affected parties.  The DAMO establishes policy and procedures for conducting damage assessments applicable to all DoD components and in concert with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation (DFAR) procedures pertaining to contracts with the DIB.

Specific activities include:
- Provide technical expertise and analyses in assessing the impact of data lost as a result of the unauthorized access and/or exfiltration. 
- Develop a damage assessment ontology and data repository in order to provide analysis to identify trends in the targeting and compromise of defense program information.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementNote>Rapid Fielding (RF) and Comparative Test is being recast with a focus on operational and developmental prototypes derived from evaluation of foreign equipment and products that will provide the U.S. Armed Services and Special Operations Command (SOCOM) capabilities to counter emerging threats.  The Foreign Comparative Testing (FCT) program will increase its focus on finding and leveraging foreign technology solutions that affordably extend the life of existing military platforms/capabilities.  FCT’s broad reach across our allies and friendly foreign countries will enable finding and developing innovative, cost effective, and potentially interoperable solutions for the DoD, Multi-Service and Combatant Command (COCOM) priority requirements.

In FY 2015, Foreign Comparative Testing funding in Program Element 0605130D8Z is being transferred to PE 0603133D8Z to emphasize operational and developmental prototypes and Budget Activity alignment.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Foreign Comparative Testing (FCT) program supports the warfighter by leveraging technologies and equipment from allied nations and coalition partners to satisfy U.S. defense requirements, thereby accelerating the U.S. acquisition process and lowering development costs.  The FCTs enhance interoperability, facilitate international collaboration, expand opportunities for prototyping to increase competition in innovation and enable more efficient and affordable transition of technologies into acquisition programs of record.  Authorized by Title 10, U.S. Code, Section 2350a (g), the FCT program is managed by the Office of Secretary of Defense (Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (DASD) Rapid Fielding), Comparative Technology Office (CTO).  The FCT projects are sponsored by the Services and SOCOM.  Evaluation processes for project selection include a detailed review to confirm the proposed item addresses valid requirements, a thorough market survey, and development of a viable acquisition strategy.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Foreign Comparative Testing (FCT) program supports the warfighter by leveraging advanced technologies and equipment from allied nations and coalition partners to satisfy U.S. defense requirements, thereby accelerating the U.S. acquisition process and lowering development costs.  The FCTs enhance interoperability, facilitate international collaboration, expand opportunities for prototyping and enable more efficient and affordable transition of technologies into acquisition programs of record.  Authorized by Title 10, U.S. Code, Section 2350a(g), the FCT program is managed by the Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD), Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (DASD) Rapid Fielding (RF), Comparative Technology Office (CTO).  The FCT projects are sponsored by the Services and U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) each year.  Evaluation processes for project selection include a detailed review to confirm the proposed item addresses valid requirements, a thorough market survey, and development of a viable acquisition strategy.  

Since the program's inception in 1980, OSD has initiated 671 projects; 619 projects have been completed to date.  Of the 324 evaluations that met the sponsors' requirements, 252 led to procurements worth approximately $11.000 billion in FY 2013 constant year dollars.  With an OSD investment of about $1.170 billion, the FCT Program realized an estimated research, deve lopment, test, and evaluation (RDT&amp;E) cost avoidance of $7.800 billion in FY 2013 constant year dollars.

The FCT program is a catalyst for teaming and other business relationships between foreign and U.S. industries.  Many successful FCT projects result in the licensed production of the qualified foreign item in the U.S. Other nations recognize the long-term value of such practices for competing in the U.S. defense market and the resultant strengthening of the "two-way street" in Defense procurement.  The result often means the creation of jobs and contributions to local economies throughout the United States.  To date, companies across 33 states benefited from FCT projects.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                        <r2:Description>The Army is looking to evaluate personal body armor, small arm protective inserts (SAPI), fabricated by new isostatic and high pressure processing technique.  This prototype process has had very promising results and has the potential to reduce the weight and improve the ballistic performance of personal body armor at a lower cost.  The current SAPI plates are made by conventional processing techniques which use low pressure autoclave to bond ceramic tiles and high performance fiber composites together.  The fiber composite materials are processed separately using hot press prior to the final bonding process.  This production method cannot provide uniform high pressure throughout the entire processing and therefore, the ballistic performance of current SAPI plates is not optimized.  The proposed technology has demonstrated the capability to provide absolute uniform and high pressure for the entire process and also to combine fiber composite consolidation and plate integration into a one-step process.  This technology will maximize the bonding strength between fiber composite layers and between composite and the ceramic which will significantly improve the ballistic performance of SAPI plates.  Uniform and high pressure processing technology will also dramatically reduce the performance variation which will provide more trade space for weight reduction.  The technology developed provides a new manufacturing technique that is unique and unavailable from domestic sources.</r2:Description>

                                                        <r2:Description>Test and qualify pump-jet propulsion technology for the first-time use as Secondary Propulsion Thrusters as a submarine Secondary Propulsion System (SPS).  These pump-jet Secondary Propulsion Thrusters have the potential to improve ship control, operational performance and greatly reduce Total Ownership Cost.  The new SPS will provide variable speed control and directional thrust to allow the ship’s driver to maneuver the submarine in waters where currents are very volatile and during mooring and underway evolutions.  The primary outputs and efficiencies produced by this project are 1) improved control of the submarine; 2) an RDT&amp;E cost avoidance of $532.000 million; and 3) an Operations and Support cost avoidance of $181.000 million.  Following successful at-sea operational testing, the technology will be considered for insertion into the Virginia Class Block V baseline.  The same pump jet technology will also be considered on the Ohio Replacement design.</r2:Description>

The portal will expand its use to distribute Air Force Weather processing needs across the enterprise in a net centric mode providing efficiencies, expanded capabilities and cost savings over current approaches.  In particular, it can be used for meteorological data processing and visualization, contain interactive forecasting tools, enhance forecast production and workflow management, and develop adherence to the Open Geospatial Consortium's (OGC) standards for Web Mapping Services (WMS), Web Coverage Services, and Web Feature Services (WFS).  In addition, Visual Weather is compatible with the Joint Meteorological and Oceanographic (METOC) Broker Language (JMBL), which is Air Force Weather’s current Web service approach to the exchange of information between meteorological and oceanographic data providers and user applications.  The use of Visual Weather reduces the time the weather forecaster spends on product generation and allows more time for quality control of the resultant weather product.  The distribution of data across the Air Force Weather Enterprise will also provide a level of Continuity of Operations that currently does not exist if connection to the Air Force Weather Agency is lost.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) establishes the dedicated funding line to carry out the duties as described in Title 10 US Code, Section 139, the Weapons Systems Acquisition Reform Act of 2009.  The Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Systems Engineering (DASD(SE)) is the principal advisor to the Secretary of Defense, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (USD(AT&amp;L)) and the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD(R&amp;E)) on systems engineering, development planning, and related technical fields in the Department of Defense.  The DASD(SE) develops policies and guidance for (1) the use of systems engineering principles and best practices; (2) the use of systems and software engineering planning and contracting approaches to enhance reliability, availability, and maintainability on major defense acquisition programs (MDAPs); (3) the systems engineering plans (SEPs) for MDAPs including software, and systems engineering considerations in support of lifecycle management and sustainability; and (4) the inclusion of provisions relating to systems engineering and reliability in requests for proposals.  The DASD(SE) reviews and approves the SEP for each MDAP and monitors and reviews the systems engineering and development planning activities of MDAPs and other defense acquisition programs as directed by the Secretary of Defense or the USD(AT&amp;L).  Based on the DASD(SE)’s continuous program engagement, the DASD(SE) advises and makes recommendations to the Secretary of Defense and the USD(AT&amp;L) regarding systems engineering, development planning and the execution of these activities.  As a member of the Defense Acquisition Board, the DASD(SE) provides independent assessments of defense acquisition program’s systems engineering, development planning, technical execution, and risk.  The DASD(SE) also provides input on the inclusion of systems engineering requirements as part of the Joint Requirements Oversight Council's process for joint military requirements, to include developing specific inputs relating to each capabilities development document.

The DASD(SE) issues guidance to, and consults with, the Services and Agencies with respect to systems engineering in the Department, providing advocacy, oversight, and guidance to elements of the acquisition workforce responsible for systems engineering, development planning, and lifecycle management and sustainability functions and developing policies and guidance for the integration of specialty engineering functions.  

The DASD(SE) periodically reviews the organizations and capabilities of the military departments with respect to systems engineering, development planning, and lifecycle management and sustainability, and identifies needed changes or improvements to such organizations and capabilities. The DASD(SE) prepares and submits an annual report to Congress on systems engineering activities and effectiveness.

This PE includes efforts by the office of the DASD(SE) in implementing the Department’s Trusted Defense System Strategy.  Specifically, the PE will develop and mature the critical sub discipline of systems engineering - system security engineering and the Comprehensive Program Protection Planning process that implements a risk-based approach to protection of critical technology, components and information in acquisition programs.  This includes study and maturation of policy, guidance and SSE discipline fundamentals such as engineering methods, tools and best practices.  These activities will be promulgated in defense acquisition as a fundamental element of DASD(SE) systems engineering and technical reviews.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Increased reliance on the internet as a vehicle for sharing information, globalization of the supply chain, and advanced persistent threats (APTs) that can evade commercially available security tools and defeat generic security best practices, drive the need for better and smarter program protection planning and execution.  Comprehensive Program Protection Planning links high level policies and practical expertise to specific acquisition practices, systems engineering activities, and risk reduction activities.  Through this initiative the Department will pilot activities with the DIB to reduce risks in sharing and storing critical program information, better understand and mitigate supply chain risks, improve program protection planning, and improve and streamline program protection engineering.  Activities carried out support implementation of DoD Directive 5200.44 Trusted Systems and Networks with the use of proven mitigation techniques and tools, the ongoing refinement of risk management processes, and creation of needed technology.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

As a UARC, the SERC is a strategic resource to further systems research and increase its impact on the Department’s ability to meet its mission.  Greatly improved systems engineering is essential to the president’s strategy for the Department to field systems that are agile, affordably sustainable, flexible, and ready for a full range of contingencies in the face of declining budgets and a shrinking workforce.  The SERC consists of a network of eighteen research universities from across the US that work collaboratively to bring the best talent in the nation to bear on DoD’s systems engineering research problems. 

In prior years, DASD/SE has resourced the SERC at $1.000 million per year from P142. 

The additional funding, beginning in FY 2014, will increase the Department’s engagement with SERC, supporting additional research on topics of strategic importance to DoD.  

This new project code, established within the Systems Engineering Program Element:  (1) provides core funding for the SERC; (2) provides adequate stable resources for the SERC research agenda; and (3) enables the SERC to take full advantage of the university collaborators, enabling them to address DoD needs much more effectively.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The funds for this program are used to support research, development, test and evaluation efforts as well as studies and analyses for nuclear weapons security; use control; nuclear weapons stockpile safety, survivability and performance; countering nuclear threats and office management.  Funds are also used to develop and implement plans for stockpile transformation; infrastructure analyses and assessments; DoD-NNSA Nuclear Weapons Council activities, as mandated by Title 10 USC, section 179; radiological and nuclear emergency response efforts; and management of international programs of nuclear cooperation, particularly with respect to enhancing international nuclear safety and security and office management.  Nuclear Matters is also responsible for policy development and implementation for personnel reliability; nuclear weapons, nuclear command and control, and special nuclear materials security; use control; nuclear weapons transportation; physical security equipment; countering nuclear threats; and nuclear and radiological incident response.

There's increased risk, absent nuclear testing, in assuring long-term safety and reliability of today’s aging stockpile—the legacy warheads left over from the Cold War.  Today’s nuclear weapons complex is not sufficiently “responsive” to technical problems in the stockpile, or to potential emerging threats.  The task is to ensure the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile and supporting infrastructure, meets long-term national security needs.</r2:Description>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>DARS is the Department’s enterprise registry, catalog and navigation map for enterprise architecture.  It serves as the Department’s primary catalog of architecture data holdings and provides users the ability to register holdings metadata and search, retrieve, and use DoD architecture data in federated architecture data repositories across DoD.  DARS provides a key component of the Department’s net-centric data management capability by federating enterprise architecture data across the Department.  It enables alignment of program architecture components with the Federal Enterprise Architecture Business Reference Model - consistent with OMB directives for exhibit 300s - via the DoD Business Reference Model.  DARS implements a federated search capability and metadata catalog that will interoperate with the Department’s Net-Centric Enterprise Discovery Service and enterprise content metadata catalog.  Architecture metadata is searchable using the DARS federated discovery web service.  The discovery search results provide links to architecture data that is retrievable based on user roles and access permissions.  Implementations are accessible on both the NIPRNET (unclassified) and SIPRNET (Collateral Classified).  Key features of the DARS program focus on: (1) Making architecture data visible, accessible, trusted, understandable, and interoperable (2) enabling reuse of validated architecture data to build “composite” integrated architectures; (3) enabling architecture analysis; and, (4) integrating architecture data into the DoD mainstream decision-making processes.  The Department of the Air Force, Army, and Navy CIO’s are collaborating in the development of DARS federation web services via the Federated Joint Architecture Working Group under the auspices of the DoD Enterprise Architecture Summit to ensure DoD-wide access to and usability of all components of the composite DoD enterprise architecture model.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

It provides the Defense Intelligence Enterprise with independent civilian personnel authorities necessary to hire, develop, reward, and retain the diverse, versatile and highly qualified workforce necessary to perform the Defense intelligence mission and brings for the first time, the entire Defense Intelligence Enterprise under one personnel framework.

These funds are used to develop modifications to the Performance Appraisal Application (PAA) in the Defense Civilian Personnel Data System and to the classified Global Force Management (GFM) Defense Intelligence Organizational Server.  PAA is a performance management tool used by the Military Services Intelligence Components, Defense Security Service and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence.

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>(U) The SBIR/STTR Program is executed in three phases. The purpose of Phase I is to determine, insofar as possible, the scientific technical and commercial merit, and feasibility of ideas submitted under the SBIR/STTR Program. Phase II awards are made to firms that have been awarded a Phase I contract on the basis of the results of their Phase I effort and the scientific, technical, and commercial merit of the Phase II proposal. Phase II is the principal research or research and development effort and is expected to produce a well-defined deliverable prototype. Phase III SBIR/STTR efforts derive from, extend or conclude Phase I or Phase II efforts, and are not funded with SBIR/STTR funds. Under Phase III, companies participating in the SBIR/STTR Program are expected to obtain funding from the private sector and/or non-SBIR/STTR government sources to develop the prototype into a viable product or non-R&amp;D service for sale in military and/or private sector markets.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The DoD Office of Small Business Programs is tasked with providing Departmental SBIR/STTR policy guidance, oversight and implementation and therefore requires program element (PE) 0605790D8Z to fund these administrative activities. In addition to funding costs for program administration, coordination and execution, PE 0605790D8Z funds essential elements of the SBIR/STTR Program that are required by law including: 
(1) Coordinate and execute the administrative portions of the DoD SBIR/STTR Programs including the development of technical topics, preparation of SBIR/STTR R&amp;D solicitations and receipt of proposal responses; 
(2) Maintain and modify automated processes across the entire SBIR/STTR lifecycle including the development and maintenance of information systems and software required for the measurement, evaluation, and effective management of the Department's SBIR/STTR Programs; 
(3) Implement an aggressive outreach program including the execution of two National conferences and outreach to small technology companies, potential investors in such companies, SDBs WOSBs, Institutions of Higher Learning and others, to facilitate participation in the SBIR/STTR Programs; 
(4) Coordinate oversight, collect results, track execution and provide reporting of Phase II technology transition in the DoD SBIR Commercialization Pilot  and Commercialization Readiness Program (CPP/CRP); and

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD(R&amp;E)) is the principal staff advisor to the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology &amp; Logistics (USD(AT&amp;L)) and the Secretary and Deputy Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (R&amp;E) matters.  In this capacity, the ASD(R&amp;E) has the responsibility to conduct analyses and studies; develop policies; provide technical leadership, oversight and advice; make recommendations; and issue guidance for DoD R&amp;E programs.  Additionally, the ASD(R&amp;E) provides technical support to the USD(AT&amp;L) on R&amp;E aspects of programs subject to review by the Defense Acquisition Board, to include assessments of technology maturity consistent with DoD acquisition policy.  The mission of the DoD R&amp;E program is to create, demonstrate, prototype, and apply technology that enables affordable and decisive military superiority.  Pursuing the R&amp;E mission requires attention to:  (1) identification and development of new technological opportunities; (2) insertion of new technologies into warfighting systems and operations; and (3) management and evaluation of the effectiveness of technology programs.  This program element (PE) provides mission support to the Office of the ASD(R&amp;E) (OASD(R&amp;E)) covering a wide range of studies and analysis in support of the R&amp;E program and it impacts the Department's decision to fund Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) efforts.  

The PE provides funding for the Defense Laboratory Office within the OASD(R&amp;E)).  The Defense Laboratory Office advocates and invests in the DoD laboratory system in three areas:  (1) facilities and infrastructure; (2) quality of workforce; and (3) global insight of critical or strategic technologies important to the Department and the Nation.

The PE provides engineering, scientific, and analytical support to the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research in its responsibility for direction, overall quality, and content of the science and technology (S&amp;T) program and ensures that the technology being developed is affordable and minimizes system development risk.  The Defense Technology Analysis program conducts assessments and analysis to ensure maximum utilization of research and development funds to accomplish the overall objectives of the S&amp;T program.  Funds are required for technical, analytical and management support, equipment and supplies, travel, and publications.

The DoD's key expertise for reviewing and guiding R&amp;E programs resides in the OASD(R&amp;E).  The OASD(R&amp;E) staff augment their responsibilities through their connections to technology experts in various fields throughout academia, industry, and government.  The Defense Support Teams project supports the directed responsibilities by building teams of technology experts to conduct program technical assessments.  The teams analyze the key engineering problem areas and offer adjustments in the development and test plan; alternate technical approaches; or new technologies that could enable successful development.  The teams provide unbiased reviews and gather advice from the Nation's leading technical experts.

The PE provides funding for Critical Technology Assessments within OASD(R&amp;E).  Critical Technology Assessments provide the technical reference guidance in support of development and implementation of DoD technology security policies on international transfers of defense related goods, services, and technologies.  The program provides an ongoing assessment and analysis of global goods and technologies; determines significant advances in the development, production, and use of military capabilities by potential adversaries; and determines goods and technologies being developed worldwide with potential to significantly enhance or degrade U.S. military capabilities in the future.  

This PE also provides funding for the Data Vulnerability Tiger Team to establish a joint analysis capability to conduct comprehensive assessments of unclassified information losses, engaging acquisition and intelligence sources to determine consequences and appropriate preventative/mitigation actions.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Specific activities include:
- Monitor and assess dual-use and military technologies worldwide.
- Assist in the development of proposals for negotiation in various multilateral export control regimes.
- Provide limited worldwide technology capability assessments for the MCTL and other U.S. international critical technologies efforts.
- Identify and determine technical parameters for proposals for international control of weapons of mass destruction.
- Identify foreign technologies of interest to the DoD and opportunities for international cooperative research and development.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (OASD(R&amp;E)) sponsored a study to investigate the desirability of changing the export-control-based purpose of the critical technology assessment program to a broader purpose that would support the broader OASD(R&amp;E) mission.  The study has reported out, recommending a more rigorous examination of information sources, best practices, and tools, to definitively determining the achievable benefits.</r2:Description>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>To date, most of the DOD technical information resides on unclassified networks that must take into account the risk of being targeted for cyber espionage campaigns.  Protecting DoD unclassified controlled technical information is a high priority for the Department and is critical to preserving intellectual property and competitive capabilities of our national industrial base.  To maintain full confidence in our systems we must also assess the effect the loss of this information has on our warfighting capabilities. DoD contractors who produce or access controlled technical information must incorporate security standards on their networks, and report cyber-intrusion incidents that result in the loss of this information.  These requirements are important, but insufficient in the face of a determined adversary.  We must take steps to understand the loss and rethink how we safeguard our capabilities.  This information, while unclassified, includes data and intellectual property concerning defense systems requirements, concepts of operations, technologies, designs, engineering, systems production and component manufacturing.

This project supports protection of unclassified controlled technical information and analysis of losses to determine consequences and appropriate requirements, acquisition, programmatic, and strategic courses of action.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) establishes the dedicated funding line to carry out the duties as described in Title 10 US Code, Section 139, the Weapons Systems Acquisition Reform Act of 2009.  The Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Development Test and Evaluation (DASD(DT&amp;E)) is the principal advisor to the Secretary of Defense, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (USD(AT&amp;L)) and the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD(R&amp;E)) on Development Test and Evaluation (DT&amp;E) in the Department of Defense (DoD).

The Development Test and Evaluation (DT&amp;E) program element is budgeted in the Research Development Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) budget activity to support and improve the DT&amp;E efforts of Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP), Major Automated Information System (MAIS), and other Special Interest (SI) acquisition programs designated by Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (USD(AT&amp;L)); as they progress through the acquisition/development lifecycle; assess the DT&amp;E capabilities of the Military Departments and Department of Defense (DoD) Components; oversee the Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) career field of the defense acquisition workforce; develop policy and guidance for the conduct of DT&amp;E within the DoD; and prepare the annual DT&amp;E report to Congress.

The Department of Operational Energy Plans and Programs (DOEPP) Project 806 is funded within this program element for technical analysis and policy guidance for the DoD operational energy programs and initiatives, including institutionalizing energy in DoD’s business processes (e.g., Fully Burdened Cost of Fuel and the Energy Efficiency Key Performance Parameters (KPPs)).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides for the assessment of the Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&amp;E) efforts of each Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP), Major 
Automated Information System (MAIS), and Special Interest (SI) acquisition programs as designated by USD(AT&amp;L).  It also provides for the assessment of DT&amp;E capabilities of the Military Departments and Department of Defense (DoD) Components, oversees the Test &amp; Evaluation (T&amp;E) career field of the defense acquisition workforce, develops policy and guidance for the conduct of DT&amp;E within DoD, and produces the annual DT&amp;E report to Congress.  Specific activities include the following:

- Work with MDAP/MAIS/SI Program Managers to develop a comprehensive DT&amp;E strategy that supports acquisition decision milestones.  Ensure that the test strategy beginning at Milestone A, is documented in the Test and Evaluation Master Plans (TEMPs).  The Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (DASD) DT&amp;E also approves or disapproves the developmental test and evaluation plans in the TEMPs.
- Coordinate with the Director of Systems Engineering (SE) to ensure that the DT&amp;E activities of the DoD are fully integrated into, and consistent with, the systems 
engineering and development planning processes of the Department.
- Provide formal DT&amp;E Assessments prior to major milestone decisions to inform the acquisition decision-makers on the readiness of programs to release the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Request For Proposal (RFP) (pre MS B) and begin production (MS C) with the goal of reducing discovery of performance issues later in the acquisition cycle. 
- Develop policy and guidance to ensure efficient and effective DT&amp;E across DoD, including policy and guidance for developmental testing of interoperability and 
information assurance in coordination with the Joint Staff and DoD Chief Information Officer (CIO).
- Provide DT&amp;E assessments in support of Nunn-McCurdy certification review teams, and the Director, Performance Assessment and Root Cause Analysis 
(PARCA).
- Review the organizations and capabilities of the military departments with respect to developmental test and evaluation and identify needed changes or 
improvements to such organizations and capabilities, and provide input regarding needed changes or improvements for the test and evaluation strategic plan 
developed by Test Resource Management Center (TRMC).
-As the T&amp;E Functional Leader, establish, oversee, and maintain the education, training and experience requirements including competencies and certification 
standards to enhance T&amp;E acquisition workforce.  Monitor and facilitate Defense Acquisition University (DAU) updates of T&amp;E courses to ensure the curriculum 
supports the certification standards and provides the appropriate education and training.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program supports the Office of the Director, Cost Assessment &amp; Program Evaluation (CAPE).  It funds assessments that help to resolve budget and programmatic issues across the full range of the Department’s activities.  Projects that support this effort help to inform the leadership on program alternatives, capability concept development, design and cost, the appropriate balance of capabilities across the force, and also to identify how well the Department’s expenditures are meeting its goals, and how well the force can implement the Defense strategy.

This program provides for analytical research across a spectrum of  issues and concerns.  The research agenda is focused on near to long-term problems identified by the Secretary of Defense, and addresses difficult and complex questions linked to program alternatives for current and future capabilities and forces in order to enhance the senior leadership's deliberations and decision-making.

This program provides the scientific and technical engineering services needed for research studies in the development of models and simulations and the evaluation of current analytical tools and scientific methods used to evaluate and assess weapons systems and warfighting capabilities for warfighting environments and scenarios, and related force structure.  Deliverables from this program will include reports, briefings, and analyses designed to illuminate critical issues facing the Department.  Outcomes include recommendations for new modeling techniques, programmatic alternatives, and scenario development.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

It funds assessments that help to resolve budget and programmatic issues across the full range of the Department’s activities.  Projects that support this effort help to inform the leadership on program alternatives, capability concept development, design and cost, the appropriate balance of capabilities across the force, and also to identify how well the Department’s expenditures are meeting its goals, and how well the force can implement the Defense strategy.

This program provides for analytical research across a spectrum of  issues and concerns.  The research agenda is focused on near to long-term problems identified by the Secretary of Defense, and addresses difficult and complex questions linked to program alternatives for current and future capabilities and forces in order to enhance DoD senior leadership's deliberations and decision-making.

This program provides the scientific and technical engineering services needed for research studies in the development of models and simulations and the evaluation of current analytical tools and scientific methods used to evaluate and assess weapons systems and warfighting capabilities for warfighting environments and scenarios, and related force structure.  Deliverables from this program will include reports, briefings, and analyses designed to illuminate critical issues facing the Department.  Outcomes include recommendations for new modeling techniques, programmatic alternatives, and scenario development.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The effort explored and developed techniques to explicitly account for dependencies and the constraints imposed by spatial and temporal (space and time) separations distinguishing combatants.
• Assessed capacity needed within DoD, as well as the role of agencies and allies in a range of scenarios against Force Planning Construct of homeland defense, Force Readiness, irregular warfare/war on terror, and conventional conflict across steady state and surge environments.
• Assessed current capacity within DoD to quantitatively identify and assess alternatives to direct appropriations.
• Determined the contribution of DoD forces as part of a local, state, and federal interagency response to current and future homeland defense consequence management scenarios.
• Continued assessments for technologies and strategies for space and cyberspace security.
• In support of the Secretary’s commitment to eradicate sexual assault in the military, initiated a study to collect and analyze data from Service Military Criminal Investigative Organizations to assess the extent of the problem, with the objective of identifying potential development or expansion of programs to eliminate the problem.</r2:Text>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Operations Security (OPSEC) Initiative (DOSI) is an effort to reorient DoD OPSEC capabilities and capacities across the Department.  The overall program mission is to enable defense components ability to effectively plan, integrate, execute and assess OPSEC in concert with other information-related capabilities used against adversaries or potential adversaries.  Funds support the development and integration of capabilities and next generation technologies for department OPSEC activities. 

The objectives of the overall DOSI program are:

1. Establish governance structures, processes and procedures for development and oversight of infrastructure, policy, authorities, and warfighter advocacy across the defense components and for OPSEC intelligence integration that will focus on the incorporation of special intelligence requirements; intelligence and threat repository support; Open Source Intelligence, Human Intelligence, Counterintelligence (CI) and Signals Intelligence support; and intelligence support to Deception in Support of OPSEC (DISO).
2. Develop a concept for integrating OPSEC into critical plans, operations and activities that will clearly articulate OPSEC requirements and the means for fulfilling them.
3. Develop an integrated OPSEC education, training and exercise program that can be incorporated with MILDEC and other information-related capabilities and focus on exercise support and formal education curricula review and development.
4. Develop a technology and capability research, development, testing, and evaluation program to identify emerging physical, technical, and administrative means and capabilities.
5. Enhance the integration and synchronization of OPSEC with MILDEC to increase effectiveness and efficiency of defense component activities. 
6. Increase the integration of OPSEC with other information-related capabilities such as Electronic Warfare (EW), Computer Network Operations (CNO), Intelligence, CI, Security, and Special Technical Operations (STO) to form an enhanced integrated whole.
7. Establish assessment programs to assess friendly and adversary measures and countermeasures based on observable actions, indicators, or information that can provide a basis for identifying such control measures as Action Controls, Countermeasures, and Counter Analysis and for assessing revised policy, doctrine, force structure, training and governance processes to identify corrective actions.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

- This program is a part of the overall Department effort to implement best practices and DoD doctrinal processes which require shared responsibility and close synchronization among intelligence, operations and associated planning elements. Joint Warfighter requirements are driving the need for the integration of capabilities across intelligence disciplines and seamlessly connecting them to operational capabilities/capacities.
- The objective of this program is the rapid experimentation and development of existing technologies (hardware, software, databases, analytics, etc.) to create new cyber intelligence capabilities and demonstrate their value in support of operations.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>These programs support readiness of the joint force by creating a Joint Training Environment to replicate the complex, and ever changing operational environment.   These investments directly support the new defense strategy and enhance joint warfighting readiness by building training capabilities that support the operational readiness of the force. The elements associated with this coordinated effort consist of:

- Joint National Training Capability (JNTC)
- Joint Simulation System (JSS)
- Joint Knowledge Development &amp; Distribution Capability (JKDDC)
- U.S. Forces Korea Training &amp; Exercise Support (USFK)
- Air Force JNTC
- Navy JNTC

JNTC:  Investment in the Joint National Training Capability (JNTC) program will enable Service and Combatant Commands (CCMD)  to train as they operate.  This investment will develop a cloud-enabled joint training environment, building on previous development of Scenario Management Tools for planning and executing joint training.  In 2016, this investment will enable access at the point of need (Service and CCMD trainers) for planning and executing joint training.  This investment will increase the relevance and realism of training by providing training capabilities which replicate the contemporary and future operating environment.  This program also enables the Department of Defense (DOD) to be responsive to the warfighters’ pace of changing operational concepts, threat environments, and best practices.

JSS:  The Joint Simulation System (JSS) will decompose, harvest, and reuse DoD investment in joint simulations to develop cloud-enabled modular services (CEMS), reaching Initial Operating Capability in FY16.  JSS will enhance existing Joint Conflict and Tactical Simulation (JCATS) and Joint Theater Level Simulation (JTLS) to meet CCMDs’ training requirements.  JSS will provide design and development of web-based applications used as services in CEMS environment.

JKDDC:  Joint Knowledge Development &amp; Distribution Capability (JKDDC) Joint Knowledge Online (JKO) is the DOD unique and authoritative source for online joint training.  JKDDC JKO is tasked to develop a Joint Individual Training Toolkit of web-enabled individual and small group training products and services.  Products and services are developed in response to OSD(P&amp;R) CE2T2 Program Goals &amp; Objectives guidance, CJCS High Interest Training Items, Joint Staff J7 training priorities, and JKDDC JKO Stakeholder (CCMDs, Services, and Combat Support Agencies) prioritized training requirements.  JKDDC JKO supports a career-long joint learning continuum, joint professional military education, and tailored common training standards to Service members for tasks that are jointly executed, resulting in trained, capable, and interoperable joint forces.  JKO research and development will improve:  
-  Small Group Scenario Trainer (SGST) desk top modeling and simulation based training: These capabilities train and prepare tens of thousands of military and civilian personnel deploying to CCMD theaters of operation prior to serving in their assigned Combined/Joint Task Force (C/JTF) billets. Specifically, C/JTF ‘battle staffs’ will be adequately trained, as individuals and the staffs collectively, based on SGST development and implementation throughout the joint training enterprise.  
-  JKO mobile “pilot” courseware training device development:  This facilitates the global distribution of web-based joint training content on portable, hand-held platforms.  
-  JKO Learning Management System (LCMS): JKO LCMS development is required to deliver JKO courses and track/report students’ completions more efficiently.  
-  Develop the future virtual worlds learning environment.  It will provide training and learning to promote adaptability and agility in the workforce through an interactive, immersive virtual gaming environment.
      
USFK:  The U.S. Forces Korea (USFK) Training &amp; Exercise Support program is developing simulations capable of satisfying all joint exercise training requirements in the Korean Theater of Operations.  Interoperability with the Republic of Korea-developed Korean Simulation System is a critical and unique requirement of this USFK RDT&amp;E program.  This solution will be capable of interoperating in a common battle space that realistically represents the operating environment to all levels of training audiences, tactical to strategic, in Korean theater exercises.  While supporting USFK’s specific requirements, this solution will contain enhancements that will benefit other combatant commander training programs that use the aging Joint, Live, Virtual, and Constructive (JLVC) simulations and the emerging JLVC 2020 simulations.

Air Force JNTC:  The Air Force JNTC funding is providing a focused upgrade to developing models for space based capabilities and integrated them into the JLVC environment.  The Air Force is also supporting development of cross domain solutions allowing for the linking of systems with differing security requirements, which significantly extend the breadth of the training audiences to additional joint and coalition participants.  

Navy JNTC:  These funds enable Navy to develop unique maritime capabilities that integrate LVC elements into a seamless joint training environment. Navy program activities include conducting research, development, test and evaluation, and cross-service architecture certification on joint-capable systems, developing cross-domain architectures for US and Coalition Forces as well as ensuring sister service modeling/simulation and instrumentation efforts follow a common unified standard.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                        <r2:Description>Initially established in 2003, JNTC continues to develop and integrate advanced training technologies into a seamless joint training environment.  JNTC establishes the overarching joint framework and context necessary for CCMDs and Services to achieve a joint training environment through an integrated network of training sites and nodes.  JNTC provides the common standards, architecture, and development processes required to link joint training programs.  By leveraging existing training programs or initiating specific actions, JNTC is developing credible opposing force capabilities and expanded access to assets typically unavailable to the training audience by developing and integrating modeled and simulated representations of these capabilities.  This furthers the integration of joint training objectives into Service training events, while capturing the objective data necessary to provide a complete and accurate after action review.  This program develops and enhances current and future joint training enterprise capabilities.</r2:Description>

JKDDC JKO is tasked to develop a Joint Individual Training Toolkit of web-enabled individual and small group training products and services.  Products and services are developed in response to OSD(P&amp;R) CE2T2 Program Goals &amp; Objectives guidance, CJCS High Interest Training Items, Joint Staff J7 training priorities, and JKDDC JKO Stakeholder (CCMDs, Services, and Combat Support Agencies) prioritized training requirements.  JKDDC JKO supports a career-long joint learning continuum, joint professional military education, and tailored common training standards to Service members for tasks that are jointly executed, resulting in trained, capable, and interoperable joint forces.  JKO research and development will improve:  
-  Small Group Scenario Trainer (SGST) desk top modeling and simulation based training: These capabilities train and prepare tens of thousands of military and civilian personnel deploying to CCMD theaters of operation prior to serving in their assigned Combined/Joint Task Force (C/JTF) billets. Specifically, C/JTF ‘battle staffs’ will be adequately trained, as individuals and the staffs collectively, based on SGST development and implementation throughout the joint training enterprise.  
-  JKO mobile “pilot” courseware training device development:  This facilitates the global distribution of web-based joint training content on portable, hand-held platforms.  
-  JKO Learning Management System (LCMS): JKO LCMS development is required to deliver JKO courses and track/report students’ completions more efficiently.  
-  Develop the future virtual worlds learning environment.  It will provide training and learning to promote adaptability and agility in the workforce through an interactive, immersive virtual gaming environment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

These capabilities facilitate the training and preparation of tens of thousands of military and civilian personnel deploying to CCMD theaters of operation prior to serving in their assigned C/JTF billets.  Specifically, C/JTF “battle staffs” will be adequately trained, as individuals and the staffs collectively, based on SGST development and implementation throughout the joint training enterprise.  JKO mobile “pilot” courseware training device development facilitates the global distribution of web-based joint training content on portable, hand-held platforms for joint warriors.  The JKO LCMS development is required to deliver JKO courses and track/report students’ completions more efficiently.  The future virtual worlds learning environment will provide training and learning to promote adaptability and agility in the workforce with the capability to tailor and adapt instructional material to fit the learner's strengths and weaknesses, learning style, and level of proficiency.</r2:Description>

This ensures the Joint Force Trainer capabilities development effort synchronizes with warfighter requirements.  Performance metrics include, but are not limited to; time, money, realism, and fidelity as defined below:

• Time – Will the effort enable the Joint Force Trainer to prepare and execute training more timely than current capabilities allow?
• Cost – Will the effort enable the Joint Force Trainer to prepare and execute training at a more effective and efficient cost than current capabilities allow?
• Realism – Will the effort enable the Joint Force Trainer to create a training environment that is closer to the real world environment than current capabilities allow?
• Fidelity – Will the effort enable the Joint Force Trainer to create more detailed capabilities in the training environment than current capabilities allow?

Measures:
• Multinational Aviation LVC Training System (MALTS) is the deployable Electronic Warfare (EW) system which will replicate opposing forces double digit surface to air missiles and advanced AAA threats for Europe and Africa.  This EW system is a critical cornerstone for Joint Forcible Entry Operations and for overcoming A2/AD challenges expected in the theaters.
• As the increased/enhanced EW training capability is used in LVC events, observations regarding better ways to use it, better ways to train, better ways to provide feedback to the training audience should be recorded and briefed back to the Warrior Preparation Center senior leadership.

Assisting Joint Staff and the Navy in developing Joint Cross Domain Information Sharing (JCDIS) Enterprise Network Architecture, which includes engineering, development, and deployment which will enable joint and coalition participants to train while classified information is segregated and protected, as required.
• Will install additional JCDIS enclave communications solutions at applicable Air Force Distributed Training Centers (multiple Training Programs) and supporting technical facilities.

Air Force is creating cyber-contested environments in the distributed mission operations setting to challenge the joint exercise/training audience.
• Adding cyber-contested environments will enhance existing LVC development environment to support exercises and training.

Air Force is developing comprehensive space effects which are being integrated into the JLVC federation of models.
• Integrating a fully operational Space Based Infrared System Missile Warning Simulator will allow space operators to actively participate in Distributed Mission Operations-Space LVC missile warning and Infrared special events.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

• Navy will produce one JSAF software release to include documentation; will design and implement upgrades to JSAF consistent with approved requirements and CRs and document the effects of JSAF capabilities (robustness) and stability.  Will design, implement, test, and integrate JSAF enhancements in accordance with requirements.

• Navy will produce one Navy Training Federation Object Model (FOM) (NTF) release to include applicable documentation updates for the Guidance, Rational, and Interoperability Manual (GRIM) and Federation Agreement document (FAD). Will implement JSAF capability enhancements to support evolving joint and Coalition training requirements.

• Navy will deliver a JSAF/JNTC-JLVC FOM interoperability Guide.

• Navy will facilitate integration by providing dedicated support to the effort, improving the quality of participation and documentation of Navy efforts in the JNTC.  Refine and mature the Navy Training Federation Object Model (NTF), it is improving interoperability and integration with other services and the Joint community.  Provides a standardized FOM for integration across the Navy training simulations.

• Navy’s current JLVC and other federation simulation distribution are accomplished by tying simulation data to multicast groups.  This is neither a scalable solution nor is it an effective one as federates are not able to publish and subscribe with fine enough precision.  The Simulation Aware Software Router will address this shortcoming, and additionally provide a flexible solution for federating heterogeneous networks and on-the-wire protocols without forcing all federates onto a single, uniform, lowest common denominator solution for each training event.  Ultimately, a simulation aware router will allow simulation users to optimize the network for both simulation scalable traffic and for voice and Command, Control, Communications, (Computers), Intelligence (C4I) traffic.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense-wide Industrial Base Analysis and Sustainment (IBAS) program element provides the Department with a comprehensive ability to achieve the strategic goal of strengthening the industrial base in support of DoD supply chain and defense manufacturing requirements. This program maintains or improves the health of essential parts of the defense industry to avoid reconstitution costs for capability after a Defense procurement hiatus on major investment programs or critical supply chain products where affordable and innovative mechanisms are available to work with the producers in the interim.

A stated purpose of the program is to provide for sustainment of the industrial base through a break in production.  Criteria for project selection will include factors such as 1) identifiable path of preservation, transformation or innovation between an existing capability and a capability with a very high probability of being needed in the short to medium term (&lt; 5 years); 2) loss of the capability is likely in the absence of the proposed project; 3) analysis showing that the project results in a lower overall cost to the department than if capability is developed from scratch when needed; and 4) preference is given to projects supporting multiple programs or services with no clearly identifiable principle beneficiary.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

These tools collaboratively identify elements of the industrial base where current acquisition programs will not invest enough in production and/or research to support the minimum sustaining rate that would keep critical suppliers viable.  While industrial base risks identified through these assessment tools are to be mitigated primarily through direct engagement with military departments, agencies, and industry, exceptional cases will require defense-wide intervention via investment accounts, often in collaboration with multiple Services and agencies, to ensure adequate industrial capability to support future defense needs.

This funding is a key tool for addressing supply chain risks and diminishing manufacturing sources.  Investments are prioritized though a careful analysis at every tier of the supply chain according to a numerical scale of risk-area's fragility and criticality.  Criticality examines characteristics that make a specific product or service difficult to replace if disrupted; fragility examines characteristics that make small deviations in the status quo likely to have substantial effects on an industry / supplier.  These concepts underpin AT&amp;L’s core mission and inform critical investment, budgetary, and programmatic decision-making.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The purpose of investment is to sustain essential industrial production and design team capabilities. Projects will have impact across all industrial base sectors: aircraft; Command, Control, Communications and Computers (C4); missiles; ground vehicles; radar &amp; Electronic Warfare (EW) and others.  Projects will be improvements of existing capabilities with a very high probability of success.

IBS will include focused projects in the following critical areas in FY 2014: Butanetriol, a solid rocket fuel precursor chemical; Infrared Focal Plane Array; Advanced Solid Rocket Propulsion; Test Facilities for Radiation Hardened Electronics.  

With a decline in the procurement of missile programs, design and production skills for critical components within the missile sector industrial base are at risk which could result in costly delays and unanticipated expense. The loss of this design and production capability could have a significant impact on many current and future missile programs damaging the readiness of the Department.  The missile sector sustainment effort will improve the existing production process efficiencies, explore advanced materials for higher performance, and upgrade outdated technology for missile components.  FY 2014 and FY 2015 efforts will include the following important capabilities: high precision attitude control, thermal batteries; and fuzes.</r2:Description>

Butanetriol:  This project develops a qualified domestic source for Butanetriol (BT), a solid rocket fuel precursor chemical,that will preclude the necessity of procurement from a prohibited foreign source.  Since 2008, DoD’s projected requirements have shrunk to levels that substantially change the business case for development of new domestic source.  To re-enable the business case and develop a permanent domestic industrial base, DoD plans to fund a project to close the gap between the new and old business cases.

Infrared Focal Plane Array (IRFPA): This project focuses on sustaining a continuous production capability for the impending modernization program of Improved Forward Looking Infrared (I-FLIR).  There is a gap between the end of horizontal integration of FLIR and the slated start of I-FLIR modernization.  In order to bridge the gap, the Department plans to maintain the foundry capability and intellectual base of critical suppliers through time-phased lots of IRFPAs.

Advanced Solid Rocket Propulsion: To support future missile interceptor missions, advanced kill vehicle thrusters for high precision and long duration missions are required.  This is a defense-unique industrial base niche.  In order to maintain this capability and avoid the loss of skills and intellectual capital, the Department is executing a project to develop high precision attitude control.  

Test Facilities for Radiation Hardened Electronics: joint efforts with other DoD, Department of Energy, and the National Reconnaissance Office to maintain industrial base facilities that are capable of testing radiation hardened electronics.  Provides resources to cover a one-time FY 2014 funding gap.</r2:Text>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This This program addresses developing an integrated and interconnected CWMD capabilities-based system that defines and enables a comprehensive, global awareness and readiness for CWMD steady-state and surge postures. The diverse and complex Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) – nuclear, biological and chemical threats – mission space requires an integrated approach towards capability development. Capability development must be based on a systems perspective that links strategic objectives with interrelated tasks and associated capabilities. The broad CWMD military strategic objectives and mission areas encompass many nontraditional capabilities for the Warfighter, and CWMD is not an isolated mission set unique to DoD – it is intertwined with counter-terrorism and homeland defense. Accordingly, developing an overall CWMD capability should and must leverage complementary capabilities through integration and synchronization. A global CWMD situational awareness capability will be established and deployed worldwide via current communications systems and common operating pictures in support of this mission.  This program will incorporate portfolio management tools and comprehensive analyses to enable a balanced and integrated CWMD systems portfolio, an optimized CWMD force structure, and the integration with and utilization of existing military assets to fill intelligence, sensor and reconnaissance gaps in CWMD.

This PE will fund development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or provide planned product improvements.

This Program Element can fund travel to support the requirements of this program.

This appropriation will finance work, including manpower, performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant arrangement with the government who conduct research (systematic study directed toward fuller scientific knowledge or understanding of the subject studied), development (systematic use of the knowledge and understanding gained from research, for the production of useful materials, devices, systems, or methods, including the design and development of prototypes and processes) and test and evaluation efforts.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Critical Infrastructure Program (DCIP) is a Department of Defense (DoD) risk management program that seeks to ensure the availability of networked assets critical to DoD missions, to include DoD and non-DoD, domestic and foreign infrastructures essential to planning, mobilizing, deploying, executing, and sustaining United States military operations on a global basis.  Through identifying Defense Critical Assets, assessing them to determine vulnerabilities, incorporating specific threat and hazard information and analysis, and visually displaying relevant infrastructure data and analysis, DoD will be positioned to make risk management decisions to ensure the appropriate infrastructure is available, when needed, to support DoD missions.

Specifically, Combatant Commands (COCOMs) are responsible for identifying the mission capability requirements and coordinating with the Military Departments, Defense Agencies, DoD Field Activities, and Defense Sector Lead Agents to identify and assess Defense Critical Assets. As asset owners and capability providers, the Secretaries of the Military Departments and the Directors of Defense Agencies and DoD Field Activities, coordinate with the COCOMs to identify and prioritize the assets required to support mission-essential functions. Asset owners will also assess identified Defense Critical Assets to identify vulnerabilities and apply appropriate remediation and mitigation measures. The Defense Sector Lead Agents are responsible for identifying the specific functions, systems, assets (DoD and non-DoD owned), and interdependencies within the Defense Sector infrastructure networks supporting the identified critical missions.

Each Defense Sector Lead Agent, as identified in DoDD 3020.40, represents one of ten (10) functional areas that provide support to the Combatant Commanders and asset owners.

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Defense Critical Infrastructure Program (DCIP) is a Department of Defense (DoD) risk management program that seeks to ensure the availability of networked assets critical to DoD missions, to include DoD and non-DoD, domestic and foreign infrastructures essential to planning, mobilizing, deploying, executing, and sustaining United States military operations on a global basis.  Through identifying Defense Critical Assets, assessing them to determine vulnerabilities, incorporating specific threat and hazard information and analysis, and visually displaying relevant infrastructure data and analysis, DoD will be positioned to make risk management decisions to ensure the appropriate infrastructure is available, when needed, to support DoD missions.

Specifically, Combatant Commands (COCOMs) are responsible for identifying the mission capability requirements and coordinating with the Military Departments, Defense Agencies, DoD Field Activities, and Defense Sector Lead Agents to identify and assess Defense Critical Assets. As asset owners and capability providers, the Secretaries of the Military Departments and the Directors of Defense Agencies and DoD Field Activities, coordinate with the COCOMs to identify and prioritize the assets required to support mission-essential functions. Asset owners will also assess identified Defense Critical Assets to identify vulnerabilities and apply appropriate remediation and mitigation measures. The Defense Sector Lead Agents are responsible for identifying the specific functions, systems, assets (DoD and non-DoD owned), and interdependencies within the Defense Sector infrastructure networks supporting the identified critical missions.

Each Defense Sector Lead Agent, as identified in DoDD 3020.40, represents one of ten (10) functional areas that provide support to the Combatant Commanders and asset owners. These functional areas are as follows:  defense industrial base (DIB); financial services; global information grid (GIG); health affairs; intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR); logistics; personnel; public works; space; and transportation.  

In addition, DCIP manages specific analytic efforts in the identification and maintenance of specific inter- and intra-dependencies DpD has on the foundational commercial infrastructure networks supporting the identified critical missions.  Specific analytic efforts are focused within six (6) commercial infrastructure areas:  energy (electric power, natural gas); chemicals; transportation; telecommunications; water; and petroleum, oil, lubricants (POL).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The LTC Program will provide rigorously analyzed competitive strategy recommendations to these senior DoD leaders, and will require the support of organizations and experts outside of government to deliver the highest quality analysis, concepts and recommendations.  Funding for the LTC program will be used to: bring outside experts into Task Force working groups and strategy review teams; contract studies; support wargaming and workshops; conduct analytical studies of key developments and dynamics, and their impact on the future security environment and U.S. military capabilities in that environment; and explore new approaches to addressing key analytical requirements.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Funds will be used to provide technical analysis, systems engineering and capability management oversight of programs, projects, initiatives and activities to maximize the Department’s return on investment in information technology resources and affect a comprehensive approach for assessing and procuring critical information systems from initial design, through development to capability delivery in support of improved systems performance and military operations. Emphasis is placed on the information transport, information assurance, network and spectrum management, command and control (C2) applications, systems and services, information sharing capabilities, and enterprise services activities focused on the development, integration, testing and technical assessment of capabilities and applications in joint and coalition warfighter support environments.  Resources support collaborative efforts to demonstrate the interoperability and performance requirements of command, control, communication, computing network, and Information Infrastructure (C4II) capabilities and programs.  This program is funded under Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development.  

     This project provides the resources necessary to implement net centric processes and authoritative analytic methods that provide the capability to synchronize interdependent C4II capabilities across all layers (ground, air, space) of the joint information environment architecture, to forecast and achieve a balance in supply and demand for network capacity, and field effective capabilities more rapidly and efficiently as an enabler for C4&amp;II capabilities applications and services.  Resources are required to transform current networks and information infrastructure into an operationally unified and architecturally diverse joint information environment that will provide end-to-end communications transport layer, computing networks, and mission application capabilities that are optimized and integrated with all other joint capability areas with a focus on the tactical edge faced with disconnected, intermittent, and latency (DIL) environments.  There will be technical assessments, modeling and simulation, and analysis of the Joint space communications layer, Joint aerial network layer, contested communications on the move, Position Navigation and Timing (PNT), C2 mission application, and information sharing capabilities.  These funds provide the capability for the warfighter to manage and deconflict radio frequencies through ground, air, and space communication networks.  The funds will be used to develop and synchronize information assurance capabilities with other joint information environment capabilities to provide secure access to information and services (e.g. Cryptographic Modernization Management plan).  
     In addition, funding will continue to be used to support the Defense Information System's Agency's (DISA) and Services' interoperable improvement efforts and processes in the development of common standards and protocols.  This effort includes initiating the Joint Interoperability Enhancement Process (IEP) that allows operators, engineers, and program managers to verify capabilities and identify issues in a design with Joint /Allied units prior to system fielding, or with fielded systems to identify required systems changes for systems upgrade planning.  DISA and the Joint Forces Combatant Command lead the effort to transform the current standards and interoperability management tools to a common set of Joint network-enabled standards to ensure adherence to the Global Information Grid (GIG) enterprise-wide technical baseline and for implementation of future Tactical Data Link (TDL) capabilities. These joint standards, protocols, and processes will be used for implementation and testing to ensure the TDL capabilities are synchronized with the development and integration timelines of other planned network-enabled Global Information Grid (GIG) initiatives.  The threats to the networking waveforms and the Joint NC migration will also be looked at in cooperation with the Intelligence agencies.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Funds will be used to provide technical analysis, systems engineering and capability management oversight of programs, projects, initiatives and activities to maximize the Department’s return on investment in information technology resources and affect a comprehensive approach for assessing and procuring critical information systems from initial design, through development to capability delivery in support of improved systems performance and military operations. Emphasis is placed on the information transport, information assurance, network and spectrum management, command and control (C2) applications, systems and services, information sharing capabilities, and enterprise services activities focused on the development, integration, testing and technical assessment of capabilities and applications in joint and coalition warfighter support environments.  Resources support collaborative efforts to demonstrate the interoperability and performance requirements of command, control, communication, computing network, and Information Infrastructure (C4II) capabilities and programs.  This program is funded under Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development.  

     This project provides the resources necessary to implement net centric processes and authoritative analytic methods that provide the capability to synchronize interdependent C4II capabilities across all layers (ground, air, space) of the joint information environment architecture, to forecast and achieve a balance in supply and demand for network capacity, and field effective capabilities more rapidly and efficiently as an enabler for C4&amp;II capabilities applications and services.  Resources are required to transform current networks and information infrastructure into an operationally unified and architecturally diverse joint information environment that will provide end-to-end communications transport layer, computing networks, and mission application capabilities that are optimized and integrated with all other joint capability areas with a focus on the tactical edge faced with disconnected, intermittent, and latency (DIL) environments.  There will be technical assessments, modeling and simulation, and analysis of the Joint space communications layer, Joint aerial network layer, contested communications on the move, Position Navigation and Timing (PNT), C2 mission application, and information sharing capabilities.  These funds provide the capability for the warfighter to manage and deconflict radio frequencies through ground, air, and space communication networks.  The funds will be used to develop and synchronize information assurance capabilities with other joint information environment capabilities to provide secure access to information and services (e.g. Cryptographic Modernization Management plan).  
     In addition, funding will continue to be used to support the Defense Information System's Agency's (DISA) and Services' interoperable improvement efforts and processes in the development of common standards and protocols.  This effort includes initiating the Joint Interoperability Enhancement Process (IEP) that allows operators, engineers, and program managers to verify capabilities and identify issues in a design with Joint /Allied units prior to system fielding, or with fielded systems to identify required systems changes for systems upgrade planning.  DISA and the Joint Forces Combatant Command lead the effort to transform the current standards and interoperability management tools to a common set of Joint network-enabled standards to ensure adherence to the Global Information Grid (GIG) enterprise-wide technical baseline and for implementation of future Tactical Data Link (TDL) capabilities. These joint standards, protocols, and processes will be used for implementation and testing to ensure the TDL capabilities are synchronized with the development and integration timelines of other planned network-enabled Global Information Grid (GIG) initiatives.  The threats to the networking waveforms and the Joint NC migration will also be looked at in cooperation with the Intelligence agencies.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Research and Development will provide increased intelligence information sharing capabilities in support of US and coalition forces utilizing the US BICES and NATO virtual networks within the Afghanistan theater and provide increased database information via Distributed Common Ground System - Army.  Provides an increase in intelligence disciplines (Imagery Intelligence, Signal Intelligence, and potential Human Intelligence ) in support of US and Allied/Coalition forces that currently is very limited to the warfighter.  Increased intelligence advanced analytics tools will be migrated from Joint Intelligence Operations Center-IT and DI2E developments and will significantly increase the timeliness of intelligence and bring US BICES/NATO Special Operations Forces Headquarters/NATO Intelligence Fusion Center capabilities into the current technology baselines.  Develops and provides a federated TNE that incorporates the Asian Pacific Intelligence Information Network being developed to support the National Defense Strategy as we transition out of Afghanistan and into the Pacific.  Provides multi-level security intelligence bi-laterals and multi-laterals to meet Combatant Commander Integrated Priority Lists.  Develops the Coalition Partner Network for CENTCOM, the Coalition Information Exchange Network for SOUTHCOM, and the Coalition Partner Network for EUCOM and AFRICOM.   Develops the US BICES connections with these bi-lateral and multi-lateral federated TNEs that make up the US BICES-X Enterprise Network in support of Commander SOCOM requirements for conventional and coalition operations as the US migrates into other Combatant Command regions.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                                                <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Assessment and Analysis - Can it easily be adapted or adjusted to meet the current or projected capabilities gap for Allied or Coalition Intelligence Information Sharing and for the Intelligence integration into the Future Mission Network.  
Realism – Allows exploration of new environments and capabilities through participation in exercise environments that utilize bi-lateral and multi-lateral intelligence enterprise solutions such as US BICES-X.
Advancement - Increases the current capabilities for the sharing of intelligence information and determines if it actually adds functionality in support of Combatant Commanders requirements through exercises such as Unified Vision, Enterprise Challenge, and the MAJIIC (multi-sensor aerospace ground joint intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance interoperability coalition) exercises. 
Utility - Can it be integrated into the existing national or multinational architectures in a timely and cost effective manner and does it increase the discovery and dissemination of intelligence information to the Allies or Coalition forces.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>
