                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) is a Department of Defense (DoD) Combat Support Agency responsible for ensuring the integrity of the government contracting process and providing a broad range of acquisition management services.  DCMA’s contract management mission provides contract administration services (CAS) to our military services worldwide and contingency contract support in theater.  DCMA provides CAS on more than 324,000 prime contracts being performed at more than 18,500 contractor locations.  The face value of these agency-managed contracts exceeds $1,963 billion, and the agency manages more than one million financial transactions annually to authorize disbursement of approximately $155 billion.  DCMA performs its mission through the employment of Information Technology Systems  most of which allow internal DCMA and external DCMA users to collect, aggregate, and analyze DoD contract information.  Without investment in these systems DCMA would not be able to effectively administer and report on the health on the contracts and contractor’s performing the work.

DCMA’s strategic vision is to be DoD's leading experts in Quality Assurance; Cost, Schedule and Supply Chain Predictability; and Contract Administration; enabling our military service and DoD Agency partners to achieve contract objectives.  Their ability to achieve contract objectives in a timely and effective manner in part hinges on DCMA’s ongoing efforts to continualy enhance and modernize its Information Technology portfolio in order to research, develop, and  implement either more efficient solutions or solutions that will provide our contract partners the ability to realize business process efficiencies.  With minimal investment in DCMA toolsets the Department has and can continue to realize efficiencies not just with DCMA but tremendous efficiensies through effective, standardized contract management.  

DCMA is continuously executing a strategy to modernize and consolidate all web-based applications in concert with a new Enterprise Architecture framework that adheres strictly to the Business Enterprise Architecure (BEA). Investment in newer modern technologies that utilize business process driven frameworks will greatly improve not only the quality of the DCMA contract information but allow DCMA to realize internal process efficiencies. The web-based capabilities support DCMA's unique mission and provide cross functional capabilities that support the full range of acquisition and contract management. The capabilities help DCMA acquisition workforce access real time data; thus, enabling them to make sound contract management and business decisions. The objective behind the web-based capabilities is to provide mission-effective and efficient solutions to unique sets of problems that slow down or hinder performance based contract management for DCMA and other DoD support components. 

FY 2013 Actual:  In FY 2013($11.574) DCMA enabled real time dashboard reporting and alerts for critical mission, financial and business support areas; streamlined Contract Administration processes and interfaces improving data exchange across the DoD Acquisition Enterprise; improved resource allocation through workload visualization, resource compliance, skill set identification, and technology requirements; and helped to increase DoD’s buying power through Procurement Contracting Officer (PCO) visibility of contractor business systems, indirect expense rates and other negotiation information.

FY 2014-2015 Plan:  In FY 2014 ($13.812) and FY 2015 ($12.530) DCMA’s primary focus is centered on the reengineering of DCMA’s Contract Administration and Line of Service business processes and the toolsets that provide the needed capabilities.  Our goal is to streamline business processes and consolidate toolsets that enable those capabilities to reduce operations and sustainment costs for the Department and where applicable for DCMA.  In order to accomplish this goal DCMA will need to invest in the research, purchase, and development of the new capabilities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) is a Department of Defense (DoD) Combat Support Agency responsible for ensuring the integrity of the government contracting process and providing a broad range of acquisition management services.  DCMA’s contract management mission provides contract administration services (CAS) to our military services worldwide and contingency contract support in theater.  DCMA provides CAS on more than 324,000 prime contracts being performed at more than 18,500 contractor locations.  The face value of these agency-managed contracts exceeds $1,963 billion, and the agency manages more than one million financial transactions annually to authorize disbursement of approximately $155 billion.  DCMA performs its mission through the employment of Information Technology Systems  most of which allow internal DCMA and external DCMA users to collect, aggregate, and analyze DoD contract information.  Without investment in these systems DCMA would not be able to effectively administer and report on the health on the contracts and contractor’s performing the work.

DCMA’s strategic vision is to be DoD's leading experts in Quality Assurance; Cost, Schedule and Supply Chain Predictability; and Contract Administration; enabling our military service and DoD Agency partners to achieve contract objectives.  Their ability to achieve contract objectives in a timely and effective manner in part hinges on DCMA’s ongoing efforts to continualy enhance and modernize its Information Technology portfolio in order to research, develop, and  implement either more efficient solutions or solutions that will provide our contract partners the ability to realize business process efficiencies.  With minimal investment in DCMA toolsets the Department has and can continue to realize efficiencies not just with DCMA but tremendous efficiensies through effective, standardized contract management.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                        <r2:Description>DCMA is executing a strategy to modernize and consolidate all web-based applications in concert with a new Enterprise Architecture framework that adheres strictly to the Business Enterprise Architecure (BEA). Investment in newer modern technologies that utilize business process driven frameworks will greatly improve not only the quality of the DCMA contract information but allow DCMA to realize internal process efficiencies. The web-based capabilities support DCMA's unique mission and provide cross functional capabilities that support the full range of acquisition and contract management. The capabilities help DCMA acquisition workforce access real time data; thus, enabling them to make sound contract management and business decisions. The objective behind the web-based capabilities is to provide mission-effective and efficient solutions to unique sets of problems that slow down or hinder performance based contract management for DCMA and other DoD support components.</r2:Description>

Also, DCMA is planning to develop solutions for using enterprise actionable data in a mobile environment; and to explore the use of Virtual Desktop Interface (VDI) for day-to-day operations that will support the mobility of the Agency.  Development and migration to IWMS and DCMA 360, which provides an integrated suite of DCMA collaborative web-applications, will be a major focus in the future as well and the development of an Enterprise Surveillance Plan tool that will analyze technical requirements and contract risk, and determine surveillance requirement.   In addition DCMA will start reengineering Contract Administration and Line of Service business processes.</r2:Text>
