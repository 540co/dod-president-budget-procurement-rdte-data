            <proc:Description>The Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense (AMD) supports the Field Surveillance Program (FSP), PAC-3 Missile Support Center (P3MSC), International Engineering Services Program (IESP), Integrated Logistics Support (ILS), and System Engineering Program Management (SEPM) activities. The mission of the PATRIOT Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) Missile Field Surveillance Program (FSP) is required to ensure that the reliability, performance, and safety of fielded PAC-3 missiles remain within the classified system specification for the life of the system.  Initial FSP tasks confirmed the quality of design, materials, procedures, and processes used in the manufacture of the system.  After missile deployment, results from surveillance firings, inspections, functional tests, Storage and Aging Programs, and depot level missile maintenance processing provide the data required for the assessment of reliability, performance, and safety of the missile stockpile. This includes PAC-3 missile tooling and test equipment. The PAC-3 missile is fielded under the Certified Round Concept.  Under this approved concept, the PAC-3 missile is capable of being placed in extended storage as part of war reserve stocks or deployed in operational units for variable periods and then fired without intervening tests or checkouts.  In accordance with the Certified Round Concept, the reliability/performance of the missile is certified by the Lower Tier Project Office (LTPO) to be at an acceptable level for a stated period of time.

The certification of reliability is made possible through the use of the PAC-3 Missile Support Center (P3MSC) contract to use technical support and knowledge of the testing of discrete lots of component parts, subassemblies and assemblies which the prime contractor Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control (LMMFC) provides as the only source of technical knowledge, expertise, and facilities to perform FSP activities and process PAC-3 missiles.

The PATRIOT International Engineering Services Program provides continuing engineering support for system software and hardware for the life of the PATRIOT Air Defense System for US and international partners. The Engineering Services Program is designed to sustain, maintain, and improve the PATRIOT system within the performance envelope described in the system specification. The support provided under this program includes PATRIOT software maintenance, Post Deployment Build 8/8.x(PDB-8/8.x), engineering support for PATRIOT peculiar hardware, government furnished equipment, logistics, technical data package, trainers, and integrated diagnostics support system. This is accomplished through the investigation, analysis, and development of solutions to identified problems. Modifications to hardware are engineered for manufacturing implementation and retrofit of fielded hardware through the modification process. The Dismounted Patriot Information Coordination Central (D-PICC) effort is an example of rehosting tactical Patriot software maintained via engineering services to a smaller, more mobile hardware configuration that will allow flexible, tailorable deployment options by freeing up Battalion level ICC's.

Procurement funded systems engineering and project management support the PATRIOT Weapon System.  This support encompasses the overall planning, direction, and control of the production of the system/program, including functions of logistics engineering and Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) management, e.g., maintenance support, facilities, personnel, training, testing, and fielding.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY17 base procurement dollars in the amount of $126.470 million supports the Field Surveillance Program (FSP), PAC-3 Missile Support Center (P3MSC), International Engineering Services Program (IESP), Integrated Logistics Support (ILS), and System Engineering Program Management (SEPM) activities.

Funds in the program were realigned in FY2015 from C53101 (MSE) to reflect those requirements that are not unique to MSE.

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>The Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) missile evolved from the PATRIOT Advanced Capability 3 (PAC-3) missile.  The MSE is based on the PAC-3 Cost Reduction Initiative (CRI) missile design and improves on it for a higher performance, dual pulse, eleven-inch diameter Solid Rocket Motor (SRM) design, improved Lethality Enhancer, thermally hardened front end for longer fly out, upgraded batteries, enlarged fixed fins, more responsive control surfaces, and upgraded guidance software.  These improvements provide a more agile, lethal interceptor missile and coupled with critical ground system improvements (Radar Digital Processor (RDP) and Software) to provide a substantial missile performance improvement while enhancing Insensitive Munitions (IM) compliance.  A more IM compliant propellant for the SRM was developed for the MSE program as well as a less sensitive Lethality Enhancer.  A single canister design provides enhanced warfighter and logistics flexibility, and facilitates Insensitive Munitions (IM) compliance for greater warfighter safety. The MSE was developed to integrate with the PATRIOT system for the U.S. and international partners.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>The FY 2017 base procurement dollars in the amount of $423.201 million supports the production of 85 Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) missiles, Field Surveillance Program (FSP), supporting equipment such as missile round trainers, empty round trainers, ancillary missile items, PAC-3 Missile Support Center (P3MSC) and Obsolescence, and System Engineering/Program Management (SE/PM).

Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) is 3376.

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.

*Unit prices reflect an assessed yearly FMS procurement of PAC-3 missile variants. In the event FMS procurements do not occur at this level, the budgeted missile unit price may not be achievable.

**Quantities will be procured at an optimized rate utilizing price advantage created through contract negotiation, FPIF contract ceiling liability reduction through price determination, other service procurement, and/or foreign military sales in a buy-to-budget procurement strategy.</proc:Justification>

                <proc:Description>This program supports the overall Air and Missile Defense (AMD) architecture and provides a robust intercept capability against Cruise Missiles (CM), Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) and Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar (RAM) threats for deployed forces.  The Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment 2 - Intercept (IFPC Inc 2-I) is a ground-based weapon system that will be designed to acquire, track, engage, and defeat UAS, CM, and RAM. The System will provide 360-degree protection and will simultaneously engage threats arriving from different azimuths. A block acquisition approach will be used to provide this capability. The Block 1 system will consist of an existing interceptor and sensor and development of fire control software and a Multi-Mission Launcher (MML) to support the UAS and CM mission. The IFPC Inc 2-I System will be compatible with the Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) Command and Control (C2) architecture. The IFPC Inc 2-I System will be transportable by Army common mobile platforms.

This budget line funds the acquisition of long-lead items required to support the production of the IFPC-Inc2-I system.</proc:Description>
                <proc:Justification>FY 2017 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $19.319 million support the acquisition of long-lead items required for the production of twelve (12) Multi-Mission Launchers (MMLs) beginning in the 4th quarter of FY 2018. Up to six (6) MMLs will be produced in the first lot of Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP) for fielding; up to six (6) test assets will be refurbished to production representative configuration for fielding.  FY 2017 funding is Advance Procurement.

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-81), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>The Laser HELLFIRE II and HELLFIRE Longbow air-to-ground missiles (all variants) provide attack helicopters and unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) with point-target precision strike capability to defeat heavy, advanced armor, individual hard point and non-traditional targets. HELLFIRE II Missiles use a semi-active laser terminal guidance and are the primary armament of the AH-64 Apache, OH-58 Kiowa Warrior, Army UAS and Special Operations aircraft.  The HELLFIRE II includes Electro-Optical Countermeasure capability, warhead improvements and an updated electronic fuze. The AGM-114R HELLFIRE II missile will be the single variant that replaces all other HELLFIRE II missile configurations (K/N/M/P) except HELLFIRE Longbow which has a millimeter wave seeker.  HELLFIRE II procurement funding supports the entire HELLFIRE II and HELLFIRE Longbow systems to include resolution of obsolescence, safety, insensitive munitions,  reliability, weapon integration activities, test sets, engineering changes and production issues.  This missile will be compatible on all current force UAS and rotary wing platforms.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2017 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $42.013 million support the procurement of 155 HELLFIRE II missiles.
 
FY 2017 OCO procurement dollars in the amount of $455.830 million supports the procurement of:    
      -  1,422 Missiles in support of the War Reserve shortage ($169.218M) 
      -  1,148 Missiles to be replaced based on combat expenditures through June 2015 ($136.612M)
         (includes: 323 Pre-deployment training expenditures; 189 Ongoing AFG Operations; 636 Ongoing IRQ Operations)
      -  1,485 Missiles FY17 Base-to-OCO Requirement ($150.000M)

The Army intends to convert any price advantage created through contract negotiations, other service procurement and/or Foreign Military Sales (FMS) into a buy-to-budget procurement strategy.

The historical Army Acquisition Objective was 34,292.
 
In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses and providing military support to civil authorities.</proc:Justification>

The production unit cost is based on all Services' base and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) quantity requirements known at this time.  Quantities include United States Air Force procurement, United States Navy procurement of tactical missiles and United States Army procurement of Hellfire II AGM-114R missiles.

See Exhibit P-5 for Unit Cost.  Unit cost may change based on quantities procured by all Services and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers.  

Based on contract structure all customers pay the same Unit Cost for the same configuration.</proc:OverallHistoryPlanningRemarks>

            <proc:Description>Javelin provides the United States Army and United States Marine Corps (USMC) a man-portable, fire-and-forget, medium-range missile with enhanced situational awareness and precision direct-fire effects to defeat armored vehicles, fortifications, and soft targets in a range of military operations.  Javelin has a high kill rate against a variety of targets at extended ranges under day/night, battlefield obscurants, adverse weather and multiple counter-measure conditions.  The system's soft launch feature permits firing from a fighting position or an enclosure.  Javelin uses a modular design to allow the system to evolve to meet changing threats and requirements via both software and hardware upgrades.  The system consists of a reusable Command Launch Unit (CLU) with a built-in-test (BIT), and a modular missile encased in a disposable launch tube assembly.  The system also includes training devices for tactical training and classroom training.  Javelin's fire-and-forget technology allows the gunner to fire and immediately take cover, to move to another fighting position, or to reload.   The Javelin provides enhanced lethality through the use of a tandem multi-purpose warhead which will defeat all known armor threats.  It is effective against both stationary and moving targets.  This system also provides defensive capability against attacking/hovering helicopters.  In current conflicts the CLU is being used as a stand-alone surveillance and target acquisition asset.  The Army is the lead for this joint program with the USMC.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2017 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $73.508 million support the procurement of 309 Missiles.

FY 2017 OCO procurement dollars in the amount of $15.567 million to support the COCOM requirement for unit equipment sets to deter potential adversaries and support the European Reassurance Initiative.  The procurement includes 83 missiles.

The estimated missile unit prices are based on combined United States Army, other services, and FMS procurements of 850 missiles per year.

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.

The Army intends to convert any price advantage created through contract negotiations, other service procurement, and/or foreign military sales into a buy-to-budget procurement strategy, or to implement a cost reduction Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) for G-Model missile.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>TOW missiles (BGM-71 Series) are combat proven missiles that provide heavy anti-armor/assault capability to the Army's Infantry Brigade Combat Teams (IBCT), the Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (SBCT) and the Bradley equipped Armor Brigade Combat Team (ABCT). TOW continues to be used consistently as the weapon of choice in precision combat engagements.  TOW missiles are the primary heavy anti-armor / assault missile for the U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) and 43 allied nations.  Warfighters employ TOW missiles against buildings and field fortifications taking advantage of the missile's inherent precise assault capability against such targets.													
TOW missiles are launched from a variety of combat systems in the active Army and Army National Guard including the Improved Target Acquisition System (ITAS), all infantry and cavalry variants of Bradley Fighting Vehicle Systems (BFVS), the Stryker Anti-Tank Guided Missile (ATGM) Light Armored Vehicle (LAV), and the M220A2 TOW 2 launcher.  The USMC employs the TOW missile from its ITAS launchers, ATGM, and AH-1W Cobra helicopters.  The TOW missile provides the warfighter with a highly lethal, cost effective, interoperable, multi-purpose weapon.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2017 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $64.922 million support the procurement of 595 missiles and the first year of a five-year (FY17-21) multi-year contract.

FY 2017 OCO includes $80.652 million to support the COCOM requirement for unit equipment sets to deter potential adversaries and support the European Reassurance Initiative.  The procurements include the 815 TOW missiles.																	
In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY08 National Defense Authorization Act, this item is necessary for use by the active components and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.

On the P-10A the End Item Quantity for FY17 shows a quantity of 1,410 which is the sum of the FY17 Base and FY17 OCO.  It should only show the FY17 Base which is 595.

On the P-10d the End Item quantity for FY17 shows 676 for the quantity and a Contract Forecast Date of 12/15/2016, these are incorrect. The correct FY17 Quantity should be 595 and the correct Contract Forecast Date should be 5/15/2017.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) rockets are surface-to-surface artillery rockets fired from the Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) and High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) launchers.  Dual GMLRS rockets provide 24/7, all-weather precision fires to engage both area and point targets at short, medium, and long ranges.  The U.S. Marine Corps also procures GMLRS rockets through the Army project office.  

The GMLRS Program consists of three separate increments.  GMLRS Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munition (DPICM) was the first increment.  It is a cluster munition that replaced the shorter range MLRS rockets to engage area or imprecisely located targets.  GMLRS DPICM Production was terminated in response to the June 2008 Department of Defense (DoD) Cluster Munitions Policy.  GMLRS Unitary is the second increment that utilizes a 200-pound high explosive warhead to engage point targets with limited collateral damage.  GMLRS Alternative Warhead (AW) was developed as a non-cluster munition replacement to GMLRS DPICM.  The Program completed the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase and entered full rate production in FY15.  The GMLRS AW rocket is 90% common with the Unitary variant.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2017 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $171.638 million supports the acquisition of 1068 GMLRS AW rockets for the United States Army. Army Procurement Objective is 43,560.

FY 2017 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $.450 million supports the acquisition of equipment and support to ensure Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Common Training Device alignment with the production configuration.

FY 2017 OCO includes $75.991 million to support the COCOM requirement for unit equipment sets to deter potential adversaries and support the European Reassurance Initiate.  The procurements include 698 GMLRS rockets.

All funding goes to the Active Component.

            <proc:Description>The Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) Low Cost Reduced Range Practice Rocket (RRPR) is the only live training rocket for High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) and M270/M270A1 MLRS Launcher units/crews.  RRPR meets a critical validated requirement for Active and National Guard HIMARS and M270A1 launcher units to achieve and maintain combat readiness.  HIMARS and M270A1 Battalions are organic and attached to modular Fires Brigades supporting Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs), Joint Expeditionary Force, and Joint Special Operations Force combatant commanders.  The training rocket has an inert payload section and blunt nose for inducing reduced range for use at multiple facilities in the United States and foreign countries.  

RRPRs are manufactured by Lockheed Martin in Camden, Arkansas and Letterkenny Munitions Center (LEMC) in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania.  LEMC provides an organic dual source producing no less than 20 percent of the fiscal year procurement quantity.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY2017 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $18.004 million support the procurement of 1704 RRPRs which are required to maintain the practice rocket inventory for Standards in Training Commission (STRC) requirements.

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.</proc:Justification>

                    <proc:OverallHistoryPlanningRemarks>Lockheed Martin is currently the industry source that is both facilitized and qualified to produce the Low Cost Reduced Range Practice Rocket (LCRRPR).  LEMC has been established as the organic source that is both facilitized and qualified to produce the LCRRPR.

Letterkenny Munitions Center (LEMC) provides an organic dual source producing no less than 20 percent of the fiscal year procurement quantity.

In FY 2015, multiple issues impacted the planned RRPR buy of 2,994 rockets resulting in a shortage of 1,626 rockets.  Efforts are currently underway to mitigate the shortfall and close the gap during FY 2016.

            <proc:Description>Lethal Miniature Aerial Missile System (LMAMS) is a single man-portable/operable, light-weight organic, beyond line-of-sight, precision guided, loitering aerial missile system capable of locating and engaging obscured and/or fleeting enemy targets who  otherwise cannot be engaged by typical direct fire weapon systems.  Front and Side Look High Resolution Electro-Optical (day) and Front Look Infrared (night) cameras allow the Warfighter to have “eyes on” the target for positive identification.  LMAMS’ Wave-Off capability allows the operator to wave-off or re-direct the LMAMS flight path up to seconds prior to impact if necessary.  The system is comprised of a fire control unit, launcher, missile, and a modular payload capable of high lethality against unprotected Combatant Personnel and Fractional Casualty against Personnel in Soft Skinned Vehicles.  Pre-flight Component Assembly and Storage allows operation within a matter of minutes.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>The PATRIOT Mods program implements critical capability, readiness and sustainability modifications to the weapon system and maintains Integrated Logistics Support.  Required modifications are identified through various means to include:  validated requirement documents such as the Capability Production Document (CPD) and the Operational Needs Statement (ONS); material changes supported by improved operational effectiveness as identified in the PATRIOT Product Improvement Program (PIP); material deficiencies identified in the field; obsolescence issues; emerging technologies; software improvements; crew interface and communication upgrades. 
 
PATRIOT Mods funding supports Reliability, Availability, and Maintainability (RAM) Mods; Recapitalization (RECAP); Battery Command Post/ Tactical Command System /Computer Software Module (BCP/TCS/CSM) Mod; the Combined Crypto Modification Phase I (CCMPI) upgrade; the Radar Digital Processor-Configuration (RDP-C) upgrade; the Air Defense Artillery (ADA) School Upgrades/ Training Aids, Devices, Simulators and Simulations (TADSS); PATRIOT Maintenance Trainer (PMT); PATRIOT Multi-Echelon Training (PMET); Reconfigurable Table Top Trainers (RT3); Assured Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT); Test Detachment; the Modern Manstation (MMS) upgrade; Enhanced Launcher Electronic Systems (ELES); SIPRNet/NIPRNet Access Point/Troposcatter (SNAP/TROPO), and Digital Sidelobe Canceller (DSLC).

RAM modifications provide resolution to field failures which are identified through component analysis, field data collection, obsolescence issues and emerging technologies which are prioritized based on readiness and Operations and Support (O&amp;S) impacts.  This effort includes the engineering, acquisition, qualification testing, installation, technical support and training device upgrades associated with modification and design changes which are essential to stabilize the system at the highest readiness posture available and reduction of O&amp;S.  Kit quantity is based on expected Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) to be applied to Major End Items (MEIs).  Quantities will be procured at an optimized rate utilizing price advantage created through contract negotiation, other service procurement, and/or foreign military sales into a buy-to-budget procurement strategy. 
 
Recapitalization (RECAP) Modifications include communication upgrades, Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV), and Depot Maintenance Plant Equipment (DMPE).  These modifications are synchronized within the RECAP program.  RECAP is a battalion set, resulting in a more supportable, reliable, and capable unit in the force.  Quantity represents 1 battalion a year. 

The Battery Command Post/Tactical Command System/Computer Software Module (BCP/TCS/CSM) effort continues the development of the Capabilities Development Document (CDD) required Battle Management, Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (BMC4I) capability to maintain compatibility with tactical software enhancements, while enhancing and improving the defense design and planning capabilities for the PATRIOT warfighter.  This includes systems engineering, software requirements, software design/code/test and independent validation and verification testing.  This effort also provides Integrated Logistics Support, required due to the large amount of Commercial Off The Shelf components, of the 62 Battery Command Posts and 17 Tactical Command Systems.  Additionally, this effort supports the BCP/TCS/CSM fielding upgrades for each PATRIOT Post Deployment Build update, as well as working obsolescence alleviation and engineering changes.  Efforts support updates for interoperability and supportability.  Note: Quantities procured and installed in prior years.

Combined Crypto Modification Phase I (CCMPI):  The planned PATRIOT communications upgrade program is a phased approach leveraging National Security Agency (NSA) mandated crypto updates, user generated requirements, (PATRIOT Data Information Link (PADIL) over IP), Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) communications, and communications hardware obsolescence mitigation efforts. This approach allows cost efficiencies and better business practices by synergizing these efforts.  CCMPI is fully funded and addresses the PAC-3 Capability Production Document (CPD) requirements including the crypto modernization, a limited PADIL over Internet Protocol (IP) capability, and 3011C multi-cast (protocol).  CCMPI installs a Black Station Clock Upgrade (BSCU) to allow for increased data rates; the Ruggedized iQ1000 (RiQ) for data processing and IP overlay; and interfaces for soldier provided SIPR/NIPR devices.  The CCMPI program also replaces KG-94A/194A encryptors with KIV-7M encryptors.

The Radar Digital Processor-Configuration (RDP-C) replaces obsolete digital processors with single rack commercial off-the-shelf based modern processors.  Battery Replaceable Units (BRUs) are reduced from 759 to 56 with 13 power supplies and 18 racks removed.  Benefits of the RDP-C include improvement in radar reliability, life cycle cost savings, and capability and growth potential through software improvements.  The RDP-C modification will enable full AN/TPX-57(v)1 Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) Mode 5 Level 1 and 2 and new Combat Identification capabilities.  The enhanced IFF capability allows for expanded target reports from the AN/TPX-57 which will include:  National Origin, Platform ID Number (PIN), and GPS position (Level 2).  The RDP-C is a prerequisite for migration to an IAMD Netted Sensor.  The RDP-C will support efforts to counter emerging threats and growth to the netted sensor concept.  This effort includes funding for kits and some spares.

The Air Defense Artillery (ADA) School Upgrades/Training Aids, Devices, Simulators and Simulations (TADSS) modification is necessary to upgrade school assets to Configuration 3.  Four Enhanced Launcher Electronics Systems (ELES) and four Radar Kits will complete the school upgrades.   

The PATRIOT Weapons System uses tactical equipment and training aids, devices, simulators, and simulations (TADSS) to conduct multi-level training for both operators and maintenance personnel. This includes both hardware devices and software programs utilized to include; the Patriot Maintenance Trainer (PMT), Reconfigurable Table Top Trainer (RT3) and the Patriot Multi-Echelon Training (PMET). The PMT is a new device being developed and planned for fielding to the Air Defense Artillery Schools at Fort Sill, OK.  The PMT trains 14E, 140E, 14T, 94S and 948D 6D tasks.  It reduces dependency on tactical equipment by merging physical simulators and virtual simulations replicating a realistic training environment.   The PMT will have one instructor station, one radar set, one launching station, and an engagement control station.  Some components will be actual physical representations of the tactical hardware while other components will be virtually simulated using state of the art gaming technology of P-MET.  The two environments will work seamlessly together to simulate the tactical end items.  P-MET is a Microsoft Windows® based software application utilizing state of the art gaming technology to train U.S. Army personnel in the proper trouble-shooting techniques to repair and maintain the PATRIOT Missile System.   P-MET is the Life Cycle Replacement for the PATRIOT Intermediate Maintenance Institutional Trainer (PIMIT) for Intermediate Maintenance training but is also used for Organizational, NET, and even Depot maintenance training.  P-MET is used in an institutional, field and depot environment.  P-MET is designed and developed to operate on the RT3.  The RT3 provides a flexible training platform that may be configured to support multiple training levels and systems, via removable hard drives. In PATRIOT the RT3 is used to run the PATRIOT tactical embedded training software (re-hosted tactical training software, PATRIOT Conduct of Fire Trainer (PCOFT)) for operations tasks, the P-MET software for maintenance tasks, and the PATRIOT Skills Library (PSL) lessons for both maintenance and operator tasks. Other weapon systems may also use the RT3 platform for training (i.e., C-RAM, THAAD, and JLENS).  The RT3 is a Life Cycle Replacement for the PCOFT and the PATRIOT Intermediate Maintenance Institutional Trainer (PIMIT) hardware platforms.

The Modern Manstation (MMS) is designed to significantly improve the reliability of the legacy Manstation by replacing 221 obsolete parts in 41 assemblies and reducing Battery Replaceable Units (BRUs) from 493 to 51.  Benefits of the MMS include the installation of two 30" high resolution color LCD displays with touch panels; significant increase in Mean Time Between Failure rates; elimination of a costly Multi-Volt power supply while greatly improving the overall visual graphics used for decision making. The MMS upgrades increased Warfighter effectiveness; enable future capabilities; increase reliability; and reduce life cycle costs. Training will be aligned with the tactical system using the same technology, providing geopolitical maps, and utilizing color symbology for immediate recognition of friend, foe or unknown. Soft keys will enable future switch configurations with software upgrades. The MMS also enables future graphical user interface with Common Warfighter Machine Interface (CWMI) systems.  The MMS modification upgrade will be incorporated into the Engagement Control Station (ECS) and the Information and Coordination Central (ICC) Shelters. 

The Enhanced Launcher Electronics System (ELES) modification upgrades a PAC-2 Launcher to a PAC-3 Capability.

SIPRNet/NIPRNet Access Point/Troposcatter (SNAP/TROPO).  The SNAP/TROPO program provides units with an organic Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) capability to support both intra battalion and external battalion communications.  Troposcatter terminals allow connectivity between PATRIOT shelters when local terrain or long distances make organic Ultra High Frequency (UHF) Line of Sight (LOS) communications impossible to support fire control quality data exchanges.  SNAP terminals allow a PATRIOT shelter without access to any local infrastructure to remotely connect to both SIPRnet and NIPRnet using Ku, Ka, or X band satellites for range extension in response to Operational Need Statements from combatant commands.

Assured Position, Navigation and Timing (PNT) - Purchases integrated Project Manager (PM) PNT M-code capable hardware for integration on Patriot Major End Items (MEI). Effort supports mandated FY2011 National Defense Authorization Act; public law 111-383 § 913.

Test Detachment - A manned and equipped unit consisting of various ancillary PATRIOT Ground Support Equipment elements that will assume the testing role and relieve operational units. The Air and Missile Defense (AMD) test detachment is a Table of Distribution and Allowances (TDA) unit consisting of 143 personnel containing a mixture of air defense, communications and maintenance Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) Soldiers which participate in all government developmental tests, missile flight tests, Tactics Techniques and Procedures (TTP) development and operational testing in support of the development, modernization and sustainment of current and future AMD programs.  Use of this detachment to support testing versus tasking operational PATRIOT units allows execution of currently scheduled testing while vastly minimizing the stress on the 15 PATRIOT Battalions in the operational force.

Digital Sidelobe Canceller (DSLC) is an Electronic Counter Measures (ECM) technique used to cancel the interference that is entering the radar via the antenna sidelobes. This is currently being performed using analog hardware in the PATRIOT radar.  DSLC replaces the analog hardware and performs this task digitally in the radars processor. Benefits of the DSLC include improved Side Lobe Canceller (SLC) Reliability and Maintainability, removal of complicated SLC adjustments, improves radar availability, removes 5 SLC Racks, provides hardware base for improved capability, and eliminates known and future obsolescence in SLC racks.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2017 base procurement dollars in the amount of $197.107 million supports the modifications for Reliability, Availability, and Maintainability Modifications (RAM Mods), Recapitalization (RECAP), Battery Command Post/ Tactical Command System/ Computer Software Module (BCP/TCS/CSM), Combined Crypto Modification Phase I (CCMPI), Radar Digital Processor-Configuration (RDP-C), SIPRNet/NIPRNet Access Point/Troposcatter (SNAP/TROPO), PATRIOT Maintenance Trainer (PMT), PATRIOT Multi-Echelon Training (PMET), Reconfigurable Table-Top Trainers (RT3), Assured Position, Navigation and Timing (PNT), Test Detachment, and Digital Sidelobe Canceller (DSLC).

Efforts have been and will continue to be made to expedite PATRIOT materiel solutions (e.g. Radar Digital Processor and Communications Upgrades) to both enhance capability and facilitate integration into the Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) architecture.

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) is the United States (U.S.) Army's primary 24/7, all weather, and surface-to-surface artillery precision missile used by current and future Combatant Commanders to shape the battle field with long-range fires against hard and soft stationary targets in open, complex, and urban environments.

This is the follow-on procurement to the integration and testing program that was funded under Program Element (PE) 0203802A; it will not build any new missiles or add to the overall inventory.

Block (Blk) 1 missiles currently have warheads (WHs) that are non-compliant with the 2008 Department of Defense (DoD) policy on cluster munitions (CM). The modification will be performed as a Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) and will take expired assets and reset them to a 10 year service life. Under this modification effort, a policy compliant WH will replace the existing M74 bomblets and also updates electronics and propellants. The Stockpile Reliability Program (SRP) will supply additional data to support extending the service life. This effort effectively brings the expired inventory back into service, while meeting the DoD CM Policy, to engage imprecisely located/area targets up to 300 kilometers (km).

ATACMS modifications will be performed by Lockheed Martin in Camden, Arkansas.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY17 procurement dollars in the amount of $150.043 million supports the modification of 183 expired ATACMS and resets their 10 year service life.  

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>This effort converts Guided Multiple Launch Rocket system (GMLRS) Unitary rockets to GMLRS Alternative Warhead (AW) rockets.  It capitalizes on the 90% commonality between GMLRS Unitary and AW variants.  In addition to exchanging the warhead, the conversion process will include replacement of obsolete guidance sets and other critical components in order to reset rocket service life to 10 years.

GMLRS rockets are surface-to-surface artillery rockets fired from the Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) and High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) launchers. GMLRS rockets provide 24/7, all-weather precision fires to engage both area and point targets at short, medium, and long ranges.

The GMLRS Program consists of three separate increments. GMLRS Purpose Improved Conventional Munition (DPICM) was the first increment.  It is a cluster munition that replaced the shorter range MLRS rockets to engage area or imprecisely located targets.  GLMRS DPICM Production was terminated in response to the June 2008 Department of Defense (DoD) Cluster Munitions Policy.  GMLRS Unitary is the second increment that utilizes a 200 lb high explosive warhead to engage point targets with limited collateral damage.  The GMLRS AW rocket is 90% common with the Unitary variant. GMLRS AW is a non-cluster munition developed to replace GMLRS DPICM.  The GMLRS AW program entered full rate production in FY15.

The U.S. Army manages all three increments as part of the GMLRS Program.  This modification program along with all GMLRS rockets are produced on a common production line by Lockheed Martin in Camden, Arkansas.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2017 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $0.395 million supports the continuation of the conversion test effort.

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for the use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>The Stinger Block I missile is an advanced, fire-and-forget, short-range, man-portable, air defense weapon system.  Stinger's mission is to provide the force with low-altitude air defense against fixed and rotary wing aircraft, unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and cruise missiles (CM).  Stinger employs an infrared (heat seeking)/ultraviolet seeker to guide to the target.  Stinger Block I has extensive infrared counter-countermeasure capabilities and can engage targets from any aspect to include head-on.  The missile utilizes a high-explosive, hit-to-kill warhead.  Stinger can be fired from the shoulder or from a variety of platforms to include vehicles, helicopters and UAS.  The missile is delivered as a certified round and requires no field testing or maintenance.  

The decision was made to separate the Proximity Fuze development from the Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) and to go forward only with the SLEP program following Proximity Fuze Flight Test Failures. This effort funds the procurement of rocket motors, standard warheads, and various Line Replaceable Units (LRUs) associated with the SLEP process. 

The U.S. Army Stinger inventory is currently projected to fall below the FY15-19 Total Army Munitions Requirement (TAMR), dated 2 June 2014, of 3,268 missiles by the end of FY 2018.  The Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) will provide Stinger Block I missiles with a 10-year shelf life by replacing items susceptible to degradation due to aging.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>There is no funding in FY2017.

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY08 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.</proc:Justification>

                    <proc:Description>The Stinger Block I missile is an advanced, fire-and-forget, short-range, man-portable, air defense weapon system.  Stinger's mission is to provide the force with low-altitude air defense against fixed and rotary wing aircraft, unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and cruise missiles (CM).  Stinger employs an infrared (heat seeking)/ultraviolet seeker to guide to the target.  Stinger Block I has extensive infrared counter-countermeasure capabilities and can engage targets from any aspect to include head-on.  The missile utilizes a high-explosive, hit-to-kill warhead.  Stinger can be fired from the shoulder or from a variety of platforms to include vehicles and helicopters.  The missile is delivered as a certified round and requires no field testing or maintenance.

The decision was made to separate the Proximity Fuze development from the Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) and to go forward only with the SLEP program following Proximity Fuze Flight Test Failures. This effort funds the procurement of rocket motors, standard warheads, and various Line Replaceable Units (LRUs) associated with the SLEP process. 

The U.S. Army Stinger inventory is currently projected to fall below the FY15-19 Total Army Munitions Requirement (TAMR), dated 2 June 2014, of 3,268 missiles by the end of 2018.  The Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) will provide Stinger Block I missiles with a 10-year shelf life by replacing items susceptible to degradation due to aging.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>The Avenger Air Defense System is a lightweight, highly mobile surface-to-air missile and gun weapon system mounted on a High Mobility Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV). The system employs a canopied turret consisting of a gunner position, two gyro-stabilized missile launcher pods containing four Stinger missiles each, a Forward Looking Infrared Receiver (FLIR), a Laser Range Finder (LRF), an Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) system and a very high rate of fire .50 caliber machine gun. The gun system is used against ground targets and to cover the Stinger missile dead-zone. Avenger is capable of day/night and adverse weather conditions; can be transported by UH-60L Blackhawk helicopter or C-130 aircraft; is air-droppable and can shoot on the move. The system can also be operated by remote control from a protected position up to 50 meters away from the fire unit.
The Avenger system is operated by a two-man crew and is used to counter Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs), cruise missiles, and fixed wing/rotary wing aircraft. Avenger fills the line-of-sight rear component of the Forward Area Air Defense (FAAD) system.
Funds procurement portion of Avenger Modification program to maintain system relevance in a configuration that is sustainable against multiple threats beyond FY2018. Avenger fills a capability gap which will be permanently filled by Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment 2 Intercept (IFPC Inc 2-I) which fully fields by FY31.
The Targeting Console (TC) is a required subsystem that provides the gunner with information and controls necessary to carry out the short range Air Defense Mission. The current Targeting Console is not supportable beyond FY18. This program will fund a fleet-wide replacement and upgrade of the TC that will be able to handle the increased targeting capability realized with the latest version of the FAAD early warning network.
The M3P.50 CAL machine gun is required to provide the Avenger crew with self-protection inside of the missile dead zone coverage. The M3Ps currently fielded to Air Defense Artillery (ADA) units are not supportable through FY31. This program will allow for the procurement of new M3Ps to ensure that Avenger units maintain their self-protection capability until a replacement system is fielded.
The Vehicle Internal Communications System (VIC) is a required subsystem that allows communication between the gunner and driver. It also interfaces with the Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) and missile electronics resulting in improved IFF capabilities. The updated VIC replaces the Voice Intercom System I (AN/VIC-I) that is currently fielded with the Avenger. The AN/VIC-I is not supportable beyond FY2018. The VIC update will upgrade the system from analog to digital and ensure that Avenger meets its intercommunication requirements until a replacement system for Avenger can be fielded.
The Avenger Fire Control Computer (AFCC) is a required subsystem of the Avenger Slew-to-Cue system that processes and displays air tracks data to the gunner. The current AFCC is not supportable through FY31. The AFCC-Revised (AFCC-R) will replace the current AFCC. The Avenger Fire Control Computer-Revised (AFCC-R) will undergo software and hardware upgrades that will enable the system to handle increased targeting capability realized with the latest version of the Forward Area Air Defense (FAAD) early warning system, ensure the system meets the latest Information Assurance (IA) requirements, and allow for future growth in areas such as improved fire control/longer range engagements.
Mode 5/Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) replaced the current Avenger IFF system. The Mode 5 is required to phase out Mode 4 capability. Mode 4 will no longer be supportable beyond December 2020. Incorporation of Mode 5 into Avenger is critical to retaining the cooperative target identification capability, allowing Avenger to remain relevant and effective in Air Defense and Homeland Defense missions.
The Environmental Control Unit/Prime Power Unit (ECU/PPU) is a required subsystem that provides turret air conditioning/heating and provides a separate backup power source in lieu of vehicle battery power. The ECU/PPU removes restrictions on operational use of Avenger in hot climates. This modification fulfills the user requirement for a separate, reliable power source and for heat and air conditioning to fully operate in a broad spectrum of combat environments (i.e., desert).</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2017 procurement dollars in the amount of $33.606 million support the acquisition of 131 Mode5/IFF units.
The P-40 Secondary Distribution table shows funding for Line Replaceable Units (LRU) kits procured for Active and National Guard units and are not representative of procuring full-up Avenger systems.
In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.</proc:Justification>

                    <proc:Description>These funds are provided to procure updated Avenger Line Replaceable Units (LRUs) to ensure that Avenger is viable and sustainable until Avenger leaves the force in the Fiscal Year (FY) 2031 timeframe.  Avenger fills a capability gap which will be permanently filled by Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment 2 Intercept (IFPC2-I).  The Avenger Fire Control Computer (AFCC) will undergo software and hardware upgrades that will enable the system to handle increased targeting capability realized with the latest version of the Forward Area Air Defense (FAAD) early warning system and ensure the system meets the latest Information Assurance (IA) requirements.  The Vehicle Internal Communications (VIC) system will be upgraded from digital to analog. Mode 5 cooperative target identification functions will be added to improve the system IFF capabilities. New targeting consoles will be placed on all Avengers. Newly redesigned Environmental Control Unit/Prime Power Units (ECU/PPU) will be procured for all Active Army Avengers. A mix of missiles may be required to launch on this platform until systems are completely retired from the Operational Army.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>The Improved Target Acquisition System (ITAS) with Far Target Location (FTL) is a combat proven system that provides long-range, lethal anti-armor and precision assault fires capability for Active Component and Army National Guard Infantry Brigade Combat Teams (IBCT) and Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (SBCT) across the spectrum of contemporary operational environments. ITAS with the TOW Missile provides the capability to defeat armored vehicles, bunkers, and buildings at extended ranges in all battlefield conditions. ITAS's superior surveillance capability also enables the Soldier to shape the battlefield by detecting targets at long range and either engaging with TOW missiles or other weapon systems to destroy those targets with its ability to generate a 10 digit grid coordinate of a target location.  The ITAS completed fielding to the total Army in December 2012.  The ITAS Image Enhancement (IE) Modification Kit reduces operator workload by optimizing the image presented to the gunner through electronic processing.  Electronic focus, image stabilization, and other processing techniques ensure that the image presented is optimized for the environment without manual manipulation of the various adjustment settings. This reduces the operations required by the gunner to achieve a consistent high quality image, reduces the time required to identify and engage targets on the battlefield.  ITAS continues to be the weapon of choice in precision combat engagements.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY2017 Base Procurement dollars in the amount of $0.383 million supports procurement of 6 ITAS Image Enhancement kits and the fielding and installation of kits as well as Government and contractor program management support.

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.</proc:Justification>

                    <proc:Description>The Improved Target Acquisition System (ITAS) with Far Target Location (FTL) is a combat proven system that provides long-range, lethal anti-armor and precision assault fires capability for Active Component and Army National Guard Infantry Brigade Combat Teams (IBCT) and Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (SBCT) across the spectrum of contemporary operational environments. ITAS with the TOW Missile provides the capability to defeat armored vehicles, bunkers, and buildings at extended ranges in all battlefield conditions. ITAS's superior surveillance capability also enables the Soldier to shape the battlefield by detecting targets at long range and either engaging with TOW missiles or other weapon systems to destroy those targets with its ability to generate a 10 digit grid coordinate of a target location.  The ITAS completed fielding to the total Army in December 2012.  The ITAS Image Enhancement (IE) Modification Kit reduces operator workload by optimizing the image presented to the gunner through electronic processing.  Electronic focus, image stabilization, and other processing techniques ensure that the image presented is optimized for the environment without manual manipulation of the various adjustment settings. This reduces the operations required by the gunner to achieve a consistent high quality image, reduces the time required to identify and engage targets on the battlefield.  ITAS continues to be the weapon of choice in precision combat engagements.

FY2017 Base Procurement dollars in the amount of $0.383 million supports procurement of 6 ITAS Image Enhancement kits and the fielding and installation of kits as well as Government and contractor program management support.

            <proc:Description>The M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) is a C-130 Transportable launcher mounted on a Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV) chassis.  The HIMARS is capable of firing either six Multiple Rocket Launcher System (MLRS) Family of Munitions (MFOM) rockets or one Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) Family of Munitions (AFOM) missile to a range of 300 kilometers.  Modification kits will be procured for the HIMARS Launcher and associated training and ground support equipment.  These modifications are vital to the Forces and will provide an increase in crew protection via an Increased Crew Protection (ICP) cab, Enhanced Command and Control (C2), decrease Operations and Support costs, reduce logistical impacts, resolve safety issues, and mitigate obsolescence.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2017 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $1.847 million will procure and install Enhanced Command and Control (C2) and continue Obsolescence Mitigation/Engineering Change Proposal Integration that supports updates or changes for hardware and software required to support launcher upgrades such as software modification efforts to address obsolescence, upgrades to platform trainers, transparent armor protection and suspension improvements.

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>Provides for the procurement of spares to support initial fielding of new or modified end items.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY2017 base procurement dollars in the amount of $34.487 million supports the continuing acquisition of MLRS Modification and Patriot Modification Initial Spares. The funds in this account procure depot level repairable (DLR) secondary items from Supply Management, Army activities of the Army Working Capital Fund and commercial life cycle support vendors.  To provide initial support, funds are normally required in the same year that end items are fielded.

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>Air Defense Artillery (ADA) Targets program procures target hardware and associated training services to include scoring, payload, and ground support equipment to enable Air Defense Artillery Soldiers and units to conduct required training.  This training consists of Department of the Army Pamphlet (DA PAM) 350-38 (Standards in Training Commission) required gunnery tables and aerial target tracking, training, and scoring. Target systems are also available to support collective training exercises and Force Development Testing and Experimentation (FDT&amp;E) investigations of engagement techniques for small unmanned aircraft systems.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2017 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $4.915 million supports Air Defense Artillery Targets and scoring, payload, and ground support equipment for training required in DA PAM 350-38, Standards in Training Commission (STRAC).  These items support gunnery tables, aerial target tracking (Captive Flight Trainer (CFT), and Tracking Head Trainer (THT)5.56) training, Missile Live Fire training when missiles are allocated in accordance with (IAW) the Missile Distribution Plan), and U.S. Army Avenger systems worldwide. Training requirements are generated by Department of the Army Major Field Commands, Training Centers, Division Level Commands, and real world mission rehearsals.  These field requirements have been reviewed and validated against ongoing force restructuring and are consistent with the approved training doctrine.  These targets are necessary to meet Army Regulation 220-1 (Unit Status Reporting) training requirements, training strategies and gunnery standards, and soldier qualification in support of unit readiness.

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.</proc:Justification>
