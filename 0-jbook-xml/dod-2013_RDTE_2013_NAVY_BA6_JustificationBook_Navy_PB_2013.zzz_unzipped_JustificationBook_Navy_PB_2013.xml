                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The objective of this project is development of necessary simulation facilities and approaches to allow determination of the effectiveness of Electronic Warfare (EW) in real world engagement situations and to support the introduction of modern, effective systems into Naval Aviation. The heavy use of test resources by all Services demonstrates the importance of these assets. The Navy has been very successful in executing all of its major programs, and to date has had no major technical problems.

The Electronic Warfare Environment Simulation project is unique because it is the only program within the Department of Defense which develops and provides Naval anti-air warfare threat assets for Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E).

This project directly supports the T&amp;E resource requirements for all Naval Air EW development programs, to include multi-spectral situational awareness and countermeasures. Programs in development and future programs include: Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile, ALR-67  (v) 3, Integrated Defensive Electronic Countermeasures Suite ALQ-214, the AAR-47 (v) 3, AVR-2, Advanced 6" Expendable, Advanced Strategic Tactical Expendable, ALQ-144A, Joint and Allied Threat Awareness System, Joint Strike Fighter, EA-18G, LR700, Low Band Transmitter, P-8A, and the Next Generation Jammer.

This project provides for the development of an Integrated Air Defense T&amp;E capability to be fielded at each of the three sites comprising the Navy's Tri-Center complex: Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, China Lake and Point Mugu in CA, and Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Patuxent River, MD.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Funding increases from FY 2011 to FY 2012 due to the need to address additional double digit threat systems at the Electronic Combat Range (ECR) by initiating the development of the Long Range Threat Systems simulator (LRTS) at ECR.  Funding increases from FY 2012 to FY 2013 due to the need for additional test capability for the Next Generation Jammer and the Joint Strike Fighter programs.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The objective of the Effectiveness of Navy Electronic Warfare (EW) Systems (ENEWS) Project is the development and application of necessary simulation assets to determine the effectiveness of EW for Navy ships in simulated real-world engagement situations.  The project primarily supports the introduction of modern, effective shipboard and offboard EW systems, and tactics for the Surface Navy.  The heavy use of ENEWS resources by Naval Sea Systems Command, Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&amp;E) Force, Special Operations, and other EW Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) agencies speaks to the overall importance of this project.  The project provides support for EW system design Engineering Test (ET), Development Test (DT), Operational Test (OT), and the development of utilization tactics.  Its quick reaction capabilities have had great impact on crisis situations such as the Lebanon and Libyan crises, Iran Harpoon threat, Persian Gulf crisis, and Operation Desert Shield/Storm.  Simulation Display is another ENEWS modeling tool that was developed to support T&amp;E.  The display has been adopted by most Department of Defense (DoD) T&amp;E and training ranges to provide visualization of T&amp;E and training scenarios.  The primary threat to surface ships is Anti-Ship Capable Missile systems.  The ENEWS Project is unique in that it is the only project within DoD dedicated to developing and providing realistic Anti-Ship Capable Missile assets to test and evaluate the effectiveness of shipboard EW systems and tactics against these type threats.  The ENEWS Project is a critical part of the Office of the Secretary of Defense Test Resource Master Plan.  This plan employs many of the ENEWS assets for planning, analysis, testing, and verification of shipboard and offboard EW systems techniques and tactics.  As part of its normal activities, ENEWS provides Development Test and Evaluation (DT&amp;E), OT&amp;E, and Follow-on Operational Test and Evaluation (FOT&amp;E) support to the surface Navy for all ship classes.  DT, OT and FOT&amp;E support includes AN/SLQ-32 Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program (SEWIP), R17.OX NULKA, Rapid Anti-ship Integrated Defense System, all MK245 Giant tests, advanced InfraRed (IR) decoys, decoy placement, ship IR signature and radar cross section measurement of DDG-51, LPD-17, DD-21 and PC class ships, High Power Microwave program, and other ship self-defense initiatives, including T&amp;E of Future Naval Capability process.  In addition, ENEWS assets are regularly employed to test the effectiveness of North Atlantic Treaty Organization ships' EW systems in joint allied exercises. ENEWS assets also support Joint EW exercises that are conducted with Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) nations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Aerial target systems, Target Control (TC), and associated Target Augmentation and Auxiliary Systems (TA/AS) are developed to support test &amp; evaluation and advanced fleet training for Joint Strike and Littoral Warfare Systems required to defend fleet surface and air units in a hostile environment. In addition to hardware, software and operational concept development, studies will be performed by an University Affiliated Research Center (UARC) to specify and verify needed target performance for future target development. For the design and validation of targets under development, the UARC will provide engineering studies in areas such as structures, controls, guidance, and propulsion.  For those hardware and software items presently under development by commercial vendors, the UARC will provide oversight and validation of vendor design and development approach.
As to specific harware development, this project includes:
- Subsonic Targets.  Subsonic Aerial Target (SSAT) development.  The SSAT primarily represents subsonic anti-ship cruise missile threats in direct support of the test &amp; evaluation (T&amp;E) of major combat weapons systems programs and of fleet training.  
- Supersonic Targets.  Supersonic Sea Skimming Target (SSST), Multi-Stage Supersonic Target (designated the ZGQM-173A), and supersonic high-diver capability development.  The family of supersonic target capabilities represents supersonic anti-ship cruise missile threats in direct support of Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&amp;E), Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&amp;E) and Live Fire Test and Evaluation of major combat weapons systems programs in development.
- TC and TA/AS development.  TC provides command and control of targets to enable the execution of threat-representative mission profiles.  TA/AS enables each target to be uniquely configured for specific mission profiles. TA/AS-configured targets are used for radar acquisition test, electronic countermeasures (jamming) evaluation, infrared measurement and testing, radar cross section evaluation, decoy-effectiveness testing, maneuver analysis, electronic warfare evaluation, warhead-effectiveness testing and evaluation of fleet tactics.  TA/AS scoring capabilities include both surface and airborne scalar and vector scoring systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>The ZGQM-173A target emulates a two-stage anti-ship cruise missile. The ZGQM-173A will have a subsonic bus stage vehicle which will tumble and fall into the sea, and a supersonic sprint stage vehicle which continues flight to impact. The fielded system will provide threat representation in support of DT&amp;E and OT&amp;E and will identify deficiencies in shipboard air defense systems. Funding will also continue GQM-163 SSST upgrades/evolutionary development to keep pace with evolving threat characteristics. Efforts include continuing to establish operational capability at Pacific Missile Range Facility, developing performance envelope characteristics to include flight termination performance, and continuing development of high-diver capability.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides for the development and procurement of aerial targets and associated systems used exclusively for test and evaluation of naval weapons systems which closely represent current and projected threats to fleet units in the Joint Strike and the Littoral Warfare environments. These representations must include characteristics related to size, performance envelope, and electromagnetic and infrared signatures. As threats change, changes must be made to keep the targets threat representative in response to changes in the test requirements of the developers of naval weapons systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Maritime Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) Planning System (MIPS) is an automated air and missile defense planning tool that supports the Joint Force Maritime Component Commander at the operational level of war by automatically and optimally allocating and stationing ships in support of Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) or Anti-Air Warfare (AAW).  MIPS contains United States Army Patriot and Terminal High Altitude Air Defense (THAAD) models to ensure synergistic allocation and positioning of maritime units in relation to other joint units, providing optimized mutual defense for selected defended assets against selected BMD and AAW threats.  

MIPS requires additional algorithms that include Bottom Contours, Long Range Surveillance &amp; Track (LRS&amp;T), Launch on Tactical Digital Information Link (TADIL), Cued Engagement and Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) stationing capabilities to improve model performance and meet the expanding requirements for optimized IAMD.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Maritime Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) Planning System (MIPS) is an automated air and missile defense planning tool that supports the Joint Force Maritime Component Commander at the operational level of war by automatically and optimally allocating and stationing ships in support of Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) or Anti-Air Warfare (AAW).  MIPS contains United States Army Patriot and Terminal High Altitude Air Defense (THAAD) models to ensure synergistic allocation and positioning of maritime units in relation to other joint units, providing optimized mutual defense of selected defended assets against selected BMD and AAW threats.  

MIPS requires additional algorithms that include Bottom Contours, Long Range Surveillance &amp; Track (LRS&amp;T), Launch on Tactical Digital Information Link (TADIL), Cued Engagement and Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) stationing capabilities to improve model performance and meet the expanding requirements for optimized IAMD.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports detailed mission, capability, and technical analysis of future naval warfighting requirements.

This project supports detailed mission, capability, and technical analysis of future naval war fighting requirements. This work provides the analytical basis for integration and prioritization of overall military capability requirements and acquisition programs in support of executing the Naval Capability Development Process and development and delivery of Mission Capability Packages, Naval Capability Packages, and Integrated Strategic Capability Plans for the Chief of Naval Operations.
Concept formulation for ships, boats and unmanned maritime vehicles must be continuously exercised to remain viable. It takes years to train competent practitioners, and knowledge currency is quickly lost without practice. Evolving threats and technologies drive concepts (and the tools, processes, and skills needed to produce them) towards obsolescence without constant attention. Capability Based Assessments (CBAs) and Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) timelines are insufficient for establishing potential material solution cost versus capability relationships without significant concept formulation work beforehand. Active collaboration between OPNAV requirement sponsors, Program Offices, and the various System Command (NAVSEA, NAVAIR, and SPAWAR) engineers is critical for fully exploring the trade space by conducting analysis for affordability, effectiveness and risk.  
The majority of Total Ownership Cost (TOC) is locked into a design before it is even a program. In the later stages of a program it becomes much more costly to make changes that will significantly impact TOC. Investment up front in concept design can have a high payoff in TOC reduction over the life of a platform class.
This project funds concept development engineering, mission effectiveness analysis, and other analyses for formulation of future surface ship and associated platform force structure along with development of the tools to accomplish these efforts. Advanced platform concept studies and systems technology assessments will be conducted as will the development and upgrade of concept design and engineering tools, methods, and criteria.
Outputs include concept costing and performance parameterization for comparative assessment against capability objectives and synthesis to quantify overall (Fleet) capabilities. These products (expressions of cost vs. capability) will serve as the basis of requirements and Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) analysis, define the trade space for Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) efforts, and underpin discussion of force architecture/structure during Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), Long Range Shipbuilding Strategy (LRSS) builds, and JROC reviews.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Complete 37 tasks for decision superiority, 21 tasks for global maritime security, 13 tasks for sea control, and 5 tasks for power projection. Produce and deliver Analytical Agenda briefings and assessments.

Portfolio Management Decision Support System (PMDSS) is an analytic Portfolio Management Methodology used to aid Navy leadership with both investment and divestment programming decisions. This methodology provides an assessment process that fosters informed, understandable, repeatable investment decisions with consistent, pedigreed, and retrievable information. The focus of this effort is to refine the system to identify programs as potential candidates for divestment. It provides leadership and resource sponsors with a starting point for their offset decision process as well as an issue ranking capability. PMDSS will include linkage of programs to N3/N5 strategic imperatives, programs mapped to warfare areas, program interdependencies annotated, and balance factors that can be adjusted to reflect Navy Leadership Priorities. The effort expands on PMDSS by capturing and mapping issues/funding adjustments, and providing a system capable of identifying fiscal interdependencies and consideration to risk in order to increase accuracy in calculating programmatic risk.

This project provides an essential management tool to: (a) assess the effectiveness of existing M&amp;P policies and programs; (b) identify needs for new policies and programs; (c) determine the required manpower and training mix relative to changing demographic, societal and legislative/regulatory actions, and to evolving strategic and geopolitical factors; (d) study the impact of M&amp;P programs on Navy accession, attrition, retention, and performance; and, (e) to develop, validate and/or refine a broad range of M&amp;P forecasting models.  The program permits Navy to more effectively utilize Research and Development expertise to respond to emergent M&amp;P issues on a continuing basis.  This program is funded under RDT&amp;E operational systems development because it encompasses engineering and development of new end-items prior to production approval decision.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>This PE provides funding to support continuing need for studies and analysis of issues critical to decisions required by the Chief of Naval Personnel and his staff regarding manpower, personnel, training and education policies, and programs that have far-reaching implications to service members and the Navy budget.  This PE supports research of both Naval Postgraduate School faculty and students, and in FY10 began the formulation of focused economic research, to include behavioral economics.  This focus will provide continuing analysis and research to facilitate the data gathering and synthesis to provide consistent and timely update to economic indicators to use in the numerous models that support management decisions within the MPTE arena that have significant impact on the efficient use of the nearly $27B Manpower &amp; Personnel, Navy budget.  The economic research will consolidate the data necessary to perform elasticity estimations and maintain this data for subsequent estimations.  To gather the data necessary to perform such estimations, would conservatively cost more than $300K on each such occasion.  The MPTE enterprise uses dozens of models, most of which require elasticity updates.  Consolidating the data repository to support this analysis will result in a cost avoidance of more than $1M and this does not include any of the actual model revisions.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Funding supports Naval aviation pre-Milestone B developmental activities to include the conduct and integration of systems engineering activities. This project unit provides information, automated tools, and decision aids necessary to perform acquisition planning in support of warfighter capability requirements. This project unit also supports research, development, and analysis efforts to include various studies, joint requirements analysis and cost analysis requirements in support of systems engineering activities, analysis-of-alternatives, and development of the 30-Year Aviation Plan (Congressionally mandated product). Due to high turnover and the end of service life of several Naval aircraft, DOD 5000 series mandates studies to identify capabilities lost and means to replace the capability. This project unit allows Naval aviation the means to properly identify capability gaps and potential solutions required to maintain maximum warfighting capability with minimal breaks in service and reduced and fiscal technical risk.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Center for Naval Analyses (CNA) is the Department of the Navy's (DoN) only Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC). CNA provides independent, objective, and expert analyses based on its unique access to sensitive data and hands-on exposure to fleet operations gained through its world-wide field program. CNA's research program is centrally funded by this program element and is primarily concentrated along one Marine Corps category and thirteen Navy categories of study called product areas. These product areas are structured to enhance CNA's focus of research and analysis upon the major present and future needs and issues of the Navy and the Marine Corps. Because of rapid advances in technology, changes in the fleet, the increasing complexity of weapon systems, and reductions in manpower, force structure, budgets, the current security environment, and Department of Defense (DoD) transformation, the Navy and Marine Corps have a greater need for analyses that are sophisticated, relevant, and timely. CNA is highly qualified to meet that need.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports the Marine Corps portion of the DoN CNA Research Program, and is managed as an element of the Marine Corps Studies System. This program provides the Marine Corps with independent and objective research and analysis of specific issues/topics appropriately performed by a FFRDC. As a result of the findings and recommendations of the Fiscal Year 1997 Defense Science Board, the Marine Corps refocused the type of support CNA provides.  The CNA maintains a varied number of field representatives for the Operational Forces Commanders and eight (8) program areas for CNA to establish and maintain. The program areas are linked to the Marine Corps Advocacy (prepotency), which are: (1) Policy and Operations; (2) Systems and Tactics; (3) Research, Development and Acquisition; (4) Infrastructure and Readiness; (5) Manpower, Medical and Training; (6) Resources, Planning and Assessments; (7) Capabilities, Force Structure and Systems and (8) Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance.  Scientific Analyst support provides six scientific analysts for the following six focus areas: Deputy Commandant (DC), Plans, Policies and Operations; DC Aviation; DC Installation and Logistics; DC Programs and Resources; DC Manpower Reserve Affairs; and Director, Manpower Plans (MP) - Manpower and Reserve Affairs (M&amp;RA). The program continues analytical support for field exercises, Ad Hoc and Quick Response study requirements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>The Marine Corps' portion of the CNA program is executed via the Marine Corps Studies System (MCSS) Annual Plan which is reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis. The MCSS maintains a comprehensive listing of all CNA studies performed for the Marine Corps.  The MCSS ensures there are no duplicate analytical efforts within the Marine Corps.  Additionally, the Operations Analysis Division of Marine Corps Combat Development Command (MCCDC) provides analytical review of all CNA products for the Marine Corps and integrates the results and recommendations into a quarterly newsletter for research and analysis.  Other evaluation processes are as follows: 
A) Contract Status Meetings: The Marine Corps participates in the DoN Contract Status Meetings. As part of the CNA oversight process, the Contracting Officer chairs a monthly meeting with the COTR, the Marine Corps, and members of the CNA Business Support Group to provide guidance regarding contract management. Issues range from reviewing the Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC) database requirements to emphasize the contractual requirement that all ongoing research be submitted to DTIC to ensure against duplication to reviewing CNA's cost effectiveness and efficiency.
B) Award Fee Evaluation Process: As required by CNA's contract with DoN, the Marine Corps participates in the CNA evaluation on a semi-annual basis throughout the entire five year performance period of Contract N00014-05-D-0500. Over 28 Marine Corps sponsors of CNA deliverables provide input regarding CNA's value to their respective organizations.  Evaluations cover CNA's support to Marine Corps leadership and management, timeliness and quality of research, as well as cost effectiveness and efficiency.  The Marine Corps' evaluation contributes to CNA's overall performance rating that is the primary basis for determining the amount, if any, of the available award fee earned by CNA. 
C) Marine Corps Three-Star Flag Officer Review: The Commanding General, Marine Corps Combat Development Command (MCCDC) and the Director, Operations Analysis Division meet several times per month to review the current fiscal year's research program and provide guidance to CNA regarding their future research requirements for the Marine Corps. These high level meetings are essential to provide CNA with Marine Corps' guidance to ensure that the research conducted is of the greatest value to the Marine Corps. The meetings also serve as the roadmap for research during the upcoming fiscal year. The Marine Corps' research plan is consolidated with the DoN's Annual Plan that is submitted to the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Integration of Capabilities and Resources (N8) for final review and acceptance.
D) CNA Comprehensive Review: Prior to contract renewal, CNA, as a FFRDC, must be evaluated to ensure that the DoN wants to renew their contract for an additional five years. The Marine Corps conducts a comprehensive review of sponsors' technical needs and mission requirements, consideration of alternative sources, efficiency and effectiveness, and management and cost effectiveness that contributes to DoN's establishment of criteria and sponsorship agreement.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

						CNA continued to provide the Navy with exemplary, high caliber research during the reporting period.  Issues of major importance to Navy leadership were addressed during the Annual Plan process which is reviewed annually to ensure CNA's research is addressing the Navy's most critical topics.  Research of highest priority included:  Analysis of Guam total force employment; developing a network (Cyber) common operational picture; countering anti-access strategies; reducing shore infrastructure cost; rotorcraft mission roles and responsibilities in 2030 and beyond; mine clearance in support of Homeland Security; and Navy installation energy strategy.  In addition, CNA's field program, providing analysts to Navy commands around the world, as well as their Washington-based scientific analyst program, provided Navy leadership with on-site, cutting edge analyses.

                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>CNA is reviewed throughout the research year on several different levels to ensure that research produced is not duplicated elsewhere.  The primary (and most effective) method of review for duplication is the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) review and approval of each and every project proposal submitted by CNA.  This method is highly effective in providing the necessary oversight to ensure that duplication of effort does not occur.  The Marine Corps Studies System (MCSS) maintains a comprehensive listing of all CNA studies performed for the USMC.  The MCSS ensures that there are no duplicate analytical efforts within the USMC.  Additionally, the Studies and Analysis Division of the Marine Corps Combat Development Command (MCCDC) provides analytical review of all CNA products for the USMC and integrates the results and recommendations into a quarterly newsletter and an annual plan for research and analysis.  Other evaluation processes:  A) DoN Contract Status Meetings:  As part of the CNA oversight process, the ONR Contracting Officer chairs a monthly meeting with the COTR, the USMC, and the CNA Business Support Group to provide guidance regarding contract management.  B) Two-Star Flag Officers and VCNO Corporate Board Meetings:  DoN Two-Star and their equivalent civilian counterparts meet several times a year to review the current fiscal year's research and provide guidance to CNA regarding their future research for DoN.  These high level meetings are essential to provide CNA with DoN's guidance to ensure that the research conducted is of the greatest value to DoN.  The meetings also serve as the catalyst for the formation of the CNA Annual Plan, CNA's roadmap for research during the upcoming fiscal year.  The CNA Annual Plan is then submitted to VCNO/N8 for final review and acceptance.  C)  CNA Comprehensive Review:  Prior to contract renewal, CNA, as an FFRDC, must be evaluated to ensure that the DoN wants to renew CNA's contract for an additional five year period.  DoN completes an exhaustive review of sponsors' technical needs and mission requirements; DoN's consideration of other sources; CNA's efficiency and effectiveness; CNA's management and cost effectiveness; as well as the FFRDC establishment criteria and sponsorship agreement.  The CNA Comprehensive Review is approved by ASN (RDA) and accepted by OSD (AT&amp;L).</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

						Phase I Feasibility
The purpose of Phase I is to determine the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of the proposed effort and quality of performance by the small business concerns (SBC). SPAWAR made 36 Phase I awards and 19 Phase I Option awards in FY 2011 valued at $3,143,017.

Phase II Technology Development
Phase II awards are based on the SBC's Phase I results and potential of the Phase II proposal to address the Navy's needs. These awards further develop the technology, maturing the TRL and providing prototypes or other sources validating the technology. SPAWAR made 31 Phase II, 28 Phase II Option, and 14 Phase II.5 SBIR awards in FY 2011 valued at $35,657,421

Phase III - Since the DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000, the Navy continues annually to award more in Phase III contracts then the rest of the DOD combined and continues to be called out in studies and Congressional language as the premier Department of Defense(DoD)SBIR program.  Although no government SBIR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and/or private sector.  The target is to transition a company's SBIR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community. One important strength of the SBIR program is that once a company has received a Phase I award the follow-on Phase II and III awards can be awarded in a non competitive process since the competitive process took place under phase I.

Phase III - Since the DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000, the Navy continues annually to award more in Phase III contracts then the rest of the DOD combined and continues to be called out in studies and Congressional language as the premier Department of Defense(DoD)SBIR program.  Although no government SBIR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and/or private sector.  The target is to transition a company's SBIR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community. One important strength of the SBIR program is that once a company has received a Phase I award the follow-on Phase II and III awards can be awarded in a non competitive process since the competitive process took place under phase I.

						Phase I Feasibility:
Phase I awards determined the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of the proposed effort and quality of performance by the
small business concerns (SBC). 

Phase II Technology Development:
Phase II awards are based on the SBC's Phase I results and potential of the Phase II proposal to address the Navy's needs. These awards further
developed the technology, maturing the Technology Readiness Level(TRL) and providing prototypes or other sources validating the technology. 

Phase III - Since the DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000, the Navy continues annually to award more in Phase III contracts then the rest of the DOD combined and continues to be called out in studies and Congressional language as the premier Department of Defense(DoD)SBIR program.  Although no government SBIR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and/or private sector.  The target is to transition a company's SBIR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community. One important strength of the SBIR program is that once a company has received a Phase I award the follow-on Phase II and III awards can be awarded in a non competitive process since the competitive process took place under phase I.

						Phase I Feasibility:
Phase I awards determined the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of the proposed effort and quality of performance by the
small business concerns (SBC). 

Phase II Technology Development:
Phase II awards are based on the SBC's Phase I results and potential of the Phase II proposal to address the Navy's needs. These awards further
developed the technology, maturing the Technology Readiness Level(TRL) and providing prototypes or other sources validating the technology. 

Phase III - Since the DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000, the Navy continues annually to award more in Phase III contracts then the rest of the DOD combined and continues to be called out in studies and Congressional language as the premier Department of Defense(DoD)SBIR program.  Although no government SBIR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and/or private sector.  The target is to transition a company's SBIR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community. One important strength of the SBIR program is that once a company has received a Phase I award the follow-on Phase II and III awards can be awarded in a non competitive process since the competitive process took place under phase I.

						Phase I Feasibility:
Phase I awards determined the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of the proposed effort and quality of performance by the
small business concerns (SBC). 

Phase II Technology Development:
Phase II awards are based on the SBC's Phase I results and potential of the Phase II proposal to address the Navy's needs. These awards further
developed the technology, maturing the Technology Readiness Level(TRL) and providing prototypes or other sources validating the technology. 

Phase III - Since the DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000, the Navy continues annually to award more in Phase III contracts then the rest of the DOD combined and continues to be called out in studies and Congressional language as the premier Department of Defense(DoD)SBIR program.  Although no government SBIR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and/or private sector.  The target is to transition a company's SBIR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community. One important strength of the SBIR program is that once a company has received a Phase I award the follow-on Phase II and III awards can be awarded in a non competitive process since the competitive process took place under phase I.

						Phase I Feasibility:
Phase I awards determined the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of the proposed effort and quality of performance by the
small business concerns (SBC). 

Phase II Technology Development:
Phase II awards are based on the SBC's Phase I results and potential of the Phase II proposal to address the Navy's needs. These awards further
developed the technology, maturing the Technology Readiness Level(TRL) and providing prototypes or other sources validating the technology. 

Phase III - Since the DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000, the Navy continues annually to award more in Phase III contracts then the rest of the DOD combined and continues to be called out in studies and Congressional language as the premier Department of Defense(DoD)SBIR program.  Although no government SBIR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and/or private sector.  The target is to transition a company's SBIR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community. One important strength of the SBIR program is that once a company has received a Phase I award the follow-on Phase II and III awards can be awarded in a non competitive process since the competitive process took place under phase I.

						Phase I Feasibility
The purpose of Phase I is to determine the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of the proposed effort and quality of performance by the small business concerns (SBC).

Phase II Technology Development
Phase II awards are based on the SBC's Phase I results and potential of the Phase II proposal to address the Navy's needs. These awards further develop the technology, maturing the TRL and providing prototypes or other sources validating the technology. SPAWAR made 4 Phase II and 1 Phase II option STTR awards in FY 2011 valued at $2,246,337.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The goal for this project is to enhance warfighter effectiveness by:  leveraging industry independent Research and Development science and technology base; developing strategic partnerships with industry to transition private sector technology; and transferring appropriate Navy-developed innovative concepts and inventions to the private sector for purposes of commercialization.  (Public Law 96-480, Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986)

This project also provides the Department of the Navy (DoN) interface to the Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Science and Technology, Office of Technology Transition, and to the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Technology Policy for matters relating to policy and reporting requirements for technology transfer. 

The increase from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is due to the return on investment of T2 pilot projects to the Naval Research Enterprise by Chief of Naval Research.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>International Cooperative RDT&amp;E: provide program management, execution, and support to implement a broad range of cooperative Naval Research and Development, Test and Evaluation initiatives to improve coalition interoperability, harmonize US Navy requirements with allied and friendly nations, and identify cooperative international opportunities, and improve coalition interoperability.  In addition, it develops coherent approaches, coordinating with partner nations, to sea-based missile defense, command, control, communications, computers and intelligence (C4I), and cooperative acquisition programs while also identifying technology to support the Global Maritime Partnership initiative.

Naval War College Strategic Studies Support:  Provides research, analysis and gaming activities which serve as a focal point, stimulus, and major source of strategic and operational thought within the Navy, joint and interagency communities.  These efforts generate strategic and operational alternatives, quantitative analysis, war gaming and political military assessments, and provide recommendations regarding the formulation and execution of maritime options .  The War Gaming Department plans, designs, executes, analyzes and reports on the Navy's Title 10 war games.  These war games provide analytical input to the Navy's Strategic Plan, assessments of future concepts, and recommendations to the Navy's Quadrennial Defense Review, force design, and strategy process.  The War Gaming Department also designs, executes and analyzes war games for theater security cooperation plans and operational war fighting issues.  

Assessment Program: The Navy Assessment Program provides capability-based planning assessment for Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS), conducts analysis to affect war fighting capability trades and enterprise resources, identifies needs, gaps, and overlaps, and assesses alternative solutions to Joint needs.  The program supports both the development and use of modeling, simulation and analytically-based warfare and provides business analyses and analytic tools that provide the basis for decision making with respect to concepts of operations (CONOPS), Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) Systems (Information Dominance); warfare systems (Sea Strike, Sea Shield, and Sea Basing) and analytical underpinnings/basis for programmatic decisions of the Navy's top leadership regarding their architectures, force structure, and the Navy's core "organize, train, and equip mission" (the warfare and provider Enterprises).  The program provides overarching Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution System (PPBES) analyses and guidance for PPBES which provides gap analysis and investment strategy and total obligation authority allocation.  It provides independent capability analysis and assists in structuring follow-on Navy analyses.  The program coordinates Navy's position for the enhanced planning process and conducts net assessments.  It serves as the lead campaign analysis to approve Navy warfare and support requirements.  The program supports "A Cooperative Strategy for 21st Century Seapower 21" as modified by the Maritime Strategy which charts a course for the Navy, Coast Guard and Marine Corps to work collectively with each other and international partners to prevent crises from occurring or reacting quickly should one occur to avoid negative impact to the United States.  It serves as an independent assessor providing a broad-view perspective across the Navy staff apart from resource sponsors, with an integrated look at both war fighting and war fighting support programs.  The program supports the world class modeling efforts to attain a level of Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) capability that is world class and establishes the Navy as a leader in the Department of Defense (DoD) M&amp;S community.  It provides Navy alternatives in assessing the implications embedded within resource decisions in a quantified context of costs versus capability versus risk.  The program provides independent analytic support to Navy leadership in conjunction with various executive level decision forums.  It develops tools and analytical methodologies that assist in evaluating Navy programs and provides technical leadership for the analysis functional area of Naval Modeling and Simulation.

Mid-Range Financial Improvement Plans: This project supports the Research Development Test &amp; Evaluation, Navy (RDTEN) portion of the larger DoD and Navy-wide effort to implement the financial improvement plan.  Funding is for the sustainment of clean and auditable statements for RDTEN.

Operations Integration Group:  Classified

CHENG: Develops and implements architecture-based systems engineering processes, methods and tools that assure integrated and interoperable systems are delivered to the fleet.  This project provides the mission-oriented technical basis for implementing capability-based acquisition management within the Navy to engineer and field Navy and Marine Corps combat systems, weapon systems, and command, control, communications, computers and intelligence (C4I) programs that must operate as  family-of-systems (FoS) or system-of-systems (SoS).  The focus of this project is on identifying the functions, relationships, and connections between systems at both the force and unit level and across warfare mission areas, and encompasses three key elements:  Systems Engineering to provide the framework for making engineering decisions by war fighting capability at the FoS/SoS level and supports consistent engineering and investment decision-making across Navy and Marine Corps programs within capability-based acquisition portfolios.  Naval Collaborative Engineering Environment development and implementation as a DON enterprise resource for Naval integration and interoperability information to enable collaboration and decision support among Fleet organizations, Program Executive Offices, Program Managers, Systems Commands, prime contractors, Resource/Warfare Sponsors and Comptroller organizations.  Standards, Policies and Guidelines engineering and technical staff to implement DoN, Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and Joint integration and interoperability and Anti-Tamper initiatives.

Naval Research Laboratory (NRL)Facilities Modernization: This program has been established to provide a systematic and planned approach to improve vital in-house science and technology (S&amp;T) laboratory facilities which are reaching or have reached critical stages of deterioration.  The program includes restoration and modernization (R&amp;M) initiatives for about 350,000 net square feet, where the average age of the buildings is 67 years old.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Provides program management, execution, and support to implement a broad range of cooperative naval Research and Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) initiatives to improve coalition interoperability, harmonize US Navy requirements with allied and friendly nations, identify cooperative international opportunities, and improve coalition interoperability.  In addition, it develops coherent approaches in coordination with combatant commanders (COCOMs), and appropriate partner nations, to sea-based missile defense, command, control, communications, computers and intelligence (C4I), and cooperative acquisition programs while also identifying technology to support the Global Maritime Partnership Initiative.

The project scope was expanded from primarily North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)-centric to include Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO), and  Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) emphasis.  Relationships have been, and are being initiated with a greatly expanded and diverse group of maritime countries, particularly those with nascent and littoral navies, located in new regions critical to U.S. security.  The project was restructured internally to both maintain ongoing international relationships and projects, while preparing to facilitate support for a global network of maritime nations under MDA and increase OCO-related support requirements. 

Ongoing cooperative RDT&amp;E programs, projects and exchanges are pursued to identify cooperative acquisition programs, enhance OCO efforts and MDA development, fill capability gaps, improve US/coalition interoperability, and set standardization with international partners. Such efforts have resulted in:
1. Negotiating and developing approximately 57 international RDT&amp;E Agreements annually with allied and friendly nations;
2. Executing approximately 300 Information Exchange Annexes (IEAs) with foreign partners;
3. Improving IEA information dissemination with allied and friendly countries and within Department of the Navy (DoN);
4. Coordinating Navy inputs to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (OUSD) Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (AT&amp;L) Foreign Comparative Test (FCT) Program, and Coalition Warfare Program (CWT) as well as the DoN Technology Transfer Security Assistance Review Boards (TTSARB). 
5. Represent the US Navy in Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) directed Armaments Cooperation Forums, including the Conference of NATO Armaments Directors' groups {NATO Naval Armaments Group (NNAG)}, and Senior National Representative-Maritime (SNR-M);
6.  Funding of various international RDT&amp;E support databases including Technical Project Officer (TPO), International Agreement Generators, Information/Data Exchange Agreements, and Project Agreements/Memorandums of Understanding;
7.  Leading the Engineering and Scientist Exchange Program (ESEP).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Navy Assessment Program provides capability-based planning assessment for Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS), conducts analysis to affect war fighting capability trades and enterprise resources, identifies needs, gaps, and overlaps, and assesses alternative solutions to Joint needs.  The program supports both the development and use of modeling, simulation and analytically-based warfare and provides business analyses and analytic tools that provide the basis for decision making with respect to concepts of operations, Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Systems (Information Dominance); warfare systems (Sea Strike, Sea Shield, and Sea Basing) and analytical underpinnings/basis for programmatic decisions of the Navy's top leadership regarding their architectures, force structure, and the Navy's core "organize, train, and equip mission" (the warfare and provider Enterprises).  The program provides overarching Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution System (PPBES) analyses and guidance for PPBES which provides gap analysis and investment strategy and total obligation authority allocation.  It provides independent capability analysis and assists in structuring follow-on Navy analyses.  The program coordinates Navy's position for the enhanced planning process and conducts net assessments.  It serves as the lead campaign analysis to approve Navy warfare and support requirements.  The program supports "A Cooperative Strategy for 21st Century Seapower 21" as modified by the Maritime Strategy which charts a course for the Navy, Coast Guard and Marine Corps to work collectively with each other and international partners to prevent crises from occurring or reacting quickly should one occur to avoid negative impact to the United States.  It serves as an independent assessor providing a broad-view perspective across the Navy staff apart from resource sponsors, with an integrated look at both war fighting and war fighting support programs.  The program supports the world class modeling efforts to attain a level of Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) capability that is world class and establishes the Navy as a leader in the Department of Defense M&amp;S community.  It provides Navy alternatives in assessing the implications embedded within resource decisions in a quantified context of costs versus capability versus risk.  The program provides independent analytic support to Navy leadership in conjunction with various executive level decision forums.
Capabilities-Based Assessment (CBA) is the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) analysis process that includes three phases: Functional Area Analysis (FAA), Functional Needs Analysis (FNA), and Functional Solution Analysis. The results of the CBA are used to develop a joint capabilities document (based on the FAA and FNA) or initial capabilities document (based on the full analysis). CBA funding provides the resource sponsors the means to develop the analytic underpinning required by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 3170.01G to support the determination of Naval warfighting capabilities and force structure needed to support the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC)/JCIDS requirements validation process and to inform Program Objective Memorandum programming decisions.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>-The overall goal is to conduct analysis to support the Navy decisions needed to turn strategy and guidance into the Fleet we need within acceptable risk. METRIC: Risks are balanced across capability that delivers the right capabilities within the resources available to Navy. Navy Assessment Program supports the development of platform specific studies and Capability-Based Assessments, an analytical effort resulting in Functional Area Analysis, Functional Needs Analysis , and Functional Solutions Analysis. Efforts provide added analytical rigor relative to program's maturation under the Joint Capabilities, Integration, and Development System and support warfare integration initiatives. 
-Navy Standard Scenarios with Warfare and Warfare Support Analyses: Goal: To ensure that essential elements of warfare analyses, including scenarios, operational concepts, tactics, capabilities of platforms and systems (for Navy, Joint, coalition and threat forces), key assumptions and input data are defined and traceable to government approved source material. METRIC: Consistency with other ongoing analyses as directed, develop Measures of Performance and Measures of Effectiveness and recommend appropriate modeling/methodology to support analysis. Models/methodology used reflect study objects, level of fidelity required and time constraints. 
-Capability Based Assessments with Campaign Mission Analyses Analytical and Technical Support: Goal: To provide analyses and technical and engineering support including, but not limited to, joint campaign analysis that examines the ability to counter a range of coordinated threat capabilities, high level tradeoffs between service capabilities, or impact of large-scale architecture, force structure of modernization decision; mission-level effectiveness analyses to determine system capabilities; analyses of alternative force structures to determine ability to meet peacetime deployment or steady-state requirements and respond to transition to war and contingency operations; cost-effectiveness and analyses; Acquisition Category Program Office and Systems Command assessments; and analyses of new technologies. METRIC: Develop analysis plans; determine proposed alternatives for analysis; and research performance data on current and future threats, coalition and own force systems; perform technology investigations and forecasts; develop or obtain cost data for current or planned systems; develop and use Cost Estimating Relationships to determine cost for conceptual or future systems for which no cost data is available; identify analysis assumptions, limitations and uncertainties; use established models or develop new models or methodologies to perform analyses; and interpret and analyze results. 
-Campaign Analysis-Modeling and Simulation: Goal: Develop and maintain a standard set of models for use in warfare analyses and analyses performed to support Planning Strategy that work at the campaign, mission, and engagement levels. METRIC: A combination of model design statements, model study reports, system specifications, updated model reports, model/database documents, model verification and validation plans, code, and Plan of Action and Milestones reports developed or updated that encompass all aspects of Sea Power 21 to include at a minimum air, land, sea, and Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance.
-Joint Assessments and Integration and Investment Strategy Development: Goal: Conduct assessments to determine shortfalls and redundancies in existing or planned operational or support capabilities; identify key issues including deficiencies in war fighting capability; determine priorities for needed capabilities; assesses affordability of high payoff systems and technologies; assess effectiveness and affordability of alternative force structures; and formulate investment strategies. Continue development and refinement of Navy program planning to determine the war fighting wholeness and cost effectiveness of alternative Navy strategies. METRIC: Identify shortfalls and redundancies in existing or planned capabilities. Determine the impact of variations in warfare systems and architectures in threat, U.S. and combined forces and strategies. Provide engineering and analytic support for the assessment and transition of technology for use in the Investment Strategy. 
-World Class Modeling, Simulation, and Capability Analysis: Goal: Development of new models or model upgrades to meet requirements identified by the WCM requirements process that support the Program Objective Memorandum decision-making process, with the goal of creating a state-of-the art set of models for use in warfare and warfare support analyses. METRIC: Develop model design documents, model study reports, system specifications, updated model reports, model documentation, model verification and validation plans, code, Plan of Action and Milestones reports, and technical reports.
The May 2007 revision of the Joint Chiefs of Staff's Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) instruction (CJCSI 3170.01F) requires a Capabilities-Based Assessment (CBA) to assess new requirements. A CBA instruction has been developed by the CNO's warfare integration office that prescribes a procedure and structure to this warfighting requirements generation process (JCIDS). A CBA is required to address and validate capability shortfalls or gaps as defined by combatant commanders. It is an analytical process that includes three phases: the Functional Area Analysis, the Functional Needs Analysis, and the Functional Solution Analysis. This process is designed to address future warfighting requirements and analysis needs and improve the quality of Analysis of Alternatives. CBA supports Navy programming decisions and provides the means to develop the analytic underpinning to support the determination of Naval capabilities and force structure recapitalization investments required to fulfill the Maritime Strategy.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>One of DoD's and Navy's priority goals is to gain a clean and auditable financial statement.  The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Comptroller, in his 8 August 2003 memorandum, directed the Military Departments and Defense Agencies, in coordination with the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS), to prepare a comprehensive mid-range financial improvement plan to identify measurable steps to ensure each material line is auditable, and ensure all major deficiencies are resolved.  

This project supports the Research, Development, Test and Evaluation, Navy (RDT&amp;E,N) portion of the larger DoD and Navy-wide effort to implement the Financial Improvement Plan (FIP).  Corrective actions required to resolve known deficiencies and determine resource requirements (people and systems) are being identified.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Standards, Policy, and Guidelines: - Alignment of SPGs across the Naval Enterprise and with OSD and Joint organizations will support standard acquisition implementation and improve compatibility and interoperability thereby lowering development and maintenance costs across programs												
- Aggregating systems for the purpose of conducting certification and accreditation and consolidating mandatory documentation for aggregations versus individual systems will optimize (cost tradeoffs and focus on high priority issues) certifications, reduce paperwork and associated costs, and put attention on systems engineering, IA, and ISPs for systems in their aggregated operational state vice just the individual system development state.   Document costs for major programs are $1 to $3.5 Million per system.  An aggregation may include 15 or more systems with four or more being major systems.  Aggregation presents a high potential for Return on Investment.												
- NR-KPP processes will clarify requirements and capabilities (including their metrics) that acquisition programs need to develop systems.  This clarification will eliminate guesses in terms of operational needs, thereby reducing the risk of program failure and reducing program and life-cycle costs.

The vast majority of these items represent fixed costs associated with Scientists and Engineers supporting the Navy's Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Programs.  

The Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) Billings project 2353 funds accounting services provided to ONR and Navy Research and Development (R&amp;D) activities.

The decrease in the Office of Naval Research Navy ERP project 3234 is due to reduced costs associated with the initial stand-up of N-ERP.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports ONR leadership, management and direction for the Naval S&amp;T program.  This project funds ONR Corporate salaries, communications, and other fixed costs at ONR Headquarters and field offices.  ONR sponsors scientific advances, which lead to Future Naval Capabilities (FNC's), supporting the Fleet's ability to operate from a position of technological superiority.  Functions performed include (1) scientific and technical direction of the nationwide 6.1 basic research program with colleges, universities, non-profit organizations and Naval Laboratories and Warfare Centers; (2) scientific and technical direction of the 6.2 applied research program through the Naval R&amp;D laboratories and Warfare Centers and industry; (3) scientific and technical direction of the Naval 6.3 advanced technology development program through the Navy's R&amp;D laboratories, Warfare Centers and industry; (4) management, resource formulation, program assessment, and contract negotiation/administration of the Navy basic research, applied research and advanced technology development program; and (5) coordination of the Navy's Technology Base program within the context of total DoD/Government (e.g., National Science Foundation, National Academy of Sciences) R&amp;D initiatives in order to maximize scientific advances.  This project also supports ONR management and direction for the following Navy-wide programs: Small Business Innovation Research, Naval Research Advisory Committee, Navy Patent Program, Historically Black Colleges and Universities/Minority Institutions Program, Navy Manufacturing Technology Program and the Ballistic Missile Submarine Nuclear (SSBN) Security Technology Program.  In addition, this project supports ONR's Navy-wide responsibilities in the negotiation and establishment of indirect cost rates for DoD-assigned universities and performance of contract administration for all DoD contracts/grants at all colleges and universities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The RDT&amp;E ship and aircraft inventory is required to adequately test new and improved weapon systems, stay current with threats, and increase warfighting capability of the fleet. The program provides integrated logistics support for aircraft at selected field activities; provides depot-level rework of aircraft, engines, and components for the Navy inventory of RDT&amp;E aircraft; and provides support for ships and aircraft bailed to contractors for Navy RDT&amp;E projects. Costs covered under this element include aircrew training and proficiency, fuel, supplies, equipment, repair, Aviation Depot Level Repairables, overhaul of ships and aircraft, as well as organizational, intermediate, and depot maintenance of ships and aircraft in the Navy RDT&amp;E inventory.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

This continuing project funds costs associated with RDT&amp;E fixed and rotary wing aircraft which accommodate test and evaluation of aircraft/weapon systems. Testing aboard these platforms reduces the number of fleet units required to support RDT&amp;E efforts.  Included in these costs are Aviation Depot-Level Repairables (AVDLR), which are spare and replacement aircraft parts and components to support overhead maintenance related flight operations, aircrew training, and proficiency flight hours. This project also funds airframe Standard Depot Level Maintenance (SDLM), the Integrated Maintenance Concept (IMC) and Phased Depot Maintenance (PDM), in-service repairs, emergency repairs, and engine repairs, as well as aircraft material condition and field inspections. Additionally, it funds Individual Material Readiness List (IMRL) tools and support equipment, and other systems for application to and compatibility with RDT&amp;E requirements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides for the maintenance of Hull Mechanical and Electrical (HM&amp;E) and installed Combat Systems of the Self-Defense Test Ship (SDTS) in support of the Navy Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) of ship self-defense systems. Testing aboard this ship reduces the number of fleet units required to support RDT&amp;E efforts. 

SDTS provides the capability to safely test self-defense weapon systems within their minimum range. A major cost of this project is regularly scheduled ship, combat system and remote control maintenance. The remainder of the funds is used for purchase of expendable supplies and routine equipment, fuel and petroleum products, and repairs and supporting services. Most costs are fixed and are associated with simply having this platform in the inventory.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The T&amp;E Enterprise consolidates all Air Warfare (AW) Ship Self Defense (SSD) at-sea testing across multiple class ships, beginning with CVN 74, LHD 8, LPD17, LHA 6, DDG 1000, CVN 78, and Littoral Combat Ship (LCS). This consolidated AW SSD test and evaluation approach meets the Probability of Raid Annihilation (PRA) (PRA is defined as a required surface ship defense against Anti-Ship Cruise Missiles), Self Defense Test Ship (SDTS) testing requirements as outlined in Air Warfare Ship Self Defense Enterprise TEMP 1714, and lead/operational ship testing requirements for ESSM TEMP 1471, RAM Blk 2 TEMP 286-1, DDG 1000 TEMP 1560, CVN 78 TEMP 1610, CEC TEMP 1415, SSDS TEMP 1400, LHA 6 TEMP 1697, AN/SPQ-9B TEMP 1463, SEWIP TEMP 1658 (Block 1A), 0686, and LCS TEMP 1695.

LHA 6 acquisition, installation and testing supports all big deck Amphibs and Carriers in the OA configuration as well as RAM BLK 2 OPEVAL, SSDS OA with RAM BLK 2, First non AEGIS SEWIP and ESSM.

The T&amp;E Enterprise merges common ship, element, and system requirements into the least number of test events while leveraging planned Combat System Ship Qualification Trials (CSSQTs) to accomplish Developmental Testing (DT) and Operational Testing (OT) requirements. All tests on the SDTS require the sharing of infrastructure, missile range allocations, execution time and underway time to eliminate duplicative testing. 

T&amp;E Enterprise preserves end-to-end mission Operational Testing in a realistic operational environment, capitalizing on Probability of Raid Annihilation M&amp;S data validated with results of that Operational Testing, and ensuring a consistent approach across ship classes. Applicability of all test events is beneficial across multiple ship classes with the same variation under test.

The T&amp;E Enterprise acquires equipment (FY10-12) for installation onboard the SDTS (FY11-14), conducts test and evaluation on the SDTS and lead/operational ships (FY10-18) and satisfies the Probability of Raid Annihilation (PRA) Testbed Model Development and test execution requirements (FY10-18).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program provides institutional maintenance and operations support for:  the Naval Undersea Warfare Center Detachment Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center, Andros Island, Bahamas; the Environmental Compliance Program; Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD), Point Mugu and China Lake, CA; Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD), Patuxent River, MD; Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) related capabilities at the Pacific Missile Range Facility, Barking Sands, HI; Maintenance and  Repair at NAWCWD and NAWCAD; and the Naval Undersea Warfare Center Keyport Nanoose and Dabob Bay Ranges.  The T&amp;E activities make up the Navy portion of the Department of Defense's Major Range and Test Facility Base.  These activities are chartered to perform T&amp;E for the development and acquisition of technology advanced weapons systems.  Core T&amp;E capabilities and capacity are operated to obtain weapons system performance documentation for acquisition program milestone decisions to provide operational forces with effective weapons systems.  This program provides Navy Acquisition Program Managers required test capabilities; lowers cost of T&amp;E; removes cost and scheduling impact of providing their own T&amp;E resources; and retains the physical airspace, land space and sea space needed to conduct testing.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>As a detachment of Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Division Newport, the mission of the Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center (AUTEC) is to provide the US Navy an underwater range facility for full-spectrum test and evaluation of Undersea Warfare systems and for Fleet training and readiness assessment.  The AUTEC Program Office is headquartered at Newport, RI.  AUTEC's administrative offices are located at West Palm Beach, Florida.  Test facilities are located at Andros Island, Sites 1 through 4, and the Berry Islands in the Bahamas.  AUTEC aircraft make scheduled daily flights between West Palm Beach and Andros Town Airport.  

AUTEC manages and, under service contract, maintains and operates a 500 square nautical miles deep-water and a 100 square nautical miles shallow-water acoustic tracking range; air-target tracking capabilities; sonobuoy simulation systems; electronic warfare threat simulation systems; fixed and rotary wing aircraft; aircraft ground support facilities; acoustic targets; torpedo retrieval and flushing capabilities; open-ocean range craft; marine support facilities; and, data processing and analysis capabilities.  

Major test facilities on Andros Island are located at Site 1.  The Command Control Building houses the range tracking displays and replay centers, the computer center, operations support functions, communications center, and the central timing system. The Range Support Facility houses a torpedo post-run workshop, Mark 46 /Mark 50 lightweight torpedo Intermediate Maintenance Activity (IMA), a Mark 30 undersea target IMA, a Mark 48 heavyweight torpedo Research and Development (R&amp;D) Turnaround facility and related technical facilities. The complex includes electrical and physical calibration labs, a complete electronics maintenance shop, a dive locker, a precision machine shop, and logistics support areas.

AUTEC has a 285-foot concrete pier with a controlling depth of 17 feet (5.2 meters) at mean low tide. An adjacent wharf is approximately 240 feet in length (72 meters) with a controlling depth of 15 feet at mean low tide.  Power is available at both locations.  Facilities at the pier/marine area include fully equipped machine /fabrication and marine overhaul shops.  Also at Site 1, six Range User Buildings are maintained  for assembling test equipment and equipment check-out during test mobilization or dockside periods. These staging areas are equipped with a variety of power sources, gantry cranes, compressed air and security features. A fully equipped range user hanger for ground maintenance and storage of helicopters is located at the AUTEC helicopter airstrip.  Sites 2, 3, and 4 are small instrumented areas located south of Site 1 used to extend tracking of sonobuoys, communications, and air target track.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project provides continuing maintenance and operational support for the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) capabilities.  These capabilities include the Pacific Ranges and Facilities, consisting of China Lake Ranges and the Point Mugu Sea Range, aerial and surface targets, test instrumentation, and T&amp;E aircraft.  The Pacific Ranges use China Lake's 1.1 million acres of land and 17,000 square miles of military restricted (R-2508) airspace together with Point Mugu's 125,000 square miles of instrumented sea range and 36,000 square miles of controlled overlying airspace, and airfield and test instrumentation at San Nicolas Island to perform its T&amp;E mission.  Included in the China Lake ranges is the Electronic Combat Range (ECR), which provides outdoor free space development and operational testing of airborne electronic warfare systems and tactics against shipboard and land based air defense systems. These ranges perform metric radar, multilateration and optical  tracking of test objects; command, control,  and destruct for range safety purposes; communications; frequency interference control and analysis; collection processing and display of telemetered data; real-time data processing and display; and the operation of a sub scale aerial target launch capability.  Other test capabilities include an outdoor High Power Microwave measurement facility; propulsion, warhead, environmental, rocket motor, and other missile component test facilities;  and gun ranges.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element (PE) provides Commander, Operational Test and Evaluation Force (COMOPTEVFOR) general support funding for headquarters annual operating costs and ensures COMOPTEVFOR compliance with Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) and Secretary of the Navy (SECNAV) directives to conduct independent operational testing and evaluation. Funding supports planning, conducting, and reporting on the operational effectiveness and suitability of new and improved systems and recommending fleet usage to the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO). Funding also supports ongoing development and implementation of new requirements relative to integrated testing. The CNO, as well as acquisition executives and managers at all levels, have a continuing need for expeditious and efficient conduct of Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&amp;E) by COMOPTEVFOR in support of training and equipping fleet forces.  To this end, this funding supports COMOPTEVFOR's continued pursuit of a variety of senior management initiatives aimed at increasing efficiencies in T&amp;E; these senior management initiatives include IT database and decision making technology upgrades, implementation of Integrated Testing and Mission Based Test Design across all programs, and improved staffing and expertise in the areas of DON acquisition processes, Modeling and Simulation, Statistical Studies, Cost Analysis, Information Assurance, and similar disciplines. All of these senior management initiatives are aimed at improving the quality of testing and evaluation, thus ensuring delivery to fleet units of fully tested and capable combat systems.  OT&amp;E issues have direct long term Navy-wide implications on the Fleet's readiness and war fighting capability. Rapid advances in technology, changes in fleet tactics, and increased complexity of weapons systems and platforms, combined with reductions in manpower, force structure, and budgets have created an increased need for technical and operational analyses that are sophisticated and timely in order to ensure an optimal return on investment of Navy resources. Funding is also provided for Navy support of the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) sponsored Joint Test and Evaluation (JT&amp;E) program.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program element (PE) provides Commander, Operational Test and Evaluation Force (COMOPTEVFOR) general support funding for headquarters annual operating costs and ensures COMOPTEVFOR compliance with Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) and Secretary of the Navy (SECNAV) directives to conduct independent operational testing and evaluation. Funding supports planning, conducting, and reporting on the operational effectiveness and suitability of new and improved systems and recommending fleet usage to the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO). Funding also supports ongoing development and implementation of new requirements relative to integrated testing. The CNO, as well as acquisition executives and managers at all levels, have a continuing need for expeditious and efficient conduct of Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&amp;E) by COMOPTEVFOR in support of training and equipping fleet forces.  To this end, this funding supports COMOPTEVFOR's continued pursuit of a variety of senior management initiatives aimed at increasing efficiencies in T&amp;E; these senior management initiatives include IT database and decision making technology upgrades, implementation of Integrated Testing and Mission Based Test Design across all programs, and improved staffing and expertise in the areas of DON acquisition processes, Modeling and Simulation, Statistical Studies, Cost Analysis, Information Assurance, and similar disciplines. All of these senior management initiatives are aimed at improving the quality of testing and evaluation, thus ensuring delivery to fleet units of fully tested and capable combat systems.  OT&amp;E issues have direct long term Navy-wide implications on the Fleet's readiness and war fighting capability. Rapid advances in technology, changes in fleet tactics, and increased complexity of weapons systems and platforms, combined with reductions in manpower, force structure, and budgets have created an increased need for technical and operational analyses that are sophisticated and timely in order to ensure an optimal return on investment of Navy resources. Funding is also provided for Navy support of the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) sponsored Joint Test and Evaluation (JT&amp;E) program.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>As indicated in section A above, funding provides for core headquarters operations and support (O&amp;S) costs related to required operational testing and evaluation (T&amp;E) conducted in support of Navy acquisition programs. The preponderance of funding provides for the annual O&amp;S costs for day to day operations of the staff/headquarters of COMOPTEVFOR, located in Norfolk, Virginia. (Pursuant to DoD Financial Management Regulations and Navy financial policy guidance, as a T&amp;E activity, COMOPTEVFOR's annual support costs are funded via RDTEN vice OMN; hence, and unlike most RDT&amp;EN programs, these funds provide for O&amp;S costs typical of military field commands/activities). Within this project, over 1/2 of the funding supports salaries of assigned civilian personnel. The remaining funds provide for other routine support costs such as travel, IT support, supplies, and other overhead/administrative support costs. The primary metric used within the project involves support for scheduled Navy acquisition program testing and subsequent analysis and reporting of results of testing to appropriate senior Navy acquisition officials and to the Navy chain of command directly to the CNO and various OPNAV/SECNAV staff offices. The performance goal is met when all assigned/scheduled testing and reporting is supported each year. Specific test program success is measured through analytic results of testing conducted throughout the year and constant interaction with program offices, acquisition decision makers, OPNAV staff resource sponsor offices, OSD and other service T&amp;E offices/activities, and miscellaneous other customers/stakeholders. This project also supports testing and evaluation of various Joint/multi-service programs in which the Navy shares responsibilities in support of the acquisition community. The following metrics relate directly to the funding provided and are applicable to current operations.                            
                              
Number of Tests Conducted - FY11 = 110; FY12 = 119; FY13 = 119
Number of Programs Supported - FY11 = 420; FY12 = 425; FY13 = 425</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) Reduction and Radio Frequency (RF) Management. This project develops tools, processes, and algorithms to identify and reduce EMI sources for Navy systems and platforms. 

(a) Automated spectrum capabilities will be enhanced to comply with fleet operational requirements and streamline Strike Force frequency management processes. It will provide automated Spectrum Management (SM) tools for development of operational task communication and radar/weapon plans to support fleet deployments, exercises, contingency operations, and the war on terrorism. It will provide identification and mitigation of EMI in Navy, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Allied, Ashore and Joint Combat Operations.

(b) It will support the Shipboard Electromagnetic Compatibility Improvement Program (SEMCIP), an element of the Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) Systems Engineering Program to identify, engineer, and evaluate effectiveness of potential EMI corrections.

(c) Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) Survivability Program assesses the EMP survivability of all mission critical systems and funds development of a hardness assurance and maintenance program. Develops improved modeling capability to reduce hardness validation costs at delivery and over the lifetime of the system/platform. Provides design criteria, test methodology, test limits, and survivability validation procedures for all Navy systems, ships, submarines and shore facilities.

(d) Advanced Technology: Investigates below deck electromagnetic environmental effects and develops the capability to perform remote spectrum monitoring and electromagnetic noise monitoring. Also, develops the tools and technologies for innovative and efficient spectrum use, and continues the development of relationships between measured EMI and system performance for selected communications systems.

(e) FY11 OCO Planned Program funds will be used for Combat Enabler in Theater OIF / OEF-A and Pre-Deployment OIF / OEF-A.

(f) FY13 Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) Request: Combat Enabler in Theatre Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom - Afghanistan (OEF-A) - Joint Emitters during the continuing OCO operations was a source of debilitating electromagnetic interference to critical United States Navy (USN) Air Operations (OPS) and Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) assets.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

						($1.900) Combat Enabler in Theater (Overseas Contingency Operation - OCO) Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom - Afghanistan (OEF-A): Joint Emitters during the continuing OCO operations was a source of debilitating Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) to critical air operations and BMD assets.  In response to FY11 OIF and OEF-A requirements, funding will be used to expand afloat and ashore spectrum management tools to address the critical need for interoperability with the USMC's spectrum management applications and put into place a joint capability for the warfighter.  USN/USMC integration promotes interoperability with the multi-national deployed forces fighting the OCO and decreases the risk of friendly fire incidents.  Accurate and timely information on the interoperability of USN and USMC systems provided by this joint capability leverages the response of both the USN and USMC to OCO. Increased situational awareness, reduction of interference, and restored mission capability are all expected benefits of the improved processes and procedures.  The requested funds will deliver a joint capability system that allows group planning and execution, information data discovery, data interoperability, and data fusion to USN and USMC forces directly supporting OIF and the OCO. Data tasking and deliverables are classified.

($3.300) In-Theater &amp; Pre-Deployment (OCO) OIF and OEF-A: Funding to address impact of upgrades to deploying ships and development of an EMI solution for the deploying strike group.  This funding will be used to evaluate and mitigate potential EMI problems that may be introduced as the fleet continues to field additional variants of combat systems and commission new ships.  Timely development of EMI solutions restores combat capability lost due to EMI.  In theater requirements demand an acceleration of the development of EMI solutions &amp; prototype hardware (in theater) in order to prompt EMI mitigation.  Evaluation of short-term and long-term EMI fix evaluation on deploying ships is required to determine optimum EMI solution. Funds requested support the procurement and installation of EMI Solutions within 12 months for strike groups and independent deployers.  Higher operating tempo and incremental costs associated with increased pace of Fleet Deployments drive an accelerated response to the development of EMI Fixes which then supports higher usage of equipment (rate of return) and extends communication capabilities.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Link Crimson program was congressionally chartered in 1977 (updated in 1980) to oversee the tactical use of reconnaissance satellites. The program rapidly develops (1-2 years) prototype systems, sensors, and software that exploit space systems to support tactical Fleet problems.  Additionally, Link Crimson focuses on elements of National Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) systems and National-Tactical Integration operations to rapidly fill tactical capability gaps via improved, fused, all-source products at multiple security levels.  Link Crimson also supports and participates in fleet exercises, which provide the venue for testing and demonstrating new prototype capabilities and enhancements to existing programs into which R&amp;D efforts transition.

This program supports the operations and installations required for general research and development use.  Program baseline funds will address research and development into potential unmanned vehicles, irregular warfare, anti-piracy, strike, information operations, battle space and maritime domain awareness (anti-submarine warfare and anti-surface warfare), fusion, visualization, ballistic missile defense (BMD) threats and cross-domain and cyber solutions.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element (PE) provides the analytical foundation for the Marine Corps Studies System (MCSS), including mandated Mission Area Analyses and Cost and Operational Effectiveness Analyses. The MCSS is the front end of the Marine Corps' acquisition system.  This PE also supports the material acquisition process as follows: managing the Marine Corps Operational Test and Evaluations (OT&amp;E); providing Chem Bio Consequence Management of capabilites for Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) incident response forces; and conducting Phase 0 activities to investigate potential material solutions that validate needs, program costs, business decisions, and prevent undue delays in pursuing priority requirements.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Marine Corps Operational Test and Evaluation Activity (MCOTEA) supports the material acquisition process by managing the Marine Corps Operational Test (OT) programs for Acquisition Categories (ACAT) I through ACAT IV (less OT of manned aircraft) and performs other functions that may be directed by the Commandant of the Marine Corps. The primary purpose of Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&amp;E) is to provide information to the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) regarding the Operational Effectiveness (OE) and Operational Suitability (OS) of the system addressed at a decision point.  MCOTEA must ensure that the Marines in the Operating Forces receive the very best possible equipment and support.  MCOTEA must also ensure each system proposed for acquisition is tested adequately, evaluated objectively and reported independently.
     Marine Corps Operational Test and Evaluation Activity (MCOTEA) is the only unit that provides the Marine Corps with required operational test and evaluation (OT&amp;E) capability, ensuring the Marine Corps is compliant with laws and regulations, and ensuring that training and equipment are operationally effective, relevant, and suitable.  Additionally, MCOTEA's early involvement, coordination, and oversight in developmental testing and evaluation of new combat and combat support systems ensures that our Marines are the best trained, and have the best equipment, with the lowest test costs for taxpayers.  Finally, MCOTEA's support of rapid acquisitions ensures that Marines in the fight are supported with the newest and most advanced equipment and that the Marine Corps is compliant with regulations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Family of Incident Response Systems (FIRS) consists of equipment, systems, and services designed to provide Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) incident response forces the capabilities needed to effectively respond to a terrorist attack using Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High-Yield Explosives (CBRNE). The Family of Incident Response Systems meets the mission requirements for the detection; mass casualty decontamination; force protection; responder inter-agency interoperability; C4I; urban search and rescue; medical and general support requirements needed by these forces to mitigate the effects of a CBRNE terrorist attack. The Family of Incident Response Systems relies primarily on Commercial Off-The-Shelf/Non-Developmental Items (COTS/NDI) equipment and systems that meet the particular mission requirements of Consequence Management (CM).   Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical (NBC) systems are adopted if they meet the CM mission requirements.  The Family of Incident Response Systems (FIRS) R&amp;D effort allows the program to keep abreast of emerging technologies in the commercial sector and address operational capability gaps that cannot be met by commercial items.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Phase A (previously known as Phase 0) Activities consist of a series of interrelated activities of the acquisition process designed to investigate potential material solutions to validate needs, estimate program costs, support sound business decisions, correct inherent disconnects between the Programming, Planning, Budgeting and Execution (PPBE) cycle, the Combat Development and Acquisition Management Systems, and prevent undue delays in pursuing priority requirements.  The process supports Commanding General (CG), MCCDC and Commander, Marine Corps Systems Command (COMMARCORSYSCOM) by providing funding to priority programs, thus allowing for the examination of concepts and alternatives to support an orderly transition from requirements to initiatives and initiatives to funded programs.  This will permit the POM process to focus on activities of evaluating, prioritizing and integrating rather than defining and resolving raw, immature requirements.  

Phase A activities "jump start" high priority programs of the acquisition process. Furthermore, since 70% of a program's life cycle cost is determined during Phase A, this initiative will put resources to work where the return on investment is the greatest.  Typical studies conducted on Phase A activities include, but are not limited to Market Surveys, Business Case Analysis (BCA), Cost as an Independent Variable (CAIV) analysis, Life Cycle Cost Estimates, Cost Comparison Analysis, Acquisition Strategies, and Trade-off Analysis in lieu of an Analysis of Alternatives.

To satisfy the emerging requirements, the Deputy Commandant for Combat Development is leading the Marine Expeditionary Force Future Vehicle (MEFFV) effort to conduct Joint Capability Integration and Development System analysis to establish a capabilities framework specifically tailored to assess technologies for transition to the Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF.  MEFFV efforts are directed at capability refinement and integration, analysis of multiple concepts, determining technology objectives, and continued development of Initial Capabilities Documents (ICDs) and Capabilities Development Documents supporting ''spin-out'' technology transitions.  This budget item supports combat development activities supporting the three Marine Requirements Oversight Council (MROC) priorities in compliance with JROC and USD AT&amp;L guidance to participate in a Joint Program with the Army's Future Combat Systems Program.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>SURFACE ELECTRONIC CAPABILITY AUGMENTATION CAPABILITY SUPPORT:  This is a continuing program that will provide advanced technologies and capabilities to current Electronic Warfare (EW) / Electronic Intelligence (ELINT) System Programs of Record (POR).  The program develops concepts of data / information exchange within the Global Information Grid (GIG).  To comply with the intent of the GIG, this program addresses compression, transmission, decompression, re-compression and long-term storage of targeted data / information without degradation.  This program will become an enabler for future capabilities such as remote operation of surface, subsurface, and air EW/ELINT open architecture PORs.  A holistic approach to data / information format, processing transmission, and storage will require developments in antenna technology, communications capabilities, operational concepts, and software development.

COMTENTHFLT MARITIME OPERATIONS CENTER (MOC):  The Maritime Operations Center (MOC) visualization system provides the common operational picture (COP) in support of the Commander's mission requirements.  The system design permits the connection of numerous data feeds at various security classification levels in order to project and adjust the COP as required on multiple output displays electronically.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>SURFACE ELECTRONIC CAPABILITY AUGMENTATION CAPABILITY SUPPORT:  This is a continuing program that will provide advanced technologies and capabilities to current Electronic Warfare (EW) / Electronic Intelligence (ELINT) System Programs of Record (POR).  The program develops concepts of data / information exchange within the Global Information Grid (GIG) as envisioned by Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and outlined within the FORCEnet concept.  To comply with the intent of the GIG, this program addresses compression, transmission, decompression, re-compression and long-term storage of targeted data / information without degradation.  This program will become an enabler for future capabilities such as remote operation of surface, subsurface, and air EW/ELINT open architecture PORs.  A holistic approach to data / information format, processing transmission, and storage will require developments in antenna technology, communications capabilities, operational concepts, and software development.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Per the FY 2005 National Defense Authorization Act, Navy Joint National Training Capability (JNTC) RDT&amp;E is managed by US Fleet Forces Command (USFF) Joint &amp; Sustainment Branch (N71) from P/E 0804758N.  This management reflects the decentralized execution of JNTC RDT&amp;E from JFCOM.  Throughout the FYDP, these funds will continue to be managed and executed by USFF N71.

The Navy continues to develop joint training technologies that will play a crucial role in it's ability to address current and future joint operational training requirements. Navy program activities include conducting research, development, test and evaluation and cross-service architecture certification on Navy capable systems, developing architectures and roadmaps to ensure that service instrumentation follows a common standard, and researching and assessing Navy mission rehearsal, Joint Semi-Automated Forces (JSAF), Joint National Training Capability (JNTC) Joint Live-Virtual Constructive (JLVC) Federation Object Model (FOM) Interoperabilities.

The Navy will further develop capabilities that integrate live, virtual, and constructive elements into a seamless joint training environment.  Using a scientific and phased approach, Navy will leverage and research new technologies and methods, based upon focused joint operational training requirements, that provide a crucial technology-based foundation supporting all current and "to be" Navy joint training capabilities.  Available commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) and government -off-the-shelf (GOTS) networked information technologies and collaborative planning tools will be leveraged to provide improved net-centric joint training capability.  Navy will lead the collaboration process to identify, collect and validate the requirements in order to design and develop the modeling and simulation  capabilities that address the shortfalls in current abilities to support Joint Task training to standards.

The Navy Joint Live-Virtual Constructive (JLVC) Federation Object Model (FOM) development program is the primary means of providing a persistent and interoperable netowork among the Navy, Joint and Coalition federation components.

The Navy JNTC RDT&amp;E Program efforts directly support the Unified Command Plan (UCP) series and is aligned with the DoD Information Operations (IO) Roadmap.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>1) Navy Warfare Development Command (NWDC) will produce one Joint Semi-Automated Forces (JSAF) software release to include documentation; will design and implement upgrades to JSAF consistent with approved requirements and Change Requests and document the effects of JSAF capabilities (robustness) and stability.  Will design, implement, test, and integrate JSAF enhancements in accordance with requirements.

2) NWDC will produce one Navy Training FOM (NTF) release to include applicable documentation updates for the Guidance, Rational, and Interoperability Manual (GRIM) and Federation Agreement Document (FAD).  Will implement JSAF capability enhancements to support evolving joint and Coalition training requirements. 

3) NWDC will deliver one Navy Continuous Training Environment (NCTE) Interoperability Guide update to be promulagated to all NCTE users.

4)  Facilitate integration by providing dedicated support to the effort, improving the quality of participation and documentation of Navy efforts in the Joint National Training Capability (JNTC).  Refine and mature the Navy Training Federation Object Model (NTF), improving interoperability and integration with other services and the Joint community.  Provides a standardized Federation Object Model (FOM) for integration across the Navy training simulations.

5)  Current Joint Live-Virtual-Constructive (JLVC) and other federation simulation distribution is accomplished by tying simulation data to multicast groups.  This is neither a scalable solution nor is it an effective one as federates are not able to publish and subscribe with fine enough precision.  The Simulation Aware Software Router will address this shortcoming and additionally provide a flexible solution for federating heterogeneous networks and on-the-wire protocols without forcing all federates onto a single, uniform, lowest common denominator solution for each training event.  Ultimately, a simulation aware router will allow simulation users to optimize the network for both simulation scalable traffic and for voice and Command, Control, Communications, (Computers), Intelligence (C4I) traffic.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>
