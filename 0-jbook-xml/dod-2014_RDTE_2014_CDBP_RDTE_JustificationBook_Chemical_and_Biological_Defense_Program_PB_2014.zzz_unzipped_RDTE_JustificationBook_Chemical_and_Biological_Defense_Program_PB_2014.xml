                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element supports the Joint Service basic research program for Chemical, Biological, and Radiological (CBR) defense.  The objective of the basic research program is to advance fundamental knowledge and understanding of those fundamental sciences identified as having potential future impact on the Chemical and Biological Defense Program, with an emphasis in exploring new and innovative research for combating or countering chemical, biological and radiological weapons.  Moreover, basic research supports a Joint Force concept of a lethal, integrated, supportable, highly mobile force with enhanced capability by the individual service member.  Specifically, the program promotes theoretical and experimental research and studies in the physical, life and information sciences.  A portion of this program element directly supports basic research efforts for the transformational medical technologies program.  The work in this program element is consistent with the Chemical Biological Defense Program Research, Development and Acquisition (RDA) Plan.  Basic research technological breakthroughs support applied research (PE 0602384BP) activities.  Basic research activities described in this budget justification leverage existing research programs and activities within the DoD and other government agencies and promotes cross-pollination between government and academia, as well as sponsors promising efforts of world class scientists.  The projects in this PE are placed in BA1, because they are basic research efforts directed towards non-specific or non-unique military applications.  \

Key efforts within this PE are in support of the FY14 policy priorities for Countering Biological Threats.  This PE supports the priority to "Leverage science, technology, and innovation through domestic and international partnerships and agreements to improve global capacity to respond to and recover from biological incidents."  These efforts are captured in the Life Sciences project and total $34.6M.

The Projects within this BA changed in FY13 to reflect the research areas of Life Sciences (LF1), and Physical Sciences (PS1).  The previous IS1 and TB1 efforts were consolidated into LF1 and PS1.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Efforts in Life Sciences (Basic Research) include: innovative biotechnology approaches with potential application for rapidly identifying, diagnosing, preventing, and treating disease resulting from exposure to biological or chemical agents, or from radiological exposure; biological and bio-inspired science addressing concepts such as synthetic biology, biomimetics; and other emerging areas of science to build a foundation for developing novel materials.  Ultimately, knowledge gained through research in this area supports the development of medical and physical countermeasures against biological or chemical agents in areas such as diagnostics, detection, biosurveillance, protection (both physical and vaccine) and therapeutic intervention.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Examined polymicrobial interactions that may impact the growth of biological agents and/or their course of disease.  Investigated immunological and physiological bases for tolerance to, or protection against, organophosphorous agents.  Characterized the host response to ionizing radiation and mechanisms of injury.  Studied the evolution of viral and bacterial families at the genomic and phenotypic levels and characterized molecular signatures of virulence and/or manipulation in the laboratory (e.g., genetic modification and culturing).  Explored the mechanisms by which viruses modulate virulence and target host species.  Investigated mechanisms behind the functionality of biological systems.  Explored novel techniques for the design and synthesis of biomimetic reagents for affinity and reactivity.</r2:Text>

Investigate and evaluate systemic biological responses following exposure of living systems to CB agents.  Improve understanding of polymicrobial interactions influencing response to or course of disease.  Exploit advances in systems biology to mine "omics" experimental designs involving agents and hosts to provide new biomarkers, targets and options.  "Omics" informally refers to a field of study in biology ending in "-omics", such as genomics or proteomics.  Explore materials in biotic/abiotic interface and biomimetics to enable functional molecular development (such as robust synthetic enzymes).  In FY13, all research from TBMDB TMT/TB1: Transformational Medical Technologies was realigned to Life Sciences (LF1).</r2:Text>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project (PS1) advances fundamental scientific knowledge in physical science areas that include chemistry, physics, materials science, environmental sciences, and nanotechnology that could potentially lead to transformational CB defensive capabilities enhancing Warfighter performance and safety.  Research results in physics, chemistry and materials sciences have potential application in point and standoff detection, as well as protection and decontamination.  Surface and environmental sciences focus on the study of physical and chemical properties and phenomena of interactions, especially with regard to Non Traditional Agents (NTAs), that seek to improve capabilities such as detection, protection, and decontamination.  Research in nanotechnology and nanoscale sciences, such as nanoelectromechanical systems, molecular motors, nanomechanical resonance sensing, and nanometer imaging, has potential application across CB capability areas to provide significant enhancement by, for example, decreasing detection response times, increasing medical countermeasure effectiveness against a wider array of threat agents, and providing currently unavailable modalities like detection imbedded in fabrics.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project (TB1) supports basic research of vaccines, diagnostic tools, and therapeutic drugs to provide effective medical defense against validated biological threat agents including bacteria, toxins, and viruses.  Research efforts advance promising innovative biotechnology approaches with the potential to rapidly identify, diagnose, prevent, and treat disease due to exposure to biological threat agents.  This project supports core science efforts that may be applied to biological defense capability areas, such as Pretreatments, Diagnostics, and Therapeutics.   

This project includes basic research to support Transformational Medical Technologies (TMT) efforts.  The program was launched to respond to the threat of emerging or intentionally bioengineered biological threats.  Research efforts evaluate the molecular characteristics of the interaction between host and pathogen, characterize the host's response to infection/intoxication and identify common mechanisms and/or pathways.  The research also studies the correlates of immunity (common response against different pathogens), and looks for pre-symptomatic bio-markers.

In FY13, all Project TB1 research efforts are re-aligned to Project LF1 - Life Sciences (Basic Research).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Funding under this program element (PE) sustains a robust defense program, which both reduces the danger of a Chemical, Biological, or Radiological (CBR) attack and enables U.S. forces to survive, and continue operations in a CBR environment.  The medical program (was TB2, TC2, TR2, but in FY13 these continue within one project, TM2) focuses on the development of antidotes, drug treatments, disease surveillance and point-of-need diagnostic devices, patient decontamination and medical technologies management.  The Medical Countermeasures Initiative (MCMI) (was in TB2, but it too continues in FY13 in TM2, consistent with consolidation of the medical program) was established to provide the capability for the advancement of regulatory science and flexible manufacturing of biological MCM to address CBR threats, including novel and previously unrecognized, naturally-occurring emerging infectious diseases.  In the physical sciences area, the emphasis is on continuing improvements in CB defense materiel, including contamination avoidance, decontamination, and protection technologies, as well as biological weapon/agent surveillance.  NT2 consolidated all efforts related to NTAs, including medical pretreatments, therapeutics, detection, threat agent science, modeling, and protection and hazard mitigation.  Research efforts are planned to be initiated for CB defense technologies that will result from a strategic approach of converging nanotechnology, biotechnology, information technology and cognitive science.  The PE also provides for applied research in the areas of real-time sensing and immediate biological countermeasures.

Key efforts within this PE are in support of the FY14 policy priorities for Countering Biological Threats.  Approximately $40.8M supports the priority to "Promote global health security efforts through building and improving international capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats, whether caused by natural, accidental, or deliberate events."  Approximately $28.4M supports the priority to "Expand our capability to prevent, attribute, and apprehend those engaged in biological weapons proliferation or terrorism, with a focus on facilitating data sharing and knowledge discovery to improve integrated capabilities."  Approximately $56.9M supports the priority to "Leverage science, technology, and innovation through domestic and international partnerships and agreements to improve global capacity to respond to and recover from biological incidents."

Efforts under this PE will transition to or will provide risk reduction for Advanced Technology Development (PE: 0603384BP), Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (PE: 0603884BP) and System Development and Demonstration (PE: 0604384BP).

In FY13, all NTA efforts (both Medical and Non-Medical) within the PE were re-aligned to Project NT2 - Techbase Non-Traditional Agents Defense.  Also in FY13, all Medical efforts formerly included in Project TB2 (Medical Biological Defense), Project TC2 (Medical Chemical Defense) and Project TR2 (Medical Radiological Defense), were re-aligned to Project TM2 (Techbase Med Defense).  CB2 Physical Science Applied Research continues, and is the project in which biological threat agent surveillance (biosurveillance) research is pursued.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project (CB2) provides physical science applied research to develop future, multi-disciplinary, multi-functional capabilities in life sciences, physical sciences, environmental sciences, mathematics, cognitive sciences, and engineering.  Efforts in this project support the seamless integration of state-of-the-art-technologies into a collection of systems across the spectrum of capabilities required to support chemical and biological defense missions.  Capability areas in this project include: detection; Information systems technology; protection/hazard mitigation; and threat agent science.  Detection focuses on developing technologies for standoff and point detection and identification of chemical and biological agents.  Information systems technology focuses on advanced warning and reporting, hazard prediction and assessment, simulation analysis and planning, and systems performance modeling.  Protection and hazard mitigation focuses on providing technologies that protect and reduce the chemical/biological threat or hazard to the Warfighter, weapons platforms, and structures.  Threat agent science is devoted to characterizing threat agents and the hazards they present in terms of agent fate in the environment, toxicology, and pathogenicity.  This project also supports biological threat agent surveillance (biosurveillance).  This project focuses on horizontal integration of CB defensive technologies in support of the Joint Services.  This project also supports applied biosurveillance research.

Multiple projects and associated funding that had been reflected in FY12 with separate CB2 Applied Research project titles (Detection, Information Systems, Protection &amp; Hazard Mitigation, Threat Agent Science) were re-aligned in FY13 into CB2 Techbase Non-Medical (TBNM) Physical Science Applied Research (PSAR), which pursues research on traditional agents.  Further, all non-traditional agent (NTA)-dedicated research formerly in CB2 was re-aligned to Project NT2 - Techbase NTA Defense.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project (TB2) funds applied research on vaccines, therapeutic drugs, and diagnostic capabilities to provide effective medical defense against validated biological threat agents or emerging infectious disease threats including bacteria, toxins, and viruses.  Innovative biotechnology approaches will be incorporated to advance medical systems designed to rapidly identify, diagnose, prevent, and treat disease due to exposure to biological threat agents.  Categories for this project include core science efforts in biological defense capability areas, such as Pretreatments, Diagnostics, and Therapeutics.  Medical Science and Technology (S&amp;T) efforts in this Budget Activity refine promising medical initiatives identified in Budget Activity 1, resulting in the development of countermeasures to protect against and treat the effects of exposure to biological agents.  

This project includes the Transformational Medical Technologies Initiative (TMTI), (funded as the Transformational Medical Technologies (TMT) program in FY12).  The program was launched to respond to the threat of emerging or intentionally engineered biological threats.  TMT's mission is to protect the Warfighter from genetically engineered biological threats by providing a rapid response capability from identification of pathogens to the delivery of medical countermeasures.  This mission is accomplished through two main efforts: 1) developing broad spectrum (multi-agent) therapeutics against biological agents (e.g. one drug that treats multiple agents); and 2) developing platform technologies to assist in the rapid development of medical countermeasures (MCMs) in response to biological agents (e.g. developing new and innovative ways to mass produce drugs in the event of a biological incident). 

The Medical Countermeasures Initiative (MCMI) was established to coordinate inter-related advanced development and flexible manufacturing capabilities, based on partnerships between the government and industry, providing a dedicated, cost-effective, reliable, and sustainable MCM process that meets the Warfighter and national security needs.  Specifically, the MCMI will provide the capability for the advanced development and flexible manufacturing of biological MCM (to include TMT developed MCMs) to address CBRN threats, including novel and previously unrecognized, naturally-occurring emerging infectious diseases.  MCMI efforts within S&amp;T are concentrated in two areas: 1) advancement of regulatory science, and 2) advancements in flexible manufacturing technologies for MCMs.

In FY13, all Project TB2 research is re-aligned into Project TM2 - Techbase Medical Defense.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Platform Technologies are standalone enabling technologies that support MCM development and when strategically aligned, provide a system of systems response capability to an adverse biological event - from the identification of an unknown pathogen to the development of an approved countermeasure ready for delivery to the Warfighter and the nation.  The enabling technologies are divided into five platform areas: Pathogen Characterization, Target Identification, Countermeasure Discovery, Countermeasure Evaluation, and Bioinfomatics.  Applied research efforts include the maturation of the components necessary to develop an integrated capability from pathogen identification and characterization to countermeasure delivery.  Off-the-shelf technologies will be identified, evaluated, and where applicable, refined to demonstrate the ability to provide drug development capabilities.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project (TM2) funds applied research for innovative technology approaches to advance medical systems designed to rapidly identify, diagnose, prevent, and treat disease due to exposure to all three of radiological, chemical and biological threat agents.  Categories for this project include core science efforts in Medical Chemical, Medical Biological, Diagnostics, and the Medical Countermeasures Initiative (MCMI).  Against radiological threats, this project provides investment for the development of pretreatments (prophylaxis) and post-irradiation therapeutics against radiological/nuclear exposure.  Against chemical and biological agents, this project funds applied research for the investigation of new medical countermeasures to include prophylaxes, pretreatments, antidotes, skin decontaminants, and therapeutic drugs against identified and emerging biological and chemical warfare agents.   Medical Science and Technology (S&amp;T) efforts in this Budget Activity refine promising medical initiatives identified in Budget Activity 1, resulting in the development of countermeasures to protect against and treat the effects of exposure to chemical and biological (CB) agents.  Diagnostic research focuses on providing high quality data closer to the point-of-need comprising devise innovation, panels of biomarkers driven by bioinformatics, and epidemiological modeling tools.  

The Medical Countermeasures Initiative (MCMI) was established to coordinate inter-related advanced development and flexible manufacturing capabilities, providing a dedicated, cost-effective, reliable, and sustainable MCM process that meets the Warfighter and national security needs. MCMI efforts within science and technology (S&amp;T) are concentrated in advancing two areas: 1) regulatory science and 2) flexible manufacturing technologies and processes for MCMs.  Efforts conducted in these areas are enablers supporting the DoD Medical Countermeasures Advanced Development and Manufacturing (MCM-ADM) capability.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project (TR2) funds applied research to develop medical countermeasures to protect the Warfighter against acute radiological exposure.  Specifically, innovative technical approaches will be used to develop products to mitigate health consequences resulting from Acute Radiation Exposure (ARS) and Delayed Effects of Acute Radiation Exposure (DEARE).  The research and development of medical countermeasures for radiation exposure will ultimately enhance the survivability of Warfighters and will serve to significantly minimize the development of acute radiation syndromes and subsequent health problems.  Results of efforts funded under this project are collaboratively shared with other government agencies, while the Department of Defense maintains an emphasis on the development of pretreatments to protect military personnel who could be involved in responding to a radiological incident.  In FY13, all research in this area is re-aligned into Techbase Medical Defense (TM2).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element (PE) demonstrates technologies that enhance the ability of U.S. forces to deter, defend against, and survive Chemical, Biological, and Radiological (CBR) warfare.  The PE funds advanced technology development for Joint Service and Service-specific requirements in both medical and physical sciences CBR defense areas.  The medical program (was TB3, TC3, TR3, but in FY13 these continue within one project, TM3), aims to produce biological diagnostic assays and reagents, diagnostic device platforms, pretreatments and therapeutics for bacterial, viral, and toxin threats as well as for chemical threats, and medical devices, as countermeasures for CBR threat agents.  Specific areas of medical investigation include: prophylaxis, pretreatment, antidotes and therapeutics, personnel and patient decontamination, and medical management of casualties.  In the physical sciences area (CB3), the focus is on demonstrations of CB defense technologies, including biological detection, chemical detection, information system technology for hazard prediction and systems performance, and protection, and decontamination. NT3 consolidated all efforts related to non-traditional agents (NTAs), including NTA chemical diagnostics, medical pretreatments, therapeutics, detection, and protection and hazard mitigation. The PE also provides for the conduct of advanced technology development in the areas of real-time sensing, accelerated biological warfare operational awareness, and the restoration of operations following a biological warfare or chemical warfare attack (project TT3).  The PE is dedicated to conducting proof-of-principle field demonstrations, and testing system-specific technologies to meet specific military needs.  Work conducted under this PE will transition to and will provide risk reduction for System Integration/Demonstration (PE 0603884BP/PE 0604384BP) activities.

Key efforts within this PE are in support of the FY14 policy priorities for Countering Biological Threats.  Approximately $71.9M supports the priority to "Promote global health security efforts through building and improving international capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats, whether caused by natural, accidental, or deliberate events."  Approximately $60.0M supports the priority to "Expand our capability to prevent, attribute, and apprehend those engaged in biological weapons proliferation or terrorism, with a focus on facilitating data sharing and knowledge discovery to improve integrated capabilities."  Approximately $75.4M supports the priority to "Leverage science, technology, and innovation through domestic and international partnerships and agreements to improve global capacity to respond to and recover from biological incidents."

To recap, in FY13, all traditional agent Medical Biological and Medical Chemical Defense efforts (Projects TB3 and TC3) were re-aligned to Project TM3 - Techbase Medical Defense (ATD).  CB3 Advanced Technology Development efforts continue to pursue solutions against traditional agents.  All non-traditional agent (NTA)-dedicated research (both medical and non-medical) was re-aligned to Project NT3 - Techbase Non-Traditional Agents Defense (ATD).    Project TT3, Techbase Technology Transition, pursues efforts  to enhance military operational capability, concepts of operation, WMD elimination, and hazard mitigation following a biological warfare or chemical warfare attack.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

This project focuses on demonstrating fast and agile scientific responses to enhance or develop capabilities that address emerging threats.  Efforts in this project support an integrated approach to develop new or enhanced countermeasures against novel and emerging threats through innovative science and technology (S&amp;T) solutions for detection, protection, decontamination and medical countermeasures (MCMs).  Efforts supply test methodologies and supporting science to verify capabilities, develop protection and hazard mitigation options, expand hazard assessment tools, and develop MCMs against NTAs.  This project is a comprehensive and focused effort for developing NTA defense capabilities, coordinated with specific interagency partners for doctrine, equipment, and training for the Warfighter and civilian population for defense against NTAs.  This project funds advanced technology development of NTA defense science and technology initiatives and transitions them to Budget Activities 4 and 5.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Enzymes should have the ability to rapidly bind and detoxify nerve agents, and have broad binding specificity and high catalytic efficiency for the destruction of agents.  For enzyme approaches, one molecule of catalytic bioscavenger should be capable of detoxifying numerous molecules of nerve agents resulting in the capability for a small quantity of catalytic bioscavenger to protect against a large dose of nerve agent.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project (TB3) supports preclinical and early phase clinical development of vaccines, therapeutic drugs, and diagnostic capabilities to provide safe and effective medical defense against validated biological threat agents or emerging infectious disease biothreats including bacteria, toxins, and viruses.  Innovative biotechnology approaches to advance medical systems designed to rapidly identify, diagnose, prevent, and treat disease due to exposure to biological threat agents will be evaluated.  Entry of candidate vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostic technologies into advanced development is facilitated by the development of technical data packages that support the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Investigational New Drug (IND) processes, DoD acquisition regulations, and the oversight of early phase clinical trials in accordance with FDA guidelines.  Categories of this project include biological defense capability areas such as Pretreatments, Diagnostics, and Therapeutics.  Pretreatment efforts conduct research and development (R&amp;D) of promising vaccines, medications, and technologies provided prior to potential exposure to biological agents.  The goal is to reduce or to entirely prevent adverse effects of exposure.  Diagnostic efforts are aimed at screening procedures and analytical methods to verify exposure and determine the effects of exposure to biological warfare (BW) or other biothreat agents.  Therapeutic efforts provide medical solutions to sustain and protect the Warfighter in biological environments.  Specifically, therapeutic efforts are aimed at developing medical countermeasures to treat exposure to biological or emerging threats such as bacterial (plague, anthrax, glanders), viral (smallpox, encephalitic Alphaviruses), and toxin (ricin, botulinum neurotoxin, staphylococcal enterotoxin) agents. 

This project includes the Transformational Medical Technologies Initiative (TMTI).  The program was launched to respond to the threat of emerging or intentionally engineered biological threats.  TMT's mission is to protect the Warfighter from genetically engineered or emerging infectious disease biological threats by providing a rapid response capability from identification of pathogens to the delivery of medical countermeasures.  This mission is accomplished through two main efforts: 1) developing broad spectrum (multi-agent) therapeutics against BW or emerging infectious disease agents (e.g. one drug that treats multiple agents); and 2) developing platform technologies to assist in the rapid development of medical countermeasures (MCMs) in response to BW or emerging infectious disease agents (e.g. developing new and innovative ways to mass produce drugs in the event of a biological incident).  Effective FY12 this effort was funded as the Transformational Medical Technologies (TMT) Program. 

The Medical Countermeasures Initiative (MCMI) was established to coordinate inter-related advanced development and flexible manufacturing capabilities providing a dedicated, cost-effective, reliable, and sustainable MCM process that meets the Warfighter and national security needs.  Specifically, the MCMI will provide the capability for the advanced development and flexible manufacturing of biological MCM (to include TMT developed MCMs) to address CBRN threats, including novel and previously unrecognized, naturally-occurring emerging infectious diseases.  MCMI efforts within science and technology (S&amp;T) are concentrated in three areas: 1) transition of novel platform/expression systems for MCMs, 2) transition advancement of regulatory science, and 3) integration of novel platforms with MCM advanced development and manufacturing.

In FY13, all research in this Project (TB3) was re-aligned to Project TM3 - Techbase Medical Defense (ATD).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Platform Technologies are stand alone enabling technologies that support MCM development and when strategically aligned, provide a system of systems response capability to an adverse biological event - from the identification of an unknown pathogen to the development of an approved countermeasure ready for delivery to the Warfighter and the nation.  The enabling technologies are divided into five platform areas: Pathogen Characterization, Target Identification, Countermeasure Discovery, Countermeasure Evaluation, and Bioinfomatics.  Efforts focus on advanced technology and development activities for Platform Technologies to include the maturation of components that will begin the process of integrating a countermeasure response pipeline.  Off-the-shelf technologies will be identified, evaluated, and refined to demonstrate the ability to provide drug development capabilities.  Advanced manufacturing platforms will continue to mature and the technology application will focus on the type of specific therapeutics under development.</r2:Description>

Analytical stability studies, safety and efficacy screening, and preclinical toxicology studies are performed prior to full-scale development of promising pretreatment or treatment drug compounds.  Entry of candidate pretreatment/prophylaxes, therapeutics, and diagnostic technologies into advanced development (i.e., efforts funded in Budget Activities 4 and 5) is facilitated by the development of technical data packages that support the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Investigational New Drug (IND) application and licensure processes, as well as Department of Defense (DoD) acquisition regulations.  Categories for this project include Pretreatments, Diagnostics, and Therapeutics to address Chemical Warfare Agent (CWA) and Non-Traditional Agents (NTAs) exposure.  In FY13, all non-NTA research in this Project (TC3) was re-aligned to Project TM3 - Techbase Medical Defense (ATD).

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project (TE3) supports the development of test and evaluation methodologies and protocols as new science and technology efforts are discovered and transitioned to advanced development programs.  It includes methodology development for chemical and biological defense test and evaluation capabilities, with an emphasis on Non Traditional Agents (NTAs).  These methodologies support development testing and operational testing with regard to advanced development programs that have unique chemical and biological defense requirements.  These new methodologies and testing capabilities include the development of protocol and standards for use of chemical and biological simulants.  In FY13, all NTA-dedicated research was re-aligned to Project NT3 - Techbase Non-Traditional Agents Defense (ATD).  All non-NTA related T&amp;E efforts were completed in FY12.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project (TM3) funds preclinical and early phase clinical development of vaccines, therapeutic drugs, and diagnostic capabilities to provide safe and effective medical defense against validated biological threat agents or emerging infectious disease biothreats including bacteria, toxins, and viruses.  Innovative biotechnology approaches to advance medical systems designed to rapidly identify, diagnose, prevent, and treat disease due to exposure to biological threat agents will be evaluated.  In addition this project supports the advanced development of medical countermeasures to include prophylaxes, pretreatments, antidotes, skin decontaminants and therapeutic drugs against identified and emerging chemical warfare threat agents.  Entry of candidate vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostic technologies into advanced development is facilitated by the development of technical data packages that support the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Investigational New Drug (IND) processes, DoD acquisition regulations, and the oversight of early phase clinical trials in accordance with FDA guidelines.  This project also supports the advanced development of medical countermeasures to protect the Warfighter against radiological/nuclear exposure.

The Medical Countermeasures Initiative (MCMI) was established to coordinate inter-related advanced development and flexible manufacturing capabilities, providing a dedicated, cost-effective, reliable, and sustainable MCM process that meets the Warfighter and national security needs. MCMI efforts within science and technology (S&amp;T) are concentrated in advancing two areas: 1) regulatory science and 2) flexible manufacturing technologies and processes for MCMs.  Efforts conducted in these areas are enablers supporting the DoD Medical Countermeasures Advanced Development and Manufacturing (MCM-ADM) capability.

In FY13, all research in Project (TB3) was re-aligned into Project TM3 - Techbase Medical Defense (ATD).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project (TR3) funds advanced technology development of medical countermeasures against radiological exposure.  Specifically, innovative technical approaches will be used to develop, refine, and transition promising products to advanced development efforts to mitigate health consequences resulting from Acute Radiation Exposure (ARS) and Delayed Effects of Acute Radiation Exposure (DEARE).  Promising products and pertinent science and technology data will be used to support Investigational New Drug (IND) applications and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensure processes, with an emphasis on the development of pretreatments to protect military responders in the event of a radiological incident.  Research efforts and data are collaboratively shared with other government agencies so that more mature and promising product candidates will be quickly transitioned to advanced development efforts.  In FY13, all research in this Project (TR3) was re-aligned to Project TM3 - Techbase Medical Defense (ATD).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project (TT3) validates high-risk/high-payoff technologies, concepts-of-operations, and a new Joint Combat Development concept development and experimentation process that could significantly improve Warfighter capabilities in preparation for transition of mature technologies to advanced development programs requiring chemical and biological (CB) defense technologies.  These programs offer an opportunity to identify and efficiently mature emerging technologies including limited objective experiments, laboratory experiments, risk reduction efforts, engineering and integration.  These demonstrations and programs seek to demonstrate the potential for enhanced military operational capability and/or cost effectiveness.  This project addresses four family of products areas: Biological Resiliency, Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Elimination, Hazard Mitigation and Facilities Protection.  Biological resiliency efforts are targeted to reduce biological threats by: (1) improving Department of Defense (DoD) access to the life sciences to combat infectious disease regardless of its cause; (2) establishing and reinforcing DoD concept of operations (CONOPS) against the misuse of the life sciences; and (3) instituting a suite of coordinated DoD and interagency activities that collectively will help influence, identify, inhibit, and/or interdict those who seek to misuse the life sciences.  WMD Elimination addresses detection, identification, verification and baseline assessments in support of expeditionary forces deployed in non-permissive environments.  Hazard Mitigation addresses Chemical, Biological, and Radiological (CBR) remediation and decontamination processes and demonstrates technologies and methods to restore assets such as mobile equipment, fixed sites, critical infrastructures, personal, and equipment to operational status as a result of having reduced or eliminated CBR contamination.  Facilities protection transitions mature technologies to improve individual and critical infrastructure protection capabilities for U.S. and coalition Warfighters.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This program element supports the Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) of medical and non-medical CB defensive equipment and materiel.  Congress directed centralized management of Department of Defense (DoD) medical and non-medical CB Defense initiatives.  DoD missions for civil support operations have recently expanded and have resulted in providing focus to develop technologies to support CB counterterrorism initiatives.  Projects within BA4 are structured to consolidate Joint and Service-unique tasks within four commodity areas: contamination avoidance, individual and collective force protection, decontamination, and medical countermeasures.  ADC&amp;P is conducted for an array of chemical, biological, and toxin detection and warning systems providing early warning, collector concentrators, generic detection, improved reagents, and decontamination systems using solutions that will remove and/or detoxify contaminated materiel without damaging combat equipment, personnel, or the environment.  CB sensors and diagnostics enhance the Departments environmental and medical surveillance efforts by improving the monitoring and surveillance of threats and forces preparing for and engaged in military operations.  These efforts are required to enable military commanders and the Military Health System to prevent, treat, and mitigate threats to individual Service Members and military units.  Integration of CB sensor and diagnostic data from the programs in this ACD&amp;P will also be usable within the homeland security and Federal public health common operating pictures.  

The Department of Defense is responsible for research, development, acquisition, and deployment of medical countermeasures to prevent or mitigate the health effects of CB threats to the Armed Forces and directs strategic planning for and oversight of programs to support medical countermeasures development and acquisition for our Armed Forces personnel.  The CB medical threat to the Armed Forces, in contrast with public health threats to U.S. citizens, encompasses all potential or continuing enemy actions that can render a Service Member combat ineffective.  CB medical threats, because they apply as a whole to military units deployed on a specific mission and/or operations, may result in the unit being unable to complete its mission.  CB medical countermeasures developed by DoD, unlike those developed to support U.S. population, must support military commanders practical operational requirements and deployment strategies and must emphasizes prevention of injury and illness and protection of the force.  Preventive measures in this ACD&amp;P, such as vaccines against the most likely biological threat agents and traditional / non-traditional chemical agent prophylaxis, conserves fighting strength, decreases the logistics burden by reducing the need for larger deployed hospital footprint and greater demand for tactical and strategic medical evacuation, and satisfies the need for greater flexibility in military planning and operations.  When vaccines and other prophylactic medical countermeasures are not available, efforts on this ACD&amp;P support pre-hospitalization treatment, en-route care, hospital care, and long-term clinical outcomes.  Specific items in this category include improvements to CB diagnostics and therapeutics to mitigate the consequences of biologic agents and exposure to ionizing radiation due to nuclear or radiological attacks.  DoD is the only Federal activity conducting ACD&amp;P on these prophylactic, diagnostic, and therapeutic CB medical countermeasures.  

The Department of Defense coordinates its efforts with the Departments of Health and Human Services to promote synergy and minimize redundancy.  The Department of Defense ensures coordination by participating in the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise interagency strategic planning process ("One Portfolio").  The Department of Defense's longstanding experience and success in CB medical countermeasure research, development, acquisition, and deployment not only ensures protection of the Armed Forces, it also accelerates and improves the overall national efforts in CB medical countermeasure research, development, and acquisition because of its unique facilities, testing capabilities, and trained and experienced personnel.  

ACD&amp;P also supports the development of updated test capabilities to evaluate Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Defense systems.  Also included is the Techbase Technology Transition effort which validates high-risk/high-payoff technologies that could significantly improve Warfighter capabilities.  

Key efforts within this PE are in support of the FY14 policy priorities for Countering Biological Threats.  Approximately $92.9M supports the priority to "Promote global health security efforts through building and improving international capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats, whether caused by natural, accidental, or deliberate events."  Approximately $45.8M supports the priority to "Expand our capability to prevent, attribute, and apprehend those engaged in biological weapons proliferation or terrorism, with a focus on facilitating data sharing and knowledge discovery to improve integrated capabilities."  Approximately $124.0M supports the priority to "Leverage science, technology, and innovation through domestic and international partnerships and agreements to improve global capacity to respond to and recover from biological incidents."

The projects in this program element support efforts in the technology development phase of the acquisition strategy and are therefore correctly placed in Budget Activity 4.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) Project supports Component Advanced Development and System Integration (CAD/SI) of reconnaissance, detection, identification, and hazard prediction equipment, hardware, and software.  Individual efforts are:  (1) Joint Biological Tactical Detection System (JBTDS); (2) Joint Chemical Biological Radiological Agent Water Monitor (JCBRAWM) Increment 2; (3) Joint Standoff Detection System (JSDS);  (4) Next Generation Chemical Detector (NGCD); and (5) Joint Biological Standoff Detection System (JBSDS) Increment 2.
		
The Joint Biological Tactical Detection System (JBTDS) will integrate, test, and produce the first lightweight (less than 37 lbs), low cost biological surveillance system that will detect, collect, and identify biological warfare agent aerosols.  JBTDS will provide warning through the Joint Warning And Reporting Network (JWARN) and archive sample for follow-on analyses.  JBTDS will provide near real-time local audio and visual alarm for use by any Military Occupational Specialty (MOS).  JBTDS components will be man-portable, battery-operable, and easy to employ.  JBTDS will be used to provide notification of a hazard and enhanced battle space awareness to protect and preserve the force.  When networked, JBTDS will augment existing biological detection systems to provide a theater-wide seamless array capable of biological detection, identification and warning.  Units equipped with JBTDS will conduct biological surveillance missions to detect BWA aerosol clouds, collect a sample, and identify the agent to support time sensitive force protection decisions.

The Joint Chemical Biological Radiological Agent Water Monitor (JCBRAWM) Increment 2 efforts will evaluate existing and emerging technologies to provide improvement to chemical detection in water to meet Tri-Service Drinking Water Standards and to detect emerging threats in water.

The Joint Standoff Detection System (JSDS), a new start program, will provide near real-time detection of chemical and biological attacks/incidents at a standoff distance.  The modular system will be tailorable to the Service and can be employed at Aerial Port of Debarkation (APOD)/Sea Port of Debarkation (SPOD), Forward Operating Base (FOB), and on multiple platforms to include: fixed site, aerostat, and ground systems.  The system will be networked to allow for cueing of point sensor arrays.  Additionally, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) (as demonstrated in the WMD Aerial Collection System (WACS) Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD))/Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) platforms could be integrated for sampling and identification.  This schedule has been synchronized with the WACS ATD schedule to facilitate data exchange and possible excursions.

The Next Generation Chemical Detector (NGCD) will detect and identify non-traditional agents, chemical warfare agents (CWAs), toxic industrial chemicals (TICs) in the air and on surfaces.  The NGCD will provide improved CWA/TIC selectivity and sensitivity on multiple platforms as well as multiple environments.  This sensor will improve detection, consequence management and reconnaissance, and weapons of mass destruction (WMD) interdiction capabilities.

The Joint Biological Standoff Detection (JBSDS) Increment 2 mission provided near real-time detection of biological attacks/incidents and standoff early detection/warning (Detect to Warn) of Biological Warfare Agents (BWAs) at fixed sites or in static mode on vehicles.  This detect-to-warn capability allowed Commanders theater-wide initial early warning capability against BWA attacks.  JBSDS 1 was the first standoff early warning biological detection system for the Joint Services.  The system demonstrated the capability of providing standoff detection, ranging, tracking, of BWA aerosol clouds for advanced warning, reporting, and protection.  The current JBSDS 1 systems was used for training to support JBSDS 2 concept of operations (CONOPs) development and could have been deployed upon receipt of an urgent need statement.  JBSDS Increment 2 addressed the requirements beyond the JBSDS 1 interim system.  Those key requirements were lower false alarm rate, day/night discrimination sensitivity, and a reduction in overall system size, weight, and power.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The JBTDS is being developed using an evolutionary acquisition strategy.   JBTDS will make maximum use of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) and Government off-the-shelf (GOTS) technology.  The awards for competitive prototyping utilized best value approach via the competitive CBRNE mission support contract to three contractor teams.  Full and open competition will be utilized at MS B for the SDD contract with options for Low Rate Initial Production and Full Rate Production.  Coordination with other programs (Common Analytical Laboratory System and Next Generation Diagnostic System) is occurring to share information and leverage potential common identification technology solutions to the three programs.

JCBRAWM

Current effort is being conducted inhouse to address emerging threats in water and to enhance chemical detection capabilities to meet current Tri-Service Drinking Water Standards.    Initial work focuses on determining viability of enhancements to existing kits through analysis of chemical processes.  Results will provide data required to develop viable alternative approaches and to develop performance requirements for the Increment 2 program at MS A.

JSDS

JSDS will maximize the use of commercial and government off the shelf mature technologies with an expected start at Milestone B.  Full and open competition will be utilized for the SDD phase of the program.

NGCD

The NGCD will build upon the low volatility work conducted under JCAD in FY11 and FY12.  The NGCD analysis of alternatives will be used to generate performance specifications that will support contracting for competitive prototype development.  The goal for the initial stage of development will be to award multiple contracts for each variant of the NGCD and down select to one contractor per variant by Milestone B.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This ACD&amp;P project supports the development of Contamination Mitigation (ConMit) systems utilizing solutions that will remove and/or detoxify contaminated material without damaging combat equipment, personnel, or the environment.  ConMit systems provide a force restoration capability for units that become contaminated.  Development efforts will provide systems that reduce operational impact and logistics burden, reduce sustainment costs, increase safety, and minimize environmental effects associated with decontamination and contamination mitigation operations.

This funding supports the Decontamination Family of Systems (DFoS) in FY14.

The DFoS program facilitates the rapid transition of mature Science and Technology (S&amp;T) research efforts to existing Decontamination or ConMit Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) Programs of Record and guides S&amp;T community efforts toward meeting the needs of the Warfighter.  Leveraging the outcome of the Materiel Development Decision (MDD) (3QFY11) directed Analysis of Alternatives (AoA), DFoS will develop a Family of Systems that includes equipment to improve decontamination processes and decontaminant solutions to meet the capability gaps for decontaminating Non-Traditional Agent (NTA) and Chemical and Biological Warfare Agents (CBWA) from personnel, equipment, vehicle interiors/exteriors, terrain, and fixed facilities.  DFoS has five initial efforts established to address some of the requirements of the ConMit ICD: the Joint Sensitive Equipment Wipe (JSEW), the General Purpose Decontaminant (GPD), the Contamination Indicator Decontamination Assurance System (CIDAS), Coatings, and Dial-A-Decon. 

JSEW will provide immediate/operational decontamination capabilities for sensitive equipment in hostile and non-hostile environments that have been exposed to chemical agents/contamination.  The JSEW will decrease the level of gross chemical agent contamination from 10 g/m2 to less than or equal to 1 g/m2 in support of thorough decontamination on sensitive equipment.  In addition, the JSEW program will investigate the potential for NTA compatibility of JSEW prototypes.

GPD will provide thorough decontamination capabilities for tactical vehicles, shipboard surfaces, crew-served weapons, and individual/personal weapons in hostile and non-hostile environments that have been exposed to traditional and non-traditional CB contamination.  

CIDAS will provide a contamination indicator/decontamination assurance technology and an applicator for use on tactical vehicles, shipboard surfaces, and crew-served and individual weapons in hostile and non-hostile environments that have been exposed to traditional and non-traditional chemical contamination.

The Coatings effort will provide one or more of the following types of coatings: barrier coatings, strippable coatings, reactive coatings, and sealants, for use on tactical vehicles, shipboard surfaces, and crew-served and individual weapons in hostile and non-hostile environments that may be exposed to CB contamination. 

The Dial-A-Decon effort will provide an adjustable decontamination formulation/mixing system that is generated for point-of-use based on user input of agent threat, actual field conditions, and type of water available.  Dial-A-Decon decontaminants will provide decontamination capabilities for tactical vehicles, shipboard surfaces, crew-served weapons, and individual/personal weapons in hostile and non-hostile environments that have been exposed to CB contamination.  

Additionally, the DFoS Program funded the Contaminated Human Remains Pouch (CHRP) effort in FY12.  The CHRP is a recovery and containment system which will protect personnel from the hazards associated with handling human remains that are potentially contaminated with Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) agents and Toxic Industrial Materials (TIM) without posing additional risk to the handlers or the environment.

The Joint Platform Interior Decontamination (JPID) program will provide decontamination capabilities for interiors of vehicles, ships, fixed-site facilities, mobile maintenance facilities, aircraft, and sensitive equipment inherent to the platform during air, ground, and sea operations in hostile and non-hostile environments that have been exposed to CBRN agents/contamination.  To accommodate the array of Service mission sets, the potential for varying system and/or technology configurations may be required.  The JPID Preferred System Concept (PSC) may consist of multiple solution sets that provide increments of capability or one solution to address the various platforms and threats identified under the program.

The DFoS is utilizing an incremental acquisition strategy to transition various developmental technology efforts (Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS), and DoD technology efforts) to meet high priority Warfighter capability gaps.  DFoS will support Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAPs) and Programs of Record by guiding S&amp;T efforts and transitioning mature technologies to meet program requirements.  A multi-phased Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) is being conducted to identify and evaluate the operational effectiveness of potential material solutions to satisfy Service requirements.  The first two efforts being evaluated under the AoA are Coatings and Dial-A-Decon.  Both of these efforts will employ Competitive Prototyping (CP) to facilitate the identification and evaluation of technologies that can meet the Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) requirements.    The JSEW program employs competitive prototyping to facilitate the evaluation of technologies.  Candidates will be evaluated from competing vendor prototypes to determine optimal JSEW systems.  The JSEW program will continue following an evolutionary acquisition strategy; employing a CP effort to facilitate the identification and evaluation of mature technologies that can meet the JSEW Capabilities Development Document (CDD) requirements.    The GPD program employs competitive prototyping to facilitate the evaluation of technologies.  Seven contracts were awarded for competing vendors to provide prototype GPDs.  Candidates will be evaluated to determine optimal GPD systems to satisfy CBRN user needs.   The CIDAS program employs competitive prototyping to facilitate the identification and evaluation of technologies.  A request for proposal will solicit industry using a full and open competition best value contract strategy for technologies capable of meeting the CIDAS requirements.   It is anticipated that multiple contracts will be awarded for competing vendors to provide CIDAS technologies for Technology Development activities.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project provides for Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P).  

Efforts included in this project are: (1) Joint Effects Model (JEM) Increment 2; (2) the Joint Warning and Reporting Network (JWARN) Increment 2; and (3) Software Support Activity (SSA).

The Joint Effects Model (JEM) is the DoD's only accredited model that has been operationally tested and deemed effective for predicting hazards associated with the release of contaminants into the environment.  JEM is a software-only, ACAT III program that is being developed in separate increments and is capable of modeling hazards in a variety of scenarios including: counterforce, passive defense, accident and/or incidents; high altitude releases, incident source prediction to include NTA events, urban CBRN/Toxic Industrial Hazard environments, human inhalation, contagious/infectious disease, population movements, efficacy of medical countermeasures, industrial transport; building interiors, and human performance degradation.  Battlespace commanders and first responders must have a CBRN hazard prediction capability in order to make decisions that will minimize risks of CBRN contamination and enable them to continue mission operations.  JEM operates in an integrated fashion with operational and tactical Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems, and in a standalone mode.  JEM interfaces and communicates with the other programs such as JWARN, weather systems, intelligence systems, and various databases.

The Joint Warning and Reporting Network (JWARN) provides the Joint Forces with a comprehensive Integrated Early Warning, Analysis and Response capability to minimize the effects of hostile CBRN attacks, as well as accidents and incidents.  It provides the operational capability to employ CBRN warning technology which collects, analyzes, identifies, locates, reports, and disseminates warnings.  JWARN is compatible and integrated with Joint Service C4ISR Systems.  JWARN transitions from platform specific Common Operating Environment (COE) standards to a Web-based Service Oriented Architecture (SOA).  JWARN facilitates data transfer from additional sensors to tactical networks, increased automation of message handling, improved false alarm filtering, integration of enhanced route-planning calculators, and improved interoperability with additional C2 systems.  JWARN is located in Command and Control Centers at the appropriate level and is be employed by CBRN defense specialists and other designated personnel.  This employment transfers data automatically from existing and future sensors to provide commanders with the capability to support operational decision making in a CBRN environment.  JWARN provides additional data processing to support the production of plans and reports, and access to specific CBRN information to improve the efficiency of limited CBRN personnel assets.  JWARN integrates existing sensors into a sensor network or host C2 system, but does not provide the sensors that will be employed in the operating environment.  The JWARN capability described above has been developed utilizing an incremental approach based on Service requirements and host system architecture.

JEM and JWARN Increment 2 will utilize the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) Manual prescribed Agile Information Technology Box "IT Box" concept for managing requirements for the follow-on increments of capability development.  Use of the "IT Box" acquisition approach increases flexibility and will expedite fielding of Information System products through build decisions versus traditional DoD Milestone Decisions.  Each program will use an Information Systems Initial Capabilities Document (IS ICD) to describe the overall development effort.  After the IS ICD is approved, future requirement details will be captured in Requirements Definition Packages (RDP) and will be approved at the Functional Capability Board (FCB) level.  In order to support an agile incremental approach, each program will ensure that the "IT Box" describes the entire IT program and not just a single increment.  As software-intensive systems both JEM and JWARN have no separately identifiable unit production components.  Both are designated ACAT III programs and unit cost calculations including Program Acquisition Unit Cost/Average Procurement Unit Cost (PAUC/APUC) and Operations and Sustainment (O&amp;S) average annual per unit costs are not applicable.  

The SSA is a user developmental support and service organization focusing on development assistance and net-centric interoperability.  The SSA provides the CBRN Warfighter with Joint Service solutions for Integrated Architectures, Information Assurance, Verification, Validation and Accreditation (VV&amp;A) and Data Management; interoperable and integrated net-centric, Service-oriented, composable solutions for CBD; and infusion of latest technologies into programs of record.  CBRN user community and related communities of interest have need for CBRN "plug and play" capability to allow interoperability and re-configurability across the enterprise.  The requirement for net-centric, composable solutions provides the near term foundation for the Warfighter's ability to communicate his CBRN solutions and interoperate with other Service operational systems.  It also supports a longer term ability to interoperate with related agencies and to reduce the Warfighter's CBRN footprint as technologies improve.  

The SSA also directly supports various Bio-Surveillance efforts in training and logistics coordination.  The SSA is re-baselining the entire Information Management/Information Technology (IM/IT) work-flow in support of the Bio-Surveillance Portal.  By creating a catalog of portlets a user will be able to select the portlets that they need/use and will have access to data that is appropriate for them in a customizable format.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The program plans to award multiple development contracts in a competitive prototyping phase prior to downselecting a single JEM developer and integrator.

JWARN

JWARN Increment 2 will structure itself in conjunction with the JROC's  IT Box  concept.  JWARN Increment 2 will incorporate all current and future technologies planned for incorporation into JWARN in their IS ICD.  This will reduce future trips to the JROC for approval of improved capabilities and ultimately move the program away from incrementalization.   Future JWARN development efforts will be acquired via a Request for Proposal (RFP) under full and open competition.  Using full and open competitive procedures, a single contract will be awarded to the responsible offeror who provides the best value in maintaining current JWARN software and developing future JWARN software.  This contract will apply a Cost-Plus-Award-Fee (CPAF) or Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) pending results of discussion with the contracting office.

SSA

The SSA provides enterprise-wide services and coordination across all CBDP programs that contain data or software, or are capable of linking to the Global Information Grid (GIG).  The SSA facilitates interoperability, integration, and supportability of existing and developing IT and National Security Systems (NSS).  Phase 1a identifies CBDP programs that deal with data or software, and have an IT component.  This will be followed by coordination to facilitate the concepts of interoperability, integration and supportability of enterprise-wide services.  Next follows work with user communities to develop and demonstrate enterprise-wide common architectures, products and services.  (BA5 - System Development and Demonstration).   Phase 2 will support the application of the enterprise-wide architectures, products and services into the programs, with verification of compliance with the defined products and services.  (BA7 - Operational Systems Development).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) Project supports: 

The Medical Countermeasures Advanced Development and Manufacturing (ADM) program (formerly called MCMI) was established to provide a dedicated, agile, flexible, and enduring capability to the Department of Defense (DoD) to support the development, licensure, and production of biological warfare Medical Countermeasures (MCMs).  The ADM will provide an integrated infrastructure to support a medical countermeasures pipeline, and respond to Warfighter and National security needs.  The ADM effort is being executed in two phases.  Phase I is a two year base period to establish, commission, and validate facilities and equipment for two ADM suites using single use, disposable, modular, and multi-product technologies for medical countermeasures advanced development and manufacturing.  Both suites must meet Biological Safety Level-3 (BSL-3) standards.  Phase 2 consists of four (4) two-year options to support and maintain ADM capability in a state of readiness to support medical countermeasures development (under the 'Animal Rule' as applicable) and manufacturing and assist in training personnel in its use.  Once commissioned, the ADM will support transition of enabling science and technology (S&amp;T) and novel platform and expression systems for delivery of products by leveraging technological and regulatory science advancements.

The ADM current Good Laboratory Practices (cGLP) Bio-Safety Level (BSL)- 4 Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) capability will provide a capability to develop medical countermeasures in a safe environment.  The mission of the BSL-4 T&amp;E facility will be to provide a capability that is appropriately resourced with personnel and equipment to conduct test and evaluation on medical countermeasures that are being developed for biological agents that require BSL-4 containment.  There is a national shortage of cGLP BSL-4 availability within the U.S.  This capability will be Government provided within a current Government owned and operated facility.  The intent of this facility is to compliment the ADM T&amp;E capability at the BSL-4 level.

Biosurveillance (BSV) requirements address medical and physical CBRN mission needs spanned in over 11 requirements documents, and through Combatant Commander (COCOM) identified needs.  Funds will support Joint USFK Portal and Integrated Threat recognition (JUPITR) ATD/BSV ATD which will find, demonstrate, transition, and transfer the best operational concepts and technology solutions in support of a holistic approach to countering biological threats from the laboratory to operational use.  The JUPITR ATD will provide the USFK with a holistic Biosurveillance capability to provide early warning, detection, collection, identification and theater confirmation of a Biological event.  The JUPITR ATD consists of filling capability gaps through information sharing and communication systems and detection/diagnostic systems for the USFK.  Depending on the maturity, outputs will focus on proving component, CONOPS, and subsystem transition into programs of record (PORs) and/or integration into existing PORs.

The Emerging Infectious Disease - Influenza (EID-Flu) Medical Countermeasure Acquisition Program is developing and will deliver an FDA-approved, broad-spectrum medical countermeasure to the Warfighter for protection against naturally occurring or biologically engineered influenza viruses.  The emergence of a new pandemic strain with no existing effective vaccine or therapeutic is highly likely.  The focus of the program is on a treatment option that is more effective than currently available drugs and has the potential to be an effective therapeutic not just for multiple strains of the flu, but many other biological warfare agents/viruses as well.  Ongoing EID-Flu drug development will be leveraged to demonstrate additional broad-spectrum MCM's against naturally occurring and/or engineered biowarfare threats.  Completion of activities required to enter Phase 3 clinical trials are the focus of the ACD&amp;P phase.  FDA approval for an influenza treatment is anticipated in FY16 following completion of the SDD phase.  

The Hemorrhagic Fever Virus (HFV) Medical Countermeasure Acquisition Program develops platform-based medical countermeasures (MCMs), using high threat, extremely lethal Biological Warfare Agents (BWAs) of the Filoviridae family agents (Ebola and Marburg) as model systems.  Platform-based medical countermeasures will be advanced through the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensure/approval via the FDA 'Animal Rule', which allows for the demonstration of efficacy in relevant animal model(s) when human testing is not ethically feasible.  HFV will also conduct animal model development, refinement and FDA qualification to support the pivotal animal efficacy testing required under the FDA 'Animal Rule'.  Animal models will be developed and qualified for parenteral and aerosol indications.  Aerosol models are needed to meet the Warfighter requirement to counter BWAs encountered on the battlefield or as a result of terrorist activities.  Completion of Phase I trials, animal model development, and manufacturing scale up are the focus of the ACD&amp;P phase.  FDA approval for Filovirus therapeutics are expected in FY18 following completion of the SDD phase.  

The Next Generation Diagnostics System (NGDS) addresses the mission needs identified in the CBRN Field Analytics ICD (2010). The NGDS is envisioned to be an evolutionary acquisition family of systems to provide increments of capability over time across many echelons of the Combat Health Support System.  The mission of the NGDS is to provide CBRN threat identification and FDA-cleared diagnostics to inform individual patient treatment and CBRN situational awareness and disease surveillance.  NGDS Increment 1 Deployable Component will significantly improve diagnostic capabilities for deployable combat health support units (role 3) while also improving operational suitability and affordability.  The NGDS Increment 1 Deployable Component is intended to replace the legacy Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS) beginning in FY17.  The NGDS Increment 1 Service Laboratory Component is intended to provide high throughput biological threat identification, characterization, and diagnostics to fixed site CONUS and OCONUS laboratories operated by the Army, Navy, and Air Force in coordination with the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center.  NGDS Increment 2 is intended to provide advanced diagnostics for biological pathogens and toxins, diagnostics for chemical and radiological exposures, and to provide capability to lower echelons of care.

The Department of Defense (DoD) funds the technology development phase for vaccines that are directed against validated biological warfare (BW) weapons to include bacteria, viruses, and toxins of biological origin.  Effective medical countermeasures to negate the threat of these biological warfare (BW) agents are urgently needed.  Vaccines have been identified as the most efficient countermeasure against the validated threat of BW weapons.  The Trivalent Filovirus Vaccine Program will offer protection against the threat of Ebola and Marburg viruses.  The Trivalent Filovirus Vaccine Program was initiated in FY10 at Milestone A.  The current budget supports development of two prototypes through the Technology Development Phase.  The DoD anticipates that the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) will approve this vaccine using the 'Animal Rule', which allows for the demonstration of efficacy on relevant animal model(s).  During this phase a scalable manufacturing process is developed.  This process will be used to develop current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) lots suitable for a Phase 1 clinical trial.  In addition, animal safety and efficacy studies will be conducted to support Investigational New Drug (IND) submission to the FDA.  These efforts will support a Milestone B decision and entry into the Engineering, Manufacturing, and Development (EMD) phase.   The DoD is the Public Health Emergency Countermeasures lead for the advanced development of the Filovirus Vaccine.

The DoD plans to initiate a Ricin Vaccine Program in FY13.  The current budget supports development of competitive prototypes through the Technology Development Phase. The efforts to be conducted during this period include developing a pilot scale manufacturing process and manufacture cGMP lots to support nonclinical and clinical studies; develop vaccine formulation that meets the logistical requirements of the DoD; conduct nonclinical GLP Safety studies and submit Investigational New Drug (IND) applications.  The DoD anticipates that the FDA will approve these products using the 'Animal Rule', which allows for the demonstration of efficacy in relevant animal model(s).  During this phase, the vaccine candidates will be evaluated for safety and immunogenicity in a small human clinical trial (Phase 1).  These efforts will support a Milestone B decision and entry into the EMD Phase.   The DoD is the Public Health Emergency Countermeasures lead for the advanced development of the Ricin Vaccine.

The DoD plans to initiate a Western, Eastern, and Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis vaccine (WEVEE) vaccine program in FY13.  To satisfy the competitive prototyping requirement and to reduce program risk, the DoD will develop two prototypes through the Technology Development Phase. The efforts to be conducted during this period include develop pilot scale manufacturing processes and manufacture cGMP lots to support nonclinical and clinical studies; develop vaccine formulation that meets the logistical requirements of the DoD; conduct non-clinical GLP Safety studies; submit Investigational New Drug (IND) applications; and conduct Phase 1 clinical human safety studies.  The DoD anticipates that the FDA will approve these products using the 'Animal Rule', which allows for the demonstration of efficacy in relevant animal model(s).  These efforts will support a Milestone B decision and entry into the EMD phase.   The DoD is the Public Health Emergency Countermeasures lead for the advanced development of the WEVEE Vaccine.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>ADM

The ADM Capability will use a FAR based ten (10) year [two (2) year base with four (4) two (2) year options] Cost Plus Fixed fee (CPFF) contract - Full and Open competition with best value to the government.  A Request for Proposal (RFP) was released in August 2011; final source selection delayed due to a pre-contract award protest filed with the U.S. Government Accountability Office in June 2012.  Contract award is now planned for 2QFY13.  The establishment of the CMO component of the ADM will occur within the base period while the other core service components (CRO, T&amp;E, F&amp;F) will be available shortly after the contract award.  The CMO will utilize modular and disposable/single use equipment to allow for flexibility in manufacturing various MCM products within the same facility.  The contractor will complete facility commissioning, support independent validation, and attain Current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) and Current Good Laboratory Practice (cGLP) status within 24 months following contract award and provide expertise necessary to maintain the facility in readiness to support the development and manufacture of MCMs, and conduct training.  The DoD will continue to issue future separate contracts for specific MCM products - i.e. the MCM  pipeline .

BSV

Objective is the delivery of a set of capabilities to acquire, integrate, and analyze medical, environmental, and incident management data using existing and next generation systems, medical and non-medical sample collection tools and identifiers/diagnostics; and transition hardware/software tools and devices from the Biosurveillance Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD).   The acquisition strategy will address the materiel solutions identified out of the multiple Biosurveillance (BSV) related Analysis of Alternatives (AoA's).  Through evaluation and maturation of hardware/software tools and devices from the Biosurveillance ATD, this project office will emphasize opportunities from common component technology and modularity.  After the Materiel Development Decision, AoAs, and Milestone A, a Request for Proposal will be released selecting the best value for the government for development of the CBRN Biosurveillance capability.  Operational testing of competitive prototypes in the relevant environment will be conducted following MS B.  After Milestone C, during the Production and Deployment phase, the system will achieve operational capability that satisfies mission needs; conduct a Low-Rate Production Decision Review and a Full Rate Production Decision Review, leading to Full-Rate production and deployment.

EID FLU

EID-Flu MCM program is utilizing a single step acquisition approach to reach FDA Approval.  A single step approach, which is the acquisition of a defined capability in one increment, is necessary for this acquisition as a result of the FDA regulatory process and maturity of the product.   To accelerate drug development and reduce risk to the program, the MCM entered the program with active IND-status.    It is the intent of the EID-Flu program to utilize the MCM Advanced Development and Manufacturing (ADM) capabilities.  If the FDA mandates post-marketing surveillance studies, they will be conducted during Production and Deployment.  In addition, the current contractor has the capability to manufacture the quantities currently required for DoD use should the need arise.

HFV

The acquisition strategy uses a parallel evaluation of drug candidates against the lethal Ebola Zaire and Marburg viruses to achieve competitive prototyping in the ACD&amp;P phase.   Following a successful Milestone B and entry into SDD phase, the program will conduct expanded human clinical safety studies, definitive animal efficacy, and toxicology studies, required for FDA approval.  The performer(s) will submit a New Drug Application(s) for the Ebola Zaire and Marburg therapeutics during the SDD Phase.  During the Production and Deployment phase, full rate manufacturing and stockpile production will be pursued.  If the FDA mandates post-marketing surveillance studies, they will be conducted during Production and Deployment.  The DoD Acquisition strategy for the HFV program has been uniquely tailored to a MCM class approach designed to provide a more efficient mechanism for pursuing additional MCM candidates as required.

NGDS

The Next Generation Diagnostics System (NGDS) will develop and field an enhanced CBRN analytical and diagnostic system to the Joint force through an evolutionary acquisition strategy.  NGDS Increment 1 Deployable Component will follow a developmental acquisition strategy to field Biological Warfare Agent diagnostic analytical devices.  Additional DoD-unique BWA diagnostic and environmental surveillance capabilities will be added to the downselected platform capabilities.  BA4 funds were used to conduct competitive prototyping and early operational assessments on the commercial hardware diagnostic systems immediately following MS A to support downselect to the final NGDS Increment 1 system.

VAC FILO

The Government will develop two Filovirus vaccine candidates through a Phase 1 clinical trial.  The Government will serve as the integrator for the Technology Development Phase by managing and coordinating the various vaccine development contracts.  At MS B, the best prototype will be selected through a full and open competition to transition to the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) Phase with delivery of a FDA licensed Filovirus Vaccine.  The development contracts will be a mix of Cost Plus and Firm Fixed Price.  In addition, the Program Office will partner with DoD agencies and laboratories to include U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, Medical Countermeasure Initiative (MCMI) Advanced Development Manufacturing, and the MCMI Test &amp; Evaluation Facility.  This Department of Defense program is the Public Health Emergency Countermeasures lead for the advanced development of this vaccine, and is leveraging expertise across the Federal and International sectors to ensure programmatic success.

VAC RIC

The technology development stage includes the manufacture of candidate current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) lots, animal safety testing, and initial clinical trials.  During this phase, the vaccine is evaluated for safety and immunogenicity in a small human trial (Phase 1).  During the System Development and Demonstration phase (SDD), the product sponsor will stabilize the vaccine formulation, validate the manufacturing processes and testing protocols, optimize the delivery systems and manufacture consistency lots.  Phase 2 clinical trials are performed during this phase to provide additional safety data and determine dose ranging and scheduling.  Phase 3 human safety trials are initiated and Animal Rule studies conducted to demonstrate efficacy against battlefield challenge.  At the Milestone C, approval is granted to produce the Initial Operational Capability (IOC) of vaccine material.  A Biologics Licensure Application is submitted to the FDA with all clinical, nonclinical, and manufacturing data.  The FDA grants licensure to products that are determined to be safe and efficacious.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project provides for the development of medical materiel and other medical equipment items necessary for the Technology Development phase of the acquisition life cycle for the advanced development of medical countermeasures (MCMs) for chemical warfare agents including diagnostic equipment, prophylactic, pre-treatment, and therapeutic drugs, and individual/casualty decontamination compounds.  A family-of-systems approach for medical defense against chemical warfare agents is required to provide protection, to sustain performance in a chemical environment, and to provide for self-aid/buddy-aid and medical treatment of chemical casualties.  Fielding of prophylactic, pre-treatment, and therapeutic drugs and medical devices requires Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval.  Given the family-of-systems approach for development of chemical MCMs for the treatment of nerve agent intoxication, multiple long-term studies are required to obtain FDA approval to deliver products that effectively integrate with current and projected therapeutic regimens.  Efficacy testing of most candidate drugs against chemical warfare agents cannot be conducted in humans; therefore, animal surrogate models must be developed and employed.  The program currently funds: (1) Bioscavenger, a new capability, to be used as a prophylaxis against nerve agents; (2) Improved Nerve Agent Treatment System (INATS) an enhanced nerve agent treatment regimen consisting of an improved oxime to replace the current fielded oxime 2-pralidoxime chloride (2-PAM) and expanded pretreatment indications for the use of pyridostigmine bromide (PB), the active component of Soman Nerve Agent Pretreatment Pyridostigmine (SNAPP).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The Bioscavenger acquisition strategy used a serial evaluation of candidates to achieve competitive prototyping in the Technology Development Phase which culminated in a down-select decision.  The Bioscavenger program issued a Request For Proposal (RFP) to select the best value for the government for a prophylaxis to support an initial limited user group.  During the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) phase the program will continue to exercise management oversight with system integration support of a commercial partner to ensure that manufacturing of the product is in accordance with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations and guidelines.  The RFP for product manufacturing includes options for transition to the Medical Countermeasures Initiative (MCMI) Advanced Development and Manufacturing (ADM) capability.  Prior to FDA licensure, a commercial partner will perform a Phase 2 human clinical safety study, definitive animal efficacy studies, and toxicology studies.  The system integrator will also develop and manufacture a product formulation and delivery system and will submit a New Drug Application and seek FDA approval.  The SDD phase will culminate in FDA licensure of the Bioscavenger.  During the Production and Deployment phase, the Bioscavenger program, in conjunction with a commercial partner, will pursue full rate production and conduct any FDA-mandated post-marketing surveillance studies. Concurrently the Bioscavenger program will conduct an analysis of alternative manufacturing technologies, investigate additional product indications, and pursue an expanded force prophylaxis once alternate technologies have matured.

INATS

During the Technology Development Phase, the INATS acquisition strategy has the Government serving as the system integrator directly overseeing completion of small-scale manufacturing, execution of nonclinical animal safety studies, submission of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application, and conduct of a Phase 1 clinical safety study.  Following a successful Pre-EMD Review and Milestone B, the INATS program will continue to exercise management oversight in the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) Phase with system integration support from a commercial partner. Prior to FDA licensure, the commercial partner will perform a Phase 2 human clinical safety study toxicology and definitive animal efficacy studies for an improved oxime.  The system integrator will also manufacture an improved formulation in an autoinjector delivery system.  As part of a second line of effort, the INATS program will conduct nonclinical studies to obtain FDA approval for expand the indications for PB under task order vehicles.    During the Production and Deployment Phase, the INATS program, in collaboration with the contracted system integrator, will pursue full rate and stockpile production as well as conduct any FDA-mandated post-marketing studies.  After delivery of the Full Operational Capability quantities, the INATS program will transfer contracting and logistical responsibilities to the Defense Logistics Agency - Troop Support during the Operations and Support Phase.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Operational forces have an immediate need to survive, safely operate, and sustain operations in a radiological/nuclear (R/N) threat environment across a continuum of global, contingency, special operations/low intensity conflict, homeland defense, and other high-risk missions.
	
Exposure to ionizing radiation causes acute radiation syndrome (ARS) which includes damage to blood-forming cells (hematopoietic system), gastrointestinal system, and central nervous system.  Treatment of R/N casualties depends on effective use of multiple medical capabilities in an integrated manner.  There are currently no FDA-approved prophylactic, therapeutic, or biodosimetry capabilities against ARS.  Thus, this program supports the development of medical radiological countermeasures (MRADC) using a family-of-systems approach to provide a full spectrum medical capability including prophylactics, therapeutics, and biodosimetry to protect Warfighters against the radiation threat and to mitigate the medical consequences of exposure to ionizing radiation.  	

MRADC efforts include development of multiple countermeasures to prevent, limit, or reverse the myriad of injuries caused by exposure to radiation resulting in increased survival, decreased incapacity, and sustained operational effectiveness of U.S. Forces.  In addition, MRADC will be effective against a broad range of ionizing radiation sources and types and will be useable throughout the full spectrum of healthcare operations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The DoD is synchronizing its investments and harmonizing its portfolio with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) which also has a radiation countermeasure program.  DoD investments will focus on DoD-unique requirements.  In support of the Integrated National Biodefense Portfolio, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was established between HHS and DoD to prevent duplication of efforts and create synergies in the development of MRADC.  In support of the MOU, the DoD will enter into Interagency Agreements (IAAs) with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), HHS' advanced developer, to promote the development of MRADC and the Strategic National Medical Radiation Countermeasures Portfolio. Each contract performer whose work is supported through these IAAs will sponsor its drug to the FDA and hold all approvals and or licenses.  In accordance with the MRADC revised acquisition strategy, the DoD will harmonize DoD investments with HHS investments.  The DoD will invest via IAAs in HHS prototypes focusing on DoD-unique requirements as HHS, in its role as the lead developer for the Technology Development phase in a whole-of-government approach, matures the prototypes to support a DoD down-select at Milestone B.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This funding supports the Joint Project Manager Nuclear, Biological, Chemical Contamination Avoidance Product Director, Test Equipment, Strategy, and Support (PD TESS) efforts.  PD TESS provides test infrastructure products for testing and evaluating chemical and biological defense systems throughout the life cycle acquisition process in support of the Milestone Decision Authority, Joint Project Managers, and the Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) community.  PD TESS test infrastructure products are aligned in three groups to include: (1) Sense Laboratory (Chemical); (2) Sense Laboratory (Biological); and (3) Individual Protection, Collective Protection and Decontamination (Shield and Sustain).

(1) Sense Laboratory (Chemical): The product for this area is the Non-Traditional Agent Defense Test System (NTADTS).  The NTADTS provides a new capability at the Edgewood Chemical Biological Center (ECBC) to conduct highly toxic materials testing using new, emerging threat agents.  The NTADTS supports testing of decontamination, collective protection, individual protection, and contamination avoidance products.  The CBD acquisition program supported are Dismounted Reconnaissance Sets Kits and Outfits (DR SKO), Next Generation Chemical Detector (NGCD), Decon Family of Systems (DFoS), Joint Expeditionary Collective Protection (JECP), Joint Service Aircrew Mask - Fixed and Rotary Wing (JSAM-FW), (JSAM-RW), and Common Analytical Laboratory System (CALS).

(2) Sense Laboratory (Biological): The product for this area is the Standoff Detection Test System (SDTS).  The SDTS, as a new start, will provide test and evaluation capability for the Joint Standoff Detection System (JSDS) acquisition program.

(3) Individual Protection, Collective Protection and Decontamination (Shield and Sustain): The product for this area is the Chemical Biological Agent Resistance Test Fixture (CBART).  Projected location for these T&amp;E capabilities is Dugway Proving Ground (DPG), Utah.  CBART provides state of the art material swatch test fixture for individual and collective protection systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project (TT4) validates high-risk/high-payoff technologies, concepts-of-operations, and reconnaissance and surveillance platforms that could significantly improve Warfighter capabilities in preparation for transition of mature technologies to advanced development programs requiring chemical and biological (CB) defense technologies.  These programs offer an opportunity to identify and efficiently mature emerging technologies from laboratory experiments to acquisition programs through risk reduction, engineering and integration.  These demonstrations and programs seek to demonstrate the potential for enhanced military operational capability and/or cost effectiveness.  Upon conclusion of the technical and operational demonstrations, the user or sponsor provides a determination of the military utility and operational impact of the technology and capability demonstrated.  Successfully demonstrated technologies with proven military utility can either be left in place for extended user evaluations, accepted into advanced stages of the formal acquisition process, proceed directly into limited or full-scale production or be returned to the technical base for further development.  This project funds three family of products areas (one of which is a new thrust areas to address DoD emphasis on an interagency collaboration for biological detection, surveillance, recovery and resilience and is annotated as such below): Hazard Mitigation, Early Warning, and Biological Resiliency.  Hazard Mitigation addresses Chemical, Biological, and Radiological (CBR) remediation and decontamination processes and demonstrates technologies and methods to restore assets such as mobile equipment, fixed sites, critical infrastructures, personal, and equipment to operational status as a result of having reduced or eliminated CBR contamination.  The Early Warning family of products achieve enhanced command and control decision making capabilities as a result of a combined and orchestrated family of chemical and biological defense systems deployed on various platforms in remote locations.  Biological Resiliency efforts are targeted to reduce biological threats by: (1) improving DoD access to the life sciences to combat infectious disease regardless of its cause; (2) establishing and reinforcing DoD concept of operations (CONOPS) against the misuse of the life sciences; and (3) instituting a suite of coordinated DoD and interagency activities that collectively will help influence, identify, inhibit, and/or interdict those who seek to misuse the life sciences.  </r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The Advanced Technology Demonstrations (ATDs) and Joint Capability Technology Demonstrations (JCTDs) exploit mature and maturing technologies to solve important military problems.  ATDs and JCTDs emphasize technology assessment and integration rather than technology development.  The goal is to provide a prototype capability to the Warfighter and to support in the evaluation of that capability.  The Warfighters evaluate the capabilities in real military exercises and at a scale sufficient to fully assess military utility.  When possible, the ATDs will leverage results from existing chemical and biological science and technology (S&amp;T) efforts and prior ATDs.  Market research/baselining is performed prior to ATD initiation to determine if a suitable solution exists or whether a solicitation/sole source is required to develop a solution.  The ATDs are typically managed by DoD, Federally Funded Research Development Centers (FFRDCs) or University Affiliated Research Centers (UARCs).  This is done through the Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request (MIPR) or the Interagency Cost Reimbursable Order (IACRO) in accordance with the Economy Act.  In addition, the ATDs utilize the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) Broad Area Announcement process to fund promising technologies between Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 4 and TRL 6.  The ATD manager, who is typically responsible for total system development, can subcontract industry, academia, or other government agencies to perform individual component development.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Operational forces have an immediate need to survive, safely operate, and sustain operations in a Chemical and Biological (CB) threat environment across the continuum of global, contingency, special operations/low intensity conflict, counternarcotics, and other high-risk missions.  Operating forces have a critical need for defense against worldwide proliferation of CB warfare capabilities and for medical treatment of CB casualties.  Congress directed centralized management of Department of Defense (DoD) CB Defense initiatives, both medical and non-medical.  This program element supports the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) of medical and non-medical CB defensive equipment and materiel.  Projects within BA5 are structured to consolidate Joint and Service-unique tasks within four commodity areas:  contamination avoidance, individual and collective force protection, decontamination, and medical countermeasures.  This consolidation provides for development and operational testing of equipment for Joint Service use and for Service-unique requirements.  

Contamination avoidance efforts under this system development program will provide U.S. forces with real-time hazard assessment capabilities.  They include multi-agent point and remove chemical detection for ground, aircraft, and shipboard applications; automated warning and reporting systems; integrated radiation detection and monitoring equipment; and enhanced battlefield reconnaissance capabilities.  Force protection efforts will increase protection levels while decreasing physical and psychological burdens imposed by protective equipment.  

The DoD Biological Defense mission requires the detection of validated biological threat agents to provide early warning capabilities on mobile and fixed platforms.  This program, element will provide theater protection through the development of point and stand-off detection systems.  The detection system concept will provide detection, identification, warning, and sample collection for verification that a biological agent attack has occurred.  

The Secretary of Defense is responsible for research, development, acquisition, and deployment of medical countermeasure equipment and materiel to prevent or mitigate the health effects of CB threats to the Armed Forces and directs strategic planning for and oversight of programs to support medical countermeasures development and acquisition for our Armed Forces personnel.  The CB medical threat to the Armed Forces, in contrast with public health threats to U.S. citizens, encompasses all potential or continuing enemy actions that can render a Service Member combat ineffective.  CB medical threats, because they apply as a whole to military units deployed on a specific mission and/or operations, may result in the unit being unable to complete its mission.  CB medical countermeasures developed by DoD, unlike those developed to support U.S. population, must support military commanders practical operational requirements and deployment strategies and must emphasize prevention of injury and illness and protection of the force.  Preventive measures in this SDD, such as vaccines and chemical prophylaxis, conserves fighting strength, decreases the logistics burden by reducing the need for larger deployed hospital footprint and greater demand for tactical and strategic medical evacuation, and satisfy the need for greater flexibility in military planning and operations.  When vaccines and other prophylactic medical countermeasures are not available, efforts on this SDD support pre-hospitalization treatment, en-route care, hospital care, and long-term clinical outcomes. Specific items in this category include CB diagnostics, and therapeutics to mitigate the consequences of biologic threats and exposure to ionizing radiation due to nuclear or radiological attacks.  DoD is the only Federal activity conducting SDD on these prophylactic, therapeutic and rapid identification and diagnostic CB medical countermeasures.  

The Department of Defense coordinates its efforts with the Departments of Health and Human Services to promote synergy and minimize redundancy.  This Department of Defense ensures coordination by participating in the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise interagency strategic planning process ("One Portfolio").  The Department of Defense's longstanding experience and success in CB medical countermeasure research, development, acquisition, and deployment not  only ensures protection of the Armed Forces, it also accelerates and improves the overall national efforts in CB medical countermeasure research, development, and acquisition because of its unique facilities, testing capabilities, and trained and experienced personnel.  

Key efforts within this PE are in support of the FY14 policy priorities for Countering Biological Threats.  Approximately $148.4M supports the priority to "Promote global health security efforts through building and improving international capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats, whether caused by natural, accidental, or deliberate events."  Approximately $61.8M supports the priority to "Expand our capability to prevent, attribute, and apprehend those engaged in biological weapons proliferation or terrorism, with a focus on facilitating data sharing and knowledge discovery to improve integrated capabilities."  Approximately $288.3M supports the priority to "Leverage science, technology, and innovation through domestic and international partnerships and agreements to improve global capacity to respond to and recover from biological incidents."

The projects in this program element support efforts in the engineering and manufacturing phase of the acquisition strategy and are therefore correctly placed in Budget Activity 5.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports System Development and Demonstration and Low Rate Initial Production (SDD/LRIP) of an array of reconnaissance, detection and identification equipment, and warning systems.  

Efforts included in this project are: (1) Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Dismounted Reconnaissance Systems (CBRN DRS); (2) Joint Biological Point Detection System (JBPDS); (3) Joint Biological Tactical Detection System (JBTDS);  (4) Non-Traditional Agent (NTA) Defense Support;  (5) Non-Traditional Agent (NTA) Detection Support; and (6) Sensor Suite Integration for NBC Reconnaissance Systems (SSI NBCRS). 

The CBRN Dismounted Reconnaissance Systems (CBRN DRS) consists of portable, commercial and government off-the-shelf equipment to provide personnel protection from current and emerging CBRN hazards and detection, identification, sample collection, decontamination, marking, and hazard reporting of CBRN threats.  The system supports dismounted Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and CBRN Site Assessment missions to enable more detailed CBRN information reports for commanders.  The program will support emerging CBRN threat capability to provide an enhanced capability in the future.  

The Joint Biological Point Detection System (JBPDS) is a fully automated system that detects, warns, and provides presumptive identification and samples for follow-on confirmatory analysis.  It is an ACAT II program in Full Rate Production.  The Army platforms include the JBPDS on the Biological Integrated Detection System (BIDS) and the Stryker Nuclear Biological Chemical Reconnaissance Vehicle (NBCRV).  The Navy installs the JBPDS on several classes of ships such as Cruisers and Amphibious Transports.  Engineering Changes to refresh the technology of the JBPDS consists of two separate efforts (one funded by procurement and one RDT&amp;E funded) that, when combined, will reduce lifecycle costs and address obsolescence concerns.  The existing computer hardware and operating system in the JBPDS will not meet Information Assurance standards due to obsolescence.  Under the existing production contract, an engineering effort is underway to address the computer and operating system obsolescence concerns.  The element being developed under RDT&amp;E funding is a new detector technology that will significantly reduce false positives resulting in improved reliability, reduced consumable use, and reduction in operational and sustainment costs.

The Joint Biological Tactical Detection System (JBTDS) will integrate, test and produce the first lightweight (less than 37 lbs), low cost biological surveillance system that will detect, collect and identify biological warfare agent aerosols.  JBTDS will provide warning through the Joint Warning And Reporting Network (JWARN) and archive samples for follow-on analyses.  JBTDS will provide near real-time local audio and visual alarm for use by any Military Occupational Specialty (MOS).  JBTDS components will be man-portable, battery-operable and easy to employ.  JBTDS will be used organically at battalion level and below and provide notification of a hazard and enhanced battle space awareness to protect and preserve the force.  When networked, JBTDS will augment existing biological detection systems to provide a theater-wide seamless array capable of biological detection, identification and warning.  Units equipped with JBTDS will conduct biological surveillance missions to detect BWA aerosol clouds, collect a sample, and identify the agent to support time sensitive force protection decisions. JBTDS will leverage potential common identification technology solutions to the three programs.  JBTDS is part of the Biological Recapitalization strategy for biological point systems.

The Non-Traditional Agent (NTA) Defense program will support the chemical and biological (CB) challenges in which are dynamic and encompass the entire range of military operations.  Dedicated initiatives and projects will explore these challenges outline and transition information, technologies, and capability into acquisition strategies that account for the breadth and depth of emerging threats that span the full range of military essential missions.  By leveraging previous work done on NTAs within the DoD, the interagency, and international, these efforts will provide essential enablers of a comprehensive, integrated, and layered defense against current CB threats and develop a balanced portfolio targeted at capabilities that preclude technological surprise from emerging threats.

The Non-Traditional Agent (NTA) Detection projects will develop, procure and advance detection and identification system(s) through follow-on technology insertion that will enhance the Domestic Response Capability (DRC), Advanced Threat (AT) Box, CBRN DRS (Dismounted Reconnaissance Sets, Kits, and Outfits), and Next Generation Chemical Detector programs to attain situational awareness and respond to emerging and escalating threats.  The projects will test, optimize and advance technology capabilities provided within the fielded NTA detection components and explore the passive defense mission space.  The products provide a mid-term capability to detect priority emerging threat materials and afford the Warfighter the ability to support domestic response and force protection missions.  These products leverage common core technologies to detect and identify threats that can be exploited for lab deployable, fixed site and handheld applications.  Additional efforts include conducting systems engineering analysis to prioritize capability gaps and outline issues that require investment.

Sensor Suite Integration for NBC Reconnaissance Systems (SSI NBCRS) evaluated technologies' ability to provide biological warfare agents (BWA), liquid Chemical Warfare Agent (CWA), Toxic Industrial Chemical (TIC), and Non-Traditional Agent (NTA) identification using a single detection technology.  This effort evaluated potential capability improvements with significant cost savings to the Warfighter by reducing consumables, reducing false alarms, and providing the ability to rapidly upgrade to detect emerging threats.  The program demonstrated a modular, "plug and play" capability to support mounted and dismounted CBRN reconnaissance, fixed site, lab deployable, and handheld applications.  Feasibility of a single sensor concept for CWA, TIC, and biological aerosols were demonstrated in technology evaluation.  A low volatile chemical surface contamination detection capability will provide improved identification of CWAs, TICs, and NTAs.  Continued prototype development will mitigate risk for future programs including NTA Detection products and Next Generation Chemical Detector.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>CBRN DRS

The Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear Dismounted Reconnaissance Systems (CBRN DRS) program uses a government-off-the-shelf (GOTS)/commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) non-developmental item (NDI) single step to full capability acquisition approach.  This strategy employs an NDI acquisition concept to establish a simplified management framework to translate mission needs and technology opportunities into a stable, affordable, and well-managed acquisition program.

JBPDS

The technology update for the detector focuses on the Rapid Agent Aerosol Detector (RAAD); being developed by MIT-LL with producibility and logistics support from Kansas City Plant (KCP).  A competitive solicitation will be issued for RAAD full rate production.  KCP will transition RAAD production to industry with the use of a technical data package.  The RAAD contractor will provide the new biological warfare agent detector to the JBPDS prime contractor.  Through an Engineering Change Order the prime contractor has initiated system integration efforts to accept the new detector technology.

JBTDS

The JBTDS is being developed using an evolutionary acquisition strategy.   JBTDS will make maximum use of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) and Government off-the-shelf (GOTS) technology.  The awards for competitive prototyping utilized best value approach via the competitive CBRNE mission support contract to three contractor teams.  Full and open competition will be utilized at MS B for the SDD contract with options for Low Rate Initial Production and Full Rate Production.  Coordination with other programs (Common Analytical Laboratory System and Next Generation Diagnostic System) is occurring to share information and leverage potential common identification technology solutions to the three programs.

NTA DEFENSE

The Non-Traditional Agent Defense products will provide incremental acquisition information, technology, and evaluation testbeds to afford acquisition programs the ability to develop capabilities for the Warfighter.  The ability to attain situational awareness and respond to any unknown and emerging threat hazard will be attained through these incremental transitions to acquisition programs.   By leveraging previous work done on NTAs within the DoD, the interagency, and internationally, the NTA Defense will provide essential enablers of a comprehensive, integrated, and layered defense against current CB threats and develop a balanced portfolio targeted at capabilities that preclude technological surprise from emerging threats.

NTA DETECT

The Non-Traditional Agent (NTA) Detection products will provide a detection capability through incremental acquisition that will afford the Warfighter ability to attain situational awareness and respond to unknown and emerging hazards.   Leveraging COTS/GOTS assessments will be used in order to lower program risks, reduce costs, and ensure a higher confidence in selected technologies.  The project will continue to address next priority mission areas and threats by continuing to qualify identified detection equipment.  To accomplish these efforts, various competitive contracting strategies will be used, i.e., cost plus type contracts, task orders, and IDIQ.

SSI NBCRS

A cost plus fixed fee contract was awarded to assist in program development and integration.   The Sensor Suite and Integration for Nuclear Biological and Chemical Reconnaissance System (SSI NBCRS) evaluated the state of Chemical and Biological sensor manufacturing to support future acquisition programs.  A technical evaluation was performed on four separate Cost plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) task orders using a competitive omnibus contract. The evaluation focused on using a common sensor technology to detect and identify both chemical and biological threats.  Efforts are ongoing to evaluate modularizing, allowing for application on potential mounted and dismounted reconnaissance, lab deployable and fixed site systems.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports System Development and Demonstration and Low Rate Initial Production (SDD/LRIP) for programs that provide a comprehensive, integrated and layered Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear (CBRN) protection and response capability for military installations and specialized military consequence management units both at home and abroad.  Particular emphasis is placed on improving military-civilian interoperability in CBRN detection and response capabilities; providing tiered levels of CBRN protection and response capabilities to military installations; and tailored modular and integrated COTS solutions to consequence management units.   

Included in this project are the following developmental efforts:

The Common Analytical Laboratory System capability (CALS) will be modular, scalable and adaptable to a variety of concept of operations (CONOPS) and environmental conditions.  Currently, fielded systems have been designed independently by various agencies with the intent of meeting a specific units requirements.  As a result, multiple mobile lab configurations exist with differing sustainment tails and lacking in commonality.  The system under development will incorporate an open architecture that provides enhanced scalability and tailorability to emerging mission requirements.  It also provides the ability to rapidly develop a common operating picture allowing first responders and DoD officials to determine the appropriate course of action.  The analytical detection package fielded will be fitted to the specific mission and CONOPS of the gaining unit and be able to detect and identify Chemical Warfare Agents (CWAs), Toxic Industrial Chemicals (TICs), Toxic Industrial Materials (TIMs), Biological Warfare Agents (BWAs), Lower Explosive Limits (LEL), and radioactive particles in all samples.   Users of the system will include the National Guard Bureau Civil Support Teams, the Army 20th Support Command, the Army Medical Laboratory, the Air Force and the Marines. 

The Special Purpose Units Chemical Biological Equipment program provides for the acquisition and ongoing assessment of Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) detection, protection and decontamination equipment for these units.

The Weapons of Mass Destruction Civil Support Team Program supports the ongoing assessment and acquisition of COTS and GOTS hand held analytical detection, protection, decontamination and sampling equipment for survey in order to expand/enhance the operational capabilities of the (57) WMD CST Teams.  This includes modernization of detection capabilities inside the Analytical Laboratory System to maintain system viability until the CALS is fielded.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Funding supports System Development and Demonstration and Low Rate Initial Production (SDD/LRIP) of Joint Service Chemical, Biological, and Radiological (CBR) Collective Protection (CP) systems that are smaller, lighter, less costly to produce and maintain, and more logistically supportable enabling mission accomplishment in CBR environments.  CP systems can be installed on any type of platform, such as, hard and soft shelters, vehicles, ships, aircraft, and buildings.  CP systems provide spaces safe from the effects of CBR contamination.

The system included in this project is the Joint Expeditionary Collective Protection (JECP).

JECP provides the Joint Expeditionary Forces a CP capability which is lightweight, compact, modular, and affordable.  A family of systems is planned that will allow the application of CP to transportable soft-side shelters, enclosed spaces of opportunity, and in remote austere locations as a standalone resource.  JECP will be capable of protecting personnel groups of varying size, unencumbered by Individual Protective Equipment (IPE), from the effects of CB agents, Toxic Industrial Materials (TIMs), radiological particles, heat, dust, and sand.  The employment of JECP is a strategic deterrence against enemy use of CBR agents or TIMs, and will reduce the need for personnel and equipment decontamination.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Strategy based on evolutionary development, based on a family of systems approach.  Following MS B, a Statement of Work (SOW) and System Performance Specification (SPS) were used to award competitive cost plus incentive fee contract to build prototypes that are being subjected to robust engineering developmental testing and Operational Assessment during the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) phase.  Following MS C, award a Fixed Price Incentive Successive Target (FPIS) option for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) to support formal Developmental Testing (DT) and Multi-Service Operational Test &amp; Evaluation (MOT&amp;E) with the intent to field Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) systems developed using procurement funds.  Following a successful Full Rate Production (FRP) decision, award a Fixed Price Incentive-Successive targets  (FPIS) option with five one-year ordering periods.  Full and open competition will be used with an updated SPS to award follow-on production contracts.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides System Development and Demonstration (SDD) for: (1) the Contaminated Human Remains Pouch (CHRP); (2) the Decontamination Family of Systems (DFoS); and (3) Joint Sensitive Equipment Wipe (JSEW).

The Contaminated Human Remains Pouch (CHRP) effort will provide the capability to protect personnel handling and processing human remains contaminated with Chemical, Biological, Radiological, or Nuclear (CBRN) contamination.  The CHRP will fulfill gaps as described in the Mortuary Affairs (MA) Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) for safe intra-theater handling and transport of contaminated human remains (CHR).  The CHRP will provide protection by containing contaminated human remains (CHR) during recovery and transport from the point of fatality to the Mortuary Affairs (MA) Activity.  The CHRP will contain fluid and vapor CBRN hazards associated with the CHR to reduce the spread of contamination and reduce the hazard to personnel handling the CHR and the environment.  Successful development and procurement of the CHRP will provide Warfighters with the capability to safely handle, transport, and temporarily store or inter CHR in a theater of operations.

The Decontamination Family of Systems (DFoS) program facilitates the rapid transition of mature Science and Technology (S&amp;T) research developments to existing Decontamination or Contamination Mitigation ICD Programs of Record and guides S&amp;T community efforts toward meeting the needs of the Warfighter.  DFoS will develop a Family of Systems, to include equipment, to improve decontamination processes, and decontaminant solutions to meet the capability gaps for decontaminating NTA and chemical and biological warfare agents from personnel, equipment, vehicle interiors/exteriors, terrain, and fixed facilities.  

JSEW will provide immediate/operational decontamination capabilities for sensitive equipment in hostile and non-hostile environments that have been exposed to chemical agents/contamination.  The JSEW will decrease the level of gross chemical agent contamination from 10 g/m2 to less than or equal to 1 g/m2 in support of thorough decontamination on sensitive equipment.  In addition, the JSEW program will investigate the potential for non-traditional agent (NTA) compatibility of JSEW prototypes.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>CHRP

The CHRP commercial items/Non-Developmental Items (NDI) acquisition strategy will leverage current Mortuary Affairs equipment, such as the Human Remains Pouch (HRP), to identify metrics and performance specifications necessary for the handling of non-contaminated human remains, and expand the performance to fill the identified capability gap for safe handling of contaminated human remains (CHR). CHRP will verify that existing commercial items/NDIs meet performance specifications to provide a fielded capability for safe intra-theater handling and transport of CHR.  Follow-on phases of CHRP development may include efforts to incorporate the CHRP into a system designed to provide a transport capability to return CHR to Continental United States (CONUS).

DFoS

The DFoS is utilizing an incremental acquisition strategy to transition various developmental technology efforts (Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS), and DoD technology efforts) to meet high priority Warfighter capability gaps.  DFoS will support Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAPs) and Programs of Record by guiding S&amp;T efforts and transitioning mature technologies to meet program requirements.  A multi-phased Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) is being conducted to identify and evaluate the operational effectiveness of potential material solutions to satisfy Service requirements.  The first two efforts being evaluated under the AoA are Coatings and Dial-A-Decon.  Both of these efforts will employ Competitive Prototyping (CP) to facilitate the identification and evaluation of technologies that can meet the Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) requirements.    The JSEW program employs competitive prototyping to facilitate the evaluation of technologies.  Candidates will be evaluated from competing vendor prototypes to determine optimal JSEW systems.  The JSEW program will continue following an evolutionary acquisition strategy; employing a CP effort to facilitate the identification and evaluation of mature technologies that can meet the JSEW Capabilities Development Document (CDD) requirements.    The GPD program employs competitive prototyping to facilitate the evaluation of technologies.  Seven contracts were awarded for competing vendors to provide prototype GPDs.  Candidates will be evaluated to determine optimal GPD systems to satisfy CBRN user needs.   The CIDAS program employs competitive prototyping to facilitate the identification and evaluation of technologies.  A request for proposal will solicit industry using a full and open competition best value contract strategy for technologies capable of meeting the CIDAS requirements.   It is anticipated that multiple contracts will be awarded for competing vendors to provide CIDAS technologies for Technology Development activities.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides System Development and Demonstration (SDD) and Low Rate Initial Production (SDD/LRIP) for individual protection equipment, with the goal of providing equipment that allows the individual soldier, sailor, airman, or Marine to operate in a contaminated Nuclear, Biological and Chemical (NBC) environment with little or no degradation of his/her performance.  

Included in this program are: 

(1) The Joint Service Aircrew Mask (JSAM) is an Acquisition Category (ACAT) III, incrementally developed Family of Systems (FoS) for respiratory protection.  The JSAM MBU-25 (V)/P and Modified M53 (MM53) Fixed Wing (FW) respirators are being developed for use in the majority of Department of Defense fixed wing aircraft, and the JSAM MPU-5 Rotary Wing (RW) mask is being developed for use in the majority of Department of Defense RW aircraft, and the JSAM-JSF is a CB respirator that supports the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) when integrated with aircraft and pilot mounted equipment, will provide combined CB, hypoxia and anti-Gravity (anti-G) protection to all F-35 users, including the United States Air Force (USAF), Navy (USN), Marine Corps (USMC), and International Partners.  The goal of the overall JSAM project is to develop, manufacture, field and sustain an aircrew respirator system that, in conjunction with a below-the-neck (BTN) clothing ensemble, will provide the capability for all aircrew to fly throughout their full operating envelope in an actual or perceived Chemical and Biological (CB) warfare environment.  The JSAM will be a lightweight CB protective mask that will be worn as CB protection for most Army, Air Force, Navy and Marine RW and FW aircrew members.  The JSAM-FW MBU-25(V)/P will be the first and only CB protective mask in the DoD inventory that can provide anti-G protection, up to nine times the vertical force (Gz), for aircrew in high-performance aircraft.  The JSAM-FW MM53 will be used in aircrew positions that do not require anti-G protection.  The MM53 provides CB protection for positions that only need pressure breathing for altitude and has a much lower cost per unit than the MBU-25(V)/P.  All JSAM variants will be compatible with most BTN CB ensembles and existing aircrew life support equipment.  They will include a protective hood assembly, CB filter, blower assembly, and an intercom for ground communication.  They will also provide flame and thermal protection, demist/emergency demist, and anti-drowning features.  JSAM Phase II will provide CB respiratory and ocular protection to aircrew members for 75% of aircrew positions.

(2) The Joint Service General Purpose Mask (JSGPM) Advanced Respiratory Protection Initiative (ARPI): This project funds the advanced component development and prototypes of an improved filtration and protection capability against highest priority Toxic Industrial Chemical (TIC) threats, addressing a current and significant capability gap to the operating force.  The effort is supported by the Capabilities Production Document for the JSGPM, which outlines the need for a robust TIC/TIM protection capability.  It is expected that new capabilities demonstrated through the activities in this project will be leveraged and integrated into future increments of UIPE.

(3) The Uniform Integrated Protection Ensemble (UIPE).  The objective of UIPE is to fully integrate chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear (CBRN) and toxic industrial material (TIM) protection into an ensemble, identical in fit and form to the combat uniform (including mask-helmet integration and protective boots and gloves), thus negating the need for separate protective ensemble components.  This integrated protection approach will result in increased Warfighter operational performance in a CBRN environment.  The UIPE program will develop, integrate, test, procure and field incremental capability solutions that are modular in function and offer improvements in form and fit over current systems; the program will explore trade-space in areas such as protection level, heat stress, durability, antimicrobial properties, flame resistance, launderability, self-detoxification, and protection time in order to provide capabilities that afford maximum utility to the Warfighter.  Where appropriate modeling and simulation tools will be used to lower UIPE program risks, reduce costs, and ensure a high confidence in selected technologies.  UIPE Increment 1 is aimed specifically at providing enhanced individual protection capabilities to the Warfighter through reduction of physiological and psychological effects associated with CBRN protective garment thermal burden, weight, and bulk.  UIPE Increment 1 achieved MS B approval in November 2011 and is now in the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase.  The first increment of UIPE will ultimately provide CB protective equipment with improved operational capability to the U.S. Special Operations Command.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>JSAM

The overall JSAM acquisition approach is incremental and phased due to the complexity of interfacing with almost 200 aircraft types and models with different mission sets, ALSE, cockpit layouts, priorities, etc.   The JSAM MBU-25 FW effort will test and field the Pressure Breathing for Gravity (PBG) Mask to aircraft platforms through an SDD contract.  An Request For Proposal will be released to solicit industry for JSAM FW procurement using a full and open competition.  The Modified M53 (MM53) effort will test and field a mask for aircrew positions not requiring PBG capabilities.  This contract will be awarded via sole source to Avon Protection Systems, Cadillac, Michigan to modify a commercially available mask (M53).  JSAM RW MPU-5 Low Rate Production (LRIP) and Full Rate Production (FRP) assets will be procured using contract options. JSAM RW MPU-5 Low Rate Production (LRIP) and Full Rate Production (FRP) assets will be procured using contract options.   JSAM RW MPU-5 Engineering and Manufacturing Development activities are performed via a contract awarded using a full and open competition, best value contracting strategy.  The existing contract includes options for LRIP and FRP.  A full and open competition, best value contracting strategy will be utilized to support additional Full Rate Production upon completion of the existing contract requirements and execution of options.

JSGPM

The JSGPM ARPI effort is using the M61 filter contracts awarded to 3M and Avon to develop improved filters for the JSGPM.  There is a continual technology refreshment CLIN that allows for filter development tasks to be awarded under this contract.  The tasks can be competed between the two awardees.

UIPE

UIPE will use an incremental development approach.   UIPE Increment 1 will pursue a Modified Commercial-Off-The-Shelf/Non-Developmental Item (COTS/NDI) Acquisition Strategy; full and open competition will be used.  Following Milestone (MS) B approval, contracts will be awarded and integrated Developmental Test/Operational Test (DT/OT) will be initiated on selected candidate system(s) during the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase.  At the end of EMD, those candidates meeting UIPE Increment 1 requirements and that offer best value to the Government will move forward into Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) and Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&amp;E).  Following OT&amp;E, effective and suitable systems will be considered for Full-Rate Production (FRP).  Increment 1 of UIPE will ultimately provide CB protective equipment with improved operational capability to the U.S. Special Operations Command.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports System Development and Demonstration and Low Rate Initial Production (SDD/LRIP).

Efforts included in this project are: (1) Joint Effects Model (JEM) Increment 2 and (2) Software Support Activity (SSA). 

The Joint Effects Model (JEM) is the DoD's only accredited model that has been operationally tested and deemed effective for predicting hazards associated with the release of contaminants into the environment.  JEM is a software-only, ACAT III program that is being developed in separate increments and is capable of modeling hazards in a variety of scenarios including: counterforce, passive defense, accident and/or incidents; high altitude releases, incident source prediction to include NTA events, urban CBRN/Toxic Industrial Hazard environments, human inhalation, contagious/infectious disease, population movements, efficacy of medical countermeasures, industrial transport; building interiors, and human performance degradation.  Battlespace commanders and first responders must have a CBRN hazard prediction capability in order to make decisions that will minimize risks of CBRN contamination and enable them to continue mission operations.  JEM operates in an integrated fashion with operational and tactical Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems, and in a standalone mode.  JEM interfaces and communicates with the other programs such as JWARN, weather systems, intelligence systems, and various databases.

JEM and JWARN Increment 2 will utilize the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) Manual prescribed Agile Information Technology Box "IT Box" concept for managing requirements for the follow-on increments of capability development.  Use of the "IT Box" acquisition approach increases flexibility and will expedite fielding of Information System products through build decisions versus traditional DoD Milestone Decisions.  Each program will use an Information Systems Initial Capabilities Document (IS ICD) to describe the overall development effort.  After the IS ICD is approved, future requirement details will be captured in Requirements Definition Packages (RDP) and will be approved at the Functional Capability Board (FCB) level.  In order to support an agile incremental approach, each program will ensure that the "IT Box" describes the entire IT program and not just a single increment.  As software-intensive systems both JEM and JWARN have no separately identifiable unit production components.  Both are designated ACAT III programs and unit cost calculations including Program Acquisition Unit Cost/Average Procurement Unit Cost (PAUC/APUC) and Operations and Sustainment (O&amp;S) average annual per unit costs are not applicable.  

The SSA is a user developmental support and service organization focusing on development assistance and net-centric interoperability.  The SSA provides the CBRN Warfighter with Joint Service solutions for Integrated Architectures, Information Assurance, Verification, Validation and Accreditation (VV&amp;A) and Data Management; interoperable and integrated net-centric, Service-oriented, composable solutions for CBD; and infusion of latest technologies into programs of record.  The CBRN user community and related communities of interest have  the need for a CBRN "plug and play" capability to allow interoperability and re-configurability across the enterprise.  The requirement for net-centric, composable solutions provides the near term foundation for the Warfighter's ability to communicate his CBRN solutions and interoperate with other Service operational systems.  It also supports a longer term ability to interoperate with related agencies and to reduce the Warfighter's CBRN footprint as technologies improve.  

The SSA also directly supports various Bio-Surveillance efforts in training and logistics coordination.  The SSA is re-baselining the entire Information Management/Information Technology (IM/IT) work-flow in support of the Bio-Surveillance Portal.  By creating a catalog of portlets a user will be able to select the portlets that they need/use and will have access to data that is appropriate for them in a customizable format.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

SSA

The SSA provides enterprise-wide services and coordination across all CBDP programs that contain data or software, or are capable of linking to the Global Information Grid (GIG).  The SSA facilitates interoperability, integration, and supportability of existing and developing IT and National Security Systems (NSS).  Phase 1a identifies CBDP programs that deal with data or software, and have an IT component.  This will be followed by coordination to facilitate the concepts of interoperability, integration and supportability of enterprise-wide services.  Next follows work with user communities to develop and demonstrate enterprise-wide common architectures, products and services.  (BA5 - System Development and Demonstration).   Phase 2 will support the application of the enterprise-wide architectures, products and services into the programs, with verification of compliance with the defined products and services.  (BA7 - Operational Systems Development).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project funds the development of reagents, assays, and diagnostic equipment for biological warfare agents (BWA) defense and expands chemical and biological detection capabilities.  Its primary mission is enhancing CBRN information sharing across the Department of Defense's (DoD) medical surveillance, public health, and chemical/biological defense communities to enhance chemical and biological medical health situational awareness and coordinate integrated CBRN system solutions. 

The Medical Countermeasure (MCM) Advanced Development and Manufacturing (ADM) capability (formerly the MCMI program) provides core and drug development services to include the establishment, commissioning, validation, and attainment of Current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP)/Current Good Laboratory Practice (cGLP) for a MCM ADM capability for the Department of Defense (DoD).  Future funding will be used to maintain the facility in a state of readiness to support MCM product development, FDA licensure and manufacture of MCMs.

The ADM effort is being executed in two phases.  Phase I is for the establishment, commissioning, and validation of the MCM capability.  This project funds the establishment of a facility(ies) to be located in the United States and its territories.  Two ADM suites, at Bio Surety Level (BSL) 3 will be established during the base contract period, with options to incrementally increase capacity.  In Phase II, the contractor team will support and maintain that capability in a state of readiness to support MCM development (under the 'Animal Rule' as applicable) and manufacturing and assist in training personnel in its use.  This includes transition and integration of new technologies, from pre-Investigational New Drug Application phase with readiness to support simultaneous operations, through FDA licensure.

Two major medical programs critical to accomplishing the Biosurveillance mission are supported under this project in order to streamline collaboration and integration efforts, maintain continuity and efficiency, and to minimize duplication of efforts.  Specifically, these efforts include but are not limited to the Critical Reagents Program (CRP), and Next Generation Diagnostic System (NGDS), These efforts address the President's priority of developing a robust portfolio of cross-cutting resources and materiel solutions that support the National Security Strategy, National Military Strategy to Combat Weapons of Mass Destruction, the National Strategy for Countering Biological Threats, and the needs of the Warfighter.

The Critical Reagents Program's (CRP) strategy establishes a core research and development capability by developing biological threat agent reference materials (strains, antigens, antibodies and nucleic acids) and detection/diagnostic assays for biothreat agent detection.  These reagents/assays are leveraged across multiple programs to meet the requirements of the Warfighter and Joint biological defense systems and support the biological defense community.  After FY14, CRP funding is combined with NGDS to form a medical diagnostic portfolio. 

BSV will support the Joint USFK Portal and Integrated Threat Recognition (JUPITR) ATD which will find, demonstrate, transition, and transfer the best operational concepts and technology solutions in support of a holistic approach to countering biological threats from laboratory to operational use. Depending on the maturity, outputs will focus on providing component, CONOPS, and subsystem transition into programs of record (PORs) and/or integration into existing PORs. Technologies identified from the JUPITR ATD will be fielded in FY14 to Pacific Command (PACOM). Future ATD developments will continue to bridge communication gaps between US Forces across other Combatant Command (COCOMs).

The Next Generation Diagnostics System (NGDS) addresses the mission needs identified in the CBRN Field Analytics ICD (2010). The NGDS is envisioned to be an evolutionary acquisition family of systems to provide increments of capability over time across many echelons of the Combat Health Support System.  The mission of the NGDS is to provide CBRN threat identification and FDA-cleared diagnostics to inform individual patient treatment and CBRN situational awareness and disease surveillance.  NGDS Increment 1 Deployable Component will significantly improve diagnostic capabilities for deployable combat health support units (role 3) while also improving operational suitability and affordability.  The NGDS Increment 1 Deployable Component is intended to replace the legacy Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS) beginning in FY17.  The NGDS Increment 1 Service Laboratory Component is intended to provide high throughput Biological threat identification, characterization and diagnostics to fixed site CONUS and OCONUS laboratories operated by the Army, Navy and Air Force in coordination with the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center.  NGDS Increment 2 is intended to provide advanced diagnostics for biological pathogens and toxins, diagnostics for chemical and radiological exposures and to provide capability to lower echelons of care.

The Emerging Infectious Disease - Influenza (EID-Flu) Medical Countermeasure Acquisition program will develop and deliver a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved, broad-spectrum medical countermeasure to the Warfighter for protection against naturally occurring or biologically engineered influenza viruses.  The emergence of a new pandemic strain with no existing effective vaccine or therapeutic is highly likely.  The focus of the program is on a treatment option that is more effective than currently available drugs and has the potential to be an effective therapeutic not just for multiple strains of the flu, but many other viruses as well.  Completion of activities required for FDA approval for an influenza treatment, expected in fiscal year 2016, is the focus of the SDD Phase.

The Hemorrhagic Fever Virus (HFV) Medical Countermeasure Acquisition Program develops platform-based medical countermeasures (MCMs), using high threat, extremely lethal Biological Warfare Agents (BWAs) of the Filoviridae family agents (Ebola and Marburg) as model systems.  Platform-based medical countermeasures will be advanced through the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensure via the FDA 'Animal Rule', which allows for the demonstration of efficacy in relevant animal model(s) when human testing is not ethically feasible.  The HFV program will also conduct animal model development, refinement and FDA qualification to support the pivotal animal efficacy testing required under the FDA 'Animal Rule'.  Animal models will be developed and qualified for parenteral and aerosol indications. Aerosol models are needed to meet the Warfighter requirement to counter BWAs encountered on the battlefield or as a result of terrorist activities.  Completion of activities required for FDA approval for Filovirus therapeutics, expected in fiscal year 2018, is the focus of the SDD Phase.

The DoD funds the development of vaccines that are directed against validated biological warfare (BW) weapons to include bacteria, viruses, and toxins of biological origin.  Effective medical countermeasures to negate the threat of these BW agents are urgently needed.  Vaccines have been identified as the most efficient countermeasure against the validated threat of BW weapons.  Products under development in this budget item include Recombinant Botulinum A/B and Plague vaccines.  Efforts to be conducted during the system Development and Demonstration (SDD) Phase include the development of large scale manufacturing process and validation of that process, nonclinical studies, demonstration of manufacturing consistency, and expanded clinical human safety studies.  The results of these efforts, and those conducted during the EMD phase, will be used to submit a Biologic License Application (BLA) to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for product licensure.  To evaluate vaccine effectiveness, pivotal animal studies will be conducted concurrently with the Phase 3 clinical trial to satisfy the requirements of the FDA's "Animal Rule".  The DoD anticipates that the FDA will approve these products using the Animal Rule, which allows for the demonstration of efficacy in relevant animal model(s).  Upon FDA licensure, the product will transition to full-scale licensed production.  

The DoD also has the mission to maintain IND vaccines in Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) storage and to conduct the periodic potency and sterility testing of these materials to support submissions to the FDA.  These IND vaccines will be used to provide additional levels of protection to laboratory workers in the Special Immunizations Program (SIP) conducting research on these diseases.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>ADM

The ADM Capability will use a FAR based ten (10) year [two (2) year base with four (4) two (2) year options] Cost Plus Fixed fee (CPFF) contract - Full and Open competition with best value to the government.  A Request for Proposal (RFP) was released in August 2011; final source selection delayed due to a pre-contract award protest filed with the U.S. Government Accountability Office in June 2012.  Contract award is now planned for 2QFY13.  The establishment of the CMO component of the ADM will occur within the base period while the other core service components (CRO, T&amp;E, F&amp;F) will be available shortly after the contract award.  The CMO will utilize modular and disposable/single use equipment to allow for flexibility in manufacturing various MCM products within the same facility.  The contractor will complete facility commissioning, support independent validation, and attain Current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) and Current Good Laboratory Practice (cGLP) status within 24 months following contract award and provide expertise necessary to maintain the facility in readiness to support the development and manufacture of MCMs, and conduct training.  The DoD will continue to issue future separate contracts for specific MCM products - i.e. the MCM  pipeline .

BSV

Objective is the delivery of a set of capabilities to acquire, integrate, and analyze medical, environmental, and incident management data using existing and next generation systems, medical and non-medical sample collection tools and identifiers/diagnostics; and transition hardware/software tools and devices from the Biosurveillance Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD).   The acquisition strategy will address the materiel solutions identified out of the multiple Biosurveillance (BSV) related Analysis of Alternatives (AoA's).  Through evaluation and maturation of hardware/software tools and devices from the Biosurveillance ATD, this project office will emphasize opportunities from common component technology and modularity.  After the Materiel Development Decision, AoAs, and Milestone A, a Request for Proposal will be released selecting the best value for the government for development of the CBRN Biosurveillance capability.  Operational testing of competitive prototypes in the relevant environment will be conducted following MS B.  After Milestone C, during the Production and Deployment phase, the system will achieve operational capability that satisfies mission needs; conduct a Low-Rate Production Decision Review and a Full Rate Production Decision Review, leading to Full-Rate production and deployment.

CRP

The Critical Reagents Program's (CRP) strategy establishes a core research and development capability to develop biological threat agent, genomic reference materials (antigens, nucleic acids, and antibodies) and detection and diagnostic assays for biothreat agent detection that shall be horizontally inserted across multiple detection and diagnostic platforms.  In addition, this strategy will implement a formal, validated advanced development process to transition new assays into production and integration with the appropriate detection/diagnostic platform.

EID FLU

EID-Flu MCM program is utilizing a single step acquisition approach to reach FDA Approval.  A single step approach, which is the acquisition of a defined capability in one increment, is necessary for this acquisition as a result of the FDA regulatory process and maturity of the product.   To accelerate drug development and reduce risk to the program, the MCM entered the program with active IND-status.    It is the intent of the EID-Flu program to utilize the MCM Advanced Development and Manufacturing (ADM) capabilities.  If the FDA mandates post-marketing surveillance studies, they will be conducted during Production and Deployment.  In addition, the current contractor has the capability to manufacture the quantities currently required for DoD use should the need arise.

HFV

The acquisition strategy uses a parallel evaluation of drug candidates against the lethal Ebola Zaire and Marburg viruses to achieve competitive prototyping in the ACD&amp;P phase.   Following a successful Milestone B and entry into SDD phase, the program will conduct expanded human clinical safety studies, definitive animal efficacy, and toxicology studies, required for FDA approval.  The performer(s) will submit a New Drug Application(s) for the Ebola Zaire and Marburg therapeutics during the SDD Phase.  During the Production and Deployment phase, full rate manufacturing and stockpile production will be pursued.  If the FDA mandates post-marketing surveillance studies, they will be conducted during Production and Deployment.  The DoD Acquisition strategy for the HFV program has been uniquely tailored to a MCM class approach designed to provide a more efficient mechanism for pursuing additional MCM candidates as required.

NGDS

The Next Generation Diagnostics System (NGDS) will develop and field an enhanced CBRN analytical and diagnostic system to the Joint force through an evolutionary acquisition strategy.  NGDS Increment 1 Deployable Component will follow a developmental acquisition strategy to field Biological Warfare Agent diagnostic analytical devices.  Additional DoD-unique BWA diagnostic and environmental surveillance capabilities will be added to the downselected platform capabilities.  BA4 funds were used to conduct competitive prototyping and early operational assessments on the commercial hardware diagnostic systems immediately following MS A to support downselect to the final NGDS Increment 1 system.

VAC BOT

A prime system contractor will function as the FDA regulatory sponsor and will perform all ancillary, regulatory, quality assurance, and data management as required by the FDA. The current budget supports development through FDA licensure of a recombinant bivalent (A and B) botulinum vaccine. Other serotypes will be developed through an evolutionary approach, as funding becomes available.  The Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) phase included the manufacture of candidate current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) lots, animal safety testing, and initial clinical trials.  During this phase, the vaccine was evaluated for safety and immunogenicity in a small human clinical trial (Phase 1).  During the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) phase, the prime contractor stabilized the vaccine formulation, validated the manufacturing process and testing protocols, optimized the delivery systems and manufactured consistency lots.  Phase 2 clinical trials were performed and provided additional safety data. The remaining efforts to be conducted during the SDD phase include the Phase 3 clinical trial to demonstrate safety in an expanded volunteer population and evaluation of efficacy in pivotal animal studies to satisfy FDA requirements for the  Animal Rule .  The Low rate Initial Production (LRIP) decision will be conducted after the manufacturing process has been validated and consistency lots have been produced. A Biologics License Application is submitted to the FDA will all clinical, nonclinical, and manufacturing data. The FDA grants licensure to products that are determined to be safe and efficacious.

VAC PLG

The Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) phase included the manufacture of candidate current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) lots, animal safety testing, and initial clinical trials.  During this phase, the vaccine was evaluated for safety and immunogenicity in a small human clinical trial (Phase 1). In order to reduce technical program risk in the Plague vaccine program, the program office conducted competitive prototyping, US vaccine candidate and a United Kingdom vaccine candidate.  During the 2008 Resource Allocation Decision, the US Plague Vaccine candidate was selected for development through licensure under a Prime System Contract.  The Prime System Contractor will function as the FDA regulatory sponsor and will perform all ancillary, regulatory, quality assurance, and data management as required by the FDA. A Project Arrangement is in place with the United Kingdom and Canada.  During the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) phase, the prime contractor stabilized the vaccine formulation, validated the manufacturing process and testing protocols, optimized the delivery systems and manufactured consistency lots.  Phase 2 clinical trials were performed and provided additional safety data. The remaining efforts to be conducted during the SDD phase include the Phase 3 clinical trial to demonstrate safety in an expanded volunteer population and evaluation of efficacy in pivotal animal studies to satisfy FDA requirements for the  Animal Rule .  The Low rate Initial Production (LRIP) decision will be conducted after the manufacturing process has been validated and consistency lots have been produced. A Biologics License Application is submitted to the FDA will all clinical, nonclinical, and manufacturing data. The FDA grants licensure to products that are determined to be safe and efficacious.

VAC SIP

The SIP effort is to store IND vaccines used to potentially provide additional protection to laboratory workers performing research on the infectious agents for Tularemia, Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE), Western Equine Encephalitis (WEE), Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis (VEE), and Q-Fever.  Efforts include Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) storage and periodic potency testing to support the FDA regulated Investigational New Drug (IND) reporting requirements.  This Department of Defense program supports the Federal interagency with this effort, as well as academic and industry partners.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides for the development of medical materiel and other medical equipment items necessary to provide an effective capability for medical defense against chemical warfare agent threats facing U.S. forces in the field.  This project supports efforts in the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) phase of the acquisition strategy for prophylactic, pre-treatment, and therapeutic drugs and diagnostic medical devices for the protection, treatment, detection, and medical management of chemical warfare agent exposures.  Project funds research and development of safety studies, manufacturing scale-up, process validation, drug interaction, performance test, and submission of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) drug licensure application(s).  This program currently funds: (1) Advanced Anticonvulsant System (AAS), which consists of the drug midazolam in an autoinjector, to be used as a treatment for nerve agent-induced seizures and will replace the currently-fielded Convulsant Antidote for Nerve Agent (CANA) autoinjector, which uses diazepam; (2) Bioscavenger, a new capability, to be used as a prophylaxis against nerve agents; and (3) Improved Nerve Agent Treatment System (INATS) an enhanced nerve agent treatment regimen consisting of an improved oxime to replace the current fielded oxime 2-pralidoxime chloride (2-PAM) and expanded pretreatment indications for the use of pyridostigmine bromide (PB), the active component of Soman Nerve Agent Pretreatment Pyridostigmine (SNAPP).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

A prime contractor shall be responsible for conducting activities associated with drug development in a manner consistent with eventual approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  The contractor shall sponsor the drug to the FDA and hold all approvals and/or licenses.  During the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) Phase the program will conduct large scale manufacturing, Phase 2 human clinical safety studies and definitive animal efficacy studies.  During the Production and Deployment Phase the program will purchase sufficient quantities of product to meet Initial Operational Capability (IOC) and Full Operational Capability (FOC).  The Defense Logistics Agency will make subsequent purchases.  The DoD is collaborating closely with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) with the development of midazolam for both civilian and DoD applications.

BSCAV

The Bioscavenger acquisition strategy used a serial evaluation of candidates to achieve competitive prototyping in the Technology Development Phase which culminated in a down-select decision.  The Bioscavenger program issued a Request For Proposal (RFP) to select the best value for the government for a prophylaxis to support an initial limited user group.  During the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) phase the program will continue to exercise management oversight with system integration support of a commercial partner to ensure that manufacturing of the product is in accordance with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations and guidelines.  The RFP for product manufacturing includes options for transition to the Medical Countermeasures Initiative (MCMI) Advanced Development and Manufacturing (ADM) capability.  Prior to FDA licensure, a commercial partner will perform a Phase 2 human clinical safety study, definitive animal efficacy studies, and toxicology studies.  The system integrator will also develop and manufacture a product formulation and delivery system and will submit a New Drug Application and seek FDA approval.  The SDD phase will culminate in FDA licensure of the Bioscavenger.  During the Production and Deployment phase, the Bioscavenger program, in conjunction with a commercial partner, will pursue full rate production and conduct any FDA-mandated post-marketing surveillance studies. Concurrently the Bioscavenger program will conduct an analysis of alternative manufacturing technologies, investigate additional product indications, and pursue an expanded force prophylaxis once alternate technologies have matured.

INATS

During the Technology Development Phase, the INATS acquisition strategy has the Government serving as the system integrator directly overseeing completion of small-scale manufacturing, execution of nonclinical animal safety studies, submission of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application, and conduct of a Phase 1 clinical safety study.  Following a successful Pre-EMD Review and Milestone B, the INATS program will continue to exercise management oversight in the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) Phase with system integration support from a commercial partner. Prior to FDA licensure, the commercial partner will perform a Phase 2 human clinical safety study toxicology and definitive animal efficacy studies for an improved oxime.  The system integrator will also manufacture an improved formulation in an autoinjector delivery system.  As part of a second line of effort, the INATS program will conduct nonclinical studies to obtain FDA approval for expand the indications for PB under task order vehicles.    During the Production and Deployment Phase, the INATS program, in collaboration with the contracted system integrator, will pursue full rate and stockpile production as well as conduct any FDA-mandated post-marketing studies.  After delivery of the Full Operational Capability quantities, the INATS program will transfer contracting and logistical responsibilities to the Defense Logistics Agency - Troop Support during the Operations and Support Phase.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Operational forces have an immediate need to survive, safely operate, and sustain operations in a radiological/nuclear (R/N) threat environment across a continuum of global, contingency, special operations/low intensity conflict, homeland defense, and other high-risk missions.
	
Exposure to ionizing radiation causes acute radiation syndrome (ARS) which includes damage to blood-forming cells (hematopoietic system), gastrointestinal system, and central nervous system.  Treatment of R/N casualties depends on effective use of multiple medical capabilities in an integrated manner. There are currently no FDA-approved prophylactic, therapeutic, or biodosimetry capabilities against ARS.  Thus, this program supports the development of medical radiological countermeasures (MRADC) using a family-of-systems approach to provide a full spectrum medical capability including prophylactics, therapeutics, and biodosimetry to protect Warfighters against the radiation threat and to mitigate the medical consequences of exposure to ionizing radiation.  	

MRADC efforts include development of multiple countermeasures to prevent, limit, or reverse the myriad of injuries caused by exposure to radiation resulting in increased survival, decreased incapacity, and sustained operational effectiveness of U.S. Forces. In addition, MRADC will be effective against a broad range of ionizing radiation sources and types and will be useable throughout the full spectrum of healthcare operations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The DoD is synchronizing its investments and harmonizing its portfolio with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) which also has a radiation countermeasure program.  DoD investments will focus on DoD-unique requirements.  In support of the Integrated National Biodefense Portfolio, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was established between HHS and DoD to prevent duplication of efforts and create synergies in the development of MRADC.  In support of the MOU, the DoD will enter into Interagency Agreements (IAAs) with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), HHS' advanced developer, to promote the development of MRADC and the Strategic National Medical Radiation Countermeasures Portfolio. Each contract performer whose work is supported through these IAAs will sponsor its drug to the FDA and hold all approvals and or licenses.  In accordance with the MRADC revised acquisition strategy, the DoD will harmonize DoD investments with HHS investments.  The DoD will invest via IAAs in HHS prototypes focusing on DoD-unique requirements as HHS, in its role as the lead developer for the Technology Development phase in a whole-of-government approach, matures the prototypes to support a DoD down-select at Milestone B.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This funding supports the Product Director, Test Equipment, Strategy, and Support (PD TESS) efforts.  PD TESS provides test infrastructure products for testing and evaluating chemical and biological defense systems throughout the life cycle acquisition process.  PD TESS test infrastructure products are aligned in four groups to include: (1) Chemical Laboratory (Sense); (2) Biological Laboratory (Sense); (3) Field Simulant Test (Sense); and (4) Individual Protection, Collective Protection and Decontamination (Shield and Sustain).

(1) Chemical Laboratory (Sense): The product for this area is the Dynamic Test Chamber (DTC) for chemical point sensors, and Non-Traditional Agent Defense Test System (NTADTS).  The Dynamic Test Chamber provides a new capability for testing chemical point detection systems against chemical warfare agents in various environmental conditions.  The NTADTS provides a new capability at Edgewood Chemical Biological Center to conduct highly toxic material testing using new emerging threats.  The NTADTS supports testing of Decontamination, Collective Protection, Individual Protection, and Contamination Avoidance products.  The CBD acquisition programs supported are Dismounted Reconnaissance Sets Kits and Outfits (DR SKO), Next Generation Chemical Detector (NGCD), Decon Family of Systems (DFoS), Joint Expeditionary Collective Protection (JECP), Joint Service Aircrew Mask - Fixed and Rotary Wing (JSAM-FW), (JSAM-RW), and Common Analytical Laboratory System (CALS).

(2) Sense Laboratory (Biological): The product for this area is the Whole System Live Agent Test (WSLAT) "Full System" Chamber and the Standoff Detection Test System (SDTS).  The WSLAT "Full System" Chamber supports testing of all biological point detection systems in production configuration in biological live agent environments.  The SDTS, as a new start, will provide test and evaluation capability for the Joint Standoff Detection System (JSDS) acquisition program.  The CBD acquisition programs supported are the Joint Biological Point Detection System (JBPDS) and the Joint Biological Tactical Detection System (JBTDS).

(3) Field Simulant (Sense): The product for this area is a fully instrumented simulant Test Grid.  The Test Grid effort provides a fully instrumented 20 km by 40 km field chemical and biological simulant test capability that integrates cloud tracking equipment; meteorological equipment; and test data network.  The CBD acquisition programs supported are the Joint Expeditionary Collective Protection (JECP), Next Generation Chemical Detector (NGCD), Joint Biological Point Detection System (JBPDS) and the Joint Biological Tactical Detection System (JBTDS).

(4) Individual Protection, Collective Protection and Decontamination (Shield and Sustain): IPEMS provides an articulated robotic mannequin that simulates Warfighters activities and includes under ensemble agent sensing capability for evaluating IPE against chemical warfare agents.  IPEMS consists of an articulated robotic mannequin, exposure chamber, control room, and real time under-ensemble sensor system.  The individual protective equipment CBD programs supported include: Uniform Integrated Protection Ensemble Increment 1 (UIPE 1), Joint Service Aircrew Mask Fixed Wing (JSAM FW) and Rotary Wing (JSAM RW), Joint Service Lightweight Integrated Suit Technology (JSLIST), and the Joint Service General Purpose Mask (JSGPM).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Budget Activity includes research, development, testing and evaluation management support for the Department of Defense (DoD) Chemical and Biological Defense Program (CBDP).

Program Element 0605384BP supports Joint Doctrine and Training (Project DT6), sustains the technical test capability at West Desert Test Center (WDTC) (Project DW6); sustains the core Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&amp;T) laboratory infrastructure (Project LS6), provides for program management and financial management support (Project MS6), and supports the Joint Concept Development and Experimentation (JCDE) program (Project O49).   

The Joint Training and Doctrine Support (DT6) project funds development of Joint Doctrine and Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) for developing CB defense systems.  This project also funds CB modeling and simulation to support the Warfighter.

The Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB) is a set of test installations, facilities, and ranges which are regarded as "national assets".  These assets are sized, operated, and maintained primarily for DoD test and evaluation missions.  However, the MRTFB facilities and ranges are also available to commercial and other users on a reimbursable basis.  WDTC is designated as the primary element of the MRTFB to primarily conduct CB Defense test and evaluation.  The DW6 Project provides operating funds to WDTC to ensure that DoD test customers are only charged direct costs of testing and that overhead expenses are centrally funded.  It finances the required institutional test operating costs.  Institutional test operating costs include institutional civilian and contractor labor; repair and maintenance of test instrumentation, equipment, and facilities; and replacement of test equipment.

The Laboratory Support (LS6) project funds laboratory infrastructure to maintain and enhance DoD infrastructure capabilities to counter an expanding threat space, exploit advances in technology; and develop and transition CB defense equipment and countermeasures to the Warfighter.

The management support (MS6) project, provides management support for the DoD CBDP to allow program overview and integration of overall medical and non-medical programs by the Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Nuclear, Chemical, and Biological Defense Programs (ATSD(NCB)), through the Deputy Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Chemical Biological Defense and Chemical Demilitarization Programs (DATSD(CBD/CD)); funds management by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA); integration of Joint requirements, management of training and doctrine by the Joint Requirements Office (JRO); Joint RDA planning, input to the Annual Report to Congress and Program Objective Memorandum (POM) development by the Program Analysis and Integration Office (PA&amp;IO); review of Joint plans and the consolidated CB Defense POM Strategy by Army in its Executive Agent role.  

The management support project also funds the Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) Executive mission to establish test infrastructure investment strategy and adequate testing for Developmental Testing (DT) and Operational Testing (OT) of Department of Defense (DoD) Chemical Biological Defense (CBD) systems and components throughout the systems' acquisition life cycle, as required in the RDA Plan under the JTIWG program.  The JTIWG program funds T&amp;E Early Involvement, test threat planning, Fielded Equipment Assessments, T&amp;E studies, and T&amp;E Standards planning and development to support testing the CBD systems for all services to include radiological, nuclear, medical T&amp;E efforts.  

The Joint Concept Development and Experimentation (O49) project funds the planning, conduct, evaluation, and reporting on Joint tests (for other than developmental hardware) and accomplishment of operational research assessments in response to requirements received from the Services and the Combatant Commanders for already fielded equipment and systems.

This Budget Activity also funds Program Element 0605502BP, which supports the Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) program. The overall objective of the Chemical and Biological Defense (CBD) SBIR program is to improve the transition or transfer of innovative CBD technologies between DoD components and the private sector for mutual benefit. The CBD program includes those technology efforts that maximize a strong defensive posture in a CB environment using passive and active means as deterrents. These technologies include CB detection; information assessment (identification, modeling, and intelligence); contamination avoidance; and protection of both individual soldiers and equipment.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project provides the technical and operational capability for testing Department of Defense (DoD) Chemical and Biological (CB) defense materiel, equipment, and systems from concept through production at West Desert Test Center (WDTC), a Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB) located at Dugway Proving Ground (DPG).  Project provides overhead (institutional) funding required to operate WDTC. 

WDTC is the reliance center for all DoD CB defense testing and provides the United States' only combined range, chamber, toxic chemical lab, and bio-safety level (BSL) three test facility.  Total institutional test operating costs are to be provided by the Service component.

WDTC uses state-of-the-art chemical and life sciences test facilities and test chambers to perform CB defense testing of protective gear, decontamination systems, detectors, and equipment while maintaining safety, security, and surety of chemical agents and biological pathogens.  WDTC also provides a fully instrumented outdoor range capability for testing with simulants that can be correlated to the laboratory testing with live agents to ensure reliable and repeatable data is generated to support acquisition decisions of CB defense equipment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The SBIR Program is a Congressionally mandated program established to increase the participation of small business in federal research and development (R&amp;D).  Currently, each participating government agency must reserve 2.5% of its extramural R&amp;D for SBIR awards to competing small businesses.  The goal of the SBIR Program is to invest in the innovative capabilities of the small business community to help meet government R&amp;D objectives while allowing small companies to develop technologies and products which they can then commercialize through sales back to the government or in the private sector.

The Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Program like SBIR, is a Government-wide program, mandated by the Small Business Research and Development Enhancement Act of 1992, PL 102-564.  STTR was established in FY94 as a three-year pilot program.  In early 1996, the General Accounting Office (GAO) conducted a comprehensive review of the Government-wide STTR Program to determine the effectiveness of the pilot program.  Upon review of the GAO report, Congress voted to reauthorize the STTR Program to the year 2000, consistent with the authorization period for the SBIR Program.

STTR was established as a companion program to the SBIR Program and is executed in essentially the same manner; however, there are several distinct differences.  The STTR Program provides a mechanism for participation by university, Federally-Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), and other non-profit research institutions.  Specifically, the STTR Program is designed to provide an incentive for small companies and research at academic institutions and non-profit research and development institutions to work together to move emerging technical ideas from the laboratory to the marketplace to foster high-tech economic development and to advance U.S. economic competitiveness.  Each STTR proposal must be submitted by a team which includes a small business (as the prime contractor for contracting purposes) and at least one research institution, which have entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement for the purposes of the STTR effort.  Furthermore, the project must be divided up such that the small business performs at least 40% of the work and the research institution(s) performs at least 30% of the work.  The remainder of the work may be performed by either party or a third party.  The budget is separate from the SBIR budget and is significantly smaller (0.15% of the extramural R&amp;D budget vs. 2.5% for the SBIR Program).

The DoD has consolidated management and oversight of the CBDP into a single office within the OSD.  The Army was designated as the Executive Agent for coordination and integration of the Chemical and Biological Defense (CBD) program.  The executive agent for the SBIR/STTR portion of the program is the Army Research Office-Washington.

The overall objective of the CBD SBIR/STTR program is to improve the transition or transfer of innovative CBD technologies between DoD components and the private sector for mutual benefit.  The CBD program includes those technology efforts that maximize a strong defensive posture in a biological or chemical environment using passive and active means as deterrents.  These technologies include chemical and biological detection; information assessment, which includes identification, modeling, and intelligence; contamination avoidance; and protection of both individual soldiers and equipment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project provides for the upgrade and modernization of fielded Information Systems including the Joint Effects Model (JEM) and the Joint Warning and Reporting Network (JWARN). This project also provides for the Software Support Activity (SSA).

The Joint Effects Model (JEM) is the DoD's only accredited model that has been operationally tested and deemed effective for predicting hazards associated with the release of contaminants into the environment. JEM is being developed in separate increments and is capable of modeling hazards in a variety of scenarios including: counterforce, passive defense, accident and/or incidents; high altitude releases, urban Nuclear Biological Chemical (NBC) environments; building interiors, and human performance degradation.  Battle space commanders and first responders must have a Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear (CBRN) hazard prediction capability in order to make decisions that will minimize risks of CBRN contamination and enable them to continue mission operations.  JEM operates in an integrated fashion with operational and tactical Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems, and in a standalone mode.  JEM interfaces and communicates with the other programs such as JWARN, weather systems, intelligence systems, and various databases.  

The Joint Warning and Reporting Network (JWARN) will provide the Joint Forces with a comprehensive Integrated Early Warning, Analysis and Response capability to minimize the effects of hostile CBRN attacks, as well as accidents and incidents.  It will provide the operational capability to employ CBRN warning technology which will collect, analyze, identify, locate, report, and disseminate warnings.  JWARN will be compatible and integrated with Joint Service C4ISR Systems.  JWARN will transition from platform specific Common Operating Environment (COE) standards to a Web-based Service Oriented Architecture (SOA).  JWARN will also provide an expansion of sensors that will connect to JWARN, increased automation of message handling, improved false alarm filtering, integration of route-planning calculator, and interoperability with additional command and control (C2) systems.  JWARN will be located in Command and Control Centers at the appropriate level and will be employed by CBRN defense specialists and other designated personnel.  This employment will transfer data automatically from existing and future sensors to provide commanders with the capability to support operational decision making in a CBRN environment.  JWARN will provide additional data processing to support the production of plans and reports, and access to specific CBRN information to improve the efficiency of limited CBRN personnel assets.  JWARN will integrate existing sensors into a sensor network or host C2 system, but does not provide the sensors that will be employed in the operating environment.  The JWARN capability described above will be developed utilizing an incremental approach based on Service requirements and host system architecture.    

The SSA is a CBDP enterprise-wide, user developmental support and service organization focusing on development assistance and net-centric interoperability.  SSA provides the CBRN community with critical "plug and play" capabilities which allow for system modularity and re-configurability across the enterprise.  SSA  helps ensure that the various programs and projects are designing/adhering to DoD and industry standards to avoid proprietary/stove-pipe solutions.  The requirement for net-centric, composable solutions provides the near term foundation for the Warfighter's ability to communicate his CBRN solutions and interoperate with other service operational systems.  It also supports a longer term ability to interoperate with related agencies and to reduce the Warfighter's CBRN footprint as technologies improve.

The SSA also directly supports various Bio-Surveillance efforts in training and logistics coordination.  The SSA is re-baselining the entire IM/IT work-flow in support of the Bio-Surveillance Portal.  By creating a catalog of portlets (think apps on a smart-phone) a user will be able to select the portlets that they need/use and will have access to data that is appropriate for them in a customizable format.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The program plans to award multiple development contracts in a competitive prototyping phase prior to downselecting a single JEM developer and integrator.

JWARN

JWARN Increment 2 will structure itself in conjunction with the JROC's  IT Box  concept.  JWARN Increment 2 will incorporate all current and future technologies planned for incorporation into JWARN in their IS ICD.  This will reduce future trips to the JROC for approval of improved capabilities and ultimately move the program away from incrementalization.   Future JWARN development efforts will be acquired via a Request for Proposal (RFP) under full and open competition.  Using full and open competitive procedures, a single contract will be awarded to the responsible offeror who provides the best value in maintaining current JWARN software and developing future JWARN software.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project provides for the upgrade and modernization of fielded Medical Biological defense equipment/systems including the Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS).  

JBAIDS is an evolutionary development program.  JBAIDS is a commercial off-the-shelf development/production effort started in August 2003 that focused on rapid development and fielding efforts to deliver a critical capability to identify bacteria and viral agents in environmental surveillance and clinical specimen sample types.  By 2005, 16 biological warfare (BW) agent surveillance detection kits were fielded along with the first JBAIDS in vitro diagnostic (IVD) assay cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  JBAIDS currently has seven IVD kits cleared by the FDA, e.g. Anthrax, Plague, Tularemia, Q-Fever, H5 Avian, Influenza A&amp;B, etc.  An expanded influenza detection panel covering six new assays was cleared on Sept 13, 2011.  Additionally, the JBAIDS Platinum Path Extraction Kit (PPEK) Bridging Study contract was awarded on Oct 20, 2011; this will allow the PPEK to be used with the Anthrax, Plague, and Tularemia IVD kits.  JBAIDS achieved full operational capability (340 systems delivered all Services) in July 2011.  JBAIDS efforts in 2012-2015 will focus on adding new surveillance food and water pathogen detection assays.  Also, the development team will focus on completing Pre-Emergency Use Authorization (Pre-EUA's) packages annually for FDA review.  These operational development RDT&amp;E funds will be used to oversea the configuration management of the system to include the conduct of software security information assurance (IA) updates on fielded software and monitor analyzer/laptop parts obsolescence.

The Next Generation Diagnostics System (NGDS) addresses the mission needs identified in the CBRN Field Analytics ICD (2010).  The NGDS is envisioned to be an evolutionary acquisition family of systems to provide increments of capability over time across many echelons of the Combat Health Support System.  The mission of the NGDS is to provide CBRN warfare threat identification and FDA-cleared diagnostics to inform individual patient treatment, CBRN situational awareness, and disease surveillance.  NGDS Increment 1 Deployable Component will significantly improve diagnostic capabilities for deployable combat health support units (role 3) while also improving operational suitability and affordability.  The NGDS Increment 1 Deployable Component is intended to replace the legacy Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS) beginning in FY17.  The NGDS Increment 1 Service Laboratory Component is intended to provide high throughput Biological threat identification, characterization and diagnostics to fixed site CONUS and OCONUS laboratories operated by the Army, Navy and Air Force in coordination with the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center.  NGDS Increment 2 is intended to provide advanced diagnostics for biological pathogens and toxins, diagnostics for chemical and radiological exposures and to provide capability to lower echelons of care.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) was selected to design and manufacture additional surveillance assay kits to detect food and water pathogens,  along with diagnostic kits to detect additional threat agents.  The program plans to conduct the annual JBAIDS Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) software compliance certification in addition to any logistics sustainment issues associated with parts obsolescence.  Additionally, the JBAIDS program office plans to partner with the US Army Medical Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), other DoD and US Government laboratories to develop FDA Pre-Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) packages for biological warfare agents (BWA's) (e.g., Burkholderia, Rickettsia prowazekii and Smallpox diseases) that could be used as biological warfare threats to DoD military forces.  A sole-source contract will be awarded to the JBAIDS prime contractor, Idaho Technology Inc., to replace laptops and software operating systems in numerous deployed JBAIDS worldwide due to parts obsolescence and unsupportable Microsoft software (Microsoft XP Professional).    JBAIDS FY14-18 funds transition under NGDS.

NGDS

The Next Generation Diagnostics System (NGDS) will develop and field an enhanced CBRN analytical and diagnostic system to the Joint force through an evolutionary acquisition strategy.  NGDS Increment 1 Deployable Component will follow a developmental acquisition strategy to field Biological Warfare Agent diagnostic analytical devices.  Additional DoD-unique BWA diagnostic and environmental surveillance capabilities will be added to the downselected platform capabilities.  BA4 funds were used to conduct competitive prototyping and early operational assessments on the commercial hardware diagnostic systems immediately following MS A to support downselect to the final NGDS Increment 1 system.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
