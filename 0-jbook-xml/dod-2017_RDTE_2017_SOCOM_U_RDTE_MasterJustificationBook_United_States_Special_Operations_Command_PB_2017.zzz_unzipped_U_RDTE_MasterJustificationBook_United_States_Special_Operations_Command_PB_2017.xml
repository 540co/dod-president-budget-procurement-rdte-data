                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element enables USSOCOM to conduct studies and develop laboratory prototypes for applied research and advanced technology development, as well as leverage other organizations' technology projects that may not otherwise be affordable within MFP-11.  Applying small incremental amounts of investments to Department of Defense (DOD), other government agencies, and commercial organizations allows USSOCOM to influence the direction of technology development or the schedule against which it is being pursued, and to acquire emerging technologies for Special Operations Forces.  This project provides an investment strategy for USSOCOM to link technology opportunities with capability deficiencies, capability objectives, technology thrust areas, human endurance and sensory performance, and technology development objectives.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Small incremental co-investments with DOD, other government agencies, and commercial organizations allow USSOCOM to influence the schedule and direction of technology developments, emerging technologies, and capabilities for Special Operations Forces (SOF), with significant economies of investment.  This USSOCOM investment strategy is used to link technology opportunities with USSOCOM capability deficiencies, capability objectives; technology thrust areas, and technology objectives.  Technology development needs in these areas may be advertised to industry and government research and development agencies via agency announcements and calls for white papers.  Sub-projects within the SOF Technology Demonstration effort include:

•  SOF Technology Development Sub-Project:  This project conducts studies and develops laboratory prototypes for applied research and advanced technology developments, and leverages other organizations' technology projects that may not otherwise be affordable within MFP-11.

•  Tagging, Tracking, and Locating (TTL) Sub-Project:  TTL funds Applied Research projects identified in the USSOCOM Quick Look Capabilities Based Assessments (QL-CBA).  TTL applies leading edge nanotechnology, biometric and biotechnology, and chemistry which is directed towards the development of revolutionary tags, taggants, sensors, communications, and data processing.

•  Classified Sub-Project (provided under separate cover).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

ATDs provide a means for demonstrating and evaluating the utility of emerging/advanced technologies in as realistic an operational environment as possible by Special Operations Forces (SOF) users.  Evaluation results are included in a transition package, which assists in the initiation of or insertion into an acquisition program.  ATDs also address projects that are a result of unique joint special mission or area-specific needs for which a few-of-a-kind prototypes must be developed on a rapid response basis, or are of sufficient time sensitivity to accelerate the prototyping effort of a normal acquisition program in any phase.  

Engineering Analysis (project SF101) provides rapid response capability for the investigation, evaluation, and demonstration of technologies for SOF platform (ground, air, and maritime) and soldier system-unique requirements. Timely application of SOF-unique technology is critical and necessary to meet requirements in such areas as: sensor integration; enhanced situational awareness; near-real-time intelligence to include data fusion, threat detection and avoidance; electronic support measures for threat geo-location and specific emitter identification; navigation; target detection; weapon performance integration; and future SOF platform and soldier system requirements.  Provides additional engineering analysis and testing required to transition items from national forces to theater forces.

Information and Broadcast Systems Advanced Technology (project S225) conducts rapid prototyping, advanced technology demonstrations, and advanced concept technology demonstrations of information and broadcast systems technology.  Includes planning, analyzing, evaluating, and production information systems capabilities and distribution/dissemination broadcast systems capabilities.  It provides a means for demonstrating and evaluating the utility of emerging/advanced technologies in as realistic an operational environment as possible by SOF users.  This project also integrates efforts with each other and conducts technology demonstrations in conjunction with joint experiments and other assessment events.  Evaluation results are included in a transition package, which assists in the initiation of or insertion into an acquisition program.  The project also addresses unique, joint special mission or area-specific needs for which prototypes must be developed on a rapid response basis, or are of sufficient time sensitivity to accelerate the prototyping effort of a normal acquisition program in any phase.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

It is a means for demonstrating and evaluating the utility of emerging/advanced technologies in operationally relevant environments with Special Operations Forces (SOF) users.  This project integrates emerging technologies and presents them in technology demonstrations, in conjunction with joint experiments and other assessment events.  Evaluation results often facilitate the initiation of new programs and the insertion of appropriate technologies to acquisition programs.   The element also addresses unique, joint special mission or area-specific needs for which a few rapid prototypes must be developed on a responsive basis, or are of sufficient time sensitivity to accelerate prototyping efforts of a normal acquisition program in any phase.  Sub-projects within the SOF Special Technology Development efforts include:  

  •  Special Operations Special Technology Sub-Project.  This sub-project integrates emerging technologies and presents them in technology demonstrations, in conjunction with joint experiments and other assessment events.  This project received a congressional add in FY 2016.

  • Tagging, Tracking, and Locating (TTL) Technologies Sub-Project.  TTL funds SOF unique ATDs identified in the USSOCOM Quick Look Capabilities Based Assessments (QL-CBA).  TTL rapidly prototypes and expeditiously transitions projects from laboratory to acquisition Programs of Record/operational use to address SOF capability deficiencies.

  • National to Theater Transition Sub-Project.  Conduct additional testing required to transition items from national forces to theater forces.

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project conducts rapid prototyping of information and broadcast system technology.  Includes cyber capabilities that predict the best media channels to reach potential target audiences, data mining and information collections tools, propaganda and social behavior analytical tools, cultural analysis tool sets and emerging technologies that support the planning and analytical needs for the Military Information Support Operations (MISO) forces.  It provides a means for demonstrating and evaluating the utility of emerging/advanced technologies in as realistic an operational environment as possible by SOF users.  This project integrates efforts and conducts technology demonstrations in conjunction with joint experiments and other assessment events and performs market research on emerging technologies that support all phases of MISO.  Evaluation results are included in a transition package, which assists in the initiation of or insertion into an acquisition program.  The project also addresses unique, joint special mission or area-specific needs.  Seeks technologies that will transform current MISO capabilities through two major objectives: 1) Exploit technologies capable of disseminating products to reach target audiences across a variety of media to include audiences in denied areas.  2) Automate and improve MISO planning and analytical capability through technologies that are integrated into SOF planning systems (Cultural Analysis, Targeting, Theme Development, Media &amp; Product Selection, Distribution &amp; Dissemination, and Measures of Effectiveness).  Develops software applications that increases the efficiency and shortens the timeline to get MISO dissemination packages approved.  Develops hardware/software tools that facilitate the collaboration and sharing of information and other critical data.  

Broadcast and Dissemination Modernization.  Develops emerging technologies available in the marketplace to transform and modernize planning, analysis, development, broadcast, distribution, dissemination, and feedback capabilities for MISO forces. This initiative will also continue development of appropriate emerging technologies initially identified by Advance Technology Demonstrations and Joint Capability Technology Demonstrations to transition to acquisition programs. Technologies include: multi-frequency broadcast systems; digital broadcast capabilities; remote controlled electronic paper; near-real-time command and control of unattended systems, especially in denied areas; focused/beam speaker sound technologies; visual projection technologies; advanced commercial broadcast technologies including amplitude modulation and frequency modulation radio transmitters and antenna; television transmitter and antenna systems; internet and telephony dissemination and broadcast systems; technologies capable of long-loiter broadcast and delivery in denied and permissive environment; and technologies that automate and improve planning and analytical capability through integrated capabilities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This program element is part of the Military Intelligence Program (MIP).  The SAFC program develops and deploys special capabilities to perform intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance for deployed Special Operations Forces (SOF) using non-traditional means.  It provides a mechanism for SOF user combat evaluation of emerging sensor technologies. Special Applications for Contingencies (SAFC) applies focused Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) for relatively low cost solutions to provide remotely controlled system emplacement and data exfiltration from denied areas.  This program also specifically addresses short lead-time contingency planning requirements where focused R&amp;D will allow for test and evaluation of leading edge solutions to emergent problem sets.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The Distributed Common Ground/Surface System Special Operations Forces (DCGS-SOF) is part of a family of systems providing Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Processing, Exploitation, Dissemination (PED), and analytical capabilities at the Joint Task Force level and below through a combination of reach back, forward support, and collaboration.  The mission tailored infrastructure interconnects the warfighter and sensors to find and fix High Value Targets and provides a network-enabled, interoperable construct allowing continual, unimpeded sharing of intelligence data, information and services with SOF and between the Services, other national intelligence agencies, combatant commands and Multi-National partners.  It connects the SOF warfighter with the essential intelligence information and provides situation awareness information to the SOF leadership at all echelons.  The four components of DCGS-SOF include the following:  The Enterprise provides infrastructure and processing capability to allow for worldwide SOF intelligence information sharing. Full Motion Video PED provides PED capabilities in garrison and deployed tactical environments of manned and unmanned sensors.  SILENT DAGGER provides Signals Intelligence exploitation capability in both garrison and deployable environments. The All Source Information Fusion will provide the intelligence analytical tools via a global and disconnected architecture.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>DCGS-SOF leverages SOF programs, DoD partners and other Government Agencies to integrate commercial/government off-the-shelf systems, and other mature technologies into the Program of Record which resides within the SOF Information Enterprise (SIE) and enables more agile access to (searchable, discoverable) and sharing of data and services to meet SOF-peculiar documented requirements.  The technology allows for seamless integration and federation with DoD, interagency, and Coalition ISR tactical PED systems.  The DCGS-SOF program office employs an agile development process with capability insertions into the development baseline for assessment and future deployment into the operational baseline.  All development requirements are prioritized through the DCGS Requirements Working Group (DRWG) chaired by J2.  Once approved, the requirements are evaluation and scheduled by an engineering development team.  Using this methodology allows capabilities to be inserted in a fast and agile manner based on user requirements and priorities.  All evolutionary technology insertions (ETIs) in the R-4 schedule are based on current program office projections.  If requirements change based on the DRWG, the ETI and version capabilities identified may change.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element identifies, develops, integrates, and tests Special Operations Forces (SOF)-unique mission kits, mission payloads, weapons, and modifications on MQ-9 UAVs, ground control stations, and training systems as a component of the Medium Altitude Long Endurance Tactical program.  USSOCOM is designated as the DOD lead for planning, synchronizing, and as directed, executing Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) against terrorist networks.  USSOCOM requires the capability to find, fix, finish, exploit, and analyze time-sensitive high-value targets.  These targets can often only be identified with patient collection of information and require rapid, decisive action during the short periods in which they present themselves.  This program element addresses the primary areas of Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, and Target (ISR&amp;T) Acquisition, and Strike.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

As the supported combatant command in Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO), USSOCOM requires the capability to find, fix, finish, exploit, and analyze time-sensitive high-value targets.  These targets can often only be identified with patient collection of information and require rapid, decisive action during the short periods in which they present themselves.  This project addresses the primary areas of Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, and Target (ISR&amp;T) Acquisition and Strike.  This project received OCO funding in FY 2015 and a congressional add in FY 2016.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This program element is part of the Military Intelligence Program.  Two programs are in this program element: Small Unmanned Aerial System (SUAS) and the Multi-mission Tactical Unmanned Aerial System (MTUAS).  SUAS identifies, develops, integrates, and tests Special Operations Forces (SOF) unique mission kits, mission payloads, air vehicle enhancements, and modifications on the SUAS and related ground control stations.  MTUAS identifies, develops, integrates, and tests Special Operations Forces (SOF) unique mission kits, mission payloads, air vehicle enhancements, and modifications on the MTUAS and related ground control stations.   

USSOCOM has been designated as the DOD lead for planning, synchronizing, and as directed, executing global operations against terrorist networks and targets.  USSOCOM requires the capability to find, fix, and finish time-sensitive high-value fixed and fleeting targets at the unit and team level without placing personnel and units in harm’s way.  These targets can often only be identified with patient collection of information and require rapid, decisive action during the short periods in which they present themselves.  This line item addresses the primary areas of Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, and Targeting (ISR&amp;T) capabilities for SOF.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project is part of the Military Intelligence Program. Two programs are in this project: Small Unmanned Aerial System (SUAS) and the Multi-mission Tactical Unmanned Aerial System (MTUAS).  SUAS identifies, develops, integrates, and tests Special Operations Forces (SOF)-unique mission kits, mission payloads, air vehicle enhancements, and modifications on the SUAS and related ground control stations.  MTUAS identifies, develops, integrates, and tests Special Operations Forces (SOF) unique mission kits, mission payloads, air vehicle enhancements, and modifications on the MTUAS and related ground control stations. The current material solution for SUAS is the All Environment Capable Variant (AECV) of the Puma UAS. The current material solution for MTUAS is the Scan Eagle UAS.

USSOCOM has been designated as the DOD lead for planning, synchronizing, and as directed, executing global operations against terrorist networks and targets. USSOCOM requires the capability to find, fix, and finish time-sensitive high-value fixed and fleeting targets at the unit and team level without placing personnel and units in harm’s way. These targets can often only be identified with patient collection of information and require rapid, decisive action during the short periods in which they present themselves. This line item addresses the primary areas of Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, and Targeting capabilities for SOF.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element consists of a highly competitive three-phase award system that provides qualified small business concerns with the opportunity to propose high quality innovative ideas that meet specific research and development needs of USSOCOM.  Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) is a result of the Small Business Development Act of 1992.  It was enacted by Congress in Public Law 97-219, reenacted by Public Law 99-443, and reauthorized by the SBIR Program Reauthorization Act of 2012.  Starting in FY 1994, the SBIR program was refocused toward dual use and defense reinvestment efforts.  Phase I projects evaluate the scientific technical merit and feasibility of an idea.  Phase II projects expand the results of, and further pursue, the developments of Phase I.  Phase III is for commercialization of the results of Phase II and requires the use of private or non-SBIR federal funding.  USSOCOM participates annually in the DOD Request for Proposal process.  USSOCOM then awards its proposed SBIR projects.  FY 2014 is the first year USSOCOM is participating in the Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program.  The STTR goal is similar to the SBIR program, but the STTR program has the additional goal to expand public/private sector partnerships between small business and nonprofit U.S. research institutions.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Aviation Systems Advanced Development:
This project provides for the development, demonstration, and integration of current and maturing technologies for Special Operations Forces (SOF)-unique aviation and training requirements. Timely application of SOF-unique technology is critical and necessary to meet requirements in such areas as: SOF specific avionics; Low Probability of Intercept/Low Probability of Detection (LPI/LPD) terrain following/terrain avoidance radar; Defensive Countermeasures; Electronic Warfare (EW) - Radio Frequency Countermeasures (RFCM); Precision Strike Package (PSP); AC-130H, AC-130W, and AC-130U Recapitalization, and other SOF airborne platforms; digital terrain elevation data and electronic order of battle; digital maps; enhanced situational awareness; near-real-time Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR); data fusion; threat detection and avoidance; navigation, target detection, and identification technologies; weapons integration; digital broadcast capabilities; aerial refueling; survivability and ISR payload technological improvements with size, weight, power and integration onto all SOF ISR platforms.  

CV-22 Development:
The CV-22 is a SOF variant of the V-22 vertical medium lift, multi-mission aircraft. The CV-22 project provides long range, high speed, infiltration, exfiltration, and resupply to Special Forces teams in hostile, denied, and politically sensitive areas. This is a capability not currently provided by other existing aircraft. The V-22 Joint Program Office is developing improved capabilities in block increments. The funding in this project supports these block increments as well as associated flight test support. The Block 10 increment was completed in FY 2007, and the Block 20 increment started in FY 2008.  Block 20: Design, integrate, test, and validate enhancements required to meet SOF-unique mission requirements and correct deficiencies identified in previous testing.  This incremental development will provide improved capabilities to include, but not limited to, more robust performance in situational awareness, ISR, weapons, avionics, survivability, maneuverability, mission deployment and improved reliability and maintainability of the CV platform.  CV-22 Terrain Following/Terrain Avoidance (TF/TA) Radar (Silent Knight Radar) program provides long-range, night/adverse weather, clandestine penetration of medium-to-high threat areas to infill, exfill, and resupply SOF forces. Provides more sustainable/capable replacement to obsolescing and tech limited terrain following/avoidance radar.

Mission Training and Preparation Systems:
The Special Operations Mission Planning and Execution (SOMPE) project funds the definition, design, development, prototyping, integration, and testing of SOMPE systems to support mission planning, rehearsal, and execution requirements to meet SOF-unique mission requirements and correct deficiencies in current mission planning, rehearsal, and execution capabilities. The Mission Training and Preparation Systems (MTPS) project also includes program management, systems engineering, configuration management, architecture development, risk reduction, and trade study initiatives, as well as initiatives to assure interoperability and commonality between diverse mission planning, rehearsal, and execution systems. 

AC/MC-130J:
The AC/MC-130J project funds core SOF-unique modifications to replace aging/retired AC-130H Spectre, AC-130W Stinger II, AC-130U Spooky, MC-130E Combat Talon I, MC-130P Combat Shadow, MC-130H Combat Talon II aircraft.  The 8 AC-130H Spectre, 12 AC-130W Stinger II and 17 AC-130U Spooky airframes will be replaced with MC-130J aircraft modified with the PSP to achieve the AC-130J configuration.  The AC-130J aircraft will provide close air support, air interdiction, and armed reconnaissance capability.  The MC-130J Commando II aircraft perform clandestine or low visibility, single or multi-ship low-level missions intruding politically-sensitive or hostile territories; provide air refueling for special operations helicopters and CV-22 aircraft; and airdrop of leaflets, small special operations teams, resupply bundles and combat rubber raiding craft.  Additional capabilities include low-level navigation and in-flight refueling. The Air Force will procure and field basic aircraft, common support equipment, and trainers for USSOCOM. An incremental upgrade approach will be used to incorporate SOF capabilities onto the aircraft and training systems.

Rotary Wing Aviation:
This project develops SOF-unique modifications and upgrades to SOF rotary wing aircraft that operate in increasingly hostile environments.  This project also includes modifications to Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) and weapons systems to counter rapidly emerging threats, improve lethality and enhance aircraft self-protection.  Rotary wing aircraft supported by this project include: MH-60M, MH-47G, and A/MH-6M. These aircraft provide aviation support to SOF in worldwide contingency operations and low-intensity conflicts. They must be capable of rapid deployment, undetected penetration of hostile areas, and operating at extended ranges under adverse weather conditions to infiltrate, provide logistics for, reinforce, and extract SOF.  The threat is characterized by an extensive and sophisticated ground based air defense system and an upgraded air-to-air capability targeted against helicopters.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

• EC-130J Upgrades provides for integration of SOF-unique implementation of the C-130J block cycle upgrade as installed on the EC-130J Commando Solo aircraft and development of digital broadcast capabilities. 

• Enhanced Situational Awareness (ESA) provides SOF C-130 fleet with near-real-time intelligence reporting to include data fusion, threat detection, identification, and avoidance.

• EW-RFCM supports development, integration and test activities to provide EW capability against RF threats for SOF AC/MC-130J aircraft.  The DCM suite is an integrated package of existing aircraft defensive systems which provides situational awareness and threat response processing; this includes the Radio Frequency Countermeasures (RFCM) system, and future defensive systems.  RFCM program provides SOF-unique aircraft defensive capabilities required for SOF missions.  The FY 2017 funding request was reduced by $4.636 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.

• PSP for SOF supports systems engineering, analysis, development, and enhancement of the baseline PSP for later integration and installation onto host MC-130J aircraft provided by the U.S. Air Force for the AC-130H, AC-130W and AC-130U recapitalization, as well as current SOF C-130s and other SOF platforms.  Missions for the AC-130 aircraft include, but are not limited to, Close Air Support (CAS), Air Interdiction, and Armed Reconnaissance.  PSP is modular, scalable, and platform neutral.

• PSP Large Caliber Gun supports systems engineering, analysis, development, integration, and test of a large caliber gun capability enhancement to the PSP installed on the AC-130 aircraft. 

• C-130 TF Radar System supports development, integration and test of a TF/TA radar and on-board processor to provide a multi-mode terrain following capability on MC-130J aircraft.  Crew systems integration efforts include modifications to aircraft controls and displays to automate TF/TA flight and reduce pilot, copilot and Combat Systems Officer workload during missions previously performed by five aircrew members on legacy C-130 tankers and penetrators. This project received a congressional add in FY 2016.  The FY 2017 funding request was reduced by $4.636 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.

• SOF Common TF/TA (Silent Knight) Radar supports Engineering and Manufacturing Development, qualification, and operational flight testing of a SOF common TF/TA LPI/LPD radar to defeat advanced passive detection threats while maintaining ability to fly safe TF.  This radar is targeted for use on all MH-47G heavy assault helicopters, MH-60M medium assault helicopters, MC-130J Commando II and CV-22B Osprey aircraft.

• EC-130J Commando Solo supports development, integration and testing of digital broadcast capabilities on the EC-130J Commando Solo aircraft.

• ISR Payload Sensor Technology supports development, integration, and testing of sensor miniaturization effort to place large ISR platform capability, such as Group 4-5 unmanned aerial systems (UASs) onto all SOF ISR platforms.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

• ISR Payload Sensor Technology:  Effort is being executed via a spiral development, integration and testing acquisition strategy based on leveraging existing sensor technology.  The focus will be on reducing the size, weight, power and cost of state of the art ISR sensors fielded on larger ISR platforms, such as Group 4-5 unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), in order to make them useable by smaller SOF ISR platforms, such as Group 2-3 UAS.  This development will include the integration of the ISR capability with the platform’s C2 and Communications systems as appropriate.  Example classes of sensors to be included under this development are:  Signal Intelligence, Electro Optical / Infrared / Multi-spectral / Synthetic Aperture Radar, Tagging, Tracking, and Locating, and clandestine communications.  Integrated systems may include the ability to generate CAT 1 or 2 National Geo-Spatial Agency - validated targeting coordinates.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The CV-22 is a Special Operations Forces (SOF) variant of the V-22 vertical medium lift, multi-mission aircraft.  The CV-22 provides long range, high speed infiltration, exfiltration, and resupply to Special Forces teams in hostile, denied, and politically sensitive areas. This is a capability not currently provided by existing aircraft. The V-22 Joint Program Office is developing improved capabilities in block increments supported with rapid prototyping. The funding in this project supports these block increments as well as associated flight test support.

• Block 20: Design, integrate, test, and validate enhancements required to meet SOF-unique mission requirements and correct deficiencies identified in previous testing. This incremental development will provide improved capabilities to include, but not limited to, robust performance in situational awareness, weapons, avionics, survivability, maneuverability, mission deployment, improved reliability and maintainability of the CV platform.

• CV-22 Terrain Following/Terrain Avoidance (TF/TA) Radar:  Provides long-range, night/adverse weather, clandestine penetration of medium-to-high threat areas to infill, exfill, and resupply SOF forces. Provides more sustainable/capable radar to replace obsolescing and tech limited APQ-186 terrain following/avoidance radar.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The CV-22 program is managed by the Navy V-22 Joint Program Office (NAVAIRSYSCOM PMA-275). This ensures that the CV-22 changes are incorporated into the ongoing V-22 production line with minimum impact. Funding for the baseline CV-22 Engineering Manufacturing and Development, known as Block 0, is embedded in the Navy budget. Block 20 and subsequent block upgrades are planned to follow the same acquisition strategy, with NAVAIRSYSCOM PMA-275 ensuring the integration of SOF-unique systems with the ongoing basic vehicle improvements supporting both the CV-22 and the Marine Corps MV-22.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project funds the definition, design, development, prototyping, integration, and testing of Mission Training and Preparation Systems (MTPS) to support training, avoid obsolescence, and maintain simulator concurrency with weapon system configurations; support mission planning and rehearsal systems enhancements required to meet Special Operations Force (SOF)-unique mission requirements and correct deficiencies identified in previous testing; and support mission planning and rehearsal capabilities in current MTPS. The MTPS project also includes program management, systems engineering, configuration management, architecture development, risk reduction, and trade study initiatives, as well as initiatives to assure interoperability and commonality between diverse SOF training systems.

Special Operations Mission Planning and Execution (SOMPE) develops, integrates, tests, and validates software enhancements required to meet SOF-unique requirements for, and correct deficiencies to, mission planning, preview, and execution software tools to support all phases of SOF operations from deliberate to time-critical. The SOMPE project automates time-sensitive planning activities and provides enhanced situational awareness during mission execution. SOMPE provides the interoperable environment for SOF adaptive planning to integrate global operations including, but not limited to, precision strike software, digital navigation, and unmanned aerial systems command and control. This project also provides the integration of SOMPE with multi-dimensional visualization systems, providing immersive mission rehearsal in minimal timeframes from the SOMPE mission plan. SOMPE is embedded in the USSOCOM Headquarters, Theater Special Operations Commands, Joint Special Operations Task Forces, Joint Special Operations Aviation Components, SOF warfighters, and SOF warfighter platforms.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The AC/MC-130J project funds core Special Operations Forces (SOF)-unique modifications to replace aging/retired MC-130E Combat Talon I, MC-130P Combat Shadow, MC-130H Combat Talon II, AC-130H Spectre, AC-130W Stinger II, and AC-130U Spooky airframes. The 8 AC-130H Spectre, 12 AC-130W Stinger II and 17 AC-130U Spooky airframes will be replaced with MC-130J aircraft modified with the Precision Strike Package (PSP) to achieve the AC-130J Gunship configuration. These platforms perform close air support (CAS), air interdiction, and armed reconnaissance missions and clandestine or low visibility, single- or multi-ship low-level missions intruding politically-sensitive or hostile territories; provide air refueling for special operations helicopters and CV-22 aircraft; and airdrop leaflets, small special operations teams, resupply bundles and combat rubber raiding craft.  Additional capabilities include low-level navigation and in-flight refueling.  The Air Force will procure and field basic aircraft, common support equipment, and trainers for USSOCOM. USSOCOM will then employ an incremental upgrade approach to incorporate SOF capabilities onto the Air Force-provided aircraft.

Conducts development, integration, and testing of aircraft enhancements to meet SOF-unique mission requirements. Enhancements include, but are not limited to, SOF communications, mission processors, aircraft performance enhancements, enhanced situational awareness (ESA), electronic warfare and survivability systems, and other SOF mission kits. Provides PSP aircraft infrastructure development.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project develops/upgrades Special Operation Forces (SOF) rotary wing aircraft systems that operate in increasingly hostile environments.  This project includes modifications to Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) and weapons systems to counter rapidly merging threats, improved lethality and enhanced aircraft self-protection. Rotary wing aircraft supported by this project include: A/MH-6M, MH-60M, and MH-47G.  These aircraft provide aviation support to SOF in world-wide contingency operations and low-intensity conflicts and they must be capable of rapid deployment, undetected penetration of hostile areas, and operating at extended ranges under adverse weather conditions to infiltrate, provide logistics for, reinforce, and extract SOF.  The threat is characterized by an extensive and sophisticated ground based air defense system and an upgraded air-to-air capability targeted against helicopters.  Sub-projects include:  

•  A/MH-6M Block 3.0 Upgrade is necessary to restore structural, performance, and safety margins for the aircrews.  An airframe structural modification and/or airframe replacement will address recurring structural failures due to high intensity, high gross weight operations, and a decade of battle damage.  A main/tail rotor drive train and engine control improvement efforts will reduce airframe loads and restore sufficient safety and performance margins.  An avionics upgrade Non-Developmental Item/Commercial Off-the-Shelf (NDI/COTS) will replace obsolescent components and provide improved battlefield situational awareness to the aircrews and customers necessary to support time sensitive mission requirements.  This upgrade is critical in keeping the A/MH-6M aircraft operational through FY 2020 and beyond or until a suitable replacement aircraft is available.  The non-recurring effort supports development, fabrication of test hardware, qualification of components and systems, and data items to support issuance of Government airworthiness releases for structural and software modifications. This sub-project includes modifications to ASE and weapons systems to counter rapidly merging threats, munitions for testing and enhanced aircraft self-protection. 

•  MH-60M Modification and Upgrades develops technologies to improve safety of the MH-60 and decrease operational costs. Efforts include, but are not limited to DOD MH-60 engineering changes, product improvements to SOF unique equipment and munitions during testing. This sub-project also includes modifications to ASE and weapons systems to counter rapidly emerging threats, improve lethality and enhance aircraft protection.  The FY 2017 funding request was reduced by $2.000 million to account for the prior year execution balances.

•  MH-60M Block Upgrades provides the development, integration, and qualification efforts on the MH-60 helicopter to include flight test support, engineering analysis, documentation, and airworthiness substantiation. 

•  Degraded Visual Environment (DVE) solution will fuse information from currently fielded aircraft sensors with emerging technology to display real-time reference points, obstacles, and landing zone information to the aviator.  The DVE solution will provide MH-47/60 aircrews with visual cues for obstacle avoidance and aircraft control during all phases of flight and significantly increase crew and passenger survivability in DVE such as dirt and snow.  This program addresses SOF-unique requirements for rapid fielding and weight limitations, capitalizes on the unique skills of the SOF aviator while integrating with SOF-unique avionics, and leverages to the maximum extent possible, the use of existing sensors on SOF aircraft.  

•  Future Vertical Lift (FVL) program provides for the long-term replacement of an aging fleet of aircraft and provides a significant increase in range, speed, payload, survivability, reliability, and maintainability of vertical lift aircraft to meet emerging mission requirements.  USSOCOM will participate in the service-common development of a joint future vertical lift aircraft by injecting USSOCOM requirements and equities into the initial development and design efforts to minimize SOF-peculiar modifications to the common aircraft.

•  Infrared Countermeasure (IRCM) program provides a low Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) capability suitable for the A/MH-6 Mission Enhanced Little Bird with potential use on the MH-60 and MH-47 aircraft. The IRCM program will develop, integrate, qualify, and test a complete lightweight IRCM system to include a missile warning system, countermeasure capability and infrared suppressor. The A/MH-6 is the only tactical aircraft in the SOF inventory without protection from infrared guided and other advanced Man Portable Air Defense missiles.

•  MH-47G Modifications and Upgrades program develops technologies to improve performance and safety of the MH-47G and decrease operational costs.  Efforts include, but not limited to the Active Parallel Actuator System (APAS), Active Noise Cancellation (ANC), and Engine Barrier Filter. This sub-project also includes modifications to ASE and weapons systems to counter rapid emerging threats and enhance aircraft self-protection.  The FY 2017 funding request was reduced by $5.000 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.

•  Mission Processor Upgrade (MPU) program provides for non-recurring engineering (NRE), systems engineering/testing, and future aircraft architecture studies that support the replacement and upgrade of the current mission and video processors for all Army Special Operations Aviation (ARSOA).  Upgrading all internal processors increases the processing power to support critical functionality and emerging technologies that will be integrated into the Common Avionics Architecture System (CAAS).  This MPU provides the processing and memory resources required to incorporate the following functions into the General Purpose Processing Unit (GPPU): (1) Global Air Traffic Management replaces ground-based navigation aids with a capability that meets the international requirement that all aircraft be compliant with digital and space-based navigation systems; (2) Situational Awareness for Safe Aircraft Recovery provides passive survivability for flight operations in all weather conditions by providing three-dimensional displays with flight path guidance to increase battle space awareness in zero-visibility conditions; (3) Cognitive Decision Aiding System fuses information on threat, route, weather, terrain, and friendly forces instantaneously adjusting an aircraft’s route to protect the flight crew in hazardous weather, low levels, and night conditions.  The FY 2017 funding request was reduced by $3.000 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.

•  Next Generation Forward Looking Infrared (NGFLIR) program improves targeting, tracking, and aircrew situational awareness on ARSOA platforms. This program mitigates obsolescence and increasing functionality on the light and heavy assault platforms within the ARSOA fleet.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>•  A/MH-6M Block 3.0 Upgrade comprises three major efforts:  airframe/rotors, engine control, and cockpit.  The airframe/rotors development effort will be a sole-source contract to Boeing, who owns the technical data associated with the A/MH-6 airframe.  The engine control work will be performed by Rolls-Royce and Triumph Electronic Control Systems under sole-source contract to Rolls Royce.  The cockpit avionics architecture will be developed by Rockwell-Collins.  Any new hardware components will be NDI/COTS and will be competitively selected.  Airframe modification and integration work will be conducted at the Special Operations Forces Support Activity (SOFSA) by the incumbent contractor.

•  MH-60M SOF Modifications and Upgrades supports the systems integration and qualification efforts on the prototype MH-60M helicopter.  This includes, but is not limited to, government and contractor flight test support, engineering analysis, documentation, and airworthiness substantiation.  Airframe modification and integration work will be conducted at the Special Operations Forces Support Activity (SOFSA) by the incumbent contractor.

•  MH-60M Block Upgrades are accomplished for 72 MH-60M base aircraft with various contractors and acquisition vehicles.  The SOFSA executes SOF-peculiar upgrade modifications onto the MH-60M base aircraft. 

•  DVE integrates and qualifies a solution to address a safety of flight issue while flying in degraded visual environments.  A competitive source selection process will be conducted for the DVE solution which will procure, integrate, and install components to provide real-time “see through” imagery and heads up display of visual cues for obstacle avoidance and landing zone information during all phases of flight.  

•  FVL is the SOF aviation participation in the Joint FVL effort to develop the next generation of vertical takeoff and landing aircraft and establishes the foundation for the transformation of the DOD vertical lift aviation capabilities over the next forty years.   

•  IRCM develops, integrates, and qualifies a mission configurable Missile Warning System and IRCM capability which does not currently exist at a weight suitable for the A/MH-6 aircraft.  Procurement of systems for integration and test will leverage Naval Research Lab IRCM development efforts and contracts.  The Government will integrate the systems onto the A/MH-6 utilizing existing aircraft modification contracts.   

•  MH-47 Modifications and Upgrades will develop technologies to improve performance and safety of the MH-47G and decrease operational costs.  Efforts include the APAS, ANC and Engine Barrier Filter.  The upgrades and modifications mostly consist of Government executed integration, testing, and qualification efforts with some analytical engineering services to be completed.

•  MPU - Data Concentrator Unit (DCU) Modernization NRE will be used to improve analog-to-digital signal processing and reliability, as well as reduce weight.  The DCU efforts will be sole-source to Sanmina SCI Corporation, the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) for the DCU.  The Future Aircraft Architecture Studies will be competitively awarded.

•  NGFLIR utilizes the Common Sensor Payload, an existing Army program of record, as a life-cycle replacement for the Q2V2 EOSS.  This effort mainly consists of upgrading the camera from Standard Definition to High Definition utilizing existing Army contracts with the OEM.  SOF unique integration on the MH-60M DAP platforms will be accomplished through existing aircraft modification contracts.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element is part of the Military Intelligence Program (MIP) that provides for the identification, development, and testing of Special Operations Forces (SOF) intelligence equipment to identify and eliminate deficiencies in providing timely intelligence to deployed forces. Sub-projects address the primary areas of intelligence dissemination, sensor systems, tagging, tracking, and locating devices, integrated threat warning to SOF mission platforms, and tactical exploitation of national system capabilities.  USSOCOM has developed an overall strategy to ensure that Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) systems continue to provide SOF with the required capabilities into the 21st century.  USSOCOM's C4I systems comprise an integrated network of systems providing positive command and control and timely exchange of intelligence and threat warning to all organizational echelons.  The C4I systems that support this new architecture employ the latest standards and technology by transitioning from separate systems to full integration with the Global Information Grid (GIG).  The GIG allows SOF elements to operate with any force combination in multiple environments.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This sub-project is part of the Military Intelligence Program (MIP).  Provides for the identification, development, and testing of Special Operations Forces (SOF) intelligence equipment to identify and eliminate deficiencies in providing timely intelligence to deployed forces.  Sub-projects address the primary areas of intelligence dissemination, sensor systems, tagging, tracking, and locating devices, integrated threat warning to SOF mission platforms, and tactical exploitation of national system capabilities.  The systems developed  and tested in this line item are National Systems Support to SOF (NSSS);  Joint Threat Warning System (JTWS);  Hostile Forces - Tagging, Tracking, and Locating (HF-TTL);  Special Operations Tactical Video System/Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and Target Acquisition (TVS/RSTA);  Special Operations Forces Planning, Rehearsal and Execution Preparation (SOFPREP);  Integrated Survey Program (ISP);  and Sensitive Site Exploitation (SSE).

U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) has developed an overall strategy to ensure that Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) systems continue to provide SOF with the required capabilities throughout the 21st century.  USSOCOM's C4I systems comprise an integrated network of systems providing positive command and control and timely exchange of intelligence and threat warning to all organizational echelons.  The C4I systems that support this new architecture employ the latest standards and technology by transitioning from separate systems to full integration with the Global Information Grid (GIG).  The GIG allows SOF elements to operate with any force combination in multiple environments.  The intelligence programs funded in this project will meet annual emergent requirements and are grouped by the level of organizational element they support: Operational Element (Team) and Above Operational Element (Garrison).    

OPERATIONAL ELEMENT (TEAM)    

•   NSSS.  This program provides a research and development rapid prototyping program that functions as HQ SOCOM's Tactical Exploitation of National Capabilities (TENCAP) program.  NSSS improves the combat effectiveness of USSOCOM, its components, and the Theater Special Operations Commands by leveraging National Government Agency (NGA) and Service development efforts to provide innovative space-based intelligence systems technologies and enhancements, products and special communications capabilities to tactical SOF units to include Geospatial Intelligence, Signals Intelligence, Special Communications, and intelligence fusion, reporting, and dissemination.  NSSS efforts are characterized by rapid development, fielding and deployment, and focus on transitioning to SOCOM Programs of Records. These developmental efforts usually support SOCOM’s existing Military Intelligence Programs.  Focus items include:  Small Unmanned Aerial System Multi-Intelligence geo-location and targeting capabilities with a Rapid Reliable Targeting system that supports National Geospatial Agency (NGA) CAT1 level targeting, enhanced Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) processing capabilities by fusing Light Detection and Ranging with National Technical Means (NTM) and the Enhanced Image Rendering Tool, which allows sharing of NTM Imagery with coalition forces.  NSSS will also improve Signal Intelligence (SIGINT) capabilities by pursuing Joint Capabilities Integration and Development 4.x and follow-on compliant SIGINT capabilities, extending SOCOM’s cross-domain security infrastructure by adding unclassified sensors into theater net-centric geo-location architecture, improve detection of Low-Probability of Intercept and Low Probability of Detection signals, and automated radar characterizations that enhance tactical SOF capabilities to find, fix, monitor, and target assets using NTM.

•   JTWS.  JTWS is a System of Systems (SoS) and is principally a SIGINT system; however, it can be used under Electronic Warfare and/or Cyber authorities if required.  The JTWS SoS enables the SOF Cryptologic Operator (SCO) to collect, process, locate and exploit threat communications signals of interest in order to provide timely, relevant, and responsive intelligence, cross-cueing, and threat avoidance information directly to the SOF Commanders.  The JTWS SoS is assembled in four variants (level 1): Ground SIGINT Kit variant, Maritime variant, Air variant and Unmanned Aerial System variant.  Each variant is further subdivided into a functional layer (level 2): Communications Intelligence, Electronic Intelligence, and Precision Geo-location (PGL) kits and an implementation layer (level 3) designed around the SCO mission environment and SOF platform specific requirements.

•   HF-TTL.  This program utilizes a commodity procurement strategy to provide SOF warfighters with the necessary tools to find, fix, and finish terrorist networks through the emplacement of sophisticated tags and devices that feed into an integrated architecture.  HF-TTL provides Global Combatant Commanders and SOF operators with an immediate capability to tag, track, and locate people, things and activities.  The HF-TTL program provides actionable intelligence for SOF planners.  The mission sets are comprised of a mix of different classes of tags and their associated detection, interrogation, viewing, tracking, and communications systems that are fielded annually to SOF Components and Theater Special Operations Commands based upon dynamic and emergent SOF operational requirements.  

•  TVS/RSTA.  This program provides SOF with critical Special Reconnaissance (SR) equipment that directly supports the planning and execution of SOF missions.  This capability allows the SOF warfighter to meet SOF SR mission requirements to find, fix, finish, exploit, analyze, and disseminate information of adversary’s movement, construct, identification, location; and associated things and activities.  TVS/RSTA provides Global Combatant Commanders and SOF operators with an immediate capability to visually and electronically acquire people, things, and activities and provides actionable intelligence for SOF planners and Commanders.  The program Family of Systems (FoS) consists of interoperable equipment to capture and transfer near-real-time ground-based, tactical day/night/reduced visibility, imagery, video, and electronic proximity and movement sensing, all capable of dissemination through SOF organic, global C4I, and commercial communications infrastructures.

ABOVE OPERATIONAL ELEMENT (GARRISON) 

• SOFPREP.  This program serves as the intelligence focal point for production of SOF enhanced GEOINT (maps, imagery, and terrain data) and 3D scene visualization databases. SOFPREP gathers, processes, exploits, disseminates and manages classified high resolution 3D databases and GEOINT data in support of SOF training, mission rehearsal and execution preparation systems. The program builds the SOF common geospatial environment and facilitates access to  authoritative source data to enable the rapid discovery, retrieval, and reuse of GEOINT data across SOF mission planning, operations, intelligence and modeling and simulation.  SOFPREP is a NGA-certified co-producer in support of time-sensitive SOF specific requirements. 

•   ISP.  This program collects and produces current, detailed, tactical planning data to support military operations to counter threats against U.S. citizens, interests, and property located both domestic and overseas. ISP products are specifically tailored packages that provide operational information, as well as intelligence data for use by DOD and the U.S. Department of State to support operational planners for counter-terrorism operations, evacuations, and other rescue missions.

•   SSE.  This program provides the capability to exploit personnel, documents, electronic data, material, and forensic evidence on sensitive sites/objectives.  Biometrics allows collection and transmission of unique, measurable biometric signatures from personnel, including live/latent fingerprints, iris patterns, and facial features.  It also provides a means to verify against and enroll subjects into the DOD authoritative database, and to query that database to support hold or release decisions. Forensic kits enable on-objective linking of events to specific persons through chemical analysis, latent fingerprints, cell phones and computer data analysis, and deoxyribonucleic acid collection. Exploitation Analysis Centers provide theater-level forensic laboratory capabilities for more in-depth exploitation of captured evidence.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element provides for development, testing and integration of specialized equipment in the areas of automation, communication, radio, weapon, soldier protection and survival, visual augmentation, lasers and sensors, munition and military information support operations (MISO) systems.  Warrior Systems specialized equipment will permit small, highly trained forces to conduct required operations across the entire spectrum of conflict.  SOF must infiltrate by land, sea, and air to conduct unconventional warfare, direct action, or deep reconnaissance operations in denied areas against insurgent units, terrorists, or highly sophisticated threat forces.  The requirement to operate in denied areas controlled by a sophisticated threat mandates that SOF systems remain technologically superior to threat forces to ensure mission success.  The efforts within this PE improve SOF warfighting capabilities by continuing efforts to develop smaller, lighter, more efficient and more robust capabilities.  The SOF mission mandates that SOF systems remain technologically superior to any threat to provide a maximum degree of survivability while, generally, being conducted in harsh environments for unspecified periods and in locations requiring small unit autonomy.  Communications efforts will maintain a Command, Control, and Communications (C3) link between SOF Commanders and SOF Teams, and provide interoperability with all Services, various agencies of the U.S. Government, Air Traffic Control, commercial agencies and allied foreign forces.  Efforts relating to soldier protection and survival requirements will improve survivability and mobility of SOF while conducting varied missions.  Specialized visual augmentation, lasers and sensors will permit small, highly trained forces to conduct required operations across the entire spectrum of conflict.  Munition efforts include advanced engineering operational system development and qualification efforts related to SOF-peculiar munitions and equipment.  Additionally, MISO efforts include planned operations to convey selected information and indicators to foreign audiences to influence their emotions, motives, objective reasoning, and ultimately, the behavior of foreign governments, organizations, groups and individuals.  

MISO:
This project provides for the development, test and integration of MISO equipment.  MISO are planned operations to convey selected information and indicators to foreign audiences to influence their emotions, motives, objective reasoning, and ultimately, the behavior of foreign governments, organizations, groups, and individuals.  This project funds transformational systems and equipment to conduct the seven phase MISO process (planning, targeting audience analysis, series development, product development and design, approval, production/distribution/dissemination, and measures of effectiveness) in support of combatant commanders.

Weapons Systems:
This project provides for next generation system development and pre-planned product improvements (P3I), testing, and integration of specialized weapon systems and weapon accessories to meet the unique requirements of SOF. Efforts include muzzle brakes and suppressors, and P3I for assault, sniper, and crew served weapons leveraging the latest technological advances to achieve overmatch capability against emerging threats.

Soldier Protection and Survival Systems:
This project provides for development, testing, and integration of specialized equipment to meet the unique soldier protection and survival requirements of SOF.  Specialized equipment will improve survivability and mobility of SOF while conducting varied missions.  Current efforts include, but are not limited to counter-improvised explosive device system development and testing to meet continually emerging Counter RC-IED threats. 

Body Armor and Associated Equipment:
This project provides specialized equipment with ballistic protection to meet the unique soldier protection and survival requirements of SOF.  Specialized ballistic equipment improves survivability and load bearing equipment impacting the mobility of SOF while conducting varied missions.  This project enhances the SOF Personal Equipment Advanced Requirements program by providing for the research, development, and testing of body armor plates, soft armor, helmets, eye protection, and other personal protective equipment to meet current ballistic threats that exist on the battlefield.

Visual Augmentation, Lasers and Sensor Systems:
This project provides for development, testing, and integration of specialized visual augmentation, laser and sensor systems equipment to meet the unique requirements of SOF.  Programs in this area include binocular/monocular devices and visual augmentation to include next generation laser designation and geo-location systems.

Communications Equipment and Electronics Systems:
This project provides for communication systems to meet emergent requirements to support SOF.  SOF units require communications equipment that improves their warfighting capability without degrading their mobility.  Therefore, SOF Communications Equipment and Electronics is a continuing effort to develop smaller, lighter, more efficient and more robust SOF Command, Control, Communications, and Computer (C4) capabilities.

Tactical Systems Development:
This project provides for development, testing, and integration of specialized automation equipment to meet the unique requirements of SOF. Tactical systems provide forward deployed forces with advanced networking, automated data processing, storage, and display capabilities to support situational awareness, mission planning and execution, and command and control (C2) of forces. 

Tactical Radio Systems:
This project is for development of all SOF tactical radio programs.  SOF units require radio communication equipment that improves their warfighting capability without degrading their mobility.  United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) has developed an overall strategy to ensure that Tactical Radio Systems continue to provide SOF with the required capabilities throughout the 21st century.  SOF Tactical Radios provide the critical C3 link between SOF Commanders and SOF Teams involved in operational missions and training exercises.  They also provide interoperability with all Services, various agencies of the U.S. Government, Air Traffic Control, commercial agencies, and allied/coalition forces.  Tactical Radios rapidly and seamlessly establish and maintain mobile and fixed (C2) communications between infiltrated/operational elements and higher echelon headquarters, allowing SOF to operate with any force combination in multiple environments.

Munitions Development:
This project provides for the advanced engineering, operational system development, and qualification efforts related to SOF-peculiar and Foreign/Non-standard munitions and equipment.  Funding supports development of Insensitive Munitions (IM) technology and evaluation, in accordance with statutory requirement set forth in U.S. Code, Title 10, Chapter 141, Section 2389 (December 2001).  Testing is in accordance with the USSOCOM IM Strategic Plan.  Funding also supports efforts to develop and improve Stand-Off Precision Guided Munitions (SOPGM), including the development and integration of improved warheads, seeker, guidance navigation and control systems, operational flight software and missile delivery to meet SOF requirements.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides for the development and acquisition of Military Information Support Operations (MISO) equipment. MISO are planned operations to convey selected information and indicators to foreign audiences to influence their emotions, motives, objective reasoning, and ultimately, the behavior of foreign governments, organizations, groups, and individuals. This project funds transformational systems and equipment to conduct MISO in support of combatant commanders. 

• Prior to FY 2015, the MISO Broadcast Systems (MISOB) consisted of the Media Production Center (MPC) Family of Systems (FoS); Product Distribution System (PDS); Fly Away Broadcast System (FABS); and the Long Range Broadcast System (LRBS). Starting in FY 2015 the MISO Broadcast System will be split into these individual programs of records.  These systems provide fixed or deployable technologies that fulfill the requirements of the MISO seven phase processes in support to theater commanders. This project is comprised of several interfacing systems that can stand alone or inter-operate with other MISO systems as determined by mission requirements and includes:

• Media Production and Broadcast Systems support the MPC and FABS MISO missions.  The MPC includes the fixed site MPC with light and medium media production capability.  FABS is a transit case fly-away broadcast system that consists of a combination of amplitude modulation (AM), frequency modulation (FM), shortwave (SW), cellular, and television (TV) transmitters.  

• LRBS is a family of broadcast systems intended to be integrated to multiple manned and unmanned, long-loiter aerial systems with the capability of broadcasting in AM, FM, SW, TV, Very High Frequency (VHF), TV Ultra High Frequency (UHF) and cellular (Short Message Service, Multi-Media Messaging Service, and Voice).  This system provides the capability of broadcasting MISO messages via multiple mediums into permissive, semi-permissive, and denied foreign areas.

• PDS provides the satellite communications (SATCOM) transport path for the worldwide Military Information Support Operations (MISO) architecture. PDS consists of three variants that are used at different levels of command from the Media Operations Complex (MOC) to the Tactical MISO Teams in order to link MISO planners with review/approval authorities, production facilities, and dissemination elements.

• FABS (previously reported in Media Production and Broadcast Systems) is a transit case fly-away broadcast system that consists of a combination of AM, FM, SW, cellular, and TV transmitters.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides specialized equipment to meet the unique operator protection and survival requirements of Special Operations Forces (SOF) to include: Army Rangers; Army Special Forces; Navy Sea, Air, Land (SEAL) teams; Navy Special Boat Units; Air Force Operators; and Marine Raiders.  Specialized equipment improves survivability protection from the environment by providing the operator with hearing protection and clothing systems, as well load bearing equipment to improve the mobility of SOF while conducting varied missions and personnel safety equipment such as harnesses and safety retention devices.  These missions are generally conducted in harsh environments, for unspecified periods and in locations requiring small unit autonomy. 

SOF Personal Equipment Advanced Requirements (SPEAR) provides for the research, development, testing and evaluation of a variety of individual and survival equipment to include: ballistic and environmental protective systems, combat uniforms, load carriage systems, communications headsets, and visual augmentation system mounts.  

Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC) provides medical devices, ancillary equipment and Casualty Evacuation (CASEVAC) sets for SOF. The CASEVAC procures a suite of Food and Drug Administration approved medical items including, but not limited, to intraosseous infusion devices, patient monitoring and assessment devices, emergency airway kits, as well as devices that provide SOF the capability to support extraction, extrication, mobility, transportation, and sustainment of casualties in forward areas.  This program fields tactical medical and CASEVAC capabilities with the intention to transition capabilities developed under the National Mission Force Tactical Medical Programs.  This capability provides significant ability to lessen battlefield losses by providing timely, critical lifesaving and evacuation capabilities to the forward-deployed SOF operators. 

Counter Radio Controlled-Improvised Explosive Device (RC-IED) program provides SOF with the ability to counter current and future RC-IED threats used by terrorist networks.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Specialized ballistic equipment improves survivability impacting the mobility of SOF while conducting varied missions. These missions are generally conducted in harsh environments, for unspecified periods and in locations requiring small unit autonomy. 

This project enhances the SOF Personal Equipment Advanced Requirement (SPEAR) program by supporting body armor plates, soft armor, helmets, and eye protection.  It also provides for the research, development, and testing of a variety of body armor and personal protective equipment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Sensor technology being developed includes image intensification (I2) thermal imaging, short wave infrared (SWIR), multi-spectral, fusion, and other sensor types.  Developments will decrease weight, increase range, increase situational awareness, provide data, image processing, image filtering, determine wind speed, observe bullet trace, and sensor fusion to be able to detect, identify, classify and engage targets at greater ranges.  These projects ensure SOF systems shall remain technologically superior to enemy threats to ensure mission success.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides for communication systems to meet emergent requirements to support Special Operations Forces (SOF). Communications Equipment and Electronics Systems is a continuing effort to develop smaller, lighter, more efficient and more robust SOF Command, Control, Communications, and Computer (C4) capabilities.   

USSOCOM's C4 systems comprise an integrated network of systems providing positive command and control and the timely exchange of information to all organizational echelons.  The C4I systems that support this new architecture employ the latest standards and technology by transitioning from separate systems to full integration within the Global Information Grid (GIG). The GIG is a multitude of existing and projected national assets that allows SOF elements to operate with any force combination in multiple environments. 

•  SOF Deployable Node (SDN) is a family of deployable, super high frequency, multi-band, Satellite Communications (SATCOM) systems providing the transport path for high-capacity, voice, data, video tele-conferencing (VTC), and full motion video at all levels of classification.  It consists of SDN subprograms, transport for intelligence variants, technology insertions and capital equipment replacement.

•  Civil Information Management (CIM).  The CIM Data Processing System (CIMDPS) is an automation system that assists active Civil Affairs and others engaged in civil-military operations to collect, process, analyze, maintain, mine, and deliver Civil Information and analysis products in support of military operations.  

•  The Special Communications (SPCOM) Enterprise program, formerly justified as the Special Communication Enterprise (SCE) includes organizations, practices, processes, services, networks, systems and subsystems that manage and provide clandestine exchange of information between elements (field-to-field, field-to-base, base-to-field) for worldwide deployed SOF units, often in austere environments with heavy adversarial monitoring.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides for development, testing, and integration of specialized automation equipment to meet the unique requirements of Special Operations Forces (SOF). Specialized automation equipment will permit small, highly trained forces to conduct required operations across the entire spectrum of conflict. These operations are generally conducted in harsh environments, for unspecified periods and in locations requiring small unit autonomy. SOF must infiltrate by land, sea, and air to conduct unconventional warfare, direct action, or deep reconnaissance operations in denied areas against insurgent units, terrorists, or highly sophisticated threat forces. The requirement to operate in denied areas controlled by a sophisticated threat mandates that SOF systems remain technologically superior to threat forces to ensure mission success.

- The Tactical Local Area Network (TACLAN) provides SOF operational commanders and forward deployed forces advanced networking, automated data processing, storage, and display capabilities to support situational awareness, mission planning and execution, and command and control of forces. The TACLN consists of Suites, Mission Planning Kits and Field Computing Devices, Coalition Local Area Network, and Full Motion Video Kits.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Tactical Radios provide the critical Command, Control, Communications (C3) link between SOF Commanders and SOF Teams involved in operational missions and training exercises.  They also provide interoperability with all Services, various agencies of the U.S. Government, Air Traffic Control, commercial agencies, and allied foreign forces.  Tactical Radios, which includes SOF Tactical Communications, and Blue Force Tracking (BFT), rapidly and seamlessly establish and maintain mobile and fixed Command and Control (C2) communications between infiltrated/operational elements and higher echelon headquarters, allowing SOF to operate with any force combination in multiple environments.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>NOTE:  Beginning in FY 2017 Unmanned ISR represents the approved consolidation of Special Applications for Contingencies Program Element (PE) 0304210BB; MQ-1 Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), PE 0305219BB; MQ-8 PE 0305231BB; RQ-11 UAV PE 1105232BB; and RQ-7 UAV, PE 1105233BB.

This program element is part of the Military Intelligence Program (MIP).  Develops and deploys special capabilities to perform Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) for deployed Special Operations Forces (SOF) using non-traditional means.  USSOCOM has been designated as the DOD lead for planning, synchronizing, and as directed, executing global operations against terrorist networks and targets. USSOCOM requires the capability to find, fix, and finish time-sensitive high-value fixed and fleeting targets at the unit and team level without placing personnel and units in harm’s way. These targets can often only be identified with patient collection of information and require rapid, decisive action during the short periods in which they present themselves. This PE addresses the primary areas of Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, and Targeting (ISR&amp;T) capabilities for SOF.

Group 1, 2, 3 and 4, Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) developmental efforts are to identify, develop, integrate, and test SOF-unique mission kits, mission payloads, air vehicle enhancements, and modifications on the related ground control stations. SAFC develops and integrates UAS payloads to advance ISR capabilities to address dynamic and emergent operational needs of the SOF user.  Efforts include improving imagery/signals intelligence and electronic warfare payloads, capitalizing on developing technologies to reduce size, weight and power while addressing processing and data management challenges. It provides a mechanism for SOF user combat evaluation of emerging sensor technologies.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project develops, tests, and evaluates Special Operations vehicles and modifications.  The Special Operations Forces (SOF) mission mandates that SOF vehicles remain technologically superior, operate in multiple environments and be able to meet any threat to provide a maximum degree of survivability.  The current family of SOF tactical vehicles include: individual mobility vehicles, light mobility vehicles, medium mobility vehicles, non-standard commercial vehicles, and heavy mobility vehicles.     

Family of Special Operations Vehicles (FSOV).  This initiative provides for product improvements in the areas of suspension, power management, armor protection and unique vehicle design for all SOF tactical vehicle configurations.  Designs must be standardized across all SOF Components that utilize a tactical vehicle.   Improvements include, but are not limited to, new engineering change proposals (ECPs), field safety issues and theater endorsed requirements that make it essential to keep up with the increased weight and minimize the impact to mobility on the basic vehicle.  FSOV develops, integrates and tests Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems in order to reduce space and power claim on vehicles and develop safety and engineering improvements that specifically address the enemy’s changing tactics on the battlefield which typically focuses on survivability, force protection, or mobility.  Specific efforts include but are not limited to: Ground Mobility Vehicle (GMV) Medium Version 1.1 effort which provides for a medium vehicle variant capable of meeting specific requirements of internal aircraft transport on the C/MH-47.  The effort also provides for engineering costs related to performance, endurance, safety testing, integration and logistical analysis of product samples.  Additionally, efforts include ECPs associated with the Non-Standard Commercial Vehicle (NSCV), the Lightweight Tactical All Terrain Vehicle (LTATV).  These ECPs will address any identified safety, reliability, and performance concerns.  Finally, funding will be used to support vehicle signature reduction efforts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides for engineering and manufacturing development of combat underwater submersibles, Special Operations Forces (SOF) operator diving systems, underwater support systems, and underwater equipment.  This project also provides for pre-acquisition activities (materiel solutions analysis, advanced component development and prototypes) to respond to emergent requirements.  These submersibles, equipment, and diving systems are used by SOF in the conduct of infiltration/extraction, personnel/material recovery, hydrographic/inland reconnaissance, beach obstacle clearance, underwater ship attack, and other missions.  The capabilities of the submersible systems, diving systems, and unique equipment provides small, highly trained forces the ability to successfully engage the enemy and conduct clandestine operations associated with SOF maritime missions.  Sub-projects include:

•   Shallow Water Combat Submersible (SWCS):  This sub-project provides for the engineering, manufacturing, testing, and development of one Engineering Developmental Model (EDM) to replace the SEAL Delivery Vehicle (SDV) system.  The EDM is being developed due to obsolescence of the SDV system.  This project will utilize mature technologies, which include electric propulsion along with upgraded navigation, communication, and sensor suites.  It also provides for integration efforts with the current Dry Deck Shelter (DDS), development of engineering changes for SWCS production craft configuration, and integration of other diving technologies to meet SOF requirements.  

• Dry Combat Submersible (DCS): This sub-project provides for the advanced engineering, manufacturing, testing, and development efforts for a surface-launched, dry, diver lock-in/lock-out vessel capable of inserting and extracting SOF and/or payloads into denied areas.  USSOCOM will award an Engineering and Manufacturing Development contract in FY 2016 to produce one production representative vessel, with options to produce two additional vessels following testing.  Current efforts leverage commercial practices to develop dry submersible prototypes to assess submersible capabilities and reduce risk in the DCS program.  USSOCOM developed and is currently testing two submersible prototypes.  USSOCOM has also conducted risk reduction efforts on a third leased vehicle to include validation of test processes, commercial classification processes, and development of the SOCOM safety certification process which permits SEALs to operate the vehicles.  In addition, the prototypes are being and will continue to be used to evaluate capability enhancing technologies in a relevant environment.  Technologies include, but are not limited to, safe Li-Ion batteries, silver zinc batteries, improved sonar systems, an advanced battery management system, and a three-dimensional Electro Optical Infrared (EO/IR) sensor.

•   DDS Modernization:  This sub-project provides for the pre-planned product improvements, testing, and integration of specialized underwater systems to meet the unique requirements of SOF, and compatibility with the submarine fleet.  The current DDS is a certified diving system which attaches to modified host submarines that provides for insertion of SOF forces and platforms.  Funding supports product improvements to the current DDS, as well as associated diver equipment for in-service submarine support systems, unmanned underwater vehicles, and follow on development efforts for future SOF payloads.

•   SOF Combat Diving:  This sub-project provides for the engineering, manufacturing, testing, development, and transition of SOF peculiar diving equipment providing the SOF combat diver the ability to engage the enemy and conduct operations.  SOF Combat Diving will provide capabilities to USSOCOM components and will support the SDV, SWCS, and DCS in conduct of infiltration/extraction, material recovery, underwater ship attack, beach clearance, and other missions.  Technologies include, but are not limited to, commercial and developmental life support, maneuverability, employment of weapons, diver navigational accuracy and situational awareness, thermal protection, and underwater communications.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The full spectrum of contracting activities is being utilized for any integration and subsystem requirements, using existing contracts where appropriate, government agencies and new contracts as necessary.

•   DCS performed risk reduction efforts on a leased vessel (S301i) to define future DCS program plans and procedures as well as used Broad Area Announcements for Research and Development contracts to design, build, and test prototypes (Button 5.60 and S351) to refine and validate key performance parameters and attributes for the future DCS, leveraging commercial technologies, practices, and safety classification standards.  USSOCOM will solicit and award a competitive engineering and manufacturing development contract for a production representative system in FY16 and award two options for procurement vessels in FY18 and FY19.

•   DDS Modernization will use existing DDS contracts to develop modernization efforts and execute configuration changes required to achieve performance requirements specified by the government.

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides for engineering and manufacturing development of medium and heavy surface combatant craft, combatant craft mission equipment, and pre-planned product improvement and technology insertion engineering changes to meet the unique requirements of Special Operations Forces (SOF).  This project also provides for pre-acquisition activities (materiel solutions analysis, advanced component development and prototypes) to quickly respond to new requirements for maritime craft and subsystems.  The craft capabilities and unique equipment provide small, highly trained forces the ability to successfully engage the enemy and conduct operations associated with SOF maritime missions.  Sub-projects include:

•   Combatant Craft Medium Mk 1 (CCM):  This sub-project is a semi-enclosed, low-observable, multi-mission combatant craft for platoon-size maritime mobility in maritime denied environments.  It is multi-mission capable, including Maritime Interdiction, Insert / Extract, and Visit, Board, Search, and Seizure (VBSS) Operations.  CCM is Naval Special Warfare’s (NSW) craft-of-choice for long-range, high-payload SOF mobility operations in denied environments up to high threat.  CCM has NSW’s best Iron Triangle: 40 knot (kt) speed; 4 crew + 19 passengers (pax) / 10,000 pound (lb) payload; and 600 nautical miles (nm) range.  CCM Mk 1 payload capacity enables inclusion of shock mitigating seats, which is critical for ride quality, operator tactical readiness, and operator health.  At 60 feet long CCM is C-17 / C5 transportable and can launch/recover by well deck or shore based trailer.  

•   Combatant Craft Heavy (CCH):  This sub-project represents a family of solutions that provides platoon-size maritime surface mobility.  The current CCH is the Sea, Air, Land Insertion, Observation, and Neutralization (SEALION) craft.  SEALION is a fully-enclosed, climate-controlled, low-observable, semi-submersible craft that operates in denied environments up to high-threat. SEALION is NSW’s most versatile and survivable combatant craft and the craft-of-choice for sensitive maritime intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions and those missions requiring a prolonged presence in denied environments.  Its clandestine mobility capability is only exceeded by an undersea craft.  Iron Triangle: 40 kt speed; 7 crew + 12 pax / 3,300 lb payload; and 400 nm range.  SEALION payload capacity enables inclusion of shock mitigating seats, which is critical for ride quality, operator tactical readiness, and operator health.  At 77+ feet long, SEALION is C-17/C-5 transportable and can launch/recover by well deck or shore based mobile travel lift or crane.  

•   Next Generation Combatant Craft Forward Looking Infrared Radar (NG CCFLIR):  This sub-project consists of a legacy CCFLIR and the NG CCFLIR.  The CCFLIR capability provides SOF with a multi-sensor, electro-optic system that enhances SOF effectiveness by improving their ability to detect, recognize, identify, range, track, and highlight objects of interest in a maritime environment.  The legacy CCFLIR is under sustainment, it is currently used on all Naval Special Warfare Combatant Craft.  The NG CCFLIR will use technological advancements to gain significant improvements in capability such as operational range, image fusion, net-centric data sharing, information assurance, and seamless craft and combat systems integration.

•   Combatant Craft Mission Equipment (CCME) (previously Next Generation Surface Systems):  This sub-project provides a rapid response capability to support SOF Combatant Craft Systems and subsystems.  The CCME will explore and provide solutions to support emerging requirements in support of SOF missions.  It provides technology refresh efforts to correct system deficiencies, improve asset life, and enhance mission capability through the means of feasibility studies, analyses of alternatives, pre-developmental risk reduction, and engineering analyses.  Demonstrations and modifications may be made to support emerging capability enhancements such as but not limited to conformal antennas, identification Friend-or-Foe capabilities, enhanced communications, weapon integration, software efresh, and navigation subsystems in support of future missions.  Solutions may be Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) solutions, leveraged from other agency solutions, or new solutions. 

•   Combatant Craft Assault (CCA) (previously High Speed Assault Craft):  This sub-project is a National-to-Theater transition.  The CCA is the theater version of the High Speed Assault Craft.  The CCA is a low-observable combatant craft for squad-size maritime mobility operations in maritime denied environments.  CCA is NSW’s best craft for VBSS in maritime denied environments up to and including medium threat.  It is the craft-of-choice for maritime interdiction and boarding operations because of the open deck space, maneuverability, and interoperability with an Afloat Forward Staging Base.  Iron Triangle: 40 kt speed; 3 crew + 12 pax / 5,000 lb payload; and 300 nm range.  At 41 feet long, CCA is air transportable by C-130 / C-17 / C-5 and can launch/recover by crane, davit, well deck, or shore based trailer.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>•  CCM acquisition strategy was a competition using a two-phase source selection process.  Phase I involved a Small Business Set-Aside competition for two vendors to design, build and deliver test articles.  Phase II selected a single vendor to provide a fully integrated baseline craft system for test and evaluation with options for production, engineering support and contractor logistic support.  

•  CCH:  SEALION I &amp; II were transitioned from United States Navy advanced technology demonstrator craft to USSOCOM.  Sustainment for SEALION I &amp; II is conducted via Special Operations Forces Support Activity (SOFSA).  Based on market research completed in December 2015; currently pursuing a Sole Source award for SEALION III in order to take advantage of previous Government investments in manufacturing infrastructure for SEALION I &amp; II.

•  NG CCFLIR:  Current fleet of legacy CCFLIR was procured via full and open competition.  Procurement for legacy CCFLIR is complete.  Legacy CCFLIR will continue to be utilized on the Rigid-hull Inflatable Boat (RIB) and Special Operations Craft Riverine (SOCR).  The Combatant Craft Medium (CCM), Combatant Craft Heavy (CCH), and High Speed Assault Craft (HSAC) will transition from legacy CCFLIR to NG CCFLIR. NG CCFLIR completed a full and open competition in Sep 15.  An Engineering Manufacturing Development contract was awarded to FLIR Systems Incorporated, which included production and sustainment options.

•  CCME acquisition strategy plans include the full spectrum of contracting activities, using existing contracts where appropriate, and other Government agencies to leverage, marinize, commonize, and advance Technology Readiness Level 6 leap ahead technology from Services and USSOCOM SOF AT&amp;L S&amp;T.  Procurement of items will be from the Combatant Craft Systems procurement program element.   

•  CCA originated as National-to-Theater transition.  The CCA is the theater version of the High Speed Assault Craft and will use various contracting and better buying power practices to develop, test, and integrate capability enhancements required to increase the craft’s current performance envelope.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
