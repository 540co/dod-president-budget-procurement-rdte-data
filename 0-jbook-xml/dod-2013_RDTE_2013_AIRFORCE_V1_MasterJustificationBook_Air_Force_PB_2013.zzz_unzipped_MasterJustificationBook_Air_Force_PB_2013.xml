Also in FY 2012, External Research Programs - Project 4113 was renamed Education and Outreach- Project 3004 to more appropriately describe its mission.  </r2:ProgramElementNote>
                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program consists of extramural research activities in academia and industry along with in-house investigations performed in the Air Force Research Laboratory. This program funds fundamental broad-based scientific and engineering research in areas critical to Air Force weapon systems.  All research areas are subject to long-range planning and technical review by both Air Force and tri-Service scientific planning groups. Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Reliance 21 process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication. This program is in Budget Activity 1, Basic Research, because it funds scientific study and experimentation.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Materials basic research enhances the performance, cost, and reliability of structural materials to eliminate reliability issues related to high-temperature strength, toughness, fatigue, and environmental conditions. This research expands fundamental knowledge of material properties that leads to the development of novel materials for airframe, turbine engine, and spacecraft structures. The goals of this Project are to develop improved materials for air and space vehicles that provide increased structural efficiency and reliability, increase the operating temperature of aerospace materials, and further increase thrust-to-weight ratio of engines. A primary research focus is on refractory alloys, intermetallics, polymer composites, metal and ceramic matrix composites, advanced ceramics, and new material processing methods. Basic research is also conducted in natural materials and systems to exploit unique properties and products for use in the development of advanced weapon technologies. Research is conducted to mimic the natural detection systems of organisms at the molecular level for use in developing novel manmade sensors. Research in natural materials focuses on using existing organisms or bioengineered organisms to manufacture new materials, or using the organisms themselves as materials. The primary areas investigated by this Project are ceramics, non-metallic hybrid composites, metallic materials, and natural materials and systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Fluid mechanics basic research advances fundamental knowledge, tools, data, concepts, and methods for improving the efficiency, effectiveness, and reliability of air and space vehicles. The goals are to improve theoretical models for aerodynamic prediction and design, as well as to originate flow control concepts and predictive methods used to expand current flight performance boundaries through enhanced understanding of key fluid flow (primarily high-speed air) phenomena. Vehicle control principles based upon natural flight sensory and sensorimotor systems applicable to small remotely piloted aircraft (RPAs) and ultraslow flight are also examined. Basic research emphasis is on turbulence prediction and control, unsteady and separated flows, subsonic/supersonic/hypersonic flows, and internal fluid dynamics. The primary approach is to perform fundamental experimental investigations and to formulate advanced computational methods for the simulation and study of complex flows, prediction of real gas effects in high-speed flight, and control and prediction of turbulence in flight vehicles and propulsion systems. Primary areas of research investigated by this Project are unsteady aerodynamics, supersonic and hypersonic aerodynamics, turbulence, and rotating and internal flows characteristic of turbomachinery flows.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Propulsion basic research expounds fundamental knowledge to enable and enhance efficient utilization of energy in airbreathing engines, chemical and non-chemical rockets, and combined cycle propulsion systems for future rapid global reach and on-demand space access. Basic research thrusts include airbreathing propulsion, space power and propulsion, high altitude signature characterization and contamination, propulsion diagnostics, thermal management of space-based power and propulsion, and the synthesis of new chemical propellants. These thrusts can be grouped into reacting flows and non-chemical energetics. Study of reacting flows involves the complex coupling between energy release through chemical reaction and the flow processes that transport chemical reactants, products, and energy. Non-chemical energetics research includes both plasma and beamed-energy propulsion for orbit-raising space missions and ultra-high energy techniques for spacebased energy utilization. Primary areas of research investigated by this Project are space power, propulsion, combustion, and diagnostics. As a newly emerging research direction within this Project, bioenergy and catalysis will investigate the economical production of renewable biofuels for airbreathing engines and will explore biocatalysis for compact power applications.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Information sciences basic research generates fundamental knowledge and understanding to support critical Air Force capabilities in information superiority, precision targeting (or strike), and improved battle space awareness. Areas of research focus are (1) access to disparate data and information, (2) information fusion and distribution, and (3) conversion of information into knowledge to support decision making. The data, fusion engines, and command and control functions reside on interlocking systems connected by networks leading to a system of systems architecture. Areas of research underpinning these team-focused, network-enabled systems are those in networks and communications, software, information management, and human-system interactions. Complementing these overall focus areas, research is occurring in the following areas: information operations network, software, and system architectures; information fusion; information forensics; communications and signals and control of large systems. Information Sciences also derive mathematical models and computational algorithms designed to optimize information intelligently and problem-solving under adverse conditions, including sustained operations, non-cooperative environments, and multi-interactive command and control.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Research stresses high-risk, far-term, game-changing capability breakthroughs essential for future leaps in warfighter system performance, functionality, reliability, and survivability while simultaneously reducing component and system power, size, mass, and life cycle costs. Major thrust areas being investigated in this Project are complex electronics and fundamental quantum processes; plasma physics and high energy density non-equilibrium processes; and lasers and optics, electromagnetics, communication, and signal processing. Although the major thrust descriptions that follow are specific sub-areas of focus within this Project, there is interest in exploring novel ideas that may bridge these major thrusts as well as those in the other Projects within this PE.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Note: Decrease in FY 2013 due to higher Department of Defense priorities in Projects 3003 and 3004. The level of effort in each thrust will be reduced.</r2:ProjectNote>
                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Basic research in the Aerospace, Chemical, and Materials Sciences Project seeks to enable revolutionary advances in, and expand the fundamental knowledge supporting technologies critical to the future of the Air Force. Research stresses high-risk, far-term, game-changing capability breakthroughs essential for future leaps in warfighter system performance, functionality, reliability, and survivability while simultaneously reducing component and system power, size, mass, and life cycle costs. Major thrust areas being investigated in this Project are aero-structure interactions and control; energy, power, and propulsion; and complex materials and structures. Although the major thrust descriptions that follow are specific sub-areas of focus within this Project, there is interest in exploring novel ideas that may bridge these major thrusts as well as those in the other Projects within this PE.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The natural systems and extremophiles major thrust effort in Project 2306, the sensory information systems major thrust effort in Project 2307, and the bioenergy major thrust effort in Project 2308 of this PE also moved to this new Project.

Note: In FY 2013, increased emphasis will be placed on complex networks, software, and decision making.</r2:ProjectNote>
                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Basic research in the Mathematics, Information, and Life Sciences Project seeks to enable revolutionary advances in, and expand the fundamental knowledge supporting technologies critical to the future of the Air Force. Research stresses high-risk, far-term, game-changing capability breakthroughs essential for future leaps in warfighter system performance, functionality, reliability, and survivability while simultaneously reducing component and system power, size, mass, and life cycle costs. Major thrust areas being investigated in this Project are information and complex networks, decision making, dynamical systems, optimization and control, and natural materials and systems. Although the major thrust descriptions that follow are specific sub-areas of focus within this Project, there is interest in exploring novel ideas that may bridge these major thrusts as well as those in the other Projects within this PE.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The major thrust areas in this Science &amp; Technology (S&amp;T) Outreach Development Project are to facilitate interactions between the international and domestic research communities and Air Force researchers, and to support and develop scientists and engineers with an awareness of Air Force basic research priorities. These professional interactions and collaborations stimulate scientific and engineering education beneficial to the Air Force, increase the awareness of Air Force basic research priorities to the research community as a whole, and attract talented scientists and engineers to address Air Force needs. International interactions facilitate future interoperability of coalition systems and foster relationships with future coalition partners. This Project also seeks to enhance educational interactions with historically black colleges and universities, Hispanic serving institutions, and other minority institutions.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The primary elements in this Project are to facilitate interactions between the international and domestic research communities and Air Force researchers, and to support and develop scientists and engineers with an awareness of Air Force basic research priorities. These professional interactions and collaborations stimulate scientific and engineering education beneficial to the Air Force, increase the awareness of Air Force basic research priorities to the research community as a whole, and attract talented scientists and engineers to address Air Force needs. International interactions facilitate future interoperability of coalition systems and foster relationships with future coalition partners. This Project also seeks to enhance educational interactions with historically black colleges and universities, Hispanic serving institutions, and other minority institutions.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program supports defense-related basic research in a wide range of scientific and engineering disciplines relevant to maintaining U.S. military technology superiority. Research topics include, but are not limited to, transformational and high priority technologies such as nanotechnology, sensor networks, intelligence information fusion, smart materials and structures, efficient energy and power conversion, and high-energy materials for propulsion and control. The program also enhances and promotes the education of U.S. scientists and engineers in disciplines critical to maintaining, advancing, and enabling future U.S. defense technologies. For example, the National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate (NDSEG) program awards fellowships to train U.S citizens in science and engineering disciplines of military importance under a joint tri-Service and Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering competition. Finally, this program assists universities in establishing superior instrumentation capabilities needed to improve the quality of defense-related research and education. A fundamental component of this program is the recognition that future technologies and technology exploitations require highly coordinated and concerted multi- and inter-disciplinary efforts. Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Reliance 21 process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.  This program is in Budget Activity 1, Basic Research, because it funds basic scientific study and experimentation.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program supports defense-related basic research in a wide range of scientific and engineering disciplines relevant to maintaining U.S. military technology superiority. Research topics include, but are not limited to, transformational and high priority technologies such as nanotechnology, sensor networks, intelligence information fusion, smart materials and structures, efficient energy and power conversion, and high-energy materials for propulsion and control. The program also enhances and promotes the education of U.S. scientists and engineers in disciplines critical to maintaining, advancing, and enabling future U.S. defense technologies. For example, the National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate (NDSEG) program awards fellowships to train U.S citizens in science and engineering disciplines of military importance under a joint tri-Service and Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering competition. Finally, this program assists universities in establishing superior instrumentation capabilities needed to improve the quality of defense-related research and education. A fundamental component of this program is the recognition that future technologies and technology exploitations require highly coordinated and concerted multi- and inter-disciplinary efforts. Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Reliance 21 process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.  This program is in Budget Activity 1, Basic Research, because it funds basic scientific study and experimentation.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The HEL Joint Technology Office (JTO) sends these funds to multi-disciplinary research institutes for projects on laser and beam control technologies.  In addition, funding supports educational grants to stimulate interest in HELs.  These educational grants are used for educational tools, scholarships, and summer intern employees in military laboratories.  Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Reliance 21 process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.

The HEL Joint Technology Office (JTO) sends these funds to multi-disciplinary research institutes for projects on laser and beam control technologies.  In addition, funding supports educational grants to stimulate interest in HELs.  These educational grants are used for educational tools, scholarships, and summer intern employees in military laboratories.  Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Reliance 21 process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project develops materials and materials processing technologies to support operational Air Force mission areas by providing the ability to inspect the quality of delivered systems, transitioning more reliable and maintainable materials, establishing a capability to detect and characterize performance threatening defects, characterizing materials processes and properties necessary for materials transition, and providing quick reaction support and failure analysis to the operational commands and repair centers.  Repair techniques and nondestructive inspection/evaluation (NDI/E) methods are developed that are needed for metallic and non-metallic structures, coatings, corrosion control processes, and to support integration of composite structures for aerospace systems.  Various NDI/E methods are essential to ensure optimum quality in the design and production of aircraft, propulsion, and missile systems.  These NDI/E methods are also essential to monitor and detect the onset of any service-initiated damage and/or deterioration due to aging of operational systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program investigates, develops, and analyzes aerospace vehicle technologies in the three primary areas of structures, controls, and aeromechanics.  Advanced structures concepts are explored and developed to exploit new materials, fabrication processes, and design techniques.  Flight control technologies are developed and simulated for aerospace vehicles.  Advanced aerodynamic vehicle configurations are developed and analyzed through simulations, experiments, and multi-disciplinary analyses.  Resulting technologies improve performance of existing and future manned and remotely piloted air and space access vehicles.  Improvements include, but are not limited to, reduced energy use by efficient air platform designs, use of lightweight composite structures and improved sustainment methods based on the condition of the platform and sub-systems.  Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Reliance 21 process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.  This program is in Budget Activity 2, Applied Research, since it develops and determines the technical feasibility and military utility of evolutionary and revolutionary aerospace vehicle technologies.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program conducts applied research in the area of airmen training, airmen system interfaces, directed energy bioeffects, deployment and sustainment of airmen in extreme environments, and understanding and shaping adversarial behavior.  The Learning and Organizational Collaboration project conducts research to measure, accelerate, and expand the cognitive skills necessary to improve airmen training and mission performance.  The Human Dynamics Evaluation project conducts research to advance information operations and intelligence operator-aiding technologies by developing and applying human-focused research to create and influence behavior signatures of existing and emerging adversaries.  The Sensory Evaluation and Decision Science project conducts research to revolutionize the manner in which the human optimizes the capabilities of Air Force systems, including remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) and adaptive teams of humans and machines.  The Performance Evaluation in Extreme Environments project conducts research to enhance human sensory, cognitive, and physical capabilities to increase airmen survivability and performance.  The Directed Energy Bioeffects project conducts research on the effects of human exposure to electromagnetic energy (radio frequency to optical), scalable directed energy weapons, and non-lethal weapons.  Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Reliance 21 process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication. This program is in Budget Activity 2, Applied Research, since it develops and determines the technical feasibility and military utility of evolutionary and revolutionary technologies.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Research optimizes human situational awareness and cognitive performance, improves the human-machine interface, and seamlessly integrates warfighters with their weapon systems across air, space, and cyber domains.  Research is conducted in four focus areas: applied neuroscience; supervisory control; battlespace visualization; and battlespace acoustics.  The applied neuroscience area develops technologies to enhance human-human and human-machine collaborations and system interactions in distributed decision-making environments.  The supervisory control area develops new control/display concepts and technologies to optimize Air Force platform capabilities.  The battlespace visualization area advances the science and technology associated with collecting, optimizing, displaying, and assimilating sensory information to enhance warfighter decision-making.  The battlespace acoustics area researches human-human and human-machine communications to exploit the use of voice and acoustic data in collaborative, net-centric environments while accounting for the effects of acoustic propagation.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project conducts applied research to enhance human sensory, cognitive, and physical capabilities to increase airmen survivability and performance.  The research is focused in four areas:  biobehavioral performance; biomechanics; applied biotechnology; and counterproliferation.  Both biobehavioral and biomechanics focus areas enhance airmen performance and survivability through dynamic human modeling techniques that define the capabilities and limits of system operators under military-unique stressors, as well as assessing and identifying adversarial threats.  Applied biotechnology advances bioscience, nanotoxicology, and neuroscience research to protect airmen from the effects of toxic chemicals and materials, and to monitor and enhance cognitive and physiological performance.  Counterproliferation research focuses on biotechnology for the detection, identification, monitoring, and neutralization of biological threat agents.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project conducts applied research on the effects of human exposure to electromagnetic (EM) energy (radio frequency to optical), scalable directed energy weapons, and non-lethal weapons.  This research addresses fundamental physical principles, as well as the psychophysical interaction between directed energy and the individual or groups of individuals. Research is divided into three core focus areas:  optical radiation bioeffects; radio frequency radiation (RFR) bioeffects; and biobehavioral systems.  Optical radiation bioeffects research enhances combat survivability and systems effectiveness through technologies that enable deployed forces to counter optical threats and exploit optical systems for offensive applications.  The RFR bioeffects research focuses on theoretical and empirical dosimeterry, bioeffects of short-and long-term exposures, methods to counter RFR threats, and exploitation of directed energy systems for offensive capabilities.  Applied biotechnology advances bioscience, nanotoxicology, and neuroscience research to protect airmen from the effects of toxic chemicals and materials to monitor and enhance cognitive and physiological performance.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This project also develops technologies to increase turbine engine operational reliability, durability, mission flexibility, maintainability, and performance while reducing weight, fuel consumption, and cost of ownership. Applications include missiles, aircraft, and sustained high-speed vehicles. Analytical and experimental areas of emphasis include lubricants, bearings, mechanical systems diagnostics, mechanical systems prognostics, rotordynamics, oil-less engine technology, optical diagnostics, fundamental combustion, detonations, combustors, and afterburners. Lubricants for these engines must be thermally stable, cost-effective, and operate over a broad range of conditions. Advanced combustion concepts must be cost-effective, durable, and reduce pollutant emissions. A portion of this project supports adaptive cycle technologies. This effort develops component technology for an adaptive cycle engine architecture that provides optimized performance/fuel efficiency for widely varying mission needs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Analytical and experimental areas of emphasis are propellants, propellant management, combustion, rocket material applications, technology for sustainment of strategic systems, and innovative space propulsion concepts. Technologies of interest will improve reliability, performance, survivability, affordability, and environmental compatibility of these systems. Technologies are developed to reduce the weight and cost of components using new materials and improved designs and manufacturing techniques. All efforts in this project contribute to the sustainment of the rocket propulsion industry, providing rocket propulsion technology for the entire Department of Defense. Technologies developed under this program enable capabilities of interest to both the Department of Defense and NASA. Efforts include modeling and simulation, proof of concept tests of critical components, advanced component development, and ground-based tests. Aging and surveillance efforts could reduce lifetime prediction uncertainties for individual motors by 50 percent, enabling motor replacement for cause.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This project also considers fuel related concepts that can increase turbine engine operational reliability, durability, mission flexibility, energy efficiency, and performance while reducing weight, fuel consumption, and cost of ownership. Applications include missiles, aircraft, sustained high-speed vehicles, and responsive space launch. Analytical and experimental areas of emphasis include evaluations of fuel properties and characteristics of alternative fuels developed from unconventional sources (such as coal, natural gas, biomass, and combinations thereof), unique/alternate fuels and components used in integrated thermal and energy management systems including high heat sink fuel capability, fuels logistics and associated vulnerabilities, and combustion diagnostics and engine emissions measurements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program develops the technology base for Air Force aerospace sensors and electronic combat.  Advances in aerospace sensors are required to increase combat effectiveness by providing anytime, anywhere surveillance, reconnaissance, precision targeting, and electronic warfare capabilities.  To achieve this progress, this program pursues simultaneous advances in:  1) generating, controlling, receiving, and processing electronic and photonic signals for radio frequency (RF) sensor aerospace applications; 2) electro-optical (EO) aerospace sensor technologies for a variety of offensive and defensive uses; 3) RF antennas and associated electronics for airborne and space surveillance, together with active and passive EO sensors; 4) technologies to manage and fuse on-board sensor information for timely, comprehensive situational awareness; and 5) technology for reliable, all-weather surveillance, reconnaissance, and precision strike RF sensors and electronic combat systems.  This program has been coordinated through the Reliance 21 process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.  This program is in Budget Activity 2, Applied Research, since it develops and determines the technical feasibility and military utility of evolutionary and revolutionary sensor, electronics, and electronic combat technologies.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project develops the technologies required to perform management and fusion of sensor information for timely, comprehensive situational awareness, automatic target recognition, integrated fire control, and bomb damage assessment.  This project determines the feasibility of technologies and concepts for fire control that help to precisely locate, identify, and target airborne and surface targets.  The project emphasizes finding reduced signature targets and targets of opportunity.  It will enable new covert tactics for successful air-to-air and air-to-surface strikes.  This project also develops the technologies required to create trusted autonomic, distributed, collaborative, and self-organizing sensor systems that provide anticipatory and persistent intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), situational awareness, and decision support for multi-layered sensing.  This program provides the technologies for:  1) trusted sensors and trusted sensor systems that will deter reverse engineering and exploitation of our critical hardware and software technology and impede unwanted technology transfer, alteration of system capability, and prevent the development of countermeasures to U.S. systems; 2) collaborative tasking of our own distributed heterogeneous sensor networks across a region and co-opted tasking of both traditional and non-traditional adversary sensors; 3) secure sensor web backbone technologies, sensor web physical topologies, and related protocols to assure reliable trusted sensor interactions; and 4) defining architectures for distributed trusted collaborative heterogeneous sensor systems and semantic sensor networks, developing new methodologies for system of systems sensor engineering and analysis, and new techniques for sensor network situation awareness and predictive analytics.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project develops and assesses affordable, reliable all weather RF sensing and countermeasure concepts for aerospace applications covering the range of RF sensors including communications, navigation, ISR, and radar, both active and passive, across the air, land, sea, space and cyber domains.  This project also develops and evaluates technology for ISR sensors, fire control radars, electronic warfare, integrated radar and electronic warfare systems, and offensive information operations systems.  It emphasizes the detection and tracking of surface and airborne targets with RF signatures that are difficult to detect due to reduced radar cross sections, concealment and camouflage measures, severe clutter, or heavy jamming.  Techniques exploited include the use of multiple RF phenomenologies, multi-dimensional adaptive processing, advanced waveforms and knowledge-aided processing techniques.  This project also develops the RF warning and countermeasure technology for advanced electronic warfare and information operations applications. Specifically, it develops techniques and technologies to detect and counter the communications links and sensors of threat air defense systems and hostile command and control networks.  The project also exploits emerging technologies and components to provide increased capability for offensive and defensive RF sensors, including radar warning, RF electronic warfare, and electronic intelligence applications.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element focuses on four major areas.  First, space survivability and surveillance develops technologies to understand space weather and the geophysics environment for mitigation and exploitation of these effects to Air Force systems.  Second, spacecraft payload technologies improve satellite payload operations by developing advanced component and subsystem capabilities.  Third, spacecraft protection develops technologies for protecting U.S. space assets in potential hostile settings.  The last major area, spacecraft vehicles, focuses on spacecraft platform and control technologies, and their interactions.  Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Reliance 21 process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.  This program is in Budget Activity 2, Applied Research, since it develops and determines the technical feasibility and military utility of evolutionary and revolutionary space technologies.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program covers research in directed energy (DE) technologies, primarily laser devices, optical beam control, and high power microwaves.  In laser devices, this research includes moderate to high power laser devices that are applicable to a wide range of applications.  In beam control, this research includes optical technologies to propagate lasers beams from a device and to provide ground-based optical space situational awareness.  In high power microwaves, this research examines technologies for applications such as counter-electronics and non-lethal weapons.  Vulnerability/lethality assessments are conducted for representative DE technologies.  Research into other advanced non-conventional/innovative weapons will be conducted.  Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Reliance 21 process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.  This program is in Budget Activity 2, Applied Research, since it develops and determines the technical feasibility and military utility of evolutionary and revolutionary technologies.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program develops enterprise-centric information technology for the Air Force (AF). Advances in enterprise-centric information technologies are required to increase warfighter readiness and effectiveness by providing the right information, at the right time, in the right format, anytime, anywhere in the world. The Connectivity and Protection Tech project provides the technologies for multi-level, secure, seamless networks; advanced communications processors; anti-jam and low probability of intercept techniques, as well as technologies that deter any adversary from attacking computer systems while allowing access to, presence on, manipulation of, and operational effects on adversary computer systems. This project also develops the technology base for the next generation of ultra-wide-bandwidth, multi-channeled, air- and space-based communications networks. The Information Management and Computational Tech project provides advances in information management and dissemination technologies to ensure the delivery of high-quality, timely, secure information to the warfighter, and develop technologies to produce both advanced on-demand computational processing and computer architectures with greater capacity and sophistication for addressing dynamic mission objectives under constraints imposed by AF systems.  The Information Decision Making Tech project develops the technology to support the commander and staff's ability to command all viable options to achieve desired effects across the full spectrum of operations. The Operational Awareness Tech project develops technologies that improve their capability to generate, process, manage, fuse, exploit, interpret, and disseminate timely and accurate information. This program has been coordinated through the Reliance 21 process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication. This program is in Budget Activity 2, since it develops and demonstrates the technical feasibility and military utility of evolutionary and revolutionary technologies.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The AF requires technologies that enable assured, worldwide communications among all elements of the force.  These communication technologies will provide en-route and deployed reachback communications for distributed collaborative military operations. This project provides the technologies for secure, self-configuring, self-healing, seamless networks; advanced communications processors; anti-jam and low probability of intercept communications techniques; agile, dynamic policy based network management capabilities; and modular, programmable, low-cost software radios.  This project also develops both the technology base for the next generation of ultra-wide bandwidth, multi-channeled air- and space-based communications networks on and between platforms using the technologies for implementing photonic chip scale optical Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) and Wavelength Division Multiplexed (WMD) transceivers and prototype networks associated with advanced fiber optics and the technology to integrate current Radio Frequency (RF) with high data rate Optical Laser communications, along with network management techniques, tools, and software to support them.  In addition, the AF requires technologies to deliver a full range of options in cyberspace at par with air and space dominance in each of the areas of cyber attack, cyber defense, and cyber support to achieve the strategic capability of cyber dominance.  This project provides the technologies required to successfully deter any adversary from attacking computer systems anytime, anywhere by ensuring the AF's ability to:  1) access, maintain presence on, and deliver effects to adversary systems; 2) detect, defend, and respond to attacks on friendly computer systems as well as provide forensic analysis concerning those attack attempts; and 3) provide cyber situational awareness to AF commanders.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The AF requires the capability to maximize the value, sharing, management, and use of its information and information assets in achieving its mission objectives as the importance of information grows in the current net centric environment.  Technology development in this project must be capable of taking advantage of future net-centric environments including new structured and ad hoc processes in response to rapidly changing warfare challenges.  Advances in robust information management focus on quality of service and flow of information within the enterprise, information transformation and brokering, secure information sharing across and among domains, and collaboration of workflow within the enterprise.  Technologies addressed in this project include the ability to globally share, discover, and access information across organizational, functional, and coalition boundaries and between and among domains, the timely delivery of information to tactical assets, the tailoring and prioritization of  information based on mission needs and importance, and the scaling, robustness, and collaboration features required of the AF net-centric information management environment.  In addition, the AF requires the development of superior, intelligent, on-demand computing to enable information superiority.  Technology development in this project focuses on producing:  1) computer architectures with greater capacity and sophistication for addressing constrained, dynamic mission objectives; 2) "game-changing" computing power to the warfighter; 3) disruptive computing technology power at the edge and the power behind grid services; and 4) interactive and real-time computing improving the usability of high performance computing to the AF.  It includes technologies in computational sciences and engineering, computer architectures, and software intensive systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The AF requires technologies that improve and automate their capability to generate, process, manage, fuse, exploit, interpret, and disseminate timely and accurate information.  This project provides not only a network-centric, collaborative intelligence analysis capability that enables the fusion of multi-intelligence and sensor sources to provide timely situational awareness, understanding, and anticipation of the threats in the battlespace, but also the advanced, novel exploitation technologies needed to intercept, collect, locate, and process both covert and overt raw data from intelligence and sensor sources.  It leads the research, discovery, and development of technology that enables the fusion of multi-intelligence sources to provide accurate object tracking and identification (ID), situational awareness, understanding, and anticipation of the threats in the battlespace (air, ground, space, and cyber).  It also leads in the development of advanced exploitation technologies to maximize the intelligence gained from our adversaries in the areas of spectral detection and geolocation, signal recognition and analysis, and the data tagging, tracking, and tracing via the insertion of secure, imperceptible signal embedding for future fusion and understanding of the information.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program funds Department of Defense (DoD) high energy laser (HEL) applied research through the HEL Joint Technology Office (JTO). HEL weapon systems have many potential advantages including speed-of-light delivery, precision target engagement, significant magazine depth, low-cost per kill, and reduced logistics requirements.  HELs have the potential to perform a wide variety of military missions including defeat of high-speed, maneuvering anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles and the ultra-precision negation of targets in urban environments with minimal collateral damage. This program is part of an overall DoD HEL Science and Technology program. Efforts funded under this program are generally chosen for their potential to have an impact on multiple HEL systems and multiple Service missions while complimenting Service/Agency programs that are directed at specific Service needs. A broad range of technologies are addressed in key areas such as electrically powered lasers, laser beam control, and laser lethality mechanisms. Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Reliance 21 process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication. This program is in Budget Activity 2, Applied Research, since it develops and determines the technical feasibility and military utility of evolutionary and revolutionary technologies.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program funds Department of Defense (DoD) high energy laser (HEL) applied research through the HEL Joint Technology Office (JTO). HEL weapon systems have many potential advantages including speed-of-light delivery, precision target engagement, significant magazine depth, low-cost per kill, and reduced logistics requirements.  HELs have the potential to perform a wide variety of military missions including defeat of high-speed, maneuvering anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles and the ultra-precision negation of targets in urban environments with minimal collateral damage. This program is part of an overall DoD HEL Science and Technology program. Efforts funded under this program are generally chosen for their potential to have an impact on multiple HEL systems and multiple Service missions while complimenting Service/Agency programs that are directed at specific Service needs. A broad range of technologies are addressed in key areas such as electrically powered lasers, laser beam control, and laser lethality mechanisms. Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Reliance 21 process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication. This program is in Budget Activity 2, Applied Research, since it develops and determines the technical feasibility and military utility of evolutionary and revolutionary technologies.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program develops and demonstrates materials technology for transition into Air Force systems.  The program has five projects which develop:  (1) hardened materials technologies for the protection of aircrews and sensors; (2) non-destructive inspection and evaluation technologies; (3) transition data on structural and non-structural materials for aerospace applications; (4) airbase operations technologies including deployable base infrastructure, force protection, and fire fighting capabilities; and (5) advanced materials for space applications. Efforts in the program have been coordinated through the Reliance 21 process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.  This program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development, since it develops and demonstrates technologies for existing system upgrades and/or new system developments that have military utility and address warfighter needs.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Divided into two broad project areas, this program develops technologies to enable the continued superiority of sensors from aerospace platforms.  The first project develops and demonstrates advanced technologies for electro-optical sensors, radar sensors and electronic counter-countermeasures, and components and algorithms.  The second project develops and demonstrates radio frequency and electro-optical sensors for detecting, locating, and targeting airborne, fixed, and time-critical mobile ground targets obscured by natural or man-made means.  Together, the projects in this program develop the means to find, fix, target, track, and engage air and ground targets anytime, anywhere, and in any weather.  This program has been coordinated through the Reliance 21 process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.  This program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development, since it develops and demonstrates technologies for existing system upgrades and/or new sensor and electronic combat system developments that have military utility and address warfighter needs.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:SummaryExplanation>FY11: Other Adjustments include -0.251 Congressional General Reductions

In FY 2012, Congress added $10 million for Program Increase.

In FY 2012, Congress transferred $58.6 million from JIEDDO to PE 0305205F, Endurance Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, for the Blue Devil 1 program.  Those funds have been subsequently moved from PE 0305205F to PE 0603203F for execution.

Decrease in FY 2013 is due to higher Department of Defense priorities.

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project develops and demonstrates advanced technologies for attack management, fire control, and target identification and recognition.  This includes developing and demonstrating integrated and cooperative fire control techniques to provide for adverse-weather precision air strikes against multiple targets per pass and at maximum weapon launch ranges.  Specific fire control technologies under development include attack management, sensor fusion, automated decision aids, advanced tracking for low radar cross section threats, and targeting using both on-board and off-board sensor information.  This project also evaluates targeting techniques to support theater missile defense efforts in surveillance and attack.  These fire control technologies will provide force multiplication and reduce warfighter exposure to hostile fire.  This project also develops and demonstrates target identification and recognition technologies for positive, high confidence cueing, recognition, and identification of airborne and ground-based, high-value, time-critical targets at longer ranges than are currently possible.  The goal is to apply these technologies to tactical air-to-air and air-to-surface weapon systems so they are able to operate in all weather conditions, during day or night, and in high-threat, multiple target environments.  Model-based vision algorithms and target signature development techniques are the key to target identification and recognition.  This project is maturing these technologies in partnership with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and evaluating the techniques to support theater missile defense efforts in surveillance and attack.  Fire control and recognition technologies developed and demonstrated in this project are high leverage efforts, providing for significant advancements in operational capabilities largely through software improvements readily transitionable to new and existing weapon systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program develops and demonstrates technologies to achieve enabling and revolutionary advances in turbine, advanced cycle, and rocket propulsion, as well as electrical power thermal management, and fuels. The program has six projects, each focusing on technologies with a high potential to enhance the performance of existing and future Air Force weapons systems. The Aerospace Fuels project develops and demonstrates improved hydrocarbon fuels and advanced propulsion systems for high-speed/hypersonic flight. The Aerospace Power Technology project develops and demonstrates power and thermal management systems for weapons and aircraft as part of energy optimized aircraft development. The Aerospace Propulsion Subsystems Integration project integrates the engine cores demonstrated in the Advanced Turbine Engine Gas Generator project with low-pressure components into demonstrator engines. The Space and Missile Rocket Propulsion project develops and demonstrates innovative rocket propulsion technologies, propellants, manufacturing techniques. The Advanced Aerospace Propulsion project develops the scramjet propulsion cycle to a technology readiness level appropriate for in-flight demonstration and for full integration with other engine cycles (including turbine and rocket based). The Advanced Turbine Engine Gas Generator project develops and demonstrates core turbine engine technologies for current and future aircraft propulsion systems. Portions of the Aerospace Fuels, Advanced Turbine Engine Gas Generator, and Aerospace Propulsion Subsystems Integration projects support adaptive cycle technology demonstrations which develop component technology for an adaptive cycle engine architecture that provides optimized performance, fuel efficiency, and durability for widely varying mission needs. Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Reliance 21 process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication. This program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development, since it enables and demonstrates technologies for existing system upgrades and/or new system developments that have military utility and address warfighter needs.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project develops and demonstrates technology to increase turbine engine operational reliability, durability, mission flexibility, and performance while reducing weight, fuel consumption, and cost of ownership. The Aerospace Propulsion Subsystems Integration (APSI) project includes demonstrator engines for manned systems and concept and efficient small-scale propulsion for remotely piloted aircraft and cruise missile applications. The demonstrator engines integrate the core (high-pressure spool) technology developed under the Advanced Turbine Engine Gas Generator project with the engine (low-pressure spool) technology such as fans, turbines, engine controls, mechanical systems, exhaust nozzles, and augmentors. Additionally, this project includes activities to improve propulsion safety and readiness. This project also focuses on integration of inlets, nozzles, engine/airframe compatibility, and power and thermal management subsystems technologies. The APSI project provides aircraft with potential for longer range and higher cruise speeds with lower specific fuel consumption, surge power for successful engagements, high sortie rates with reduced maintenance, reduced life cycle cost, and improved survivability, resulting in increased mission effectiveness. Technologies developed are applicable to sustained high-speed vehicles and responsive space launch. The APSI project is focused on improving propulsion capabilities while at the same time reducing the cost of ownership. Anticipated technology advances include turbine engine improvements providing approximately twice the range for a sustained supersonic combat aircraft, doubling the time on station with 10 times the power output for surveillance aircraft and propulsion for a high speed supersonic missile with double the range for time sensitive targets. A portion of this project supports the demonstration of adaptive cycle technologies, which develop component technology for an adaptive cycle engine architecture that provides optimized performance, fuel efficiency, and durability for widely varying mission needs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project develops and demonstrates advanced and innovative low-cost rocket turbo-machinery and components, low-cost space launch propulsion technologies, and advanced propellants for launch and orbit transfer propulsion. Additionally, this project develops technologies for the sustainment of strategic systems (including solid boost/missile propulsion, post boost control, and aging and surveillance efforts) and tactical rockets. Characteristics such as environmental acceptability, affordability, reliability, responsiveness, reduced weight, and reduced operation and launch costs are emphasized. Increased life and performance of propulsion systems are key goals. This project also develops chemical, electrical, and solar rocket propulsion technologies for station-keeping and on-orbit maneuvering applications. Technology areas investigated include ground demonstrations of compact, lightweight, advanced propulsion technologies, higher efficiency energy conversion systems (derived from an improved understanding of combustion fundamentals), and high-energy propellants. Technological advances developed in this program could improve the performance of expendable payload capabilities by approximately 20-50 percent and reduce launch, operations, and support costs by approximately 30 percent. Responsiveness and operability of propulsion systems will be enhanced for reusable launch systems. Technology advances could also lead to seven-year increase in satellite on-orbit time, a 50 percent increase in satellite maneuvering capability, a 25 percent reduction in orbit transfer operational costs, and a 15 percent increase in satellite payload. Aging and surveillance efforts for solid rocket motors could reduce lifetime prediction uncertainties for individual motors by 50 percent, enabling motor replacement for cause. The efforts in this project contribute to the sustainment of the rocket propulsion industry, providing rocket propulsion technology for the entire Department of Defense and often NASA.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project develops and demonstrates, via ground and flight tests, the scramjet propulsion cycle to a technology readiness level appropriate for full integration with other engine cycles (including turbine and rocket-based) to provide the Air Force with transformational military capabilities. The primary focus is on the hydrocarbon-fueled, scramjet engine. Multi-cycle engines will provide the propulsion systems for possible application to support aircraft and weapon platforms operating over the range of Mach 0 to 8+. Efforts include scramjet flow-path optimization to enable operation over the widest possible range of Mach numbers, active combustion control to assure continuous positive thrust (even during mode transition), robust flame-holding to maintain stability through flow distortions, and maximized volume-to-surface area to minimize the thermal load imposed by the high-speed engine. Thermal management plays a vital role in scramjet and combined cycle engines, including considerations for protecting low speed propulsion systems (e.g., turbine engines) during hypersonic flight.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project develops and demonstrates technology to increase turbine engine operational reliability, durability, mission flexibility, and performance while reducing weight, fuel consumption, and cost of ownership. The objective is to provide the continued evolution of technologies into an advanced gas generator in which the performance, cost, durability, reparability, and maintainability can be assessed in a realistic engine environment. The gas generator, or core, is the basic building block of the engine and nominally consists of a compressor, a combustor, a high-pressure turbine, mechanical systems, and core subsystems. Experimental core engine demonstration validates engineering design tools and enhances rapid, low-risk transition of key engine technologies into engineering development, where they can be applied to derivative and/or new systems. These technologies are applicable to a wide range of military and commercial systems including aircraft, missiles, land combat vehicles, ships, and responsive space launch. Component technologies are demonstrated in a core (sub-engine). This project also assesses the impact of low spool components (such as inlet systems, fans, low pressure turbines, and exhaust systems) and system level technologies (such as integrated power generators and thermal management systems) on core engine performance and durability in "core-centric engine" demonstration. The core performances of this project are validated on demonstrator engines in Project 4921 of this Program Element. A portion of this project supports the demonstration of adaptive cycle technologies, which develop component technology for an adaptive cycle engine architecture that provides optimized performance, fuel efficiency, and durability for widely varying mission needs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program develops and demonstrates technologies to support Air Force electronic combat warfighting capabilities.  The program focuses on developing components, subsystems, and technologies with potential aerospace combat, special operations, and airlift electronic combat applications in three project areas.  The first project develops and demonstrates technologies for integrating electronic combat sensors and systems into a fused and seamless whole.  The second project integrates and focuses research efforts in electronic warfare (EW), directed energy weapons (DEW), and cyber warfare to rapidly demonstrate a capability for rapid fielding.  The third project develops and demonstrates advanced technologies for radio-frequency electronic combat suites.  The fourth project develops and demonstrates advanced warning and countermeasure technologies to defeat electro-optical, infrared, and laser threats to aerospace platforms.  This program has been coordinated through the Reliance 21 process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.  This program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development, since it develops and demonstrates technologies for existing system upgrades and/or new sensor and electronic combat system developments that have military utility and address warfighter needs.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Future improved space-qualifiable electronics and software for data and signal processing will be more interchangeable, interoperable, and standardized.  In the near-term, this project's work concentrates on converting (i.e., radiation-hardening) commercial data and signal processor technologies for use in Air Force space systems.  For mid-term applications, this project merges advanced, radiation-hardened space processor, memory, and interconnect technologies with commercially-derived, open system architectures to develop and demonstrate robust, on-board processing capabilities for 21st century Department of Defense satellites.  In the long-term, this project area focuses on developing low-cost, easily modifiable software and hardware architectures for fully autonomous constellations of intelligent satellites capable of performing all mission related functions without operator intervention.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The project performs assessments of critical components and subsystems, and evaluates susceptibility and vulnerability to radio frequency (RF) and laser threats.  This project also develops technologies that mitigate identified vulnerabilities.  Technologies are developed and demonstrated to support balanced satellite protection strategies for detecting, avoiding, and operating in a hostile space environment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program develops, demonstrates, and integrates ordnance and advanced guidance technologies for air-launched conventional weapons.  The program includes development of conventional ordnance technologies including warheads, fuzes, and explosives; and development of advanced guidance technologies including seekers, navigation and control, and guidance.  Technologies to be developed, demonstrated, and integrated include blast, fragmentation, penetration, low-collateral damage warheads, variable depth/location fuzing, precise guidance, and high performance and insensitive explosives.  Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Reliance 21 process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.  This program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development, since it develops and demonstrates technologies for existing system upgrades and/or new system developments that have military utility and address warfighter needs.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program develops, demonstrates, and integrates ordnance and advanced guidance technologies for air-launched conventional weapons.  The program includes development of conventional ordnance technologies including warheads, fuzes, and explosives; and development of advanced guidance technologies including seekers, navigation and control, and guidance.  Technologies to be developed, demonstrated, and integrated include blast, fragmentation, penetration, low-collateral damage warheads, variable depth/location fuzing, precise guidance, and high performance and insensitive explosives.  Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Reliance 21 process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.  This program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development, since it develops and demonstrates technologies for existing system upgrades and/or new system developments that have military utility and address warfighter needs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Manufacturing Technology (ManTech) program executes technical programs to maintain and develop an affordable and reliable industrial base and manufacturing capability that will be responsive to warfighter needs.  The program develops and improves manufacturing technologies and processes to enable cost reduction, improve component and system quality, and enhance industrial capability. Further, value stream modifications and manufacturing throughput improvements are effected to shorten cycle times of weapon systems during design, development, production and sustainment. ManTech objectives are conducted through industrial partnerships which enable the demonstration of manufacturing technologies for existing weapon system upgrades and/or for new warfighter systems.  Efforts in the program have been coordinated through the Reliance 21 process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.  Manufacturing Technologies is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development, since it develops and demonstrates manufacturing technologies for existing upgrades and/or new system developments that have military utility and address warfighter needs.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Manufacturing Technology (ManTech) program executes technical programs to maintain and develop an affordable and reliable industrial base and manufacturing capability that will be responsive to warfighter needs.  The projects include development and improvement of manufacturing  technologies and processes; collaboration with government program offices, industry, and academia; investments in generic technologies that can be applied to different applications; cost-sharing; multiple system/customer applications; potential for significant return on investment; and customer commitment to implement.  To this end, ManTech develops and demonstrates advanced manufacturing processes and technologies to reduce costs, improve quality/capability, and shorten cycle times of weapon systems during design, development, production, and sustainment.   Where mature processes are not available, laboratory-developed and demonstrated initial process capabilities are made available for transition into weapon system programs. ManTech objectives are conducted through partnerships with all industry levels, from large prime contractors to small material and parts vendors.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Manufacturing readiness of technologies is a key concern when identifying and mitigating risk to successfully transition these technologies and systems into production.  Within each product sector (aeronautical, space, munitions/directed energy, and C2ISR), manufacturing readiness assessments (MRAs) will be applied and manufacturing readiness levels (MRLs) utilized to gauge and manage manufacturing related issues.   Advanced Technology Demonstrations (ATDs) will be used when appropriate to aid in efficient transition.  Selected acquisition programs will also be assessed to determine readiness for milestone decisions and/or to reduce manufacturing risk.  Pervasive, generic and system-specific manufacturing maturation plans will be developed and implemented based on the assessments to reduce overall program risk and to provide an increased awareness of manufacturing issues throughout major weapon system life cycles.  Generic and pervasive manufacturing issues will be identified and considered as potential ManTech programs to transition advanced manufacturing technologies into multiple sectors.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program develops and demonstrates Air Force Enterprise-Centric Information technologies for the warfighter.  The Global Battlespace Awareness project develops, integrates, and demonstrates advanced technologies to achieve comprehensive net-centric operations and total battlespace awareness by using and exploiting information from all sources.  The Assured Worldwide Connectivity project provides advanced net-enabled architectures and communications technologies in support of global military operations, including a secure information grid for worldwide information exchange of near-real-time multimedia (i.e., voice, data, video, and imagery) information.  In addition, this project develops and demonstrates advanced optical networking and communications for Air Force air- and space-based information exchange on and between platforms.   These optical networks will be rapidly deployable, mobile, interoperable, and seamless between Air and Space Operations Centers (AOC) and air- and space- based platforms either en route or in theater.  This project also provides the tools and applications leading to the development and integration of cyber deterrence technologies resulting in a strategic capability of cyber dominance within the secure information grid.  The Knowledge Management and Computing project develops the technology applications that will provide for a secure, tailored, seamless exchange of information among producers, consumers, and managers of information relevant to a particular community of interest (COI).  The project also provides the development of interactive and real-time computing technologies that greatly improve the usability of high performance computing for the exchange, utilization, and management of information in the enterprise.  The Anticipatory Ops Intent and Response project develops the technologies for dynamic planning and execution with the accuracy, fidelity, and timeliness needed to dominate the battlespace. This program has been coordinated through the Reliance 21 process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication. This program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development, since it develops and demonstrates technologies for existing upgrades and/or new system developments that have military utility and address warfighter needs.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

This project develops and integrates decision support technologies that will enhance the commander's ability to anticipate and dominate the future battlespace by more effectively forecasting the evolution of the battlespace and by more rapidly generating options to "virtually checkmate" the adversary.  It develops the decision aid technologies and processes to plan the use of various assets and assess their effects in the battlespace.

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Air Force requires advanced net-enabled architectures and communications technologies in support of global kinetic and non-kinetic military operations including a secure information grid for worldwide information delivery and exchange of near-real-time information including voice, data, video, and imagery.  This secure environment will be rapidly deployable, mobile, interoperable, and seamless between Air and Space Operations Centers (AOC) and aircraft, either en route or in theater.  This project provides secure information transmission capabilities for a persistent, global, survivable communications backbone network accessible for warfighters operating in all domains; it provides self-healing, self-configuration, anti-jam communication networking capabilities; and it provides enterprise networking capabilities for agile, policy-based network management.  In addition, this project develops and demonstrates advanced optical networking and communications for Air Force air- and space-based information exchange on and between platforms including development of highly integrated multi-gigabit optical and radio frequency networks, all optical data routers, optical backbone interface circuits for on board information exchange, and integrated electronic, adaptive optic systems for atmospheric mitigation.  The Air Force also requires the ability to deliver sovereign options in cyberspace through the development and integration of cyber attack, cyber defense, and cyber support technologies for a strategic capability of cyber dominance.  This project develops the ability to deliver cyber attack capabilities (access, stealth and persistence, cyber intelligence, and weapons delivery), cyber defense capabilities (attack detection, attack attribution, and response automation), and cyber support capability (situational awareness and war gaming.)</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>In order to achieve information dominance, the Air Force must be able to monitor, assess, plan, and execute (MAPE) missions rapidly across the full spectrum of operations (air, space, and cyberspace) at all levels of war (strategic, operational, and tactical) and during all phases of conflict (pre-conflict, conflict through stability operations).  This project develops, integrates, and demonstrates advanced technologies to achieve comprehensive net-centric operations and Predictive Battlespace Awareness using information from all sources.  Technology development includes:  tasking information collectors (intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance platforms, national intelligence sources, etc.); correlating and geo-registering the collected data; exploiting the data to extract information of military significance; fusing information from multiple sources to create a digital-n-dimensional representation of the battlespace; assessing the situation; predicting adversary courses of action (COA); and archiving the results for ready use by decision makers.  This is a dynamic, complex process that involves technologies for information exploitation, fusion, processing, storage, and retrieval, as well as technologies for machine reasoning, pattern recognition, and timeline analysis.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Air Force requires technologies that will provide the decision maker and staff with seamless access to tailored information within a mobile, dynamic, and scalable, globally distributed Air and Space Operations Center (AOC), as well as among other producers, consumers, and managers of information relevant to other particular communities of interest (COI).  This project demonstrates the enterprise management capabilities needed for the rapid distribution of actionable information, as well as the needed advances in high performance computing to ensure this complex capability.  This project develops an agile information environment that focuses on quality of service, transformation and brokering, a federated information environment focusing the relationship among the members of the environment, a secure cross-domain information sharing capability that focuses on the security layer and inter-COI information exchange in different security domains, and a collaboration environment focusing on the information workflow layer of the enterprise.  This project will also develop:  1) a computational science and engineering capability demonstrating new models of computation; 2) novel approaches for high performance, interactive, net-centric, distributed, and embedded computing systems; and 3) the technological tools enabling affordable, large-scale, complex, software intensive systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program funds Department of Defense (DoD) high energy laser (HEL) advanced technology development through the HEL Joint Technology Office (JTO).  HEL weapons have many potential advantages including speed-of-light delivery, precision target engagement, significant magazine depth, low-cost per kill, and reduced logistics requirements.  HEL weapons have the potential to perform a wide variety of military missions including defeat of high-speed, maneuvering anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles and the ultra-precision negation of targets in urban environments with minimal collateral damage.  This program is part of the overall DoD HEL Science and Technology program.  Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Reliance 21 process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.  This program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development, since it enables and demonstrates HEL capabilities and concepts.

HEL weapons have many potential advantages including speed-of-light delivery, precision target engagement, significant magazine depth, low-cost per kill, and reduced logistics requirements.  HEL weapons have the potential to perform a wide variety of military missions including defeat of high-speed, maneuvering anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles and the ultra-precision negation of targets in urban environments with minimal collateral damage.  This program is part of the overall DoD HEL Science and Technology program.  Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Reliance 21 process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.  This program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development, since it enables and demonstrates HEL capabilities and concepts.
