            <proc:Description>The Department of Defense Human Resources Activity (DHRA) is a consolidated Field Activity under the direction and control of the Under Secretary of Defense (Personnel and Readiness) (USD (P&amp;R)) established for the collection and interaction of manpower and personnel data to support Department-wide tracking, analysis, research, studies, and a wide variety of reporting requirements. DHRA provides functional information management, civilian personnel policy support, and civilian personnel administrative services to DoD Components and activities. The scope of operations is necessarily broad and encompasses all aspects of data collection and utilization of Defense manpower and personnel data records to support DoD-wide analysis, studies, research, and reporting requirements. DHRA is the responsible organization within DoD for the interchange of automated manpower data with other government agencies. 

For FY 2017, as a result of a Business Process and Systems Review, DHRA will implement a major reorganization that will impact the DHRA procurement budget.  The most significant aspect of this reorganization, from a procurement perspective, will be the integration of the Enterprise Human Resources Information System (EHRIS) into the Defense Manpower Data Center's (DMDC) portfolio of information technology (IT) initiatives.  Additionally, DHRA has implemented a major reorganization of the DMDC programs to more accurately align budget program lines with the DHRA Information Technology (IT) data reported in the DHRA IT Budget.  The Defense Eligibility and Enrollment System (DEERS); Data Governance/Data Acquisition &amp; Decision Support (EDS); Real Time Automated Personnel Identification System (RAPIDS); Common Access Card (CAC); Cyber Security program has been decomposed into a DEERS program and a RAPIDS program, with CAC being retained as part of the RAPIDS program.  Synchronized Pre-deployment and Operational Tracker (SPOT) has been integrated into a Personnel Accountability (PA) program, which also includes Joint Personnel Accountability Reconciliation and Reporting (JPARR), and Noncombatant Evacuation Operations (NEO) Tracking System (NTS).  

Civilian HR automation enhancements (EHRIS) planned for FY 2017 are focused on software development to support the Department's civilian workforce, including readiness requirements for the development of automation for a performance management system; development of interfaces with the Defense Civilian Personnel Data System (DCPDS) and other civilian HR systems;  development of DCPDS interfaces with Office of Personnel Management (OPM) initiative mandates for the HR Line of Business (LoB), and electronic Official Personnel Folder. DoD is one of six designated Shared Service Centers in the federal government focused on providing standard services across agency lines, gaining potential significant business and cost-saving benefits. DoD is considered a leader in this initiative. DCPDS is the Department's enterprise civilian HR system that has provided the savings originally projected in the achievement of full operational capability in 2002 and which has continued to operate as the DoD system serving over 800,000 employee records. Additional initiatives to sustain the Department's lead in automated systems include expansion of employee self-service functionality, and customer focused portal access and systems with software development that transitions from an HR professional focus to employee/manager users. All enhancements will support the Department's focus on the further consolidation of civilian HR operations to a single operational site, with linkage to Component operations worldwide.  Other systems support includes the Investigations and Resolution Case Management System (RCMS) that support injury and unemployment compensation.  Additional business operations will be assessed in the areas of, talent management, competency assessment, and case management tracking systems.  DCPDS is the Department's enterprise civilian human resources (HR) transactional system supporting 800,000 employees, representing approximately one-third of the federal government's civilian work force.  The consolidation of all instances of DCPDS at the DDC completed in 2014 has resulted in substantial component savings.  In FY 16, additional data center consolidation will include additional HRIT Enterprise Systems moving to the Denver Data Center (DCC).  In FY16/17 application upgrades, database consolidation, and new capabilities to process employee benefits will be delivered.

Defense Eligibility and Enrollment System (DEERS) is DoD's only authoritative data repository of all manpower, personnel (military, civilian, selected contractors, retirees, and family members), benefit eligibility, and TRICARE enrollments worldwide. Provides and maintains medical and personnel readiness information on Uniformed Services members, DoD and Medicare eligibility status, Federal Service member's Group Life Insurance enrollment, the central repository for immunizations, and the single portal for DoD benefit information. The program maintains enrollment and eligibility verification data from existing DEERS client applications and interfacing systems, as well as the DoD Components and non-DoD information systems.

RAPIDS is the infrastructure that supports the Uniformed Services identification card, provides on-line updates to DEERS and issues the CAC to Service members, civilian employees, and eligible contractors, thus providing an enterprise-wide credential for both physical and logical access to DoD facilities and networks. CAC uses the DEERS database for authentication and personnel information.    

The PA program is comprised of three initiatives: Synchronized Pre-deployment and Operational Tracker (SPOT), Joint Personnel Accountability Reconciliation and Reporting (JPARR), and Noncombatant Evacuation Operations (NEO) Tracking System (NTS).  This family of systems represents end-to-end tracking, reconciliation and reporting of DoD personnel location and movements, to include military, DoD affiliated civilians, contractors, and U.S. citizens. This includes DoD travel, contracts, and contractor personnel tracking in support of contingencies, military readiness, reporting  of locations at the unit and person level, accountability of DoD personnel during (and after) natural or man-made disasters, and accountability and visibility of noncombatant evacuees.  SPOT is the DoD system of record for accountability and visibility of contracts and contractor personnel authorized to operate in a contingency operation. JPARR is a "public" SIPR only application that provides daily person-level location reporting.  JPARR receives feeds for Service and Agency deployment systems, reconciles the data, and provides various reports at unit level detail.  NTS is a certified and accredited DoD automated system that accounts for, and sustains visibility of noncombatant evacuees during a NEO.

The EDS program is comprised of 4 initiatives:  Data Governance, Data Acquisition and Decision Support (DA&amp;DS), Fourth Estate Manpower Tracking Systems (FMTS), and Cyber.  Data Governance includes Enterprise Data assets, data modeling and database standardization, data quality, and database architectures. Master Data Management oversight controls costs while providing timely and accurate information to the DoD decision makers.  Data Acquisition and Decision Support (DA&amp;DS) is a collection of critical data sources for the Department of Defense that are managed and updated in real time while enforcing data standardization and data quality.  FMTS is the authoritative source for DoD 4th Estate manpower authorizations, identity management, authentication and enterprise email.  Cyber is related directly to the development of the Enterprise Identity Attribute Service (EIAS)/Access Based Access Control technology in the classified environment to serve as an immediate deterrent to allow/deny access to classified information giving the DoD the ability to control and monitor pre-provisioned user access in a manner that cannot be repudiated (e.g., using CAC-enabled PKE Authentication).</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>The increase in funding from FY 16 to FY 17 is attributable to additional funding to support DEERS in bolstering the DMDC Information Technology Infrastructure and additional funding for the EDS program in support of enhancements to the proven Army Person event Data Environment (PDE) research and analysis capability that supports all of the Department of Defense.

Breakout of where the realignment of projects between the FY16 and FY17 budget submission:
1.  DCPDS Central Operations realigns to Project 5, Enterprise Human Resource Information systems (EHRIS)
2.  RAPIDS/CAC realigns from Project 3, DEERS/RAPIDS/CAC/JPARR/NTS/Data Governance/CYBER
3.  DEERS/RAPIDS/CAC/JPARR/NTS/Data Governance/CYBER was realigned into 3 new projects (Project 2, 6, and 7)
4.  Virtual Lifetime Electronic Record (VLER) realigns to Project 6 DEERS
5.  EHRIS This is a new project line but not a new start
6.  DEERS This is a new project line but not a new start
7.  Personnel Accountability (PA) This is a new project line but not a new start
8.  Enterprise Data Systems (EDS) (this is a new project line)

Project RAPIDS/CAC.  FY 2017 investment in Automated Data Processing (ADP) equipment supports the RAPIDS/CAC program. This includes the acquisition, installation, and maintenance of the DMDC RAPIDS/CAC infrastructure, as well as replacing outdated and/or maintenance-intensive equipment in order to continue to ensure full functionality, system security, and HSPD-12 implementation.

Project PA.  FY 2017 investment in the NEO Tracking System (NTS) will be used to upgrade fielded NTS across the COCOMs as called for in JROCM 117-10 dated 29 JUL 2010.  This centralized procurement of equipment will enable DMDC to track the systems in the field and provide support such as software upgrades, training and equipment tracking which are also responsibilities of DMDC called out in JROCM 117-10. 

FY 2017 investment in the JPARR will allow for continued expansion.  This investment will allow for the acquisition of hardware needed to include the U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM) into JPARR.  USNORTHCOM will be the fifth Combatant Command support by these reports. 

Project EDS.  .FY2017 Investment funding will be used to extend and enhance the proven Army Person-event Data Environment (PDE) research and analysis capability to all of the Department of Defense and transfer ownership to DMDC.  Enhancing the PDE will provide an integrated solution which 1) reduces costs, 2) leverages self-service and collaboration, 3) encourages data sharing through a standard data catalog and streamlined business workflow, 4) protects data under the Privacy Act and Health Information Portability and Accountability Act, and 5) provides the security for unencumbered access. The goal of the PDE is to bring 'the analyst to the data' rather than the traditional approach of the 'data to the analyst'.   PDE is  a cloud computing, self- service environment where researchers set up their approved studies, invite colleagues to participate, review 'like' analyses, create idea blogs, reuse data recorded in a data catalog, post research or analysis results and use a common electronic Institutional Review Board (eIRB) if required to protect the exposure of individuals used in a study.  Additionally, the use of the PDE is a proactive step to greatly reduce the risk to DoD of a potentially massive Personally Identifying Information (PII) data loss.

Project DEERS.  FY 2017 investment in the DS Logon program in support of VLER benefits will be used to purchase additional identity proofing's from a vendor that allows the DS Logon credential to be issued online (remotely) simplifying the process for the Beneficiary by avoiding the necessity to be in-person proofed and reducing the cost for the Government by avoiding the costs associated with in-person proofing (manpower, facility, mailings).  These identity proofing's will further be utilized to allow the Beneficiary to reset their password when they have forgotten their username, password and challenge questions.  This avoids the much higher costs associated with calls to a help desk and provides our Beneficiaries with immediate resolution.

Project EHRIS.  FY 2017 investment provides for virtualization and consolidating multiple instances of the EHRIS suite into one.  Additionally, funding will allow multiple instances currently running at the Defense Civilian Personnel Data Center to be collapsed.  The push for collapse and virtualization is a DoD Chief Information Office (CIO) initiative to reduce the reliance on hardware and operate in the MILCLOUD.  The impact to operations would be lengthy delays in meeting DoD CIO  mandates.</proc:Justification>
