                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Advanced IT Services Joint Program Office (AITS-JPO) identifies and integrates new and mature commercial information technology (IT) and advanced operational concepts into net-centric battlespace capabilities to access and exchange critical information; exploit opportunities to enhance current force capabilities; and project future force IT requirements. AITS-JPO supports preparing for future joint force and coalition initiatives through developing and integrating a full range of data services and advanced IT applications to support cooperative activities between the US and its coalition partners. These emergent capabilities are technologies that can be rapidly infused into existing tools.  

The program uses three key mechanisms to streamline the process of fielding emergent requirements: (1) Joint Capability Technology Demonstrations (JCTDs) with the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD)/Combatant Commands (COCOMs)/Services/Agency; (2) Joint Ventures with COCOMs/Program of Record (POR); and (3) Risk Mitigation Pilots with POR/Community of Interest. The JCTD process aligns with the revised Joint Capability Integration and Development System process, developed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, by adapting technology and concept solutions to meet pressing warfighter needs. OSD approves new JCTDs annually and on a rolling start basis.  Defense Information Systems Agency participates in both a technical and transition manager role.  The JCTDs and the Joint Ventures and risk mitigation pilots use a teaming approach thereby sharing costs and reducing the risk to individual organizations.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:SummaryExplanation>The decrease of -$0.499 in FY 2015 is due to a decrease in civilian pay execution.

 The decrease of -$5.036 in FY 2016 is due to agency efficiencies and reductions to overhead support contracted labor. 

The decrease of -$24.747 in FY 2017 is an Agency efficiency and results in the disestablishment of the JCTD program.  As a result, civilian pay and FTEs were realigned to RDT&amp;E PE 0302019K (62 FTES), and O&amp;M (31 FTEs).  In addition, non-pay funding was realigned to RDT&amp;E PE 0302019K.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Advanced IT Services Joint Program Office (AITS-JPO) identifies and integrates Leading Edge commercial information technology (IT) and advanced operational concepts into net-centric battlespace capabilities to access and exchange critical information; exploit opportunities to enhance current force capabilities; and project future force IT requirements. These Leading Edge products provide the Department of Defense (DoD) and National Senior Leaders, (e.g., the President of the United States, Secretary of Defense, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Combatant Commanders, as well as inter-agency participants) with critical focus on long-term collaboration, planning and information sharing. The Leading Edge technology pilots support future joint and coalition initiatives by developing and integrating a range of data services and advanced IT applications. These emergent capabilities are technologies that can be rapidly infused into existing tools for use by the US and coalition partners.
  
Program investments in advanced technology benefit strategic and tactical users in the intelligence, warfighting and business domains by providing them with reliable, persistent collaboration, and networking technologies including computing-on-demand to reduce the need to replicate data or services at the point of consumption. Investments also provide support for virtual end-user environments and semantic search capabilities which enhance the decision-making process. These capabilities provide the warfighter with technical superiority and to achieve interoperability and integration, while working in concert with joint, allied and coalition forces to effectively counter terrorism and enhance homeland security defense. 

The program is further divided into major subprogram areas:  Command and Control (C2) and Combat Support (CS), Information Sharing (IS), Network Infrastructure (NI), Network Operations (NetOps), Cyber Threat Discovery and Program Management Support.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The decrease of -$10.732  from FY 2016 to FY 2017 is an Agency efficiency and results in the disestablishment of the JCTD program.  As a result, civilian pay and FTEs were realigned to RDT&amp;E PE 0302019K (62 FTES), and O&amp;M (31 FTEs).  In addition, non-pay funding was realigned to RDT&amp;E PE 0302019K.</r2:Text>

Market research during the acquisition process includes a review of DISA contracts, other DoD contract vehicles, and other Government agency contracts which are advertised for Government-wide usage.  This market research also includes consideration of small businesses including, minority/women owned (8A) businesses, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, mentor/protégé and other specialized contract vehicles and processes.  It evaluates all contractors available from DISA sources for their ability to deliver the products specifically required for the unique program efforts.  The program works collaboratively with vendors to obtain generic cost data for planning and analysis purposes.  Past and current contract prices for similar work and other government-wide agency contracts provide additional sources of information.  Quotes from multiple sources help provide averages for more realistic cost estimates.  DISA makes a concerted effort to award many of its contracts to small businesses.  Additionally, many of the DISA contracts are awarded with multiple option periods. These have the benefit of fixing labor costs over an extended period and minimizing the administrative costs associated with re-issuing short-term contracts. CTO reviews existing contract vehicles and the number of contracts to minimize administrative overhead.  Instead of individual contracts for program management, business line improvement, asset management, and financial management, there is now one small business program services contract that provides services across DISA.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>OSD holds program reviews twice a year to review cost, schedule, performance and delivery. For JCTDs/ECTDs, the 
program office develops an Implementation Directive and Management Plan. These guidance documents outline the 
project objectives, schedule, and funding for the JCTD/ECTDs. Military utility will be assessed by each JCTD/ECTD to develop and document the detailed objectives. The Operational Sponsor (a COCOM) will evaluate the process and measure results. For technology investigation and piloting, DISA CTO uses standard operating procedures for identifying objectives and metrics. Key metrics used include: utility of technology, time to delivery of technologies to the field, percentage of improvement in transition of technologies, and percentage of improvement in collaborative efforts with other Science and Technology organizations. See below for specific metrics:

1.  Metric: JCTDs/ECTDs provide rapid capabilities to the warfighter that address urgent COCOM needs. Metrics include: time of delivery of technology to the field and utility of technology.

Measure/Goal: Number of approved JCTDs/ECTDs with CTO as the Technical Manager and the number of JCTDs/ECTDs pending approval with CTO as TM. 
FY15 Actual: 3 Approved (2 completed, 1 dropped) 
FY16 Target: 3-5 potential ECTDs/ETs (evaluating about 8 projects which may or may not become an ECTD/ET)

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Global Combat Support System - Joint (GCSS-J), is a key enabler for achieving Focused Logistics and is essential during peace, contingency, crisis, and war in support of the joint warfighter across the full range of military operations. GCSS-J, the Logistics System of Record, provides a Joint Logistics Common Operational Picture to ensure the right personnel, equipment, supplies, and support are in the right place at the right time and in the right quantities to mobilize, move, and sustain all elements of operating forces within a theater or operational area. 

GCSS-J gathers data from authoritative sources to provide a fused, integrated, near real-time, multidimensional view of combat support and combat service support across joint capability areas. These efforts provide situational awareness of the battlespace and logistics pipeline (e.g., supply, deployment and distribution, engineering, etc.). Using GCSS-J, the joint logistics warfighter no longer needs to log into multiple legacy systems and manually gather data to compile reports. GCSS-J provides real time actionable information in the form of watchboards (e.g., fuels and munitions watchboards) and near real time information in the form of reports and mapping visualizations.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

GCSS-J, the Logistics' System of Record, provides a Joint Logistics Common Operational Picture (JLogCOP), ensuring the right personnel, equipment, supplies, and support are in the right place, at the right time, and in the right quantities across the full spectrum of military operations. 

GCSS-J gathers data from authoritative sources to provide fused, integrated, near real-time multidimensional view of combat support and combat service support across joint capability areas. These efforts provide situational awareness of the battlespace and logistics pipeline (e.g., Supply, Deployment and Distribution, Engineering, etc.). Using GCSS-J, the joint logistics warfighter no longer needs to log into multiple legacy systems and manually gather data to compile reports.  GCSS-J provides real-time in the form of reports and mapping visualizations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The GCSS-J Program Management Office (PMO) uses various contract types, employs large and small contractors, and is focused on achieving agency socio-economic goals and incorporating DoD acquisition reform initiatives in purchasing. The PMO maximizes the use of performance-based contracts and requires contractors to establish and manage specific earned value data to mitigate risk and monitor deviations from cost, schedule, and performance objectives. The PMO evaluates performance by conducting thorough Post-award Contract Reviews, monthly Contract Performance Reviews, and bi-monthly In-Process Reviews.  

The PMO uses a Statement of Objectives (SOO) for development efforts rather than the traditional Statement of Work, as it provides potential offerors flexibility to develop cost-effective solutions and the opportunity to propose innovative alternatives to meet GCSS-J requirements. By stating the requirements in a SOO, the contractor can produce a technical solution methodology to deliver leading edge technology to the warfighter.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>GCSS-J fields capabilities based on functional priorities of the Combatant Command 129 Requirements Document as approved and prioritized by the functional sponsor, Joint Staff J4. These requirements and goals are translated into releases with specific capabilities, which have established cost, schedule, and performance parameters approved by the DISA's Component Acquisition Executive/Milestone Decision Authority.

Metrics and requirements are routinely gathered by the GCSS-J PMO. The metrics from the strategic server sites are analyzed by the PMO to ensure that operational mission threads continue to be met and if system enhancement/capabilities are of benefiting the user. Future capabilities include tools that allow GCSS-J to refine and enhance the type of performance metrics that can be gathered and analyzed. These tools become increasingly important as GCSS-J continues to integrate additional data sources and external applications, which allows GCSS-J to continue to transition to a Service Oriented Architecture and directly supports DoD's net-centric vision of exposing and consuming web services. As GCSS-J usage increases and new capabilities are fielded, performance metrics will ensure that the system is meeting user requirements.

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), through the Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC), manages the Department’s Interoperability Test, Evaluation, and Certification process that is structured to provide meaningful and independent test results in order to increase stakeholder confidence.  The objectives, of the Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) activities, are to validate that DISA’s (and the Department’s, where appropriate) deliverables have met operational requirements.  The T&amp;E activities target evaluation strategies in the design, development, operational, integration and/or sustainment aspects of every program requiring support.  DISA’s T&amp;E efforts span a variety of test categories supporting DISA’s delivery of Department-wide enterprise solutions as well as Service, Agency, and mission partner developmental, operational, Information Assurance, and interoperability testing, validation and certification efforts. These efforts are focused on T&amp;E for Information Technology (IT) that includes the Joint Information Environment (JIE), Cyber, Cloud services, and Mobility. 

As the Department of Defense (DoD) Joint Interoperability Certification Authority, JITC annually: 
  •  Issues hundreds of interoperability testing and certification related products.
  •  Manages the scheduling and executes multiple annual distributed Joint Tactical Data Link hardware in the loop interoperability test events.  These events are designed to evaluate, certify and re-certify Service/Agency Tactical Data systems.
  •  Reviews hundreds of Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System documents, interoperability support plans and Legacy Waiver requests on behalf of the DoD Chief Information Officer (CIO) and the Joint Staff. 
  •  Serves as executive agent to DoD Interoperability Steering Group, in support of the DoD CIO, and uses this forum to coordinate policy, adjudicate issues, and to process Interim Certificates to Operate.
  •  Ensures interoperability test and certification standard practices and procedures are in accordance with DoD policy, and reviews and issues over 600 Joint interoperability certifications annually for DoD’s Information Technology and National Security Systems (IT/NSS). 
  •  Manages the scheduling and prioritization of multiple annual distributed Joint Tactical Data Link simulated test events using real components (hardware in the loop interoperability test events) designed to evaluate, certify and re-certify Service/Agency Tactical systems.

JITC provides interoperability test support to Joint, Coalition and Allied operations in theater by providing Interoperability test support within the area of responsibility and supports exercises intended to evaluate Joint, Coalition and Allied operations in, or planning to deploy to theater by: 
  •  Providing on-demand rapid response contingency support to Regional Combatant Commands (COCOMs) as required, and conducting assessments of interoperability exercises.  
  •  Conducting assessments during three of the largest interoperability exercises (the Endeavors).
  •  Broadening its support to the Joint Staff and functional COCOMs with a multitude of interoperability assessment services. 
  •  Maintaining a 24x7 Warfighter Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (C4I) Interoperability Hotline that connects warfighters to subject matter experts to resolve IT interoperability challenges. 
  •  Establishing the framework for the conduct of annual independent evaluations and the status of interoperability through DoD Interoperability Communications Exercises (DICE).
  •  Emulating a distributed Joint Task Force network, providing realism and operational significance during the assessments and evaluations of data integrity, interfacing and responsiveness coupled with efficient configuration tactics, techniques, and procedures. 
  •  Including first responder local and federal communications as part of the task force. 
 
As the only non-Service Operational Test Agency (OTA) within DoD, JITC conducts operational testing of IT/NSS under realistic conditions to determine the operational effectiveness, suitability, interoperability, and security; and independently assesses the operational impact of system issues on mission accomplishment.  JITC is the OTA for DISA-managed programs, and also upon request serves as the OTA for other Agencies such as the Defense Logistics Agency, Department of Homeland Security, and the National Security Agency.

JITC designs Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&amp;E) events to determine if IT/NSS meet user requirements, offering sustaining support services to users to assist Acquisition Program Managers with meeting their overall milestone objectives.  

JITC focuses its efforts towards core T&amp;E improvements, better T&amp;E policy for IT/NSS and designing new test methodologies to better assess Enterprise Service systems, aligning with the Information Technology Service Management model evaluating fulfillment services for suitability.

The T&amp;E project supports the strategy development and investment plans in support of maintaining, improving and operating the DISA Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB).  Specific goals for DISA’s MRTFB each year are to:  
  •  Integrate evolving technologies that are able to leverage efficiencies such as virtualization, enterprise elements such as Infrastructure as a Service and Platform as a Service, and the foundational Cyber assets mandated by the JIE.
  •  Expand test infrastructure and operations to allow for rapid, on-demand provisioning, and federation across the DoD and Cyber integration with enterprise environments. 
  •  Design consistent, repeatable test methodologies that ensure efficient T&amp;E on changing or emerging technologies. 
  •  Provide T&amp;E guidance/oversight to nearly 130 DISA programs, creating synergy and efficiencies across the large DISA IT portfolio, gaining insight in new technologies and commercial best practices.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Through the Combined Enterprise Regional Information Exchange System (CENTRIXS) and Pegasus, the Multinational Information Sharing (MNIS) Program enables secure sharing of operational and intelligence information and enhances collaboration between United States (US) forces, trusted allies and other multinational partners. This effort also increases overall combat effectiveness by leveraging capabilities and information from all partners and reducing the possibility of fratricide.  These coalition information sharing systems are in direct support of the Department of Defense’s (DoD’s) strategic goals to “Win our Nation’s Wars” and “Deter conflict and promote security”.  The MNIS program supports five Combatant Commands (COCOMs) with connectivity in 89 nations, the North America Treaty Organization, 11 Bilateral agreements and 150 sites with over 80,000 users worldwide.  MNIS also evaluates new technologies and develops tactics, techniques and procedures to facilitate the integration of emerging technologies and capabilities into operational multinational information sharing capability.  The integration of new technology for CENTRIXS and Pegasus is accomplished through research, integration, and testing using the Combined Federated Battle Laboratory Network.  

A planned improvement to the CENTRIXS coalition network, Common Mission Network Transport (CMNT), will provide distinct and permanent transport capabilities; enabling network operation centers to priority command and control information more efficiently.  CMNT supports DoD instruction 8110.1 guidance for integrating CENTRIXS and other operational networks into existing DoD general service communications infrastructure as a separate network servicing all DoD MNIS requirements.  This capability provides a common transport for encrypted traffic.  CMNT will be the established encrypted network to facilitate the movement of virtual private network traffic between segments.

The MNIS emerging capability, Unclassified Information Sharing Services (UISS), extends US information sharing capabilities to mission partners providing enterprise-level solutions that allow COCOMs to share unclassified information with US Government agencies and non-traditional partners such as, host nations, intergovernmental organizations, and nongovernmental organizations. The employment concept for the UISS is to implement enterprise Web-based, “non-mil” platform, available to as broad a community as needed to support mission operations, with worldwide, 24 hour-a-day, seven day-a-week access, to any user with an Internet connection, including web-enabled mobile personal devices.  Using an Internet-based capability and an integrated suite of commercial-off-the-shelf collaboration tools the UISS capability will enable unclassified information exchanges and ad-hoc communications for shared communities of interest and issue-specific groups among and across organizations and individuals.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Multinational Information Sharing (MNIS) Program is a portfolio of four coalition information sharing capabilities designed to enable and improve sharing of operational and intelligence information among United States (US) forces and multinational partners.

1) Combined Enterprise Regional Information Exchange System (CENTRIXS), supports intelligence and classified operations at the Secret Releasable level.  There are multiple, cryptographically-isolated CENTRIXS enclaves serving various communities of interest (COI) that support multinational efforts including Overseas Contingency Operations and counter-narcotics operations. CENTRIXS is regionally focused and combatant command (COCOM) centric. The MNIS Program Management Office provides selected centralized services from two Defense Enterprise Computing Centers for five of the 40+ CENTRIXS networks/COIs, and engineering support for standardized solutions.  

2) Pegasus connects the national Command and Control (C2) systems of Combined Communications Electronics Board (CCEB) Nations including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom and the US, using commercial-off-the-shelf security appliances and cross domain solutions that facilitate situational awareness and operational planning/execution. Pegasus has a strategic focus and is member nation centric. 

3) The Combined Federated Battle Laboratory Network (CFBLNet) provides a controlled coalition Research, Development, Trials and Assessment coalition information sharing “sandbox” for the US, CCEB Nations, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and other mission essential nations. This sandbox is used to evaluate new technologies and to develop tactics, techniques and procedures that facilitate the transition of promising technologies and capabilities into operational multinational information sharing capability enhancements.  CFBLNet's direct customers are the CCEB nations’ military operational and intelligence entities led by their US counterparts at the COCOM and Agency levels.  It is being used for the Coalition Warrior Interoperability Demonstrations, NATO missile defense initiatives, and by the Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance community to test capabilities prior to deployment.

4) The Unclassified Information Sharing Service (UISS) extends US information sharing capabilities to mission partners, enterprise-level solutions that allow COCOMs to share unclassified information with other US Government agencies, host nations, inter-governmental organizations, non-governmental organizations, and other partners.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The National Military Command System (NMCS), operated by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, provides the President, Secretary of Defense, and other national senior leaders the ability to maintain situational and operational awareness and command and control of military forces in all crisis and/or national emergency contingencies. DISA's NMCS engineering program meets the NMCS systems engineer responsibilities, per Department of Defense Directive (DoDD) S-5100.44 and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 3280.01B, to provide the Joint Staff with operationally efficient and cost-effective engineering solutions to ensure that components and facilities satisfy operational requirements including emergency messaging, situational awareness, crisis action, and information management.

The NMCS engineering program is vital in supporting the government's ability to safeguard national security and respond to contingencies globally and/or nuclear war. NMCS engineering focuses on implementing collaborative tools into current and crisis operations areas, integrating adequate back-up storage and recovery of voice, video and data across the continental United States to support key leaders, transitioning nuclear command and control to Internet Protocol based networks, migrating data and voice network to next generation satellites, implementing modern cryptological devices, and utilizing wireless networking to support warning systems and situational awareness. In addition, NMCS engineering continues to maintain the NMCS Reference Guide required by DoDD S-5100.44 and to develop engineering and test plans for the installation of hardware and software systems utilized within the NMCS.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The National Military Command System (NMCS), operated by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, provides the President, Secretary of Defense, and other national senior leaders the ability to maintain situational and operational awareness and command and control of military forces in all crisis and/or national emergency contingencies. DISA's NMCS engineering program meets the NMCS systems engineer responsibilities, per Department of Defense Directive (DoDD) S-5100.44 and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 3280.01B, to provide the Joint Staff with operationally efficient and cost-effective engineering solutions to ensure that components and facilities satisfy operational requirements including emergency messaging, situational awareness, crisis action, and information management.

The NMCS engineering program is vital in supporting the government's ability to safeguard national security and respond to contingencies globally and/or nuclear war. NMCS engineering focuses on implementation of collaborative tools into current and crisis operations areas, the integration of adequate back-up storage and recovery of voice, video and data across the continental United States to support key leaders, transition of nuclear command and control to Internet Protocol (IP)-based networks, migration of data and voice network to next generation satellites, implementation of modern crypto-logical devices, and the utilization of wireless networking to support warning systems and situational awareness. In addition, NMCS engineering continues to maintain the NMCS Reference Guide (NRG) required by DoDD S-5100.44 and to develop engineering and test plans for the installation of hardware and software systems utilized within the NMCS.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>The JSEIO conducts regularly scheduled In-progress Program Reviews (IPRs) and Configuration Control Board (CCB) meetings to monitor status of engineering projects/tasks. Each current project/task is evaluated in terms of how well the technical work is progressing and how allocated resources are being utilized. Adjustments to resources, schedules, and technical directions are made, as required.  Future projects/tasks are also discussed, thereby ensuring an integrated approach is maintained across all related project/task areas. To further increase the utility of the IPR/CCB structure, the Joint Staff customer participates in the project/task reviews. The result of this approach is a truly integrated effort of NMCS Engineering, contractor, and Joint Staff working together to achieve common program goals. Suitable products are delivered within allocated resources and delivered on schedule 90% of the time.

The NMCS met all FY 2015 performance metrics and is on track to meet its FY 2016 and FY 2017 metrics by delivering suitable products on schedule and within allocated resources 100% of the time.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Information Infrastructure Engineering and Integration effort encompasses two projects: Modeling and Simulation and DoD Information Network (DODIN) Systems Engineering and Support. There are two major activities under the Modeling and Simulation project: Modeling and Simulation and DODIN Enterprise Wide Systems Engineering (EWSE).

The DODIN EWSE activity resolves near term (one to three years) high-priority technical issues defined by DoD Chief Information Officer (DoD CIO) and Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), that impact operational capabilities affecting DODIN End-to-End (E2E) interoperability and performance. 

The Modeling and Simulation project provides architecture, systems engineering and E2E analytical functions for DISA and its customers, ensuring integrated capabilities to fulfill warfighter mission requirements. Ongoing beneficiaries of these capabilities include DoD CIO, the DISA Network Services Directorate, the DISA Enterprise Services Directorate, Program Executive Office-Mission Assurance, the Defense Information Systems Network Command Center and Joint Communications Simulation System users in DoD.

The DoDIN Systems Engineering and Support project performs discovery, research, development and experimentation of emerging and commercial technologies through the Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO) to fill capability shortfalls and technology gaps across the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP).   The OCTO identifies these gaps/shortfalls, pursues leading innovative solutions from industry, academia, and the Federal sector, and engages industry partners for commercial best practices.  The OCTO develops technology forecasts and innovation roadmaps for existing and nascent DISA programs (Cloud Computing, Unified Capabilities, Cyber Security, End User Device/Mobility, and Process/Automation).  The OCTO conducts technical system engineering reviews and oversight of DISA and DoD enterprise products and services.  The OCTO performs early identification of technology needs and explores, develops, and delivers recommended emerging technologies to the DISA Requirements &amp; Analysis Office.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Modeling and Simulation activities support the Department of Defense (DoD) communications planning and investment strategy, including: application performance assessments, contingency planning, network capacity planning and diagnostics, and systems-level modeling and simulation. Project efforts provide across-theater information awareness for Combatant Commands through application solutions for integrated networks, including DoD’s missions in Afghanistan and the Defense Information Systems Network (DISN) by: (1) supporting the development and implementation of DoD Information Network (DODIN) Enterprise Wide Systems Engineering (EWSE) processes essential to evolving the DODIN in a manner that enables interoperability and E2E performance for critical DODIN programs; (2) developing standardized DISA systems analyses and integration processes to improve systems integration across DISA for all DISA developed communication systems and services; and (3) providing the underlying modeling and simulation and analytical support for E2E DISA and DoD systems engineering and assessment. 

Project efforts provide DoD decision makers with services and a suite of tools capable of identifying key points of impact on DoD command and control information systems and recommending trade-offs within the DODIN configuration with regard to prioritized performance, availability, and security. This effort will reduce the risk in products deployed to the warfighter through improved network performance and traffic analysis, and an efficient means of troubleshooting and subsequent redesign.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>EWSE uses contractors to assist/supplement the Government lead/team for technical activities. Subject matter experts in both large and small businesses are sought for the engineering support. Firm fixed price contracts with one option year are typically used in open competition. Furthermore, technical work with Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) such as MITRE and MIT Lincoln Lab are established and coordinated when the Government can leverage their expertise and R&amp;D in the key technology.  

Modeling and Simulation uses a range of contractors for modeling support to the various projects. Contractors range from small to large business, predominantly using open competition methods and Firm Fixed Price (FFP) tasks and utilizing multi-year (base plus option years) contracts where possible. Support includes network modeling tool and processes development to adapt to ever-evolving OSD/DISA programs and projects, analyses, capacity planning, and network redesign using the models. Some specific support (e.g., integration with proprietary software) will require contracting with OPNET (e.g., sole source). FFRDCs are also considered depending upon the task.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>DISN core transport bandwidth sufficiency, tied to capacity planning and activation of bandwidth in the DISN optical core to keep at least 25% spare capacity, to allow for provisioning of unforeseen requirements and rerouting under outages.

DISN IP Core bandwidth sufficiency tied to capacity planning and activation of IP bandwidth to maintain average bandwidth utilization of DISN IP Core and NIPRNet backbone circuits under 65% during daily peak periods.

DISN SIPRNet bandwidth sufficiency tied to capacity planning and activation of IP bandwidth to maintain average bandwidth utilization of SIPRNet backbone circuits under 50% during daily peak periods.

The EWSE projects will be measured by the number of technical studies performed with associated systems engineering artifacts (market research reports, technology assessments, solutions analyses, etc.) that are developed to support DODIN capabilities; and the number of proof-of-concept demonstrations or pilots executed to support viability of the technical approach/recommendation. These products will be coordinated with the stakeholders, users and/or Program Management Offices (PMO) to ensure EWSE provides the right deliverables for solution development decisions.  

FY15 actual target (met):  2 technical studies, 7 engineering artifacts, and 2 concept demonstrations.  
FY16 planned target: 2 technical studies, 6 engineering artifacts, and 2 concept demonstrations.  
FY17 planned target: 2 technical studies, 6 engineering artifacts, and 2 concept demonstrations.

The Modeling and Simulation project provides architecture, systems engineering and E2E analytical functions for DISA and its customers, ensuring integrated capabilities to fulfill warfighter mission requirements. Ongoing beneficiaries of these capabilities include DoD Enterprise Activities, the DODIN and DISA applications, as well as engineering capabilities support to programs and projects to address technical and engineering solutions to activities such as information assurance and cyber security; mobility and cloud technologies and warfighter and mission support activities.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The DoD Information Network (DODIN) Systems Engineering and Support project aligns with the updated DISA Strategic Plan, which includes the Chief Technology Officer’s Outlook and a Technology Watchlist.  The Watchlist identifies key technology areas that are essential for Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) including:  Networking, Computing and Storage, Unified Capabilities, Mobility Devices and Applications, Cybersecurity and Network Operations.

The DODIN Systems Engineering and Support Project ensure the technical strategies for the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) are in line with the DoD IT Efficiency strategy and Department of Defense Chief Information Office (DoD CIO) Capabilities Planning Guidance (CPG) for 2017 – 2021 through the Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO).  These strategies will establish the foundation for DISA's technology investments and technical development.  The OCTO leverages technology to drive efficiencies and cost savings to the DoD, the Warfighter, and other Federal Agencies, and provides actionable, decision-oriented information to the Secretary of Defense, Joint Staff, Military Services, Combatant Commands, and other mission partners in satisfying DoD mission objectives.
                                                            
Cyber security and cloud computing present critical near term challenges, especially the ability to securely leverage commercial cloud service offerings.  The OCTO’s partnership with Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) will assess and transition technologically relevant and mature solutions. Included are applications with a security wrapper that detect and mitigate cyberattacks; smart routing and managed reputation capability; embedded system defense capabilities; and resilient and intrusion-tolerant network capabilities. 

Partnerships with industry, academia, and the Federal sectors will produce requisite cyber measures and ensure optimal use of commercial cloud services.  The OCTO will conduct technology assessments, process improvements, as well as the analysis and review of potential technology solutions, products, capabilities and services to ensure consistency with DODIN architecture and standards.  Enabled by the Technology Assessment Framework (TAF) and the DISA Technology Information Repository (DTIR), the OCTO will perform “quick looks” and deeper technology evaluations to provide critical awareness, characterization, and suitability of specific technologies.  These include the assessments of advanced cloud management capabilities; physical containers to enable mobile data center; emerging open source Storage Service APIs and/or abstractions and global standards for storage services; analytic platform performance baselines of emerging commercial analytic platform products; advanced approaches to Continuity of Operations (COOP) in a hybrid cloud environment; and the next generation software defined networks for automating and virtualizing the DODIN.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Market research during the acquisition process includes a review of DISA contracts, other DoD contract vehicles, and other Federal Government agency contracts which are advertised for Government-wide usage.  This market research also includes consideration of small businesses including minority/women owned (8A) businesses, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, mentor/protégé and other specialized contract vehicles and processes. Market research evaluates all contractors available from DISA sources for their ability to deliver the products specifically required for the unique program efforts.  The program works collaboratively with vendors to obtain generic cost data for planning and analysis purposes.  Past and current contract prices for similar work and other government-wide agency contracts provide additional sources of information.  Quotes from multiple sources help provide averages for more realistic cost estimates.  DISA makes a concerted effort to award many of its contracts to small businesses.  Additionally, many of the DISA contracts are awarded with multiple option periods. These have the benefit of fixing labor costs over an extended period and minimizing the administrative costs associated with re-issuing short-term contracts.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

Performance Metrics
Performance is measured by project milestones and the adoption of these technologies into existing Programs of Record (PORs) or as new program offerings to the DoD and intelligence communities. Metrics that will be used include number and percentage of emerging and mature technologies adopted by DISA and DoD, number and percent of technology research and development initiatives and investments in the DoD, peering organizations and industry partners attributable to technology research. These investments and evolution plans identify, promote, channel and align technology research and investments to reduce time to field emerging technologies to satisfy warfighter requirements. See specific metrics below:

Metric: Performance is measured by the number of technologies assessed and the adoption or influence of the technologies assessed on DoD, DISA or IC programs, projects or services. Technologies are identified by many venues to include research and development initiatives, technology watch-lists from various sources (e.g. in-house, peer organizations, industry and/or academic advisors) and commercial product releases that have potential applicability to the warfighter mission area. These measures will allow CTO to align technology research and development with capabilities gaps and needs resulting in improved operational effectiveness and efficiencies.

Measure/Goal: Number of pilot and technology assessments instantiated within the CTO Technical Environment. Number research initiatives designed, developed and demonstrated and transitioned to programs, projects, or services.

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Information Systems Network (DISN) is the Department of Defenses (DoD's) consolidated worldwide telecommunications capability that provides secure, end-to-end information transport for DoD operations.  It also provides the warfighter and the Combatant Commands (COCOMs) with a robust Command, Control, Communications, Computing, and Intelligence infrastructure to support DoD net-centric missions and business requirements.  The Defense Red Switch Network (DRSN) is a DoD Secure Voice, Command and Control Network that is controlled and directed by the Joint Staff and the Office of the Secretary of Defense.  It provides multi-level secure, rapid, ad hoc, voice calling and conferencing capability to the President, Secretary of Defense, Services, COCOMs, subordinate organizations (military and civilian) and coalition allies.  DRSN also supports the Presidential and National Voice Conferencing (PNVC) (formerly known as National Emergency Action Decision Network (NEADN)) and the Enhanced Pentagon Capability/Survivable Emergency Conferencing Network. These funds support three major efforts:

DISN Systems Engineering Support:  This effort includes engineering for Internet Protocol and optical transport capabilities to ensure the essential operations of a robust and secure DISN; refreshing the systems that instrument and automate the operations, administration, maintenance and provisioning functions and creating a single DISN-wide view for network managers and operators; other activities in support of the DRSN communications capabilities.   

PNVC:  The PVNC provides selected system engineering for continued development and testing of the PNVC equipment for senior leaders.  The PNVC system provides a military, satellite-based, survivable, secure, and near toll-quality voice conferencing capability for the President, Secretary of Defense, Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff, and other senior national/military leaders anywhere in the world as needed.  Funding supports the acquisition activities for the PNVC baseband equipment, including critical and essential engineering required to develop new vocoder and cryptographic and audio-summing equipment.   
 
DoD Mobility: The Mobility Program will lead the development of an Enterprise Solution to support Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) and leverage commercial carrier infrastructure to provide entry points for both classified and unclassified wireless capabilities.  Continued evolution and expansion, within the Department, of the DoD Mobility program will allow for increased mobile services in direct support of the warfighter and the COCOMs.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Initial PNVC Engineering Develop Models (EDMs) and DISA funded pre-production units were tested at various facilities by different organizations.  The Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC) in Ft. Huachuca, AZ secure voice test facility was used to test the audio baseband equipment with the DRSN Switch, and also to test the baseband kits. An Air Force Satellite Communications (SATCOM) testing facility in Colorado Springs, CO was used for air testing. NSA conducted testing of the BIG for cryptologic functions, and testing was completed at JITC in Ft. Huachuca, AZ for interoperability with the rest of the baseband audio equipment.</r2:Text>

The increase of $10.454 from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to development of airborne variants of the PNVC baseband equipment for Air Force and Navy platforms.  New versions of the Multi-stream Summing Device and the Baseband Interface Group are being developed to meet airborne environmental requirements.</r2:Text>

The decrease of -$19.558 from FY 2016 to FY 2017 is primarily attributed to the one time increase in FY 2016 to complete the airborne variants of the PNVC baseband equipment. The original environmental requirements for the PNVC baseband equipment were changed in FY14 and the original designs were deemed suitable only for ground locations. This necessitated the creation of airborne variants of the baseband equipment to meet the more stringent aircraft requirements of the E-4B and E-6B platforms. The funding for the Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) to develop the airborne versions came in two increments: an FY15 reprogramming and in FY16 to complete the development.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>PNVC project metrics track the development status of program acquisition documents, as required by the component executive. These documents include:  Project Execution Plan, Concept of Operations Acquisition Strategy, Capability Production Document, System Engineering Plan and other documents required by the DISA’s Component Acquisition Executive.  Additionally, for management and system engineering support vendors, monthly reports are critical to tracking overall programmatic and engineering progress and the percent of total deliverables received on time.

For product development activities, effective progress is measured based upon the task order milestones in the form of development reviews and weekly progress meetings.  As end items (hardware and software) become available for test, additional measures will be available.  Specifically, the percentage of successfully verified requirements out of the number tested and the number of critical trouble reports outstanding longer than six months, will be tracked.

Internet Protocol (IP) and Optical Transport Technology Refresh:  Provides engineering technical expertise to support and integrate newer, more efficient technologies required to replace end of lifecycle equipment and to achieve more efficient IP and optical technologies.  These new technologies provide protected and assured services for mobility and critical support to the warfighter as well as other DoD and federal customers.

Element Management System (EMS):  Provides operational and network operating systems that instrument and automate the operations, administration, maintenance and provisioning functions creating a single DISN-wide view for network managers and operators.  EMS is a component of the DISN Operational Support Systems (OSS).

Peripheral and Component Design (Secure Voice Switches):  This equipment satisfies unique military requirements for multi-level security (i.e., extensive conferencing/conference management capabilities and features, and gateway functions) that are not available in commercial products.  

DoD Mobility: The Mobility Program will lead the development of an Enterprise Solution to support Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) and leverage commercial carrier infrastructure to provide entry points for both classified and unclassified wireless capabilities.  Continued evolution and expansion, within the Department, of the DoD Mobility program will allow for increased mobile services in direct support of the warfighter and the COCOMs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Minimum Essential Emergency Communications Network (MEECN) provides the Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3) Engineer with plans and procedures, systems analysis, operational assessments, systems engineering, and development of concepts of operation and architectures. The NC3 System provides connectivity from the President and the Secretary of Defense through the National Military Command System to nuclear execution forces integral to fighting a “homeland-to-homeland,” as well as theater nuclear war. MEECN includes the Emergency Action Message dissemination systems and those systems used for integrated Tactical Warning/Attack Assessment, presidential decision-making conferencing, force report back, re-targeting, force management, and requests for permission to use nuclear weapons. Efforts assure positive control of nuclear forces and connectivity between the Secretary of Defense, military forces, and an informed decision-making linkage between the President, the Secretary of Defense, and the Combatant Commands. MEECN ensures our national leadership has proper command and control of our forces during times of national emergency, up to and including nuclear war.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

It also provides NC3 expertise to the Department of Defense (DoD) Chief Information Officer (CIO) National Leadership Command Capability (NLCC) Management Office. Systems Analysis supports long range planning and vulnerability assessments to ensure the NC3 System is adequate under all conditions of stress or war and recommends investment strategies to evolve the Nuclear Command and Control System to achieve desired capabilities. Operational Assessments of fielded systems and weapon platforms provide the sole means for verification of NC3 systems’ performance in support of plans and procedures, operation orders, training, equipment, and end-to-end system configuration. Assessments provide strategic and theater level C3 interfaces into the NC3 System. Supporting efforts assure positive control of nuclear forces and connectivity between the Secretary of Defense and strategic and theater forces. Systems Engineering provides the Senior Leadership C3 System with technical and management advice, planning and engineering support, and Test &amp; Evaluation. Leading Edge Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence technology is assessed for all communication platforms supporting executive travelers and senior leaders to include the interoperability of hardware and operational procedures. These technology elements support the President's and other DoD command centers and aircraft (e.g., Air Force One and the National Airborne Operations Center).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Performance is measured by compliance with contract deliverables schedules for specifically included products, such as: operational assessment plans, operational reports; revisions to the Joint Staff’s Emergency Action Procedures (EAP-CJCS) Volumes VI and VII; NC3 System Description documents, and Nuclear C3 Architecture Diagrams. In addition, performance of the Nuclear C3 System is directly measured by the operational assessments funded by this program element. These periodic assessments evaluate the connectivity used for the five functions of Nuclear command and control: Situation Monitoring, Planning, Decision Making, Force Execution, and Force Management. Assessment results are used by the Joint Staff to direct changes in system engineering and integration, programmatic execution, and training.

Specific performance metrics include the following:

Provide engineering products in all task areas that satisfy DoD/CIO and Joint Staff needs within allocated resources 90% of the time.

Conduct assessments of the NC3 system and the SLC3S that provide actionable results and recommendations for the Joint Staff and DoD/CIO to pursue improvements to these capabilities 90% of the time.

MEECN achieved all its FY 2015 performance metrics and is on track to achieve the FY 2016 and FY 2017 targets of provisioning the Joint Staff requirements within the allocated resources 90% of the time.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Global Command and Control System-Joint (GCCS-J) funds a Joint Command and Control (JC2) portfolio which includes: GCCS-J, Joint Planning and Execution Services (JPES), and JC2 Architecture.

The GCCS-J Program is the Department of Defense (DoD) Joint C2 system of record.  It incorporates core planning and assessment tools required by Combatant Commanders and their subordinate Joint Task Force Commanders while meeting the readiness support requirements of the Services.  GCCS-J is used by all nine Combatant Commands (COCOMs) at sites around the world, supporting joint and coalition operations. The Services rely heavily on GCCS-J components to reduce their command and control (C2) operational costs. It provides support for commanders and staffs as they conduct joint and multinational operations by providing a fused picture of the battle space within an integrated system that is supporting joint warfighter needs today.  GCCS-J is currently focused on sustainment, synchronization, and modernization to meet emerging operational needs by modifying and enhancing elements or capabilities in order to implement new requirements, enhance functionality, increase efficiency and lower operating and deployment costs while taking advantage of the progress made by current operational systems and technologies.  The GCCS-J program is also executing incremental modernization of C2 capabilities using the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) approved needs.

JPES is a portfolio of capabilities supporting joint policies, processes, procedures, and reporting structures. It is supported by communications and information technology used by the Joint Planning and Execution Community (JPEC).  JPEC uses these capabilities to monitor the following activities: planning, execute mobilization, deployment, employment and sustainment, redeployment, and demobilization.   At full maturity, the JPES capabilities will be integrated with other adaptive planning and execution systems to facilitate the rapid development and sustainment of plans and a seamless, dynamic transition to execution in a net-centric environment. One of the key capabilities residing within the JPES portfolio of sustaining the existing Joint Operational Planning and Execution System (JOPES) while modernization of JOPES is planned and implemented.  The JPES portfolio also includes a core set of infrastructure services consisting of  the JPES Framework (JFW) and a variety of mission applications to include Joint Force Projection (JFP), Joint Capabilities Requirements Manager (JCRM) and eventually the capabilities that will replace JOPES.

JC2 Architecture is a reference architecture that aligns closely to the DoD Information Enterprise Architecture.  The JC2 Architecture describes architectural and operational concepts, technical constructs, and is a repository for valuable reference information relating to C2 standards and information security.  It is the authoritative source of information and technical direction for the JC2 arena.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Global Command and Control System – Joint (GCCS-J) is DoD’s Joint Command and Control (JC2) system of record and provides the foundation for migration of service-unique C2 systems into a Joint, interoperable environment. The Defense Information System Agency’s (DISAs) portfolio includes funding to support GCCS-J, Joint Planning and Execution Services (JPES), and the development and sustainment of the JC2 Architecture.  GCCS-J incorporates the core planning and assessment tools required by combatant commanders and their subordinate Joint Task Force Commanders while meeting the readiness support requirements of the Services.  Adaptive Planning and Execution Joint Planning Services are being developed to modernize the adaptive planning functions in a net centric environment.  DISA continues to provide support for the operational system to ensure continued access to information integration and decision-support capabilities that enable the exercise of authority and direction over assigned and attached forces, in a net-centric, collaborative information environment.  Additionally, DISA provides critical C2 capabilities to the Commander-in-Chief, Secretary of Defense, National Military Command Center, Combatant Commands (COCOMs), Joint Force Commanders, and Service Component Commanders.  

JPES is a set of capabilities that address components of the DOD’s Adaptive Planning Roadmap (13 December 2005) and Adaptive Planning Roadmap II (5 March 2008).  JPES produces enhancements to the Joint Operations Planning and Execution System (JOPES), focused adaptive planning capabilities, and provides a set of core infrastructure services necessary to provide the warfighter a fully interoperable environment where functionality can be easily added as mission needs dictate.

The JC2 Architecture is a foundational element of JC2 capabilities for the Department.  The JC2 Architecture provides a set of net-centric tenets associated with data, functional service and the C2 infrastructure that describes architectural and operational concepts, technical constructs, and is a repository for valuable reference information relating to C2 standards and information security.  Each year, the DISA architecture team, annually, produces a transitional architecture that documents the current state of C2 capabilities, anticipated changes/enhancements either in progress or planned by the JC2 community.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The databases are the prime sources of information for DoD use of the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum. The JSC provides technical measurement and analysis in support of DoD spectrum policy decisions to ensure the development, acquisition, and operational deployment of systems are compatible with other spectrum dependent systems operating within the same EM environment (EME). Additional efforts focus on improving future warfighter EM spectrum utilization through technological innovation, and influencing research and development emerging technology efforts.
 
Improved spectrum support includes the Global Electromagnetic Spectrum Information System (GEMSIS), a net centric capability that will provide commanders with an increased common picture of spectrum situational awareness of friendly and hostile forces while transparently deconflicting competing mission requirements for spectrum use. This capability will enable the transformation from the current preplanned and static assignment strategy into autonomous and adaptive spectrum operations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>DSO has the responsibility to investigate emerging spectrum related technologies and evaluate their applicability to improve future warfighter EM spectrum utilization through technological innovation. The goal of the EST program is to identify the opportunities and risks associated with emerging spectrum-related technologies in the early stages of the technology development, influence and lead technology development in order to maximize DoD spectrum utilization, and ensure that spectrum policies incorporate optimal technology to meet DoD mission requirements. Within EST there is an increased focus on Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA). DSA is realized through wireless networking architectures and technologies that enable wireless devices to dynamically adapt their spectrum access according to criteria such as policy constraints, spectrum availability, propagation environment, and application performance requirements.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Program Executive Office Enterprise Services (PEO-ES) provides a portfolio of enterprise level services that enable communities of interest and mission applications to make their data and services visible, accessible, and understandable to other anticipated and unanticipated users. The continually expanding portfolio of enterprise services supports 100 percent of the active duty military and Government civilians; 258 thousand embedded contract personnel; 75 percent of the active Guard and Reserve; and 25 percent of the Guard and Reserve users. This meets the Department’s requirement to support 2.5 million users on the Sensitive but Unclassified (SBU) Internet Protocol (IP) Data network and 300 thousand users on the Secret IP Data network. The portfolio of services continues to expand through the transition of local services to the Department of Defense (DoD) enterprise and providing enhanced functionality that allows DoD personnel to go anywhere within the DoD, login, and be productive, the implementation of an access control infrastructure that enables secure information sharing throughout the DoD, and the integration of pre-planned product improvements to existing enterprise services keeping them relevant to the end-users’ missions.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Program Executive Office Enterprise Services (PEO-ES) continues to expand their portfolio of services that currently includes the core capabilities delivered by the Net-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES) Program, with a resilient and flexible access control infrastructure that enables strong authentication for secure information sharing in the Department of Defense (DoD), and the identification, transitioning, and operationalization of local services into the larger DoD enterprise. Critical warfighter, Business, and Intelligence Mission Area services within the portfolio include an enterprise collaboration capability supporting over 900,000 DoD users, Enterprise Search that exposes data sources throughout the DoD, Service Oriented Architecture Foundation supporting a robust Enterprise Messaging service that provides producers the ability to publish one message that, in turn, can be distributed to hundreds of end-points supporting the subscribers to that information and a critical enterprise authoritative data source service that supports the user’s need to identify and use authoritative data and services. The portfolio also includes the Strategic Knowledge Integration Web (SKIWeb) providing decision and event management support to all levels of a widespread user-base that ranges from the Combatant Commanders to the Joint Staff to Coalition partners on the Secret Internet Protocol (IP) Data network; DoD Visitor that allows personnel to “go anywhere within the DoD, login, and be productive;” the DoD Enterprise Portal Service that provides users with a flexible web-based hosting solution to create and manage mission, community, organization, and user focused sites; and privilege management Authentication Gateway Services (AGS) that is integrated with the Identity and Access Management services supporting brokered Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) authentication for DoD applications without a native PKI authentication capability. The individual suite of capabilities within the portfolio of services provides the user with the flexibility to couple the services in varying ways to support their mission needs. This flexibility provides unprecedented access to web and application content, critical imagery, intelligence and warfighter information, and temporarily stores critical data in a secure environment. The portfolio of enterprise services delivers tangible benefits to the Department by providing capabilities that are applied by US Forces, Coalition forces, and Allied forces to support full spectrum joint and expeditionary campaign operations. These enabling benefits include the ability to:
•	Enhance collaborative decision-making processes
•	Improve information sharing and integrated situational awareness
•	Share and exchange knowledge and services between enterprise units and commands
•	Share and exchange information between previously unreachable and unconnected sources
•	Schedule and coordinate meetings with people across the DoD Components
•	“Go anywhere in the DoD, login, and be productive”
•	Create and manage mission, community, organization, and user-focused sites from global locations
•	Exchange knowledge to enable situational awareness, determine the effects desired, select a course of action, the forces to execute it, and accurately assess the effects of that action
The portfolio contains capabilities that are also key enablers to the Defense Information Systems Agency’s (DISA) mission of providing a global net-centric Enterprise infrastructure in direct support of joint Warfighter, National level leaders, and other mission and Coalition partners across the full spectrum of operations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The portfolio of services is leveraging portions of the acquisition approach approved for the NCES Program. Based on the approved NCES acquisition strategy, the portfolio will adopt proven specifications, best practices, and interface definitions to adopt or buy new network-based services or applications that are delivered, hosted, and managed in accordance with Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and that ensure available, reliable, and survivable services to support the warfighter’s mission.
The portfolio is using a streamlined acquisition approach to ensure that the required acquisitions contain only those requirements that are essential to meet the warfighter mission and that they can be acquired in a cost effective and time constrained manner that meets the defined mission need. This strategy will enable the rapid fielding of low to moderate risk capabilities to meet end-user operational needs through an agile requirements collection and engineering process that supports the acquisition, testing, and fielding of needed requirements in minimum time. The benefits provided by this acquisition approach include:
•	Satisfy time-urgent needs of the warfighter or theater commander
•	Provide early and continual involvement of the user
•	Evaluate the portfolio to determine optimum funding approach to rapidly deploy urgently needed services within the funding profile
•	Effective control processes that lower cost and maintains schedule
•	Provide multiple, rapidly executed increments or releases of capability
•	Early dialogue between the requirements and acquisition communities to expedite technical, programmatic, and financial solutions
•	Enable “insight” not “oversight” to identify and resolve problems early and ensure both the acquisition process and deployed service meets 
                     performance goals
•	Enable agility in selecting modular, open-systems approach
This business strategy will strike a balance between ensuring accountability using acquisition best practices and deploying urgently needed services to the warfighter on a schedule that will support their mission requirements. The goal is to facilitate the DoD enterprise cloud vision where users and Programs of Record easily access enterprise services from maritime, airborne, and land-based locations worldwide through a federation of core data centers. The user community will guide how the portfolio of services must evolve to remain relevant to the Warfighter, Business, and Intelligence Mission Area mission requirements. By partnering with the DoD Components and Mission Areas, the Defense Information Systems Agency will rapidly deliver functionality and capability at the lowest possible cost and risk in the shortest possible timeframe.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

Net-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES) uses continuous monitoring to ensure the delivered and managed portfolio of services meets the mission needs of the stakeholders, are delivered, improved, and sustained in a cost effective manner and continues to add functionality that keeps the capability relevant to the missions supported, and is responsive to evolving mission requirements.

Activity:
•  Requirements Satisfaction

Continue to expand, modernize, and enhance the portfolio of enterprise services to ensure the functionality is kept current with warfighter needs, evolving technologies, and DoD policy. Delivery of modernized services and integration of new technologies are fully tested and delivered in a timely fashion to meet mission needs.

Expected Outcome:

FY2015 (Actual): Completed the transition to the replacement Defense Enterprise Collaboration service and support any development and testing required to transition the users from the existing service to the replacement service.
FY2016 (Estimated): Identify mission needs and candidate local services that cross Service and Combatant Command boundaries for their potential to transition into the enterprise infrastructure and the expanding portfolio.
FY17: N/A

Activity:
•  Portfolio Evolution

Support the transition and integration of new and existing enterprise services and evolving technologies. Provide continuing analysis of industry standards and specifications for enhancements and added functionality to existing operational enterprise services to keep them current with evolving technologies and establish the strategic vision of enterprise services to ensure they evolve to support the user's missions.

Expected Outcome:

FY2015 (Actual): Identified, researched, and developed additional functionality for the replacement Defense Enterprise Collaboration service to ensure it stays relevant to the end-users mission needs.
FY2016 (Estimated): Evaluate Service-centric applications and technologies transitioning into the Joint Information Environment to identify candidates to “jump start” as potential enterprise services that can support other Services with similar mission needs.
FY17: N/A

Activity:
•  Enterprise Service Availability
 
Operational testing of modernized services or updated technologies into existing services validate that the validated customer requirement of ≥ .997 availability/reliability is sustained. Operational availability/reliability requirement is met to ensure the modernized service or technologies updates supports the customer perspective of value to mission effectiveness and relevancy to evolving mission needs.

Expected Outcome:

FY2015 (Actual): Operational requirement was met by all enterprise services that, in turn, supported the customer perspective that the services support mission effectiveness and is relevant to evolving mission needs.
FY2016 (Estimated): Operational requirement met by all enterprise services that, in turn, will support the customer perspective that the services support mission effectiveness and is relevant to evolving mission needs.

The management areas are designed to ensure that problems can be identified rapidly for resolution, while providing maximum support to the warfighters’ mission. The metrics associated with these management areas provide quantitative data to show that the portfolio of enterprise services are secure, interoperable, and responsive
to current and future warfighter missions in a cost-effective manner. The management areas and metrics will be used to continuously evaluate the value of services to the Warfighter. They will be used to determine the right time to scale and update services to keep them relevant to the warfighter’s mission. Also, when necessary, they provide the necessary artifacts to make decisions to continue, shutdown, or place in caretaker status capabilities that are not performing as expected or where the user demand has slipped or never grew to the level of keeping the service cost effective.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Joint Information Environment (JIE) construct is a consolidated secure and defensible environment across DoD.  This is comprised of unified, consolidated and shared information technology (IT) infrastructure, enterprise services, and standardized security architectures throughout the Department of Defense Information Network (DODIN) to achieve full spectrum superiority, improve mission effectiveness, increase security and realize IT efficiencies.  

The target objective state of JIE is a DODIN that optimizes the use of DoD's IT assets from the administrative and operational planning at the Pentagon to the tactical edge; to include our mission partners through converging communications, computing, enterprise services, and defense of the DODIN that can be leveraged for all Department missions. 

When implemented, JIE will reduce DoD's Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), improved security by reducing the attack surface of our networks, and enable Combatant Commands/Services/Agencies (CC/S/A) to more efficiently access information to perform their missions from any authorized IT device, any time, from anywhere in the world.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Joint Regional Security Stack (JRSS) is a joint DoD security architecture deployed regionally throughout the world. Each of the 23 NIPR and 25 SIPR stacks is comprised of complementary defensive security solutions that remove redundant Information Assurance (IA) protections; leverages enterprise defensive capabilities with standardized security suites; protects the enclaves after the separation of server and user assets; and provides the tool sets necessary to monitor and control all security mechanisms throughout DoD's Joint Information Environment.  The JRSS Management System (JMS) is the management and operational control suite/capability for the JRSS. While the JMS is treated as a related effort, it requires its own experience and evaluation strategy as the JMS is a selection of best of breed capabilities. The JMS is a system-of-systems designed to centralize and enhance the management of the JRSS components and achieve economies of scale by using DoD common suites/infrastructure.  The savings are realized by coupling the JRSS and JMS. The JRSS collapses replicated IT security functionality for all Department of Defense (DoD) components into relatively few regionally located stacks.  The JMS provides Centralized Network Management of the JRSS with a standard interoperable set of capabilities across DoD.  JMS provides visibility and control over network transport and associated security systems.  It enables monitoring and analysis of relevant fault and performance data to determine the impact on current operations and trend analysis.  This centralized capability allows standardization of policies, procedures and configurations of critical network transport assets. The JMS enables DoD Components to maintain Title 10 required management and visibility of their IT security while providing high level visibility to CYBERCOM.

                                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>The Joint Regional Security Stack (JRSS) is a joint DoD security architecture deployed regionally throughout the world.

The JRSS Management System (JMS) is the management and operational control suite/capability for the JRSS. While the JMS is treated as a related effort, it requires its own experience and evaluation strategy as the JMS is a selection of best of breed capabilities. The JMS is a system-of-systems designed to centralize and enhance the management of the JRSS components and achieve economies of scale by using DoD common suites/infrastructure.  The JMS provides Centralized Network Management of the JRSS with a standard interoperable set of capabilities across DoD.  JMS provides visibility and control over network transport and associated security systems.  It enables monitoring and analysis of relevant fault and performance data to determine the impact on current operations and trend analysis.  This centralized capability allows standardization of policies, procedures and configurations of critical network transport assets. The JMS enables DoD Components to maintain Title 10 required management and visibility of their IT security while providing high level visibility to CYBERCOM. Cyber Operations can take proactive actions to ensure the uninterrupted availability and protection of system and network information.

FY 2015 (Actual): N/A

FY 2016 (Estimated): N/A

FY 2017 (Estimated): 100% successful testing of new pre-production capabilities for Full Packet Capture analytics (e.g. ArcSight and Splunk log); JMS 1.5 data orchestrator aggregation; and JRSS 1.5 active stack capabilities through the Joint Interoperability Test Command.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Department of Defense (DoD) Teleport system is a satellite communications (SATCOM) gateway that links the deployed warfighter to the Global Information Grid.  The DoD Teleport program has fielded system capabilities incrementally using a multi-generational approach with Generation 1 and 2 Full Deployment authorized by DoD Chief Information Officer on February 18, 2011. DoD Teleport Generation 3 consists of three phases; Phases 1 and 2 are in Production and Deployment while Phase 3 is in Engineering and Manufacturing Development. Each DoD Teleport investment increases the warfighter’s ability to communicate with a world-wide, net-centric set of information capabilities, which is vital for the DoD to maintain a persistent presence among its adversaries.

Currently, the Teleport system operates as an upgrade of SATCOM capabilities at selected DoD SATCOM gateways. This system provides deployed warfighters with seamless worldwide multi-band SATCOM connectivity to the Defense Information System Network (DISN) Service Delivery Nodes and legacy tactical command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence systems. It also provides centralized integration capabilities, contingency capacity, and common interfaces to access the DISN.

DoD Teleport's goal is to provide secure, seamless, interoperable, and economical upgrades to DoD SATCOM Gateways and meet the growing throughput requirements of the deployed warfighter.

The primary beneficiaries of the DoD Teleport investment are the DoD Combatant Commanders, Military Departments, Defense Agencies, and the warfighter. DoD Teleport Generation 3 is designed to meet the growing demands of the warfighter through the execution of the following phases:

Phase 1: Gateway Advanced Extremely High Frequency [Extended Data Rate] terminals provides tactical users with a 350% bandwidth increase in survivable, antijam communications through all peacetime and combat operations by installing Navy Multiband Terminals (NMT) at select Teleport sites. In addition to enhanced throughput, the NMT maintains compatibility with legacy waveforms and current tactical terminals.

Phase 2: Gateway Wideband Global SATCOM X/Ka-band terminals provide enhanced Wideband Global System (WGS) X/Ka capability to warfighters worldwide by installing terminals from the Modernization of Enterprise Terminal (MET) program at DoD Teleport and other gateway sites. This gateway enhancement allows Teleport to replace end-of-life Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS) terminals while remaining interoperable with tactical WGS X/Ka-band users. The MET enhancement provides a 300% Ka-band capacity increase and an 1100% X-band capacity increase to current enterprise terminal X/Ka capabilities. Additionally, it enables the DoD Teleport system to maintain operational availability consistent with Generation 2 requirements and reduce the overall life-cycle cost of X/Ka capabilities across the DoD.

Phase 3: Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) to Legacy Ultra High Frequency (UHF) systems interoperability will provide interoperability between MUOS users and legacy UHF users by installing MUOS-to-Legacy UHF SATCOM Gateway Component (MLGC) suites of equipment at DoD Teleport sites. MUOS is the next generation DoD UHF SATCOM system that will provide the warfighter with modern worldwide mobile communication services, utilizing the Wideband Code Division Multiple Access waveform for use in the military UHF SATCOM band. MLGC suites will provide critical continuity and interoperability as DoD tactical satellite users transition from legacy waveforms and radios to the Joint Tactical Radio System.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The three TPO procuring agencies, Program Manager Defense Communications and Army Transmission Systems, the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command, and Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) provide direct contracting support. Assistance from other Departments including Army, Navy, and Air Force is acquired via Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request for both organic and contracted support. The TPO maximizes the use of performance-based contracts and requires contractors to establish and manage specific earned value data to mitigate risk and monitor deviations from cost, schedule, and performance objectives. Performance is evaluated thorough post-award contract reviews, performance assessment during quarterly program reviews. The MLGC program will use various contract types to employ the vendor best suited to deliver the program’s capabilities to the warfighter.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Teleport Cost and Schedule Performance Metrics:

Teleport manages and tracks its cost and schedule performance parameters using a tailored Earned Value Management System (EVMS) process, integrating the program plan, the program schedule, Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and financial data. Progress is monitored/documented monthly showing percentages complete for schedule and cost. Formal updates with changes to the schedule are documented against the program baseline.

Teleport Program Metrics:

RDT&amp;E funds will be used to maintain an interoperability certification of the fielded DoD Teleport system in light of required/desired system changes. These changes are certified in standalone test events or as part of DoD Interoperability Communications Exercises (DICE). Percentage will be computed by dividing the number of changes under test by the number deemed DoD Interoperable.

Performance metrics have been established in four measurement areas: 1) customer results, 2) mission and business results, 3) processes and activities, and 4) technology. Specific measurement indicators and units of measure vary by measurement area, and metrics in each of the aforementioned areas are measured annually. Teleport will use the same measurement areas for performance metrics in FY 2015, FY 2016 and FY 2017.

The three TPO procuring agencies, Program Manager Defense Communications and Army Transmission Systems, the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command, and Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) provide direct contracting support. Assistance from other Departments including Army, Navy, and Air Force is acquired via Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request for both organic and contracted support. The TPO maximizes the use of performance-based contracts and requires contractors to establish and manage specific earned value data to mitigate risk and monitor deviations from cost, schedule, and performance objectives. Performance is evaluated thorough post-award contract reviews, performance assessment during quarterly program reviews.

Teleport manages and tracks its cost and schedule performance parameters using a tailored Earned Value Management System (EVMS) process, integrating the program plan, the program schedule, Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and financial data. Progress is monitored/documented monthly showing percentages complete for schedule and cost. Formal updates with changes to the schedule are documented against the program baseline.

Generation 3 Program Metrics:

RDT&amp;E funds will be used to perform acquisition testing.

Across appropriations, performance metrics have been established in four measurement areas: 1) customer results, 2) mission and business results, 3) processes and activities, and 4) technology. Specific measurement indicators and units of measure vary by measurement area, and metrics in each of the aforementioned areas are measured annually. Teleport will use the same measurement areas for performance metrics in FY 2015, FY 2016 and FY 2017.

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC) coordinates with the Military Services and Defense Intelligence Agencies to conduct Joint/Distributed Common Ground/Surface System (DCGS) testing and analysis, including event coordination, configuration, instrumentation and integration functions on the Distributed Development and Test Enterprise (DDTE).  Under the DCGS Governance, this effort, referred to as the DCGS Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) Focus Team (FT), is composed of three parts:  the DDTE Focus Group, providing and sustaining a distributed development network; the Strategy Focus Group, looking at current and future net-enabled enterprise T&amp;E methods; and the Execution Focus Group, which leverages the Strategy Focus Group’s methodologies in executing DCGS Enterprise assessment events, such as the annual DCGS demonstration, ENTERPRISE CHALLENGE.  These efforts improve systems engineering and T&amp;E throughout all phases of the DCGS life-cycle, resulting in improved capabilities to share net-centric data and services between the DCGS Programs of Record (PoRs) and the overarching Defense Intelligence Information Enterprise (DI2E).

Operates and maintains the DDTE, providing DCGS PoRs a virtual, operationally-relevant assessment environment maintaining connectivity between Service facilities, National Agency capabilities, and Coalition partners.  DDTE allows robust integration of modeling and simulation T&amp;E capabilities across Joint DCGS events without introducing vulnerabilities to operational Command and Control networks and has enabled improvements in systems engineering, instrumentation and T&amp;E throughout all phases of the DCGS life cycle. 

DCGS PoRs and Coalition partners use the DDTE network, which supports the net-centric maturity assessment of the DCGS Enterprise under the DCGS Governance, to integrate architecture, standards, and capabilities for implementation of the DCGS Integration Backbone and support the migration to net-centricity, including DCGS Enterprise services for the Military Departments, DCGS-Special Operations Forces and the DCGS Intelligence Community.  National Agency capabilities supporting DCGS include Geospatial Intelligence, Signals Intelligence, Measurement and Signature Intelligence and Human Intelligence, which are integrated and tested in the DDTE domain.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The T&amp;E FT also leverages Joint Interoperability Certification testing to support the evaluation of DCGS Enterprise maturity. In FY 2015, T&amp;E FT performed ten (10) DCGS Enterprise assessments, of the six DCGS PoR systems, three hold current Joint Staff (JS), Command, Control, Communications, &amp; Computers/Cyber (J6) Interoperability (IOP) Certifications and continue to conduct IOP testing on emerging releases. One DCGS PoR has completed interoperability testing, and the joint IOP certification is pending. The remaining two PoRs are not required to be JS J6 certified, but the T&amp;E FT leverages data collected during periodic IOP assessments of these programs during enterprise-level demonstrations and test events. Due to increased automation for data collection, parsing and analysis, in addition to advances in PoR and Enterprise maturity, the T&amp;E FT increases the cumulative number of net-centric capability evaluations each year. 

In FY 2016, T&amp;E FT will perform a minimum of ten (10) DCGS Enterprise assessments. This trend is expected to continue in FY2017. This effort provides the basis for the DCGS Enterprise Assessment, allowing the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) to measure the level of maturity of the DCGS Enterprise supported by the DCGS Governance across DoD.

In FY 2017, T&amp;E FT will perform a minimum of ten (10) DCGS Enterprise assessments.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>
