                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Projects 090/DX8. The M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) is a full spectrum, combat proven, all weather, 24/7 lethal and responsive, precision strike weapon system that fully supports more deployable, affordable and lethal, Brigade Combat Teams (BCT), Fires Brigades, Modular Forces, and Joint Expeditionary Forces.  The HIMARS launcher is a C-130 transportable, wheeled, indirect fire, rocket/missile launcher capable of firing all rockets and missiles in the current and future Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) Family of Munitions (MFOM) and Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) Family of Munitions (AFOM) engaging targets with precision out to ranges of 300 kilometers. HIMARS satisfies the Army's digitization requirements by interfacing with the Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) fire support command and control system. The HIMARS product improvement program provides funding for research, development test, and integration efforts necessary for incorporation of advanced automotive, armor, armament, life cycle enhancements, system hardware and software technologies, including Common Operating Environment (COE) and Network Integrated Evaluation (NIE), obsolescence mitigation, reliability improvements and decreasing the logistics footprint.  This effort includes performing technical assessments, concept studies, and risk reduction efforts for incorporation of future requirements.  The HIMARS product improvement program maintains compliance with Intra-Army Interoperability and Digital Communications.  HIMARS was deployed to Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and is still supporting Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) with great success by both US Army and Marine Corps units.

Project 093. MLRS is a full spectrum, combat proven, all weather, 24/7 lethal and responsive, Precision Strike weapon system that is organic/assigned to Fires Brigades supporting BCT.  The MLRS launcher provides critical missile precision strike, operational shaping fires, counterfire, and close support destructive and suppressive fires.  The launcher is complimented by the MFOM to include the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS), engaging targets up to 60 kilometers (km).  AFOM munitions are capable of engaging targets up to a range of 300 km.  The MLRS product improvement program provides funding for research, development, test and integration efforts necessary for incorporation of advanced automotive, armament and system hardware and software technologies, including COE and NIE, obsolesence mitigation, reliability improvements, and decreasing the logistics footprint.  This effort includes performing technical assessments, concept studies, and risk reduction efforts for incorporation of future requirements.  The MLRS product improvement program maintains compliance with intra-army interoperability and digital communications via joint variable message format. 

Projects 784/78G.  Beginning in FY2015, GMLRS will have its own separate Program Element, 0205778A, to include Projects EG2 (GMLRS Alternative Warhead) and EG3 (Guided MLRS), previously under Program Element 0603778A Project Codes 78G and 784, respectively.  GMLRS rockets are surface-to-surface artillery rockets fired from the MLRS and HIMARS launchers.  GMLRS rockets provide 24/7, all-weather precision fires to engage both area and point targets at short, medium, and long ranges.  

The GMLRS Program consists of three separate increments: GMLRS Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munition (DPICM) cluster munition to engage area or imprecisely located targets; GMLRS Unitary utilizes a 200 lb high explosive warhead to engage point targets with limited collateral damage; and GMLRS Alternative Warhead (AW) is being developed as a non-cluster munition to replace GMLRS DPICM.  GMLRS DPICM Production was terminated in response to the June 2008 Department of Defense (DoD) Cluster Munitions Policy.  GMLRS Unitary is currently in full rate production.  GMLRS AW is currently in the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase and scheduled to enter full rate production in FY2015.  The GMLRS AW rocket is 90% common with the Unitary variant.

Project DZ8. The Army G-3/5/7 has directed that GMLRS Increment 4 change its name to Long Range Precision Fires (LRPF) to better reflect the solution as an Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) replacement versus a follow-on increment to the GMLRS program.  LRPF is being developed as a non-cluster munition to provide Joint Force Command with a 24/7 all weather long-range fires capability without placing aircraft and crews at risk.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The MLRS product improvement program conducts concept studies to support obsolescence mitigation, automotive updates, and hardware/software enhancements.  Development efforts underway include Enhanced C2 and efforts supporting interoperability certifications, information assurance compliance, IAC, and mitigating obsolescence of the Fire Control System through the FCS-U effort.  The IAC effort enhances the level of crew protection. A contract was awarded following a competitive bid process (full and open competition) to ensure best value for the government.   Seven prototype cabs have been delivered with integration of cab to launcher ongoing; testing will be completed in FY15.  The FCS-U is driven by the need to mitigate obsolete electronic components that are being sustained through life of type purchases.

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Project 784 is intended to support, investigate, and develop alternative material changes to improve the GMLRS family of munitions as they are identified by the material developer or combat developer.  This project also supports IM activities to improve the overall posture of the system all the way down to component level.  Future initiatives include a missile modernization program to extend the shelf life of the GMLRS rocket.  

Beginning in FY2015, GMLRS will have its own separate Program Element, 0205778A, to include Projects EG2 (GMLRS Alternative Warhead) and EG3 (Guided MLRS), previously under Program Element 0603778A Project Codes 78G and 784, respectively.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>Beginning in FY2015, Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) will have its own separate Program Element, 0205778A, to include Projects EG2 (GMLRS Alternative Warhead) and EG3 (Guided MLRS), previously under Program Element 0603778A Project Codes 78G and 784, respectively.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The United States (U.S.) Army is funding the development of the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) Alternative Warhead (AW) increment under the 78G-GMLRS AW project code.  GMLRS AW is being developed as a non-cluster munition to replace GMLRS Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munitions (DPICM) and service the same area and imprecisely-located targets.  GMLRS DPICM Production was terminated in response to the June 2008 Department of Defense (DoD) Cluster Munitions Policy.

The GMLRS AW increment completed Milestone B (MS B) on February 19, 2012 and is currently in the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase.  The three-year EMD contract was awarded on March 30, 2012.  Funding was requested in FY2013 for the second year of the EMD contract and for other government and contracted EMD activities to include engineering developmental testing and the Critical Design Review (CDR).  GMLRS AW is scheduled for a combined Milestone C (MS C) and Full Rate Production (FRP) Decision in FY2015 and Initial Operational Capability (IOC) in FY2016.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) is a full spectrum, combat proven, all weather, 24/7 lethal and responsive, precision strike weapon system that fully supports more deployable, affordable and lethal, Brigade Combat Teams, Fires Brigades, Modular Forces, and Joint Expeditionary Forces.  The HIMARS launcher is a C-130 transportable, wheeled, indirect fire, rocket/missile launcher capable of firing all rockets and missiles in the current and future Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) Family of Munitions (MFOM) and Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) Family of Munitions (AFOM) engaging targets with precision out to ranges of 300 kilometers.  HIMARS satisfies the Army's digitization requirements by interfacing with the Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) fire support command and control system.  The HIMARS product improvement program provides funding for research, development, test and integration efforts necessary for incorporation of advanced automotive, armor, armament, life cycle enhancements, system hardware and software technologies, including Common Operating Environment (COE) and Network Integrated Evaluation (NIE), obsolescence mitigation, reliability improvements, and decreasing the logistics footprint.  This effort includes performing technical assessments, concept studies, and risk reduction efforts for incorporation of future requirements.  The HIMARS product improvement program maintains compliance with Intra-Army Interoperability and Digital Communications.  HIMARS was deployed to Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and is still supporting Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) with great success by both U.S. Army and Marine Corps units.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>The Army G-3/5/7 has directed that Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) Increment 4 change its name to Long-Range Precision Fires (LRPF) to better reflect the solution as an Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) replacement versus a follow-on increment to the GMLRS program.  Beginning in FY2016, LRPF is a New Start program.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The LRPF is being developed as a cluster and insensitive munition-compliant system that replaces and improves upon ATACMS capabilities to provide Joint Force Commanders with a 24/7, all-weather, area target, long-range fires capability without placing aircraft and crews at risk.  The mission of the LRPF System will be to attack/neutralize/suppress/destroy targets using missile delivered indirect precision fires.  The LRPF will counter the enemy's ability to conduct combat maneuver and air defense operations.  Targets include counterfire, air defense, command and control, and other high payoff targets at all depths of the tactical battlefield. LRPF requirements include 300km range; specified lethality against the designated target set, a Missile Launch Pod Container (MLPC) that holds a minimum of two missiles; and compatibility with the existing launcher platforms (M270A1 and High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS)).  The Army is conducting an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA), based on an Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) approved Material Development Decision (MDD) on 6 November 2013.  The AoA is scheduled for completion in March 2015.

The Army is funding the development of the LRPF under Program Element 0603778A project code DZ8.   The LRPF program currently has a Milestone (MS) A Decision scheduled for 1QFY16.  Funding is requested in FY2016 to conduct competitive sub-system risk reduction activities under DoD Section 845 Other Transaction Authority (OTA), to mature the rocket motor and warhead technology to support the award of Technology Maturation/Risk Reduction (TM/RR) system demonstration contracts in FY17.  LRPF will be developed using competitive prototyping, carrying two or more contractors through the TM/RR Phase.  LRPF is scheduled for a MS B in FY2019 and MS C in FY2022.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

An AoA supporting a MS A decision is being conducted by U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Analysis Center-White Sands Missile Range (TRAC-WSMR), with the final report to be completed in March 2015.  The Milestone Decision Authority will hold a MS A decision review in 1QFY16.  The Acquisition Strategy is for competitive prototyping for TM/RR at both the sub-system and system demonstration levels.  After a MS A decision directing a new start LRPF system, the program office will initiate TM/RR activities with awards in 3QFY16 for critical sub-system prototyping under the DoD Ordnance Technology Consortium (DOTC) Section 845 (NDAA 1994) Other Transaction Authority. The program will also conduct a full and open competition in FY2016 of a 24-month TM/RR competitive prototyping and flight demonstration phase to be awarded to two contractors in 2QFY2017.  Flight demonstrations and PDRs in FY18 will lead to a limited competition for the EMD contract and competitive down select at MS B.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>ER2 - This program includes development efforts to upgrade Close Combat technologies, energetics, and munitions, such as counter explosives, grenades, demolitions, shoulder launched munitions, pyrotechnic simulators, non-lethal ammunition/systems, networked munitions and mines, that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production.  This program will identify, characterize, study, analyze, test and develop technologies to resolve close combat munition reliability, safety, environmental, storage, standardization, obsolescence and manufacturing/producibility issues.

ER5 - Indirect Fire and Fuze Technology: This program will identify, study, analyze and support enhanced lethality, range extension and standardization to improve target engagement effectiveness; increase reliability, safety, and exportability of indirect fires weapons and munitions; and reduce taxpayer costs including elimination of sole source supply of indirect fires ammunition materials as well as studies and analyses of such technology solutions in comparison to current stock pile indirect fire conventional weapons and munitions and their associated production and life cycle support processes. Additionally, environmental impacts of legacy propellants, explosives and metal parts will be studied. Replacement of hazardous materials such as Ammonium Perchlorate, Diphenylamine, Lead, etc. and addition of propellant anti-tubewear additives will remain a focus. This program supports the standardization and interoperability of legacy and new production weapons and ammunition to maximize battlefield interchangeability/compatibility between domestic US and Allied Nations under the auspices of the international Joint Ballistics Memorandum Of Understanding (JBMOU).  Maximizing standardization, interchangeability, and exportability will potentially increase FMS sales of US products to maintain domestic production and economies of scale.

This program also supports the identification, study, analysis and development of fuzing technologies and safe and arm devices in production and in the field. This program will implement these technologies into fuzing systems to preclude obsolescence, maximize standardization, enhance performance, and improve the safety and exportability of existing munitions. The program addresses two major areas: (1) analysis and (2) block upgrades. Analysis efforts will identify second sources for fuzing systems that may reduce cost by providing competition, and maintain production when sources or parts are no longer available. It will also allow for the performance enhancement of current ammunition items by conducting studies of major fuze components to detect and identify latent defects. The second major area is block upgrades, which will identify and perform studies on improvements to fuzes; increase commonality of fuze components and requirements. Block upgrades will enable the introduction of the latest technologies into fuzing, keep the fuzing design current to avoid obsolescence issues, and add capabilities.


ER6 - Direct Fire Technology and NATO Ammo Eval: This program funding will be used to support direct fire ammunition from small caliber ammunition, 40mm grenade, medium caliber cannon ammunition and large caliber ammunition enhancements to lethality, effectiveness, survivability, accuracy and general product improvements. In addition, this program assures complete interchangeability of direct fire ammunition and weapons among all the NATO countries with all of the associated logistic, strategic and tactical advantages of the alliance. Project involves development and testing compliance of NATO standardization agreements (STANAGS) and staffing of the North American Regional Test Center (NARTC). FY 2016 funds will be used for a more lethal and safer design for 40mm grenades that will be built and tested. An improved 30mm training round for the Apache helicopter will allow pilots to see where the rounds strike. Warhead improvements for the 30mm Apache ammunition are also under development. A number of studies on potential improvements for training ammunition and better primers will be conducted.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>ER2 is a new project in 2016. Grenades MK3A2 Replacement, Concussion Grenade Optmization Effort and Claymore Force-on-Force Training Aids, Devices, Simulators, and Simulations (TADSS) Trainer are efforts previously funded under project 296 PE 0605805A - Munitions Standardization, Effectiveness and Safety.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program includes development efforts to upgrade Close Combat technologies, energetics, and munitions, such as counter explosives, grenades, demolitions, shoulder launched munitions, pyrotechnic simulators, non-lethal ammunition/systems, networked munitions and mines, that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production.  This program will identify, characterize, study, analyze, test and develop technologies to resolve close combat munition reliability, safety, environmental, storage, standardization, obsolescence and manufacturing/producibility issues.

FY 2016 funds will be used to improve the MK3A2 Offensive Hand Grenade and develop an improved Claymore Force-on-Force Training Aids, Device, Simulator and Simulation (TADSS) Trainer.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>This effort incorporates modern materials and insensitive explosives to provide a safer, producible concussion grenade. Use of the MK3A2 offensive grenade has been suspended due to age and safety issues. The current MK3A2 can expose the Soldier to toxic levels of asbestos. War fighters cannot safely employ the offensive grenade. Alternate munitions such as the M84 do not satisfy User needs for incapacitation of the enemy. Effort will continue to finalize design in anticipation of Production Verification Testing (PVT) in FY16 with type classification in FY17 and full material release in FY18.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Develop an improved Claymore Force-on-Force Training Aids, Devices, Simulators, and Simulations (TADSS) Trainer.  While the Claymore is one of the most popular items used by the soldier, the system does not have a TADSS trainer with sight, sound &amp; Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (MILES) capability. Development of an improved Claymore trainer will allow Claymore to be trained at Combat Training Centers (CTCs) and will provide more realistic and effective training for the user when they are training Claymore as an end item and when training Claymore as initiated by Spider.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program supports product improvement development efforts to upgrade indirect fire weapon systems and munition that have already been fielded and/or are in production.  Indirect Fire Weapons and Munitions Product Improvement Programs include enhanced lethality, range extension,  improved target engagement; increased reliability, availability, maintainability, and safety; standardization and interoperability with weapons and munitions of Allied Nations; defense exportability features under the auspices of Better Buying Power; reduced taxpayer life-cycle costs; reduction of failure mechanisms and supply chain risk through introduction of new and alternative technology and material solutions; materiel and technology obsolescence mitigation; improvement of manufacturing methods and their associated production and life cycle support processes; new capabilities in response the evolving and emerging threats and countermeasures; and reduction/elimination of potential environmental and health risks associated with these products and their underlying components, materials, and production processes.   

This program supports the standardization and interoperability of legacy and new production U.S. weapons and ammunition with Allied Nations to maximize battlefield interchangeability/compatibility under the auspices of the international Joint Ballistics Memorandum Of Understanding (JBMOU).  Maximizing standardization, interchangeability, and exportability will also potentially increase Foreign Military Sales (FMS) of U.S. indirect fire Weapon and Munition products to maintain critical mass domestic production and affordable taxpayer costs through increased economies of scale.

This program also supports the identification, study, analysis and development of fuzing technologies and safe and arm devices in production and in the field. This program will implement these technologies into fuzing systems to preclude obsolescence, maximize standardization, enhance performance, and improve the safety and exportability of existing munitions. The program addresses two major areas: (1) analysis and (2) block upgrades. Analysis efforts will identify second sources for fuzing systems that may reduce cost by providing competition, and maintain production when sources or parts are no longer available. It will also allow for the performance enhancement of current ammunition items by conducting studies of major fuze components to detect and identify latent defects. The second major area is block upgrades, which will identify and perform studies on improvements to fuzes; increase commonality of fuze components and requirements. Block upgrades will enable the introduction of the latest technologies into fuzing, keep the fuzing design current to avoid obsolescence issues, and add capabilities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Joint Ballistics Memorandum of Understanding (JBMOU) Concerning the Standardization of Elements of 155mm Weapons and Ammo between United States, France, Germany, Italy, and United Kingdom was signed 18 Dec 2009.  This is a FY 2016 continuation of live fire testing, evaluation, and validation and any corresponding NATO Armaments Ballistics Kernel (NABK) and Firing Control Input (FCI) database changes, enables battlefield interchangeability of existing/new 155mm cannon munitions between domestic US and NATO/Allied Nations Indirect Fires Weapons And Munitions. 

This is a FY 2016 continuation of ARDEC Fuze Technology Integration (FTI) which improves current production munitions by exploiting existing fuzing technologies and inserting them into current production fuzes, providing safer, more producible, and more lethal fuzing solutions. FTI develops second source suppliers and resolve component obsolescence issues to mitigate risk and prevent production interruptions in order to continue to provide safer, more reliable munitions for the Warfighter with significant risk reduction to production fuzes also benefiting the U.S. Taxpayer. FTI will conduct ballistic tests to evaluate proximity sensor improvements that will eliminate the potential of an early M734A1 fuze function due to undesired out-range response and generate the engineering change proposals (ECPs) to incorporate changes into the M734A1 fuze Technical Data Package; will evaluate the omni-directional G-switch performance of the M433 grenade, and evaluate if it will reduce duds, due to improved reliability on soft targets and graze angles. FTI will analyze the design modification to the escapement housing to ensure the M433 High Explosive Dual Purpose (HEDP) round and M918 training rounds will decrease the risk of having a defeated safety. FTI will evaluate the design and integration of the Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) G-Switch for setback sensing into the M734A1/M783 through analysis, bench and sub-scale testing. FTI will conduct tests to evaluate the delay primer improvements and evaluate changes to the explosive content of the delay primer input cup assembly which will reduce the occurrences of instantaneous firings and will subsequently generate an ECP to incorporate into the M734A1 and M783 fuze(TDPs). FTI will evaluate the improvements to the inductive fuze setter and incorporate the changes to the software that will provide cost savings and simplify integration with future weapon platforms.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program funding will be used to support direct fire ammunition from small caliber ammunition, 40mm grenade, medium caliber cannon ammunition and large caliber ammunition enhancements to lethality, effectiveness, survivability, accuracy and general product improvements. In addition, this program assures complete interchangeability of direct fire ammunition and weapons among all the NATO countries with all of the associated logistic, strategic and tactical advantages of the alliance. Project involves development and testing compliance of NATO standardization agreements (STANAGS) and staffing of the North American Regional Test Center (NARTC).  

FY 2016 funds will be used for a more lethal and safer design for 40mm grenades that will be built and tested. An improved 30mm training round for the Apache helicopter will allow pilots to see where the rounds strike. Warhead improvements for the 30mm Apache ammunition are also under development. A number of studies on potential improvements for training ammunition and better primers will be conducted.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The FY 2016 budget request for Apache AH-64E, previously known as Apache Block III, will fund the non-recurring engineering (NRE), development, and testing work associated with the planned remanufacture and new build of 690 Apache aircraft in the AH-64E configuration (deliveries began in Oct 2011).  The AH-64E - program consists of two Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAP), AH-64E Remanufacture and AH-64E New Build.  This project also addresses obsolescence and reliability challenges and provides increased combat capability to the aircraft.  Upgrades include: Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Level III-IV Control, Improved Situational Awareness, Upgraded Communications Suite, Improved Drive and Propulsion Systems, Improved Targeting Capability, Increased Computer Processing Capability and Speed, Improved Navigation Systems, and Improved Diagnostics and Maintainability.  Upgrades are integrated as incremental block modifications.  The program addresses operational shortfalls identified during real-world combat missions and meets Longbow Apache Capability Production Document (CPD) requirements for modernization.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The NRE will encompass subsystem integration and will utilize existing test aircraft, incorporate the technical insertions, and initiate appropriate qualification and operational flight-testing. 

In FY14, a contract for Apache AH-64E Lot 3, initiating Full Rate Production, is planned with options for Lot 4 and will continue to a total of 690 remanufactured and new build aircraft.

Training device concurrency will be maintained with each technical insertion. The EMD effort is managed as Cost Reimbursable.  Production efforts will be awarded as Firm Fixed Price (FFP) and include the Advance Procurement requirements.

In FY13, FY14, and FY15 MRL NRE will encompass US Government (USG) design of the Hydra Launcher Electronics Assembly (LEA), modification of the M261 launcher, launcher fabrication, and launcher testing.

In FY15-FY18, Apache AH-64E Development &amp; Integration (D&amp;I) Contract.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The H-60L Digital BLACK HAWK, now designated as UH-60V, is designed to update the existing H-60L analog architecture to a digital infrastructure enabling the upgraded aircraft to have a similar Pilot-Vehicle Interface (PVI) to the H-60M.  The program will address current capability gaps and meet operational requirements by employing an evolutionary acquisition approach to leverage mature technologies that have been successfully integrated on other military aircraft.  The program will reduce obsolescence and increase commonality and interoperability by installing a digital cockpit, bussing and upgrading the communication/identification suite, improving navigation guidance, and integrating Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE), digital moving map, and Joint Variable Message Format (JVMF) messaging.

FY 2016 UH-60V funds hardware and software development as well as prototype support. Tasks include build of aircraft 1 and 2, Bench Test Facility Assembly, and developmental testing.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The budget line provides for Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE), development of supplemental type certificates (STC) and associated developmental testing, and integration of all Army fixed wing aircraft to provide Communications, Navigation and Surveillance (CNS), Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE), and Department of Defense (DoD) mandated safety equipment to meet current and evolving international and Army standards. FY 2016 Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) dollars in the amount of $1.151 million provides funding for developmental NRE for aircraft modifications to CNS, ASE, and integration of Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) Mission Equipment Packages (MEP).  The increased performance will permit the Army fixed wing aircraft to operate in compliance with other existing and emerging regulations.  As requirements for new avionics equipment continue, aircraft delays and airspace exclusions are likely for aircraft not properly equipped. Upgrade of communication and aircraft modifications will assure worldwide deployability for those required to deploy. This budget line will also provide funding for studies, evaluations and Analysis of Alternatives to support emerging Army fixed wing requirements for product improvements to support the Army fleet.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>For Fiscal Year (FY) 2014 and prior, all funding for ITEP was contained in Program Element (PE) 0203744A – Aircraft Modifications/Product Improvement Programs, Project 504.  FY 2015 funding has moved from PE 0203744A, Project EB1 to PE 0607139A, Project ES6.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification: The Improved Turbine Engine Program (ITEP) develops, tests, qualifies, and integrates the next generation turboshaft engine on the Blackhawk and Apache aircraft.  The Improved Turbine Engine (ITE) replaces the existing T700 engine design originated in the 1970's and meets the operational requirement of 6K/95.  The ITE will fit inside the existing engine bays of the Black Hawk and Apache Helicopters and provides a significant power enhancement of up to fifty percent (total of 3,000 shaft horsepower) with increased fuel efficiency.  Additional benefits include improved design life, enhanced reliability, lower maintenance cost and restored capability lost due to aircraft weight growth, without increasing the logistics footprint.  The program consists of systems engineering and program management, detailed design engineering, design assurance, hardware manufacturing and testing, component and module level development and testing, system level testing and qualification, as well as integration into the airframe.

FY 2015 funding provides for systems engineering/program management in support of draft and formal Request For Proposal (RFP) release, initial Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB) for Preliminary Design Review (PDR) competitive contracts, and platform/engine integration trade studies.  FY 2016 funding provides for dual vendor competitive PDR contract awards, initial engine design effort, and continues platform/engine integration trade studies.  FY 2017 continues engine design effort and platform/engine integration trade studies.  FY 2018 funds the remaining PDR engine design effort, the Engineering Manufacturing and Development (EMD) SSEB for entry into Milestone B (MS B), EMD contract award, and continues platform/engine integration trade studies.  FY 2019 continues both the EMD effort and platform/engine integration trade studies, and results in a Critical Design Review (CDR) in FY 2019.  FY 2020 continues both the EMD effort and platform/engine integration trade studies. FY 2021 continues the EMD effort, provides for First Engine To Test (FETT), and begins physical airframe integration.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

FY 2015 funding has moved from PE 0203744A, Project EB1 to PE 0607139A, Project ES6.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification: The Improved Turbine Engine Program (ITEP) develops, tests, qualifies, and integrates the next generation turboshaft engine on the Blackhawk and Apache aircraft.  The Improved Turbine Engine (ITE) replaces the existing T700 engine design originated in the 1970's and meets the operational requirement of 6K/95.  The ITE will fit inside the existing engine bays of the Black Hawk and Apache Helicopters and provides a significant power enhancement of up to fifty percent (total of 3,000 shaft horsepower) with increased fuel efficiency.  Additional benefits include improved design life, enhanced reliability, lower maintenance cost and restored capability lost due to aircraft weight growth, without increasing the logistics footprint.  The program consists of systems engineering and program management, detailed design engineering, design assurance, hardware manufacturing and testing, component and module level development and testing, system level testing and qualification, as well as integration into the airframe.

FY 2015 funding provides for systems engineering/program management in support of draft and formal Request For Proposal (RFP) release, initial Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB) for Preliminary Design Review (PDR) competitive contracts, and platform/engine integration trade studies.  FY 2016 funding provides for dual vendor competitive PDR contract awards, initial engine design effort, and continues platform/engine integration trade studies.  FY 2017 continues engine design effort and platform/engine integration trade studies.  FY 2018 funds the remaining PDR engine design effort, the Engineering Manufacturing and Development (EMD) SSEB for entry into Milestone B (MS B), EMD contract award, and continues platform/engine integration trade studies.  FY 2019 continues both the EMD effort and platform/engine integration trade studies, and results in a Critical Design Review (CDR) in FY 2019.  FY 2020 continues both the EMD effort and platform/engine integration trade studies. FY 2021 continues the EMD effort, provides for First Engine To Test (FETT), and begins physical airframe integration.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>As a result of the language that was incorporated into the Senate Report 112-196 that accompanied the Department of Defense Appropriations Bill 2013, House Report 5856, Project EC8 "Emerging Technologies from NIE's was established under PE 0203758A "Digitization" specifically for the transition of promising technologies from NIEs to the field, particularly those developed by nontraditional vendors. 
Congressional Directed Transfer in 2014: Funding and Requirements were transferred from PE 02037558 Project EC8 to this newly established Project under PE 06047140. 
Program control will be exercised by review of individual projects and approval by Army Gatekeepers, much like the Network Integration Evaluation (NIE) Program (PE 0604798A).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The FY 2016 funding request was reduced by $1.988 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Logistics Information Warehouse (LIW) has been designated by the Secretary of the Army as the primary system for the accessing, acquiring, and delivery of materiel data. This includes data from all sources designated as Authoritative, as well as, system derived data and appropriate reference data. This data will be used in support of materiel sourcing and distribution and other Materiel Enterprise missions. It enables Command visibility of business intelligence and resulting metrics for critical logistics components enabling enterprise-level analytics to be performed in support of the equipping mission within the Army's Tiered Readiness processes. LOGSA and its LIW suite of products and services provide the Army community with vital logistics data necessary for the planning, conducting and sustainment of war fighting capability worldwide. The LMI-DST directly supports Tiered Readiness by linking available equipment to the Generated Force model. Specifically, LMI-DST synchronizes an Army authoritative Demand Signal for manning, equipping, services &amp; infrastructure and authoritative resourcing (money) information, resulting in an accurate prediction of a ready and properly equipped force. The Army Financial Liability Investigation of Property Loss Tracker (AFT) tool is a web-based, automated FLIPL processing and tracking system which provides an electronic FLIPL documentation packet that includes intelligent, digital versions of required forms and allows for attachment of supporting documentation.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

This includes data from all sources designated as authoritative, as well as system derived data and appropriate reference data. This data will be used in support of materiel sourcing and distribution and other Materiel Enterprise missions. LIW enables visibility of business intelligence and resulting metrics for critical logistics components enabling enterprise-level analytics to be performed in support of the equipping mission within the Army's Tiered Readiness processes. LIW supports the tenants of Mission Command by logistically empowering the Commander to successfully integrate and synchronize logistics information with warfighter functions in time and space to maximize potential for mission success. ADDITIONAL CAPABILITIES: LIW provides the data and custom business intelligence environment to enable Command-specific analysis and presentation of business intelligence displays to satisfy unique command management requirements.  LIW serves as the single logistics repository which bridges the Army ERP systems (GCSS-Army, LMP, AESIP, GFEBS) with enduring legacy systems. 

LOGSA is requesting RDT&amp;E funds to develop and host the Army Financial Liability Investigation of Property Loss Tracker (AFT) tool.  The AFT will be a web-based, automated FLIPL processing and tracking system which provides an electronic FLIPL documentation packet that includes intelligent, digital versions of required forms and allows for attachment of supporting documentation. The AFT will be designed to follow the DA Form 7531, instructing and assisting investigating officers, records managers, and commanders in the proper execution of the FLIPL process. The AFT will have business intelligence and work flow processing that ensures FLIPLs contain the key documents critical to a supportable FLIPL and the resulting determinations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Lead Materiel Integrator Decision Support Tool (LMI DST) is a software solution, resident within the Logistics Information Warehouse, that supports the Army Materiel Command in its mission as the Army Lead Materiel Integrator as well as materiel managers at Army Commands, Army Service Component Commands, Direct Reporting Units, Corps and Divisions with making informed equipping decisions. The LMI DST directly supports Army Forces Generation (ARFORGEN) by linking available equipment to the Generated Force model. 

Specifically, development will enable the tool to consume and display additional data sources, such as maintenance data from both legacy and Enterprise data sources - a critical capability during the fielding of GCSS-Army; provide additional modules, including Second Destination Transportation Planning, supporting USARC and NGB requirements to deprecate legacy systems and a Readiness Cost Banding module to implement analysis algorithms to deliver decisions to optimize readiness within Army cost constraints. New development will also enable equippers to redistribute items, based on their level of modernization, limiting transportation costs of moving outdated equipment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The LMI DST is a development effort to meet the Secretary of the Army's intent in designating the Army Materiel Command as the Lead Materiel Integrator and the Logistics Information Warehouse (LIW) as the authoritative repository of Army logistics domain data. The LMI DST integrates logistics domain data from the LIW with materiel demand requirements from the Readiness Enterprise to enable automated decision support for equippers throughout the Army. In August 2011, a sole source contract was awarded to ProModel Corporation to leverage their COTS modeling and simulation capability, the ProModel Application Framework to develop the Lead Materiel Integrator Decision Support Tool, which is a GOTS product. The project utilizes an agile development methodology. Versions 1-4 were released on a six-month cadence between December 2011 and April 2013. LMI DST development and sustainment have been transitioned to LOGSA's Information and Technology Services Contract.  Requirements for additional development were collected from Army Commands and vetted through a General Officer Steering Committee, chaired by Army Materiel Command.  RDTE funding supports future major version releases.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Biometrics Enabling Capability (BEC) product office has full life-cycle management responsibility of the upgraded authoritative biometrics enterprise repository system, known as DoD Automated Biometrics Identification System (DoD ABIS).  DoD ABIS is an information technology system that supports identity superiority by providing the critical capability for Warfighters to identify known or suspected terrorists and third country nationals in the course of military operations.   DoD ABIS is the authoritative biometrics enterprise system that provides matching, sharing and storing of biometrics data.  The capability can receive multi-model biometrics submissions to include iris, face, palm and finger prints from biometrics collection devices, which will support the Warfigher in making, retain, capture or release decisions.  The system has a direct impact on the availability of critical intelligence information that is of vital interest to DoD and other government agencies, including Department of Justice (DoJ), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and Department of State (DoS).

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Biometrics Enabling Capability (BEC) product office has full life-cycle management responsibility of the upgraded authoritative biometrics enterprise repository system, known as DoD Automated Biometrics Identification System (DoD ABIS).  DoD ABIS is an information technology system that supports identity superiority by providing the critical capability for Warfighters to identify known or suspected terrorists and third country nationals in the course of military operations.  DoD ABIS is the authoritative biometrics enterprise system that provides matching, sharing and storing of biometrics data.  The capability can receive multi-model biometrics submissions to include iris, face, palm and finger prints from biometrics collection devices, which will support the Warfigher in making, retain, capture or release decisions.  The system has a direct impact on the availability of critical intelligence information that is of vital interest to DoD and other government agencies, including Department of Justice (DoJ), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and Department of State (DoS).

The Defense Forensics and Biometrics Agency (DFBA) as the Executive Manager for Army Biometrics acts as the DoD proponent to establish and maintain Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation (RDTE) and information management support throughout the Armed Services.  DFBA leads in the development and implementation of biometric technologies for Combatant Commands (CCMDs), Services, and Agencies; delivers capabilities that contribute to the enhancement of the biometric community; increases Joint Service interoperability and; empowers the warfighter by improving operational effectiveness on the battlefield. The DFBA strategy pursues technology opportunities through scientific discovery and makes investments responsive to specific requirements identified by combat developers. These directives are carried out by DFBA's Office of the Chief Scientist (OCS). OCS coordinates all science and technology (S&amp;T) efforts and oversees the RDT&amp;E program.

Justification:
FY16 Research Development Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) funding in the amount of $11.770 million supports integration and testing of upgraded Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) Search Core software to replace obsolete technology and extend the service life of the DoD ABIS system baseline.  Funds will also support software upgrades to the Electronic Biometrics Transmission Specification (EBTS 2.0) to comply with current DoD Information Technology Standards Registry (DISR) EBTS 3.0 Standards.

FY 2016 funding in the amount of $1.467 million will provide DFBA the ability to actively manage internal and external research efforts to ensure scientific merit, feasibility, and DFBA objectives and requirements are met. DFBA conducts biometric T&amp;E activities, including standards conformance and Automated Biometric Identification System (ABIS) interoperability assessments, supporting DoD acquisition organizations, and providing subject matter expertise to DoD and non-DoD government stakeholders.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Defense Forensics and Biometrics Agency (DFBA) as the Executive Manager for Army biometrics acts as the DoD proponent to establish and maintain Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation (RDTE) and information management support throughout the armed services.  DFBA leads in the development and implementation of biometric technologies for Combatant Commands (CCMDs), Services, and Agencies; delivers capabilities that contribute to the enhancement of the biometric community; increases Joint Service interoperability and; empowers the warfighter by improving operational effectiveness on the battlefield. The DFBA strategy pursues technology opportunities through scientific discovery and makes investments responsive to specific requirements identified by combat developers. These directives are carried out by DFBA's Office of the Chief Scientist (OCS). OCS coordinates all science and technology (S&amp;T) efforts and oversees the RDT&amp;E program.

Justification:
FY2016 funding in the amount of $1.467 million will provide DFBA the ability to actively manage internal and external research efforts to ensure scientific merit, feasibility, and DFBA objectives and requirements are met. DFBA conducts biometric T&amp;E activities, including standards conformance and Automated Biometric Identification System (ABIS) interoperability assessments, supporting DoD acquisition organizations, and providing subject matter expertise to DoD and non-DoD government stakeholders.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>PATRIOT is an advanced Surface-to-Air guided missile system with a high probability of kill, capable of operation in the presence of Electronic Countermeasures (ECM) and able to conduct multiple simultaneous engagements against high performance air breathing targets and ballistic missiles likely to be encountered by U.S. Forces.  The PATRIOT Product Improvement Program provides for the upgrade of the PATRIOT System through individual materiel changes and upgrades to the PATRIOT system to address operational lessons learned, enhancements to joint force interoperability, and other system performance improvements to provide overmatch capability with the emerging threat.  Efforts will be made to expedite PATRIOT materiel solutions (e.g. Radar Digital Processor, Communications Upgrades, address Tactical Ballistic Missile (TBM) capability, Combat ID, and Advanced ECM improvements) to both enhance capability and facilitate integration into the Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) architecture.  Near term efforts are modifications and FY15 initiates competitive modernization through development of the Lower Tier Air &amp; Missile Defense-Capability (LTAMD-C).

The software funding provides improvements to the PATRIOT system against the evolving threat. This effort supports work with national agencies to evaluate, assess, and develop means to mitigate threat trends and specific threat developments potentially impacting system performance, and prioritize the improvements in the overall development cycle. Specific improvements may be developed and fielded under this task if warranted. The effort maintains the Mission Tailoring Database, responding to immediate tactical concerns; Database updates are fielded between major software upgrades as necessary.

FY2016 base dollars continue Software Improvement for Threat Evolution, Upper Tier Debris Mitigation (UTDM), Radar Digital Processor (RDP) Development, RDP Waveform Suite, THAAD PATRIOT Interoperability, Advanced Electronic Counter Measures (AECM), Tasks 2, 6, and 7 activities, Combat ID Enhancements, Common Warfighter Machine Interface (CWMI),  Lower Tier Air &amp; Missile Defense-Capability (LTAMD-C), Concept Development and Anti-Radiation Missile (ARM) Asset Defense for the PATRIOT Product Improvement Program (PIP).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Software Improvements for threat evolution:   Performs necessary analysis and development efforts to maintain PATRIOT system effectiveness against evolving threat technologies and specific threat capabilities.  This effort identifies evolving threats and threat characteristics that might present a challenge to PATRIOT's current capabilities and develops initial concepts to maintain system effectiveness relative to these threats.  

Upper-Tier Debris Mitigation (UTDM):  Implements algorithms to mitigate system impacts of debris from Upper Tier intercepts associated with operating in the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) environment.  Debris from Upper Tier intercepts can cause significant radar loading effects and the potential for erroneous engagements and missile wastage on debris.

Radar Digital Processor (RDP) Development:  Incorporates improvements to mitigate radar hardware obsolescence, improves Reliability, Availability and Maintainability (RAM) and improves performance of the PATRIOT Radar Set against evolving threat sets.  This program includes the implementation of Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) Mode 5 Level 1 / Level 2, and a Non-Cooperative Target Recognition (NCTR) Combat ID technique to mitigate potential fratricide risk, and the development of CONOPS to incorporate the new Combat ID capabilities into system operation.  The RDP also provides the necessary radar processing capability to support follow-on Evolutionary Development Program (EDP) Tasks 6 and 7 to counter emerging threats and provide data necessary to support migration to IAMD.  The RDP is a pre-requisite for migration to an IAMD Netted Sensor.

RDP Waveform Suite:  Develops a comprehensive set of waveforms in the RDP to improve PATRIOT radar capabilities against current and evolving threats, including support to Task 6 and 7 efforts(see below),and implements advanced data collection enabled by the RDP to support further system improvements.  The RDP implementation allows significant radar waveform improvements necessary to counter evolving threats.

SIPRNet/NIPRNet Access Point/Troposcatter (SNAP/TROPO):  Provides hardware interfaces to support extended range communications within the battalion (TROPO) and Force Operations interfaces to satellite for access to SIPR/NIPR worldwide communication networks. 
 
THAAD/PATRIOT Interoperability:  Implements improvements to THAAD/PATRIOT Interoperability and addresses Joint Defense Network (JDN) deficiencies that impact Tactical Ballistic Missile (TBM) battle management and force/engagement operations.  Efforts will be concentrated on joint, collaborative force operations (defense design and planning) and enhanced Tactical Digital Information Link - Joint (TADIL J) interoperability. 
 
Advanced Electronic Counter Measures (AECM):  This task investigates the implications of advanced technology Digital Radio Frequency Memory (DRFM) available on airborne platforms that enables new ECM techniques which could adversely affect Air and Missile Defense System effectiveness.   

Task 2:  Implements improved ground system and interceptor capabilities (PATRIOT Advanced Capability-2 / Guidance Enhanced Missiles(PAC-2/GEM), PATRIOT Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3), and Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE)) to counter stressing TBM threats.
 
Task 6:  Software improvements enhance discrimination of higher altitude TBM Re-entry Vehicles (RVs) from associated objects to support the full engagement capabilities of the interceptor.  Longer-range detection, track, and improved high-altitude discrimination are required to achieve the required lethality performance against the RV and to mitigate missile wastage against separation debris.  This task leverages the signal processing capabilities of the RDP, and supports the high altitude engagements required by the PATRIOT Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) and PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) missiles.

Task 7:  Software improvements analyze existing and evolving TBM countermeasures and their effects on PATRIOT system effectiveness.  Develops concepts to address countermeasure effects and ensure the PATRIOT system maintains its effectiveness.   Develops detailed system requirements to implement concepts; design/code/test software implementation leveraging RDP, Modernized Adjunct Processor (MAP), Enhanced Weapons Control Computer - Emulator (EWCC-E) and Flight Solution Computer - Redesign (FSC-R) processing capabilities.

Combat ID Enhancements:  Develop and implement improvements to the RDP-C Combat ID capabilities and additional NCTR technique to further mitigate misclassification and fratricide risk, and to provide the Warfighter with improved situational awareness.

Common Warfighter-Machine Interface (CWMI):  Leverages modern manstation capabilities to implement CWMI concepts to improve training commonality and cost-efficiency, and to provide better situational awareness.  Brings the man-machine interface under development for the IBCS program into the legacy PATRIOT system so that while the IAMD Battle Command System (IBCS) is fielding, the warfighter has the same interface whether he/she is fighting the battle from legacy PATRIOT or from the IBCS.  The incorporation of CWMI significantly mitigates the impact to the Institutional Training Base (ITB) and manning requirements during the 8-year transition from legacy PATRIOT to the IBCS system.

Lower Tier Air &amp; Missile Defense-Capability (LTAMD-C), Concept Study:  This task provides studies for initial concepts and performance capabilities related to the implementation of an Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) transmitter/antenna into the PATRIOT radar.  These assessments are needed to refine user community expectations and requirements, and to prepare a viable set of requirements to support a competitive modernization competition.

Anti-Radiation Missile (ARM) Asset Defense:  Provides improved capability for PATRIOT to protect other Army and Joint Services Sensors from ARM attacks.  Builds on an initial capability provided in Post-Deployment Build (PDB)-7 by determining remaining gaps, identifying and evaluating alternatives, and implementing further improvements.

Lower Tier Air &amp; Missile Defense-Capability (LTAMD-C):  LTAMD Capability tasks include all the programmatic and engineering activities needed for the LTAMD Capability Materiel Development Decision (MDD), Analysis of Alternatives (AOA), and Business Case Analyses/Trades. Once the material solution has been determined, the development effort for LTAMD-C will be accomplished.  These activities will continue through the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) and Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase to enable the prototyping, development, and testing of the LTAMD Capability.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The design objective of the PATRIOT system was to provide a baseline system capable of modification to cope with continuing threat evolution.  This program minimizes technological risks and provides a means of enhancing system capability through planned upgrades of deployed systems.  The PATRIOT Product Improvement Program upgrades the PATRIOT system to address operational lessons learned, enhancements to joint force interoperability and communications, and other system performance improvements to provide overmatch capability against the emerging threat.  Upgrades are implemented through individual hardware and software materiel changes and fielded incrementally. This program encompasses several changes which will require the use of a variety of acquisition methods to develop, test, procure and field.  Future software capabilities will be incorporated into future PDB releases.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>An FY 2014 Congressional realignment divided the JLENS Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) funding line between two separate Program Elements (PEs). PE/Project 0102419A/E55 funds the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) and a second PE/Project 0202429A/EP8 funds the JLENS COCOM Exercise.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Joint Land Attack Cruise Missile Defense Elevated Netted Sensor System (JLENS) is a supporting program of the Army and Joint Integrated Air and Missile Defense, providing persistent, over the horizon surveillance and fire control quality data on Army and Joint networks.  This over-the-horizon radar system enables protection of the U.S. and coalition forces, as well as geopolitical assets from Cruise Missiles, Aircraft, Unmanned Air Vehicles, Tactical Ballistic Missiles, Large Caliber Rockets, and Surface Moving Targets.

A JLENS Orbit consists of two systems: a fire control radar system and a wide-area surveillance radar system.  Each radar system consists of a separate 74-meter tethered aerostat, mobile mooring station, radar and communications payload, processing station, and associated ground support equipment.  The systems are designed to work together, but can operate independently.  The JLENS Orbit is transportable by road, rail, sea and air.

JLENS uses advanced sensor and networking technologies to provide persistent, 360-degree, wide-area surveillance and precision tracking of Land Attack Cruise Missiles and other types of Air Breathing Threats.  This information is distributed via joint service networks and provides fire control quality data to Surface to Air missile systems, such as Army Patriot and Navy Aegis, increasing the weapons' capabilities by allowing systems to engage targets normally below, outside, or beyond surface based weapons' field of view. JLENS also provides fire control quality data to fighter aircraft, allowing the aircraft to engage hostile threats from extended ranges, and contributes to the development of a single integrated air picture.

JLENS Product Office successfully demonstrated the system's operational capability with the Weapon Systems Evaluation Program (WSEP) proof of concept for the National Capital Region Integrated Air Defense System exercise. The Exercise used JLENS with an United States Air Force (USAF) operational aircraft and a Norwegian Advanced Surface to Air Missile System (NASAMS), to track and neutralize targets in August 2013.

JLENS has been directed to support a Homeland Defense Operational Exercise in the National Capital Region (NRC) from Fiscal Year (FY) 2014 to FY 2017 and will be assessed during the exercise to support a follow on decision from the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC). The JLENS Product Office has a requirement for the acquisition of services through the JLENS Exercise Contract to support the deployment of a JLENS Orbit at Aberdeen Proving Grounds (APG), MD as directed by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memorandum (JROCM) 021-13 signed by the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on 31 January 2013.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>An FY 2014 Congressional realignment divided the JLENS Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) funding line between two separate Program Elements (PEs). PE/Project 0102419A/E55 funds the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) and a second PE/Project 0202429A/EP8 funds the JLENS COCOM Exercise.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>JLENS is a supporting program of the Army and Joint Integrated Air and Missile Defense, providing persistent, over the horizon surveillance and fire control quality data on Army and Joint networks.  This over-the-horizon radar system enables protection of the U.S. and coalition forces, as well as geopolitical assets from Cruise Missiles, Aircraft, Unmanned Air Vehicles, Tactical Ballistic Missiles, Large Caliber Rockets, and Surface Moving Targets.

A JLENS Orbit consists of two systems: a fire control radar system and a wide-area surveillance radar system.  Each radar system consists of a separate 74-meter tethered aerostat, mobile mooring station, radar and communications payload, processing station, and associated ground support equipment.  The systems are designed to work together, but can operate independently.  The JLENS Orbit is transportable by road, rail, sea and air.

JLENS uses advanced sensor and networking technologies to provide persistent, 360-degree, wide-area surveillance and precision tracking of Land Attack Cruise Missiles and other types of Air Breathing Threats.  This information is distributed via joint service networks and provides fire control quality data to Surface to Air missile systems, such as Army Patriot and Navy Aegis, increasing the weapons' capabilities by allowing systems to engage targets normally below, outside, or beyond surface based weapons' field of view. JLENS also provides fire control quality data to fighter aircraft, allowing the aircraft to engage hostile threats from extended ranges, and contributes to the development of a single integrated air picture.

JLENS Product Office successfully demonstrated the system's operational capability with the Weapon Systems Evaluation Program (WSEP) proof of concept for the National Capital Region Integrated Air Defense System exercise.  The Exercise used JLENS with an United States Air Force (USAF) operational aircraft and a Norwegian Advanced Surface to Air Missile System (NASAMS), to track and neutralize targets in August 2013.

JLENS has been directed to support a Homeland Defense Operational Exercise in the National Capital Region (NRC) from Fiscal Year (FY) 2014 to FY 2017 and will be assessed during the exercise to support a follow on decision from the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC).  The JLENS Product Office has a requirement for the acquisition of services through the JLENS Exercise Contract to support the deployment of a JLENS Orbit at Aberdeen Proving Grounds (APG), MD as directed by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memorandum (JROCM) 021-13 signed by the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on 31 January 2013.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

On 28 Jun 05, the Defense Acquisition Board (DAB) approved the JLENS program for entry into Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD).  The DAB elected to maintain oversight of JLENS as an Acquisition Category (ACAT) 1D program as stated in the Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) signed on August 5, 2005.

On 24 May 2012, the Acting Defense Acquisition Executive (DAE) signed the JLENS Nunn-McCurdy (NM) ADM certifying the restructured JLENS Program, and signed a memorandum rescinding the Milestone B approval for the JLENS program, originally granted on August 5, 2005.  This ADM directed the Army to restructure the JLENS program to consist of two Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Orbits; complete scheduled EMD tests and evaluation, to include the Naval Integrated Fire Control-Counter Air demonstration, Limited User Test, Developmental Test 2, and Developmental Test 3; to assist in site selection and planning for the employment of one JLENS Orbit to support an operational Continental United States based exercise.  Letters were provided to Congress notifying them that the NM review was complete and the program was certified and restructured as detailed above.

The Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) reviewed the results of the Army's 60 Day Deep-Dive employment assessment of JLENS for Homeland Defense and concurred with the proposed JLENS employment to Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD for an operational exercise duration Fiscal Year 2014-2017.

The JLENS Acquisition Program Baseline (APB) was reset by the Nunn-McCurdy Process in accordance with 10 U.S.C. § 2435(d). The proposed APB was signed by the Army Acquisition Executive (AAE) on 10 July 2013 and the Defense Acquisition Executive (DAE) on 8 August 2013. The new Acquisition Program Baseline (APB) reclassified the Joint Land Attack Cruise Missile Defense Elevated Netted Sensor System (JLENS) program as an Acquisition Category (ACAT) IC program and removed all Nunn-McCurdy unit cost breaches and reporting requirements.

JLENS has been directed to support the Homeland Defense Operational Exercise in the National Capital Region from FY 2014 to FY 2017 and will be assessed during the exercise to support a follow on decision from Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC).  The JLENS Product Office has a requirement for the acquisition of services through the JLENS Exercise Contract to support the deployment of JLENS Orbit deployed at Aberdeen Proving Grounds (APG), MD as directed by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memorandum (JROCM) 021-13 signed by the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on 31 January 2013.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>An FY 2014 Congressional realignment divided the JLENS Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) funding line between two separate Program Elements (PEs). PE/Project 0102419A/E55 funds the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) and a second PE/Project 0202429A/EP8 funds the JLENS COCOM Exercise.

The FY 2016 funding request was reduced by $10.366 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Joint Land Attack Cruise Missile Defense Elevated Netted Sensor System (JLENS) is a supporting program for Army and Joint Integrated Air and Missile Defense, providing elevated, persistent, over the horizon surveillance and fire control quality data on Army and Joint networks, enabling protection of the U.S. and coalition forces as well as critical geo political assets from Cruise Missiles, Aircraft, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, Tactical Ballistic Missiles, Large Caliber Rockets, and Surface Moving Targets.  A JLENS Orbit consists of two systems: a fire control radar system and a wide-area surveillance radar system. Each radar system consists of a separate 74-meter tethered aerostat, mobile mooring station, radar and communications payload, processing station, and associated ground support equipment. The systems are designed to work together, but can operate independently. The JLENS Orbit is transportable by road, rail, sea and air.  

JLENS uses advanced sensor and networking technologies to provide persistent, 360-degree, wide-area surveillance and precision tracking of Land Attack Cruise Missiles and other types of Air Breathing Threats. This information is distributed via joint service networks and provides fire control quality data to Surface to Air missile systems, such as Army Patriot and Navy Aegis, increasing the weapons' capabilities by allowing systems to engage targets normally below, outside, or beyond surface based weapons' field of view. JLENS also provides fire control quality data to fighter aircraft, allowing the aircraft to engage hostile threats from extended ranges, and contributes to the development of a single integrated air picture.

JLENS will participate in the NORAD-USNORTHCOM National Capital Region IADS Operational Exercise (OPEX) from FY14- FY17.  The OPEX will include an operational assessment to "inform a future decision for enduring operational employment", in accordance with Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memorandum (JROCM) 021-13.  The Combatant Command (CCMD) objective for the OPEX is to provide the full range of JLENS Orbit level capability to include: Persistent Wide Area Surveillance (WAS) through Battle Command System Fixed (BCS-F) Integration Combat Identification (CID) / Electronic Identification (EID) Precision Cue to Fighters/Ground-Based Air Defense (GBAD) via Tactical Data Link (TDL) Integrated Fire Control to Fighters (IFC)/GBAD via TDL.

The JLENS Product Office has a requirement for the acquisition of services through the JLENS Exercise Contract to support the deployment of a JLENS Orbit at Aberdeen Proving Grounds (APG), MD as directed by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memorandum (JROCM) 021-13 signed by the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on 31 January 2013.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>An FY 2014 Congressional realignment divided the JLENS Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) funding line between two separate Program Elements (PEs). PE/Project 0102419A/E55 funds the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) and a second PE/Project 0202429A/EP8 funds the JLENS COCOM Exercise.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>JLENS is a supporting program for Army and Joint Integrated Air and Missile Defense, providing elevated, persistent, over the horizon surveillance and fire control quality data on Army and Joint networks, enabling protection of the U.S. and coalition forces as well as critical geo-political assets from Cruise Missiles, Aircraft, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, Tactical Ballistic Missiles, Large Caliber Rockets, and Surface Moving Targets.  A JLENS Orbit consists of two systems: a fire control radar system and a wide-area surveillance radar system. Each radar system consists of a separate 74-meter tethered aerostat, mobile mooring station, radar and communications payload, processing station, and associated ground support equipment. The systems are designed to work together, but can operate independently. The JLENS Orbit is transportable by road, rail, sea and air.  

JLENS uses advanced sensor and networking technologies to provide persistent, 360-degree, wide-area surveillance and precision tracking of Land Attack Cruise Missiles and other types of Air Breathing Threats. This information is distributed via joint service networks and provides fire control quality data to Surface to Air missile systems, such as Army Patriot and Navy Aegis, increasing the weapons' capabilities by allowing systems to engage targets normally below, outside, or beyond surface based weapons' field of view. JLENS also provides fire control quality data to fighter aircraft, allowing the aircraft to engage hostile threats from extended ranges, and contributes to the development of a single integrated air picture.

JLENS will participate in the NORAD-USNORTHCOM National Capital Region IADS Operational Exercise (OPEX) from FY14- FY17.  The OPEX will include an operational assessment to "inform a future decision for enduring operational employment", in accordance with Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memorandum (JROCM) 021-13.  The Combatant Command (CCMD) objective for the OPEX is to provide the full range of JLENS Orbit level capability to include: Persistent Wide Area Surveillance (WAS) through Battle Command System Fixed (BCS-F) Integration Combat Identification (CID) / Electronic Identification (EID) Precision Cue to Fighters/Ground-Based Air Defense (GBAD) via Tactical Data Link (TDL) Integrated Fire Control to Fighters (IFC)/GBAD via TDL.

The JLENS Product Office has a requirement for the acquisition of services through the JLENS Exercise Contract to support the deployment of a JLENS Orbit at Aberdeen Proving Grounds (APG), MD as directed by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memorandum (JROCM) 021-13 signed by the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on 31 January 2013.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>JLENS has been directed to support the Homeland Defense Operational Exercise in the National Capital Region from FY 2014 to FY 2017 and will be assessed during the exercise to support a follow on decision from Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC).  The JLENS Product Office has a requirement for the acquisition of services through the JLENS Exercise Contract to support the deployment of JLENS Orbit deployed at Aberdeen Proving Grounds (APG), MD as directed by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memorandum (JROCM) 021-13 signed by the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on 31 January 2013.

Exercise preparation was conducted in FY 2013 on a limited basis to facilitate 2014 Activities as funding became available. Site development was projected to be completed 2014 with MILCON funding, followed by emplacement of the Orbit on the developed tactical sites at APG in 1Q 2015. Due to new start constraints related to the Continuing Resolution Act (CRA), MILCON funding was not received in time to complete construction in 2014 as planned.The sites are being constructed sequentially with the Surveillance Radar System (SuS) being the first to be completed.  Current projection for both sites to be completed is June 2015.  To allow operations to commence as early as possible, the MILCON contractor agreed to co-occupancy of the SuS site to allow JLENS System Integration and Check-out concurrent with completion of MILCON activities.

Transfer of operational control for operations to the Combatant Command is expected to be in 2QFY15 with end of the exercise at the end of 3QFY2017.  The Orbit will be disassembled and placed in storage at the conclusion of the Exercise unless directed otherwise.  The COCOM Exercise Contract is to support the JLENS NCR Exercise at APG, MD.  December 5, 2014 the contract was awarded as an Undefinitized Contract Action (UCA) for the 6 month base period of the contract.  The contract is scheduled to be definitized and Option 1 awarded by May 2015.  This contract is planned to have 3 option periods beginning every June until the contract ends in September 2017.

The JLENS system is sustained by a two-Level maintenance concept consisting of Field and Sustainment Levels.  Sustainment level maintenance for common support equipment is supported by standard Army procedures and all sustainment level maintenance for JLENS peculiar or unique equipment is provided by the Prime Contractor.  Prime Contractor will serve as the supply chain manager and ensure failed spares are requisitioned and replaced to ensure system is operational.  There is no organic capability for the JLENS peculiar equipment at this time.  The JLENS Product Office retains major end item management responsibilities and performs oversight of the contractor's efforts.

A recommendation for continuing JLENS operations as an enduring mission will be considered by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) based on results of the Combatant Commander's assessment of the initial operations period in support of the NCR Exercise.   Upon receipt of direction to proceed with Enduring Mission or to store or dispose of the system, the Department of Defense will address funding needs to meet the requirements of the decision.  Based on the system being an EMD versus Production unit, an enduring mission decision will require major technical refresh of the system due to obsolescence and wear and tear. A competitive or sole source contract will be pursued if the decision is for an enduring mission.  The current budget provides funding through FY 2017 for the JLENS Homeland Defense Operational Exercise and FY 2018 for program close-out.  Depending on the results of the enduring mission decision, POM submissions will be required for continued operations, to include technical refresh, for transportation to storage and cost of storage, or for transportation to appropriate location for demilitarization along with the cost of demilitarization. 

The EMD contract was completed 31 December 2013 and close-out tasks were initiated.  The SDD JLENS Systems, sub-systems, components, etc. were transferred to the Government on 19 December 2013 via DD250s.  A modification to the current Engineering Services contract was awarded on 20 December 2013, incorporating all Government Furnished Property (GFP).  The current Engineering Services Contract will continue through September 30th, 2015, for technical refresh assessments; conducting analysis required in support of the Homeland Defense Exercise; training of soldiers; maintaining equipment until ready for shipment to the exercise location; packaging, handling and transportation of equipment to the exercise location; and system set-up, integration and check-out.   The JLENS Product Office anticipates that a new technical requirements contract will be awarded in the first quarter of 2016 for contractor technical requirements support during the Exercise.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>The Army Acquisition Executive (AAE) determined that AFATDS Increment 2 (program element 0203726A project code DU5) is a software modernization effort of the existing AFATDS program. Therefore, the Army moved funding for AFATDS Increment 2 from program element 0203726A project code DU5 (PB2015 BLIN 163), to the current AFATDS funding (program element 0203728A project code EF8) as AFATDS version 7.0.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) provides the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps automated fire support command, control and communications. AFATDS is used to plan, execute, and deliver lethal and non-lethal effects. AFATDS provides Joint/Coalition Situational Awareness for fires execution and mission management. The system interoperates and integrates with over 80 different battlefield systems, including Navy and Air Force command and control weapon systems; and the German, French, Turkish, and Italian fire support systems. AFATDS automates the planning, coordination, and control of all fire support assets (field artillery, mortars, close air support, naval gunfire, attack helicopters, offensive electronic warfare, fire support meteorological systems, forward observers, and fire support radars). AFATDS provides eleven core services that manage user input and handle dissemination of complex fires processes. These core services are: Attack/Engagement Analysis, Fire Support Planning, Mission Guidance, Target Definition, Mission Area Definition, Cross-System Graphics/Mapping management, Unit Task Organization Data, Fires Conflict Detection, Mobile Air/Ground Tracking, Mission Execution and Mission Trigger Events. These AFATDS services promote situational awareness of data, intelligence information and targeting data, in near real time, in order to effectively manage target selection and target engagement in accordance with the Maneuver Commanders guidance and priorities. 

Joint Automated Deep Operations Coordination System (JADOCS) is a Joint and Coalition targeting, coordination, and de-confliction mission management software application. It links Command and Control (C2), Intelligence, and Air operations information with execution systems using real time collaborative targeting managers, customized for each service or specific functional area.  JADOCS is used to significantly enhance the Joint Force and Component Command's capability to simultaneously develop, coordinate and execute dynamic and Time Sensitive Targets as well as planned targets and fire missions. JADOCS provides coordination and de-confliction of targeting information at all levels of command structure for the military as well as enabling common system information exchange to coordinate, collaborate, and de-conflict missions. The JADOCS' system–to–system interface enables automated communications with Joint and Coalition systems to minimize targeting process time and increase dynamic targeting accuracy. JADOCS coordination managers provide operators and commanders with a clear definition of the targeting cycle's workflow process steps, responsibilities and status. JADOCS is used by Air, Ground, Maritime, and Special Operations forces supporting time sensitive and dynamic targeting, battle space coordination, search and rescue, and disaster relief / recover operations worldwide. It provides horizontal (across Services) as well as vertical (within Services) coordination of missions to ensure a common picture of targeting operational status across the entire Joint force. Mission Summary windows display the coordination and targeting status of each mission using intuitive color coded indicators referred to as coordination status. As a software application, JADOCS can be configured and customized for each user and location. The client and server software can be installed on typical Windows OS.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>AFATDS version 6.7 is the current fielded version of software.  Product Director, Fire Support Command and Control (PdD FSC2) fielded AFATDS version 6.8.0 to the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in June 2013.  PdD FSC2 fielded AFATDS version 6.8.0.1 in September 2014 to maintain compatibility with the fielded Joint Automated Deep Operations Coordination System (JADOCS) version 1.0.5.2.  AFATDS version 6.8.1.1 remains under development with a Full Materiel Release projected for 3QFY2016.  The PM projects that AFATDS version 6.8.1.1, the final software improvement under the superseded AFATDS Operational Requirements Document (ORD), will achieve Full Operational Capability (FOC) in 4QFQ2016.

Based on the approved AFATDS Increment 2 Capability Development Document (CDD), the Army Acquisition Executive approved the development of AFATDS version 7.0.  This is a modernization of the existing software code to meet the approved key performance parameters as well as meet Army Common Operating Environment (COE) standards.  The PM will re-design AFATDS version 7.0 to provide the operator role/duty-based interaction, a dynamic embedded training capability, and allowance for more efficient insertion of future capabilities.  The PM will competitively award this contract for this effort in 3QFY2016 with fielding projected for FY2019.

Development of future AFATDS capabilities will be considered based on requirements approved through the Fires Center of Excellence (FCoE) Tactical Software Requirements Governance Board.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>Effective for PB2015: funds ($5.425 million) were transferred to program element 0203728A project code EF8 from program element 0203726A project code 322 (PB2014 BLIN 161) due to Major Automated Information System (MAIS) transparency requirements; funds ($12.300 million) were transferred to program element 0203728A project code EF8 from program element 0203726A project code DU5 (PB2015 BLIN 163) due to Army requested transfer; funds ($8.800 million) were removed from program element 0203726A project code DU5 (PB2015 BLIN 163) due to program delays. 

The Army Acquisition Executive (AAE) determined that AFATDS Increment 2 (program element 0203726A project code DU5) is a software modernization effort of the existing AFATDS program. Therefore, the Army moved funding for AFATDS Increment 2 from program element 0203726A project code DU5, to the current AFATDS funding (program element 0203728A project code EF8) as AFATDS version 7.0. Previous "AFATDS Increment 1" efforts are delineated as V6.x in program element 0203728A project code EF8.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) provides the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps automated fire support command, control and communications. AFATDS is used to plan, execute, and deliver lethal and non-lethal effects. AFATDS provides Joint/Coalition Situational Awareness for fires execution and mission management. The system interoperates and integrates with over 80 different battlefield systems, including Navy and Air Force command and control weapon systems; and the German, French, Turkish, and Italian fire support systems. AFATDS automates the planning, coordination, and control of all fire support assets (field artillery, mortars, close air support, naval gunfire, attack helicopters, offensive electronic warfare, fire support meteorological systems, forward observers, and fire support radars).

AFATDS provides eleven core services that manage user input and handle dissemination of complex fires processes. These core services are: Attack/Engagement Analysis, Fire Support Planning, Mission Guidance, Target Definition, Mission Area Definition, Cross-System Graphics/Mapping management, Unit Task Organization Data, Fires Conflict Detection, Mobile Air/Ground Tracking, Mission Execution and Mission Trigger Events. These AFATDS services promote situational awareness of data, intelligence information and targeting data, in near real time, in order to effectively manage target selection and target engagement in accordance with the Maneuver Commanders guidance and priorities.  

AFATDS FY15 funding in the amount $1.273 million will support efforts to finalize AFATDS V7.0 requirements through market studies and contracted research, and contracting efforts (Request For Information, Request For Proposal, Performance Work Statement, etc).

Funding in FY16 through FY20 was moved from program element 0203726A project code DU5 (PB2015 BLIN 163), formerly known as AFATDS Increment 2. The Army Acquisition Executive (AAE) decided that AFATDS Increment 2 was a software modernization effort instead of a new acquisition program. The AAE determined that AFATDS Increment 2 reflected a modernization of the software code for the current AFATDS Project Manager (PM) Mission Command presented a Software Change Proposal for the current AFATDS as the appropriate approach to execute this effort. PM Mission Command will execute AFATDS software version 7.0 development effort as a follow on to the current AFATDS program.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>AFATDS version 6.7 is the current fielded version of software.  AFATDS version 6.8.0 was fielded to the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in June 2013.  Product Director, Fire Support Command and Control (FSC2) fielded AFATDS version 6.8.0.1 in September 2014 to maintain compatibility with the fielded Joint Automated Deep Operations Coordination System (JADOCS) version 1.0.5.2.  AFATDS version 6.8.1 remains under development with a Full Materiel Release projected for 3QFY2016.  AFATDS version 6.8.1.1, the final software improvement under the superseded AFATDS Operational Requirements Document (ORD), is projected to achieve Full Operational Capability (FOC) in 4QFQ2016.

Based on the approved AFATDS Increment 2 Capability Development Document (CDD) (CARDS # 04031), the Army Acquisition Executive approved the development of AFATDS version 7.0.  This is a modernization of the existing software code to meet the approved key performance parameters as well as meet Army Common Operating Environment (COE) standards.  AFATDS version 7.0 will be re-designed to provide the operator role/duty-based interaction with a dynamic embedded training capability, as well as allow for more efficient insertion of future capabilities.  The contract for this effort will be competitively awarded with fielding projected for FY2019.

Development of future AFATDS capabilities will be considered based on requirements approved through the Fires Center of Excellence (FCoE) Tactical Software Requirements Governance Board.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Joint Automated Deep Operations Coordination System (JADOCS) software provides joint fire support management, and common operational picture (COP) capabilities.  JADOCS complements the Mission Command architecture with joint and collaborative capabilities that can be employed and tailored based on the unit mission and operational situation.  JADOCS software provides integration between multiple joint command and control (C2) systems of the uniformed services involved in the targeting process at US Army, US Air Force, US Navy, US Marine Corps, Combatant Commands, and Special Operations Command.

Project F19 funds development of JADOCS Version(v) 2.0 software which is the final version of JADOCS to be developed with new functionality.  JADOCS v2.0 is required to incorporate critical Joint requirements into JADOCS.  These requirements include modification and updates for joint user interfaces, updates to targeting databases, and creation of non-kinetic targeting resources.  JADOCS v2.0 development is being completed by CECOM Life Cycle Management Command, Software Engineering Center (SEC).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>Project code EF6 (JADOCS) and EF8 (AFATDS) were previously funded in OSD program element 0203726A project codes F19 and 322 (PB2014 BLIN 161) up to FY2014.  Due to Major Automated Information System (MAIS) transparency requirements, beginning in FY2015, all non-MAIS funds were transferred out of 0203726A into 0203728A.   Beginning in FY2015, JADOCS funding is justified in project code EF6 and AFATDS funding in project code EF8.

The Army Acquisition Executive (AAE) determined that AFATDS Increment 2 (program element 0203726A project code DU5) is a software modernization effort of the existing AFATDS program. Therefore, the Army moved funding for AFATDS Increment 2 from program element 0203726A project code DU5 (PB2015 BLIN 163), to the current AFATDS funding (program element 0203728A project code EF8) as AFATDS version 7.0.  Previous "AFATDS Increment 1" efforts are delineated as V6.x in program element 0203728A project code EF8.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>There are three developmental efforts that are being executed concurrently: Joint Automated Deep Operations Coordination System (JADOCS) (project code EF6); Pocket-sized Forward Entry Device (Increment II) (project code EF7) and Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) (Increment I) (project code EF8). 

Joint Automated Deep Operations Coordination System (JADOCS) is a Joint and Coalition targeting, coordination mission management software application. It links Command and Control (C2), Intelligence, and Air operations information with execution systems using real time collaborative targeting managers, customized for each service or specific functional area. JADOCS is used to significantly enhance the Joint Force and Component Command's capability to simultaneously develop, coordinate and execute Dynamic and Time Sensitive targets and fire missions, as well as battle space coordination, search and rescue, and disaster relief/recover operations worldwide. JADOCS provides coordination and de-confliction of targeting information at all levels of command structure for the military. JADOCS system–to–system interfaces enables automated communications with Joint and Coalition systems to minimize targeting process time and increase dynamic targeting accuracy. JADOCS coordination managers provide operators and commanders with a clear definition of the targeting cycle's workflow process steps, responsibilities and status. JADOCS is used by Air, Ground, Maritime, and Special Operations forces. It provides horizontal (across Services) as well as vertical (within Services) coordination of missions to ensure a common picture of targeting operational status across the entire joint force. As a software application, JADOCS can be configured and customized for each user and location. The client and server software can be installed on typical Windows Operating System.

Pocket-sized Forward Entry Device (PFED) Increment II will be a software only application that operates on the Nett Warrior End User Device (EUD).  It will provide the dismounted Forward Observer (FO) and Fire Support Teams (FISTs) the capability and functionality to accurately and rapidly locate ground targets and enable the Nett Warrior ensemble to digitally process a Call For Fire. PFED Increment II aligns with the Army's Fires and Effects Concept of Operation and contributes to Networked Fires as part of the combined arms teams in Army, Special Operations Forces (SOF), and Joint operations.  PFED Increment II answers the Mobile Handheld Computing Environment requirement that all handheld applications reside on the Nett Warrior End User Device. Project code EF7 funds the evolutionary software development of this handheld Fires Command and Control (C2) system.

The Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) provides the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps automated fire support command, control and communications. AFATDS is used to plan, execute, and deliver lethal and non-lethal effects. AFATDS provides Joint/Coalition Situational Awareness for fires execution and mission management. The system interoperates and integrates with over 80 different battlefield systems, including Navy and Air Force command and control weapon systems; and the German, French, Turkish, and Italian fire support systems. AFATDS automates the planning, coordination, and control of all fire support assets (field artillery, mortars, close air support, naval gunfire, attack helicopters, offensive electronic warfare, fire support meteorological systems, forward observers, and fire support radars). AFATDS provides eleven core services that manage user input and handle dissemination of complex fires processes. These core services are: Attack/Engagement Analysis, Fire Support Planning, Mission Guidance, Target Definition, Mission Area Definition, Cross-System Graphics/Mapping management, Unit Task Organization Data, Fires Conflict Detection, Mobile Air/Ground Tracking, Mission Execution and Mission Trigger Events. These AFATDS services promote situational awareness of data, intelligence information and targeting data, in near real time, in order to effectively manage target selection and target engagement in accordance with the Maneuver Commanders guidance and priorities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

JADOCS CPD was approved in April 2012. Project EF6 funds development of JADOCS software version 2.0 to meet the CPD and Joint Users and COCOMs requirements. JADOCS fires and targeting capabilities will migrate to AFATDS Version 7.0. JADOCS capabilities will be sustained until AFATDS meets the Joint Users requirements. JADOCS v 2.0 software is being developed by CECOM Life Cycle Management Command, Software Engineering Center (SEC).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>On 29 January 2014, the Army Acquisition Executive (AAE) signed the Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) approving the PFED Increment II Materiel Development Decision (MDD). The Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) officially approved entry into the acquisition management system at the Technology Development phase as an Acquisition Category (ACAT) III program with the Program Executive Officer (PEO), Command, Control and Communications-Tactical (C3T) as the Materiel Developer and Milestone Decision Authority.

PFED Increment II leverages an Army Science and Technology investment by transitioning a software application that has been developed and used in proponent experimentation events (i.e. Army Expeditionary Warrior Experiment (AEWE) and Bold Quest). Upon a successful Milestone B decision in FY2015, this software application will be transitioned to PM Mission Command to conduct all Army developmental and operational test and evaluation requirements. PFED Increment II will be integrated onto the Nett Warrior End User Devices (EUDs) and will be fielded by PM Soldier Warrior (PM SWAR). Training on the PFED Increment II software will be conducted by PM Mission Command as units are fielded the capability.

The PFED Increment II CPD, dated 6 September 2012, was approved as an "Information Technology (IT) Box" requirement. As such, evolutionary development of the software will continue in order to meet emerging requirements that fall within the bounds of the approved IT Box.   PM Mission Command will continue to manage future capability Blocks of software development. PM Mission Command will continue to coordinate with PM Soldier Warrior to field and train future versions of the software, as described above.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>Effective for PB2015: funds ($5.425 million) were transferred to program element 0203728A project code EF8 from program element 0203726A project code 322 (PB2014 BLIN 161) due to Major Automated Information System (MAIS) transparency requirements; funds ($12.300 million) were transferred to program element 0203728A project code EF8 from program element 0203726A project code DU5 (PB2015 BLIN 163) due to Army requested transfer. 

The Army Acquisition Executive (AAE) determined that AFATDS Increment 2 (program element 0203726A project code DU5) is a software modernization effort of the existing AFATDS program. Therefore, the Army moved funding for AFATDS Increment 2 from program element 0203726A project code DU5, to the current AFATDS funding (program element 0203728A project code EF8) as AFATDS version 7.0. Previous "AFATDS Increment 1" efforts are delineated as V6.x in program element 0203728A project code EF8.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) provides the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps automated fire support command, control and communications. AFATDS is used to plan, execute, and deliver lethal and non-lethal effects. AFATDS provides Joint/Coalition Situational Awareness for fires execution and mission management. The system interoperates and integrates with over 80 different battlefield systems, including Navy and Air Force command and control weapon systems; and the German, French, Turkish, and Italian fire support systems. AFATDS automates the planning, coordination, and control of all fire support assets (field artillery, mortars, close air support, naval gunfire, attack helicopters, offensive electronic warfare, fire support meteorological systems, forward observers, and fire support radars).

AFATDS provides eleven core services that manage user input and handle dissemination of complex fires processes. These core services are: Attack/Engagement Analysis, Fire Support Planning, Mission Guidance, Target Definition, Mission Area Definition, Cross-System Graphics/Mapping management, Unit Task Organization Data, Fires Conflict Detection, Mobile Air/Ground Tracking, Mission Execution and Mission Trigger Events. These AFATDS services promote situational awareness of data, intelligence information and targeting data, in near real time, in order to effectively manage target selection and target engagement in accordance with the Maneuver Commanders guidance and priorities. 

AFATDS FY15 funding in the amount of $17.722 million is for the continued development and testing of the AFATDS 6.8.X Software Release which will align with the Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE) as it fits into the Army's overarching Common Operating Environment (COE) construct.  The COE has been directed by the AAE to align all Army networks, procurements, and enhancements.  

Network Assisted GPS for Precision Fires (NA GPS) is a development effort to improve performance and mission reliability for GPS-guided munitions. Regardless of terrain-constrained operational conditions and GPS degraded environments, NA GPS will permit Precision Fires Mission availability. NA GPS is tailored to support standardized messaging with Joint Battle Command-Platform (JBC-P), AFATDS, M777A2 Towed Howitzer Digital Fire Control System and Mortar Fire Control System. Network Assisted GPS for Precision Fires will complete the developmental effort in FY15.

Funding in FY16 through FY20 was moved from program element 0203726A project code DU5 (PB2015 BLIN 163), formerly known as AFATDS Increment 2. The Army Acquisition Executive (AAE) decided that AFATDS Increment 2 was a software modernization effort instead of a new acquisition program. Project Manager (PM) Mission Command presented a Software Change Proposal for the current AFATDS as the appropriate approach to execute this effort. PM Mission Command will execute AFATDS software version 7.0 development effort as a continuation of the current AFATDS program. 

FY16 funding in the amount of $19.219 will be used to initiate efforts on AFATDS version 7.0. This will include preliminary design reviews for the application and architectural infrastructure, human factors studies, and contracting (Request For Proposal, contract award). Software development will reorganize and optimize the technical foundation to provide a more adaptable baseline to accommodate future Army Common Operating Environment (COE) requirements while maintaining Joint Command and Control (JC2) interoperability.  PM Mission Command will develop a role/duty-based functional architecture (Fire Support, Fire Control, and Fire Direction) that reduces training workload and simplifies usage. AFATDS version7.0 will also provide embedded computer based training to decrease classroom burden and increase system usability.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>AFATDS version 6.7 is the current fielded version of software. Product Director, Fire Support Command and Contral (PdD FSC2) fielded AFATDS version 6.8.0 to the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in June 2013. PdD FSC2 fielded AFATDS version 6.8.0.1 in September 2014 to maintain compatibility with the fielded Joint Automated Deep Operations Coordination System (JADOCS) version 1.0.5.2. AFATDS version 6.8.1.1 remains under development with a Full Materiel Release projected for 3QFY2016. The PM projects that AFATDS version 6.8.1.1, the final software improvement under the superseded AFATDS Operational Requirements Document (ORD), will achieve Full Operational Capability (FOC) in 4QFQ2016.

Based on the approved AFATDS Increment 2 Capability Development Document (CDD), the Army Acquisition Executive approved the development of AFATDS version 7.0.  This is a modernization of the existing software code to meet the approved key performance parameters as well as meet Army Common Operating Environment (COE) standards.  The PM will re-design AFATDS version 7.0 to provide the operator role/duty-based interaction, a dynamic embedded training capability, and allowance for more efficient insertion of future capabilities.  The PM will competitively award this contract for this effort in 3QFY2016 with fielding projected for FY2019.

Development of future AFATDS capabilities will be considered based on requirements approved through the Fires Center of Excellence (FCoE) Tactical Software Requirements Governance Board.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>The Stryker Improvement Program (Project EE2) was submitted under a new Program Element for the FY 2015 President's Budget.  The previous Program Element was 0603653A/Project C03 and C51.   

The FY 2016 funding request was reduced by $55.853; Abrams (Project 330; $35.769) and Bradley (Project 371; $20.084) million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Army has approved engineering change proposals for the Abrams, Bradley and Stryker programs to restore lost platform capability and host inbound technologies.  

This Program Element (PE) corrects vehicle deficiencies identified in Army operations; continues technical system upgrades to include the integration of applicable technologies on ground systems; addresses needed evolutionary enhancements to tracked combat vehicles; and develops technology improvements which have application to or insertion opportunities across multiple Ground Combat Systems vehicles.  This PE provides combat effectiveness and Operating and Support (O&amp;S) cost reduction enhancements for the Abrams tanks, Bradley Fighting Vehicles and Stryker Family of Vehicles (FOVs) through a series of product improvements.

The strategy for Abrams and Bradley will focus on incrementally delivering capability to the warfighter to meet both near-term limitations as well as mitigating gaps and maintaining combat overmatch in the future.  This effort was approved by the Army Acquisition Executive in 3Q FY 2011.  

The Abrams M1A2 SEP V2 and M2/M3A3 Bradley Fighting Vehicles are at or exceed Space, Weight, and Power-Cooling (SWaP-C) limitations.  In order to host and restore lost platform capability, the Abrams Tank and Bradley Fighting Vehicle programs will execute a series of Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) to support the current embedded systems and to facilitate integration of technologies currently in development under other existing Programs of Record.  The ECPs are not intended to exceed the operational capability outlined in current system requirements documents, but rather to ensure that the existing system performance is not further degraded and that Army mission equipment packages can be integrated on the Abrams and Bradley Platforms.

Stryker Improvement Program will address Lethality, Survivability, Mobility, and Communication, Command, and Control (C3) issues with the Stryker family of vehicles.  Primary focus is on the Stryker ECP 1 effort which will enable the Stryker Double-V Hull (DVH) fleet to buy back the Space, Weight, and Power-Cooling (SWaP-C) that has been lost as a result of vehicle changes required to counter the evolving threats that were present in the Theater of Operations.  The ECP 1 effort will allow the DVH fleet to host the future network without further degrading vehicle performance.  The upgrade will increase available electrical power while ensuring adequate mechanical power, weight margin, and cooling.  Combined with a digital backbone, this will ensure that the DVH fleet can host the future network while retaining its protection and mobility.  Funding in FY16-20 supports continued development engineering, prototype build and testing efforts for Stryker ECP 1.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The M2/M3A3 Bradley Fighting Vehicle is at or exceeds Space, Weight, and Power-Cooling (SWAP-C) limitations. To restore lost platform capability and to host other Army Existing Programs of Record, the Bradley Fighting Vehicle program shall execute a series of Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs). ECP 1 improves vehicle's track and suspension while ECP 2 improves the power train and electrical system to enable the A3 fleet to host inbound technologies from Army Program of Records, including Handheld Manpack Small (HMS) Radios and Joint Battle Command – Platfom (JBC-P). The ECPs are not intended to exceed the operational capability outlined in current system requirement documents, but rather to ensure that the existing system performance is not further degraded and that Army mission equipment packages can be integrated on the Bradley platform. ECP 2 development effort will lead to a production start in FY 2017.   The Bradley M2A4 Vehicle is the combination of the Base Vehicle, ECP 1 and ECP 2.  A separate integration effort began in FY 2014 for an underbelly armor kit for improved survivability against blast threats.  Additionally, Improved Forward Looking Infrared (IFLIR) integration effort will begin in FY 2016 that will replace the current FLIR for increased lethality through improved target acquisition capability.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>Beginning in FY15, PE Number 0203735A/Project EE2 funds the Stryker Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) 1 program, which was previously funded by PE Number 0603653A/Project C03/C51.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Funding will address Lethality, Survivability, Mobility, and Communication, Command, and Control (C3) issues with the Stryker family of vehicles.  Primary focus is on the Stryker ECP 1 effort which will enable the Stryker Double-V Hull (DVH) fleet to buy back the Space, Weight, and Power-Cooling (SWaP-C) that has been lost as a result of vehicle changes required to counter the evolving threats that were present in the Theater of Operations.  The ECP 1 effort will allow the DVH fleet to host the future network without further degrading vehicle performance.  The upgrade will increase available electrical power while ensuring adequate mechanical power, weight margin, and cooling.  Combined with a digital backbone, this will ensure that the DVH fleet can host the future network while retaining its protection and mobility.  Funding in FY2015-2020 supports continued development engineering, prototype build and testing efforts for Stryker ECP 1.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>AAE approval for a 3rd DVH SBCT Bridgade of 337 Exchange Vehicles was given on July 26, 2013 (funded in G85100). ASARC production decision planned for 4th quarter FY2016 will provide approval to begin 4th Brigade DVH ECP 1 production, which will be funded in Stryker Upgrade (G85200).  Stryker MOD (GM0100) is for Stryker Fleet modifications to include ECP 1 retrofits to the Stryker fleet starting in FY19.  Prior to FY15, PE 0603653A/Project C51 funded the Stryker Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) 1 program.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Stryker ECP 1 effort will buy back the vehicle space, weight, and power margin lost due to the addition of numerous kits in response to eleven years of war (20-combat rotations &amp; 37+ million total miles), in order to allow integration of the future network (as directed by VCSA in August 2011) without further degrading the performance of the platform.  In May 2012, Stryker ECP 1 program (Phase I) was approved, permitting preliminary design and integration efforts on both the Flat Bottom (FB) and Double-V Hull (DVH) variants.  In March 2013, Phase II approved upgrading the mechanical power, electrical power generation, chassis upgrades and the in-vehicle network for the DVH vehicles.  Based on additional testing conducted in the summer of 2013, the decision was made to focus ECP efforts on the DVH and defer efforts on flat bottom Strykers.  ECP 1 Phase II contract, awarded November 25, 2013, continues development engineering, prototype build test and evaluation.  The Production decision (Phase III) will determine the production requirements of the technologies selected in Phase II.  Beginning in FY15, PE Number 0203735A Project EE2 funds the Stryker ECP 1 program, which was previously funded by PE Number 0603653A/Project C03 (FY13) and Project C51 (through FY14).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>FY 2016 funding will support core TMC missions. 

The decrease in FY2016-2020 funding reflects the realignment of Common Operating Environment (COE) Infrastructure development and application migration onto a new common core foundation to a separate funding line, Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE) PE/Project 0604818/EJ4.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Tactical Mission Command (TMC) is a suite of products and services that provide commanders and their staff executive decision making capability in a collaborative environment. The suite of products currently in development consist of Command Web (CW), Tactical Applications (TacApps), and an Army Voice Communication System (WAVE). TMC satisfies requirements and capabilities identified in the MCS 6.4 Capability Production Document and the Battle Command Sustainment Support System (BCS3) Capability Production Document.  The overarching capability includes a user-defined Common Operating Picture (COP) with integrated Command and Control (C2) and Situational Awareness (SA), map-centric collaboration, Army Mission Command Systems (and others) enabling system interoperability, data management, and enterprise services.  TMC contributes to Mission Command (MC) Convergence/COE development for commanders and staff to effectively conduct collaborative mission planning and execution across a range of operations and spectrum of conflict.   Legacy products supported by this Budget Item include Command Post of the Future (CPOF), Battle Command Common Services (BCCS), Logistics Widgets, and Common Tactical Vision (CTV).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The H-60L Digital BLACK HAWK, now designated as UH-60V, is designed to update the existing H-60L analog architecture to a digital infrastructure enabling the upgraded aircraft to have a similar Pilot-Vehicle Interface (PVI) to the H-60M.  The program will address current capability gaps and meet operational requirements by employing an evolutionary acquisition approach to leverage mature technologies that have been successfully integrated on other military aircraft.  The program will reduce obsolescence and increase commonality and interoperability by installing a digital cockpit, bussing and upgrading the communication/identification suite, improving navigation guidance, and integrating Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE), digital moving map, and Joint Variable Message Format (JVMF) messaging.

This line has been moved to the new PE 677135 starting in FY15 and out.

The Improved Turbine Engine Program (ITEP) develops, tests, and qualifies the next generation turboshaft engine.  The Improved Turbine Engine (ITE) replaces the existing T700 engine design originated in the 1970's and meets the operational requirement of 6K/95.  The ITE will fit inside the existing engine bays of the Black Hawk and Apache Helicopters and provides a significant power enhancement of up to fifty percent (total of 3,000 shaft horsepower) with increased fuel efficiency.  Additional benefits include improved design life, enhanced reliability, lower maintenance cost and restored capability lost due to aircraft weight growth, without increasing the logistics footprint.  The program consists of system engineering and program management,detailed design engineering, design assurance, hardware manufacturing and testing, component and module level development and testing, system level testing and qualification, as well as integration into the airframe. 

FY 2014 ITEP ($79.880M) funds system engineering/program management, continuing component testing, and initial airframe integration efforts.  All funding for ITEP for FY 2015 and beyond is located in Project Element (PE) 0203744A - Project EB1. FY 2014 UH-60V ($17.3M)  funded within PE 0203744A. Funds required for systems engineering/program management and preliminary hardware and software development leading to up to program readiness for preliminary design review</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The FY 2016 budget request for Apache AH-64E, previously known as Apache Block III, will fund the non-recurring engineering (NRE), development, and testing work associated with the planned remanufacture and new build of 690 Apache aircraft in the AH-64E configuration (deliveries began in Oct 2011).  The AH-64E - program consists of two Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAP), AH-64E Remanufacture and AH-64E New Build.  This project also addresses obsolescence and reliability challenges and provides increased combat capability to the aircraft.  Upgrades include: Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Level III-IV Control, Improved Situational Awareness, Upgraded Communications Suite, Improved Drive and Propulsion Systems, Improved Targeting Capability, Increased Computer Processing Capability and Speed, Improved Navigation Systems, and Improved Diagnostics and Maintainability.  Upgrades are integrated as incremental block modifications.  The program addresses operational shortfalls identified during real-world combat missions and meets Longbow Apache Capability Production Document (CPD) requirements for modernization.     

Funds will also provide for the development, integration and testing of the Modernized Rocket Launcher (MRL) with digital launcher electronics.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Horizontal Battlefield Digitization is a strategy that allows warfighters, from the individual soldier and platform to echelons above corps, to share critical situation awareness (SA) and command and control (C2) information. It conducts analysis and evaluation of new information technologies, concepts, and applications of integrated management activities. Digital information technologies to acquire, exchange, and employ data throughout the operational environment, are used to provide an operational picture for leaders. This timely sharing of information significantly improves the ability to quickly make decisions, synchronize forces and fires, and increase the operational tempo. The major efforts included in the program element are: 1) Integration and synchronization of the Army's interoperability efforts; between joint and multi-national forces, combat material, and training efforts. 2) Systems engineering and integration of hardware and software from a System of Systems (SOS) perspective. 3) Develop Army Equipping Enterprise System (AE2S) integration of the Force Development Investment Information System (FDIIS), Army Flow Model (AFM), and Force Development Knowledge Center (FDKC) programs into a single integrated system. 

Digitization efforts are in support of the Army Equipping Strategy, National Defense Authorization Act 804, and OSD reports to Congress.

The FY 2016 funding request was reduced by $1.755 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Project 038 Avenger Product Improvement Program (PIP):  The Avenger Air Defense System is a lightweight, highly mobile surface-to-air missile and gun weapon system mounted on a High Mobility Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV).  The system employs a canopied turret consisting of a gunner position, two gyro-stabilized missile launcher pods containing four STINGER missiles each, a Forward Looking Infrared Receiver (FLIR), a Laser Range Finder (LRF), an Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) system, and a very high rate of fire .50 caliber machine gun.  The gun system is used against ground targets and to cover the Stinger missile dead-zone.  Avenger is capable of day, night and adverse weather operations; can be transported by UH-60L Blackhawk helicopter or C-130 aircraft; is air-droppable and can shoot on the move.  The system can also be operated by remote control from a protected position up to 50 meters away from the fire unit.  

The Avenger system is operated by a two-man crew to counter Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs), cruise missiles, attack helicopters, and high performance fixed wing/rotary wing aircraft. The system fills the line-of-sight rear component of the Forward Area Air Defense (FAAD) system.

These funds are provided for the Avenger PIP to modify the Avenger to ensure viability and sustainability through the end of the useful life. Avenger will remain in the force through the Fiscal Year (FY) 30 timeframe according to the Long Range Investments Requirements Analysis. Avenger fills a capability gap which will be permanently filled by the Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment 2 Intercept (IFPC2-I) which will be fully fielded in FY30. The Avenger Fire Control Computer (AFCC) will undergo software and hardware upgrades that will enable the system to handle increased targeting capability realized with the latest version of the Forward Area Air Defense (FAAD) early warning system and ensures the system meets the latest Information Assurance (IA) requirements, upgraded analog to digital vehicle intercommunication system and Mode 5 cooperative target identification functions. 

Project DT5 Stinger Product Improvement: The Stinger Block I missile is an advanced, fire-and-forget, short-range, man-portable, air defense weapon system.  Stinger's mission is to provide the force with low-altitude air defense against fixed and rotary wing aircraft, unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and cruise missiles (CM).  Stinger employs an infrared (heat seeking)/ultraviolet seeker to guide to the target.  Stinger Block I has extensive infrared counter-countermeasure capabilities and can engage targets from any aspect to include head-on.  The missile utilizes a high-explosive, hit-to-kill warhead.  Stinger can be fired from the shoulder or from a variety of platforms to include vehicles, helicopters and UAS.  The missile is delivered as a certified round and requires no field testing or maintenance.  

The Stinger Product Improvement provides design, development, test and integration of a Proximity Fuze into the existing Stinger Block I missiles. The Proximity Fuze will improve system effectiveness against the evolving UAS threat. Unmanned Aerial System Defense (UAS-D) is a requirement of the Operational Requirements Document (ORD) for the Stinger Guided Missile System and validated by the Deputy Chief of Staff, G-3/5/7, Current and Future Warfighting Capabilities Division (DAMO-CIC) in memo dated 28 May 2013.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Stinger Block I missile is an advanced, fire-and-forget, short-range, man-portable, air defense weapon system.  Stinger's mission is to provide the force with low-altitude air defense against fixed and rotary wing aircraft, unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and cruise missiles (CM).  Stinger employs an infrared (heat seeking)/ultraviolet seeker to guide to the target.  Stinger Block I has extensive infrared counter-countermeasure capabilities and can engage targets from any aspect to include head-on.  The missile utilizes a high-explosive, hit-to-kill warhead.  Stinger can be fired from the shoulder or from a variety of platforms to include vehicles, helicopters and UAS.  The missile is delivered as a certified round and requires no field testing or maintenance.  

The Stinger Product Improvement provides design, development, test and integration of a Proximity Fuze into the existing Stinger Block I missiles. The Proximity Fuze will improve system effectiveness against the evolving UAS threat. Unmanned Aerial System Defense (UAS-D) is a requirement of the Operational Requirements Document (ORD) for the Stinger Guided Missile System and validated by the Deputy Chief of Staff, G-3/5/7, Current and Future Warfighting Capabilities Division (DAMO-CIC) in memo dated 28 May 2013.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS) is the United States (U.S.) Army's primary 24/7, all-weather, and surface-to-surface artillery precision missile used by current and future Combatant Commanders to shape the battlefield with long-range fires against hard and soft stationary targets in open, complex, and urban environments. This effort will not build any new missiles or add to the overall inventory.   Block (Blk) 1 missiles currently have warheads (WHs) that are non-compliant with the 2008 Department of Defense (DoD) policy on cluster munitions (CM).   The modification effort will take expired assets and reset them to a 10 year service life.  Under this modification effort, a policy compliant WH will replace the existing M74 bomblets and also replace electronics and propellants.  The Stockpile Reliability Program (SRP) will supply additional data to support extending the service life.  This effort effectively brings the expired inventory back into service, while meeting the DoD CM Policy, to engage imprecisely located/area targets up to 300 kilometers (km).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>G-BOSS(E):  Ground-Based Operational Surveillance System (Expeditionary) (G-BOSS(E)) will replace the interim Persistent Surveillance System-Ground (PSS-G) Increment 1 towers with improved persistent surveillance capabilities and will provide network integration and better mobility utilizing modular configurations.  G-BOSS(E) will replace obsolete, quick reaction capability (QRC) surveillance and force protections systems utilizing modular configurations: Light (man-transportable) for extra small base camps or small outpost/company, Medium (mid sensor height) for small to medium size base, and Heavy (high level sensor height) for large contingency base camps.  G-BOSS(E) will operate in a stand-alone mode or as part of an integrated network utilizing government owned software, be easily operated and maintained, and be rugged enough to support employment in expeditionary operations worldwide.  

IGSSR-C:  The Integrated Ground Security, Surveillance and Response Capability (IGSSR-C) is a requirement to provide a layered approach to integrate sensors, sensor systems and unmanned systems with automated fusion capabilities.   The system will provide a Force Protection (FP) Common Operational Picture (COP) capability for CONUS fixed, OCONUS semi-fixed or expeditionary elements in all Operating Environments (OE). This capability will enable rapid decision analysis, speed the response process as well as increase information dissemination horizontally and vertically along the chain of command and with outside supporting organizations.  IGSSR-C is a software centric fusion engine that connects legacy and emerging FP systems, legacy Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN), unmanned systems, biometric identification and forensic data systems.  The desired end state is to achieve interoperability and COP with current and emerging FP systems used by Joint Forces, Department of Defense (DoD) agencies and multi-national forces.

Integrated Base Defense (IBD): The purpose of IBD Kitting is to harvest and refurbish physical security and Force Protection (FP) Non-Standard Equipment (NS-E) and package them into integrated and interoperable IBD Capabilities.  IBD provides integration of software and analytical capability to support the integration of systems in the field.  IBD employs an enterprise approach to enable IBD capabilities across the operational spectrum by leveraging interoperability efforts in support of the Integrated Unit, Base and Installation Protection (IUBIP) framework.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>This project is a shared funding line.  Ground-Based Operational Surveillance System (Expeditionary) (G-BOSS(E)) and the Integrated Ground Security, Surveillance and Response Capability (IGSSR-C) are new starts in FY 2016.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>G-BOSS(E):  Ground-Based Operational Surveillance System (Expeditionary) (G-BOSS(E)) will replace the interim Persistent Surveillance System-Ground (PSS-G) Increment 1 towers with improved persistent surveillance capabilities and will provide network integration and better mobility utilizing modular configurations.  G-BOSS(E) will replace obsolete, quick reaction capability (QRC) surveillance and force protections systems utilizing modular configurations: Light (man-transportable) for extra small base camps or small outpost/company, Medium (mid sensor height) for small to medium size base, and Heavy (high level sensor height) for large contingency base camps.  G-BOSS(E) will operate in a stand-alone mode or as part of an integrated network utilizing government owned software, be easily operated and maintained, and be rugged enough to support employment in expeditionary operations worldwide.  

IGSSR-C:  The Integrated Ground Security, Surveillance and Response Capability (IGSSR-C) is a requirement to provide a layered approach to integrate sensors, sensor systems and unmanned systems with automated fusion capabilities.   The system will provide a Force Protection (FP) Common Operational Picture (COP) capability for CONUS fixed, OCONUS semi-fixed or expeditionary elements in all Operating Environments (OE). This capability will enable rapid decision analysis, speed the response process as well as increase information dissemination horizontally and vertically along the chain of command and with outside supporting organizations.  IGSSR-C is a software centric fusion engine that connects legacy and emerging FP systems, legacy Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN), unmanned systems, biometric identification and forensic data systems.  The desired end state is to achieve interoperability and COP with current and emerging FP systems used by Joint Forces, Department of Defense (DoD) agencies and multi-national forces.

Integrated Base Defense (IBD): The purpose of IBD Kitting is to harvest and refurbish physical security and FP Non-Standard Equipment and package them into integrated and interoperable IBD Capabilities.  IBD provides integration of software and analytical capability to support the integration of systems in the field.  IBD employs an enterprise approach to enable IBD capabilities across the operational spectrum by leveraging interoperability efforts in support of the Integrated Unit, Base and Installation Protection framework.

FY 2016  RDTE funding in the amount of $10.750 million supports the design and prototype development of the G-BOSS(E) in the amount of $5.750 million, IGSSR-C development/design efforts in the amount of $3.500 million, and the DOD IBD efforts in the amount of $1.500 million to provide enhanced situational awareness, increased efficiencies, and more effective responses for both tactical bases and CONUS/OCONUS Installations focused on system engineering, development efforts to upgrade systems and software development.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Ground-Based Operational Surveillance System (Expeditionary) (G-BOSS(E)) will replace the interim PSS-G Increment 1 towers with improved persistent surveillance capabilities along with network integration and better mobility utilizing modular configurations.  The G-BOSS(E) Capability Design Document (CDD) was approved May 2014.  In FY 2014, the Department of Defense (DoD) Physical Security Enterprise and Analysis Group (PSEAG) provided funds to conduct pre-milestone B activities.  It is anticipated that a G-BOSS(E) Materiel Development Decision (MDD) will occur FY 2015. Pending successful Milestone B decision, the existing US Marine Corps (USMC) tower's design (Ground Based Operational Surveillance System) (GBOSS) will be leveraged and upgraded to meet the Army's G-BOSS(E) tower requirement.  The Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) at Crane, Indiana will provide system design, development and integration.  Future funding will complete development and early Operational Testing (OT) leading to Milestone C in FY 2018.  Pending a successful Milestone C decision in FY 2018, the proposed acquisition strategy is to award a Low Rate Initial Production Firm Fixed Price (FFP) competitive contract in FY 2018, followed by Full Rate Production (FRP) in FY 2020.  

The Integrated Ground Security, Surveillance and Response Capability (IGSSR-C) provides a layered approach to integrate sensors, sensor systems and unmanned systems.  The IGSSR-C Capability Design Document (CDD) was approved September 2013 and Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics and Technology (ASA(ALT)) assigned IGSSR-C Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) to PEO IEW&amp;S in December 2013.  IGSSR-C is a suite of software that achieves integration, fusion and interoperability in support of the Army Acquisition Executive's Common Operating Environment (COE) Command Post Compute Environment (CPCE) effort.  In FY 2014, the Department of Defense (DoD) Physical Security Enterprise and Analysis Group (PSEAG) provided funds to conduct pre-milestone B activities.  The IGSSR-C Materiel Development Decision (MDD) is planned for FY 2015.  Pending a successful milestone decision and strategy approval, the plan is to award a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contract in FY 2016. This effort will provide for the design maturation/optimization and software/hardware integration.  Pending a successful Milestone C decision in FY 2018, the proposed acquisition strategy is to award a Low Rate Initial Production Firm Fixed Price (FFP) competitive contract, followed by Full Rate Production (FRP) contract in FY 2020.

The IBD acquisition strategy is to leverage existing IBD-related government organizations and to competitively award multiple contracts in support of IBD objectives for the development of holistic IBD architectures and products to support interoperability of fielded and emerging IBD-related systems.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Environmental Information Technology Management (EITM) Program is an Office of the Secretary of Defense sponsored program that was assigned to the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army for Environment, Safety and Occupational Health as the Department of Defense (DoD) Executive Agent by the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics in 2001.  The DoD Directive 4715.1E defined EITM mission is to ensure efficient use of enterprise environment, safety and occupational health (ESOH) corporate information management processes by providing and sustaining requirement-driven ESOH corporate data management, Congressional-reporting and public outreach tools to the DoD, and other DoD stakeholders.  Funding provided for this program will allow EITM to develop a Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Installations and Environment directed Chemical Management Enterprise Information Integration capability that will allow Army net-centric hazardous material and ESOH 2.0 NetCentric data management capabilities per the Secretary of the Army Directive 2009-03 "Army Data Management" and DoD Directive 8320.2 "Data Sharing in a Net-Centric Department of Defense."  Prior to funding being committed, Army and DoD environmental information technology stakeholders meet to determine which high priority EITM interface requirements need upgrades to incorporate new security and other information technology requirements.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The PATRIOT system includes a family of hardware, software, interceptors (GEM, PAC-2, PAC-3/MSE) and Ground Support Equipment.  As software and hardware improvements are developed, there is a continuing need for system level modeling, simulations, and tests.  Modeling and Simulation allow for performance assessment against all threats that would not be possible in flight tests due to cost, target and range constraints.  Flight testing is periodically required for validation of the Modeling and Simulation as well as satisfying Army Test and Evaluation Command/Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (ATEC/DOTE) requirements of segment improvements. 

PATRIOT is an integral part of the overall Air and Missile Defense (AMD) Architecture and enables the incremental fielding of the system capability for Army Air and Missile Defense Battalions.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The design objective of the PATRIOT system is to provide an element of an integrated Ballistic Missile Defense system capable of being modified to cope with the evolving threat.  This strategy minimizes technological risks and provides a means of enhancing system capability through planned upgrades of deployed systems.  PAC-3 system development efforts further improve system capabilities against emerging and reactive threats.  The PAC-3 Missile Program focuses on developing, fabricating and testing the high velocity, hit to kill, surface to air missile and associated ground support equipment to provide essential increases in battle space, accuracy, lethality and firepower to counter and destroy evolving air defense threats.  The missile performance is demonstrated through a series of flight tests and modeling and simulation activities.  The PAC-3 MSE program evolves the PAC-3 system providing extended ranges, insensitive munitions enhancements, and greater logistical flexibility.  The PAC-3 MSE will be fielded to U.S. PATRIOT units.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Projects EG2/EG3. GMLRS rockets are surface-to-surface artillery rockets fired from the Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) and High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) launchers.  GMLRS rockets provide 24/7, all-weather precision fires to engage both area and point targets at short, medium, and long ranges.  

The GMLRS Program consists of three separate increments: GMLRS Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munition (DPICM) cluster munition to engage area or imprecisely located targets; GMLRS Unitary that utilizes a 200 lb high explosive warhead to engage point targets with limited collateral damage; and GMLRS Alternative Warhead (AW) that is being developed as a non-cluster munition to replace GMLRS DPICM.  GMLRS DPICM Production was terminated in response to the June 2008 Department of Defense (DoD) Cluster Munitions Policy.  GMLRS Unitary is currently in full rate production.  GMLRS AW is currently in the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase and scheduled to enter full rate production in FY2015.  The GMLRS AW rocket is 90% common with the Unitary variant.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>Beginning in FY2015, Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) has its own separate Program Element, 0205778A, to include Projects EG2 (GMLRS Alternative Warhead) and EG3 (Guided MLRS), previously under Program Element 0603778A Project Codes 78G and 784, respectively.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The United States (U.S.) Army is funding the development of the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) Alternative Warhead (AW) increment under the EG2-GMLRS AW project code.  GMLRS AW is being developed as a non-cluster munition to replace GMLRS Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munitions (DPICM) and service the same area and imprecisely-located targets.  GMLRS DPICM Production was terminated in response to the June 2008 Department of Defense (DoD) Cluster Munitions Policy.

The GMLRS AW increment completed Milestone B (MS B) on February 19, 2012 and is currently in the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase.  The three-year EMD contract was awarded on March 30, 2012.  Funding was requested in FY2013 for the second year of the EMD contract and for other government and contracted EMD activities to include engineering developmental testing and the Critical Design Review (CDR).  GMLRS AW is scheduled for a combined Milestone C (MS C) and Full Rate Production (FRP) Decision in FY2015 and Initial Operational Capability (IOC) in FY2016.  Acquisition Strategy is to procure AW as part of the annual GMLRS FRP contract.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Joint Tactical Ground Station (JTAGS) is a post-production, ACAT III program and is designated as a DoD Space Program.  JTAGS provides missile warning message data for the Air and Missile Defense (AMD) architecture and improves performance for Integrated Air and Missile Defense Fire Control Systems/Composite Army Air and Missile Defense Brigades. The JTAGS Program Element (PE) supports development and test to meet JTAGS ORD thresholds using improved sensors and algorithms as Pre-Planned Product Improvements (P3I).  Presently, JTAGS Block 1 is a transportable information processing system, receiving and processing in-theater, direct down-linked data from Defense Support Program (DSP) and other Infrared (IR) satellites. JTAGS then disseminates near real time warning, alerting, and cueing information on ballistic missile launches and other tactical events of interest throughout the theater using existing communication networks, providing critical support to Combatant Commanders in their Areas of Responsibility (AOR).  Four OCONUS deployed JTAGS units constitute DoD's only in-theater system providing space-based missile warning.  The fifth CONUS system is being used as an institutional trainer but is a deployable asset.   JTAGS is designated as the in-theater element of the United States Strategic Command's Theater Event System (TES). JTAGS supports all Theater Missile Defense pillars and by being located in-theater, affords the shortest sensor to shooter connectivity.  P3I Improvements will upgrade JTAGS to a new Block 2 configuration for operation with the next generation of Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) satellites, and will improve warning tactical parameters and timeliness.  JTAGS Block 2 P3I is on contract for a two-Phase development effort. Phase 1 deshelters five systems, adds SBIRS Geosynchronous (GEO) scanner capability (FY 2012-15) and updates hardware/software/communication systems.  Phase 2 activities include stereo SBIRS GEO starer sensor data and Net Centric capabilities (FY 2015-18).  JROC-Memos 197-12 and 113-13 directs fielding of JTAGS P3I Block 2 Phase 1 by FY15 and Phase 2 by FY 2017.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Under this program element, critical improvements will be developed making maximum use of Non-Developmental Items (NDI)/Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) components.  After design and integration, the system will be subject to thorough developmental and validation/verification testing to verify performance, operational effectiveness and suitability. P3I Improvements will upgrade JTAGS to a new Block 2 configuration for operation with the next generation of Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) satellites, and will improve warning tactical parameters and timeliness.  JTAGS Block 2 P3I is on contract for a two-Phase development effort. Phase 1 deshelters five systems, addressing obsolescence issues, adds SBIRS Geosynchronous (GEO) scanner capability (FY 2012-15) and updates hardware/software/communication systems.  Phase 2 activities include stereo SBIRS GEO starer sensor data, Net Centric capabilities (FY 2015-18), and technical refresh issues (as required).  JROC-Memos 197-12 and 113-13 directs fielding of JTAGS P3I Block 2 Phase 1 by FY15 and Phase 2 by FY 2017.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY16 the following adjustments were made:

The FY16 funding request was reduced by $2.235 million to account for the availability of prior year funding execution balances. 

Information Assurance funding was increased by $9.725 million in support of defensive cyberspace operations.
Crypto Modernization funding was increased by $4.441 million in support of the embedded cryptographic modernization initiative.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Information Assurance Development supports the implementation of the National Security Agency (NSA) developed Communications Security (COMSEC) technologies into the Army by providing COMSEC system capabilities through encryption, trusted software or standard operating procedures, and integrating these mechanisms into specific systems in support of securing the National Network Enterprise in as transparent a manner as possible.  This entails architecture studies, system integration and testing, developing installation kits, and certification and accreditation of Automation Information Systems. The program assesses, develops and integrates Information Assurance (IA)/COMSEC tools (hardware and software) which provide protection for fixed infrastructure post, camp and station networks as well as tactical networks.  The cited work is consistent with Strategic Planning Guidance and the Army Modernization and Strategy Plan.

Information Assurance Development funding supports the technical assessment and specifications documentation of cryptographic, key management and IA capabilities in coordination with the NSA, the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), and Joint Services, to secure National Security Systems (NSS) and National Security Information (NSI).  Technical evaluations assess the security, operational effectiveness and network interoperability of advanced concept technologies to develop policies, standards, and fundamental building blocks for Army COMSEC capabilities.  Develop and publish the Cryptographic Modernization strategy to identify, standardize, and govern the insertion of IA capabilities to bridge operational gaps and support the DoD and NSA mandated requirements to enhance network capacity while providing for secure information exchange of voice, video, and data in accordance with the Army Network Campaign Plan.  This will be accomplished by interoperability, standards testing, and IA System of System Network Vulnerability Assessments (IA SoS NVA) of Army Capability Sets for IA/COMSEC capabilities that provide protections for fixed infrastructure post, camp and station networks. 

The Defensive Cyberspace Operations (DCO) program provides initial capabilities that enable passive and active cyberspace defense operations to preserve friendly cyberspace capabilities and protect data, networks, net-centric capabilities, and other designated systems.  Big Data Pilot provides an advanced analytics capability capable of ingesting structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data from multiple data sources (e.g., Joint Regional Security Stacks (JRSS), intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems, network device log files, trouble tickets, firewalls, proxies, web and applications server log files, etc) and proves situational awareness of cyberspace battlefield.  It provides the computer network defense provider with common analytic platform which informs and reduces risk associated with future material solutions and forms a blueprint for future Big Data Analytics.  Big Data (analysis-of-all DoD Information Network sensor data) provides two optimized and accredited clusters deployed in support of JRSS and Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN) with a tools suite accessible to Cyber Mission Forces via secure remote access.  The Army's DCO activities are a construct of active cyberspace defenses which provide synchronized, real-time capability to discover, detect, analyze, and mitigate threats to and vulnerability of DoD networks and systems. 

The Army Key Management System (AKMS) is the Army's implementation of the NSA Electronic Key Management System (EKMS) program automating the functions of COMSEC electronic key management, control, planning, and distribution.  Supports the Army's ability to communicate and distribute data on the Army's tactical and strategic networks by limiting adversarial access to, and reducing the vulnerability of, Army Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence (C4I) systems.  The NSA EKMS program is being replaced by the NSA Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) Program.  The AKMS System of Systems (SoS) systems components are the Local COMSEC Management Software (LCMS), Automated Communications Engineering Software (ACES) and Simple Key Loader (SKL).  The transition of the legacy EKMS LCMS to the modern KMI Management Client Nodes (MGC)s began in FY12 and must be completed by the LCMS sunset date of December 2017. AKMS supports the transition to AKMI. 
 
The Army Key Management Infrastructure (AKMI) is the Army's implementation of the NSA KMI ACAT IAM Program.  KMI further automates the functions of COMSEC electronic key management, control, planning and distribution.  AKMI supports the Army's ability to communicate and distribute data on the Army's tactical and strategic networks by limiting adversarial access to, and reducing the vulnerability of, Army C4I systems.  KMI provides an integrated, operational environment that brings essential key management functions in-band.  AKMI supports Department of Defense (DoD) Global Information Grid (GIG) Net Centric and Crypto Modernization Initiatives and supports emerging key management requirements.  AKMI achieves an Over the Network Keying (OTNK) solution to support emerging cryptographically modernized systems.  Some components of the AKMS SoS will be replaced under AKMI while others will be modified or adapted to meet the new KMI requirements.  The AKMI SoS includes the MGC Nodes, ACES and the NGLD Family.  

The Crypto Modernization program supports using NSA developed COMSEC technologies within the Army providing encryption, trusted software, or standard operating procedures, and integrating these mechanisms into specified systems in support of securing the National Network Enterprise in as transparent a manner as possible.  The Cryptographic Modernization Initiative (CMI) is designed to investigate Courses Of Action (COAs), conduct a Material Solution Analysis (MSA), and execute upgrade activities to ensure all enduring Army communications and data equipment that employs embedded cryptographic hardware will be able to accept and utilize modern cryptographic key.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program supports the implementation of National Security Agency (NSA) developed Communications Security (COMSEC) technologies into the Army by providing COMSEC system capabilities through encryption, trusted software, or standard operating procedures; and integrating these mechanisms into specified systems in support of securing the National Network Enterprise in as transparent a manner as possible. (PD Net E)

This entails architecture studies, system integration and testing, developing, installation kits, and certification and accreditation of Automation Information Systems. The program assesses, develops and integrates Information Assurance (IA)/COMSEC tools (hardware and software) which provide protection for fixed infrastructure post, camp and station networks as well as tactical networks.  The cited work is consistent with Strategic Planning Guidance and the Army Modernization and Strategy Plan. (PD Net E)

Funding supports the technical assessment and specifications documentation of cryptographic, key management and IA capabilities In Coordination With (ICW) the National Security Agency (NSA), the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), and Joint Services, to secure National Security Systems (NSS) and National Security Information (NSI).  Technical evaluations assess the security, operational effectiveness and network interoperability of advanced concept technologies to develop policies, standards, and fundamental building blocks for Army COMSEC capabilities. (CIO/G6)

Develop and publish the Cryptographic Modernization strategy to identify, standardize, and govern the insertion of IA capabilities to bridge operational gaps and support the DoD and NSA mandated requirements to enhance network capacity while providing for secure information exchange of voice, video, and data IAW the Army Network Campaign Plan.  This will be accomplished by interoperability, standards testing, and IA System of System Network Vulnerability Assessments (IA SoS NVA) of Army Capability Sets for IA/COMSEC capabilities that provide protections for fixed infrastructure post, camp and station networks. (CIO/G6)

The Defensive Cyberspace Operations (DCO) program provides initial capabilities that enable passive and active cyberspace defense operations to preserve friendly cyberspace capabilities and protect data, networks, net-centric capabilities, and other designated systems.  Big Data Pilot provides an advanced analytics capability capable of ingesting structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data from multiple data sources (e.g., Joint Regional Security Stacks (JRSS), intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems, network device log files, trouble tickets, firewalls, proxies, web and applications server log files, etc) and provides situational awareness of the cyberspace battlefield.  It provides the computer network defense provider with a common analytic platform which informs and reduces risk associated with future material solutions and forms a blueprint for future Big Data Analytics.  Big Data (analysis-of-all DoD Information Network sensor data) provides two optimized and accredited clusters deployed in support of JRSS and Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN) with a tools suite accessible to Cyber Mission Forces via secure remote access.  The Army's DCO activities are a construct of active cyberspace defenses which provide synchronized, real-time capability to discover, detect, analyze, and mitigate threats to and vulnerability of DoD networks and systems.

                                            <r2:Text>This COMSEC Modernization effort determines the maturity and viability of Cryptographic Key Management and IA technologies to ensure secure and interoperable National Security Systems and National Information.  It provides increased operational availability, enhances Cyber posture, ensures performance based standards are consistent with COE and the DoD Joint Information Environment (JIE).  Operational needs and assessments are reviewed and validated, identify fundamental building blocks for IA solutions and perform risk reduction testing of commercial products prior to insertion into Army for use.  Exercise oversight to improve process and technical solutions before making investment strategy decisions so that duplications will be reduced or eliminated.  Participate in operational assessment of NSA, DoD, Joint Staff and Service led Joint Capability Technology Demonstrations (JCTD) to align new technologies to documented Army and Service capability gaps for National Security Systems. Develop strategies and policies that leverage emerging cryptographic and key management tools and services. (CIO/G6)</r2:Text>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Army Key Management System (AKMS) is the Army's implementation of the National Security Agency's (NSA) Electronic Key Management System (EKMS) program automating the functions of Communications Security (COMSEC) electronic key management, control, planning, and distribution.  AKMS supports the Army's ability to communicate and distribute data on the Army's tactical and strategic networks by limiting adversarial access to, and reducing the vulnerability of, Army Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence (C4I) systems.  The AKMS System of Systems (SoS) systems components are the Local COMSEC Management Software (LCMS), Automated Communications Engineering Software (ACES) and Simple Key Loader (SKL).

The NSA EKMS program is being replaced by the NSA Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) Program.  The transition of the legacy EKMS LCMS to the modern KMI Management Client Nodes (MGC)s began in FY12 and must be completed by the EKMS Tier 2 sunset date of December 2017.

AKMS supports the transition to Army Key Management Infrastructure (AKMI).  Some components of the AKMS SoS will be replaced under AKMI while others will be modified or adapted to meet the new AKMI requirements.  Two critical components required for the transition include the development of the Mission Planning Management Support System (MPMSS) and the ability to support Over the Network Keying (OTNK).

MPMSS creates a secure, highly automated interface enabling transparent provisioning of KMI products.  MPMSS capability is developed by NSA but each Service is responsible for interface development and final integration into their infrastructure.  ACES is the initial target for the interface to MPMSS.  NSA will be providing additional capabilities and updates to the MPMSS interface specification through FY17.  The Army must then adjust to these changes delivered by NSA.   

One major enhancement in the KMI architecture is the ability for OTNK. The end state for the Army is to make all 1.5 million legacy ECUs KMI aware with OTNK.  Within AKMS this capability will be focused on the SKL.  The SKL will act as an interim solution for all legacy ECUs to be recognized on the KMI network until they can be upgraded to be fully KMI aware.  OTNK developments are expected to begin in FY2015 and continue throughout the POM. 

To support this transition, a new KMI compliant cryptographic engine must be developed.  The KOV-21 card used in current Army Tier 3 fill devices has hardware obsolescence issues and does not support OTNK.  Redesigning and developmental efforts using modern and readily available components for use in the Army's SKL devices have been initiated.  The redesign of the current KOV-21 card is referred to as the KOV-21 Replacement and is an extension of the KOV-21 card as a technology insertion.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Army Key Management System (AKMS) is an ACAT III Program of Record (POR) under PD Network Enablers (PD Net E).  It is the Army's implementation of the National Security Agency (NSA)'s Electronic Key Management System (EKMS).  The AKMS allows the Army to manage, control, plan, and distribute electronic key for the 1.5 million End Cryptographic Units (ECU)s necessary to communicate and distribute data on the Army's tactical and strategic networks. 

AKMS was initially approved for Milestone III in FY99.  The AKMS System of Systems originally included Local COMSEC Management Software (LCMS), Automated Communications Engineering Software (ACES) and Data Transfer Device (DTD) (AN-CYZ-10).  In 2QFY02, the PEO C3T Milestone Decision Authority approved the procurement of the Simple Key Loader (SKL) as the replacement for the DTD within the AKMS System of Systems (SoS) POR.  AKMS is a fully fielded POR that undergoes modifications to meet emerging operational needs.

The NSA EKMS program is being replaced by the NSA Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) Program.  As the DoD Key Management Lead, NSA is dictating the change from EKMS to KMI.  The Army's implementation of the NSA KMI is the Army Key Management Infrastructure (AKMI) program.  Some components of the AKMS SoS will be replaced under AKMI while others will be modified or adapted to meet the new AKMI requirements.  

The LCMS component of the AKMS SoS (AN/GYK-49) is fully fielded.  The LCMS is assigned to the COMSEC Account Manager/COMSEC Custodian.   LCMS most recent hardware refresh was completed in FY12.  The current software baseline is 5.1.0.5 with certain select accounts upgrading to v5.2 based on operational needs.  Further LCMS software releases are not anticipated.  LCMS workstations will be replaced by KMI Management Client (MGC) Nodes before the NSA mandated EKMS Tier 2 sunset of December 2017.  EKMS Common Tier 1 operations and Tier 1 operational support continues to be provided by CECOM.  LCMS hardware is sustained by CSLA until fully replaced by the KMI MGC.

The ACES component of the AKMS SoS (AN/GYK-33) current hardware platform is a Dell E6500 non-ruggedized laptop fielded to S6, Spectrum Managers and some COMSEC Account Managers at Battalion level and above.  ACES is undergoing a hardware technology refresh and will be replacing 1/5 quantity of laptops each year.  The current version of ACES is 3.4.  Software is released on an annual basis and coincides with the Capability Set delivery schedule.  PD Net E currently holds the software development contract.  As the Tier 2.5 component, ACES operates between the LCMS (Tier 2) and the SKL (Tier 3).  It links the key data from the LCMS with mission planning data for a single load by the SKL into the ECUs.  ACES will continue with modifications to support the AKMI System of Systems.  In order to support AKMI, ACES must be modified to seamlessly operate within the KMI architecture.

The SKL is the primary Army fill device and is the Tier 3 component of the AKMS SoS (AN/PYQ-10).  The SKL is fully fielded to the Army.  Army holds the sole full rate production procurement contract for the SKL, which is heavily utilized by other DoD and civil services as well as FMS customers.  The SKL repair capability is with the Original Equipment Manufacturer but TYAD is developing an organic depot repair support.  The SKL and its cryptographic engine are facing hardware obsolescence issues. SKL v3.1 in combination with a new KMI compliant cryptographic engine resolves these issues and lays the foundation for the Army's Next Generation Load Device- Medium capability.  The SKL v3.1 modifications will be made to the Army's existing fleet of the fill devices via a modification kit starting in FY15.  The KMI cryptographic engine is reliant on the CERDEC-led RESCUE RDT&amp;E eoffort that began in FY14.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>Key management Infrastructure (KMI) (DV4) was realigned from project 491 in FY2014.  KMI supports infrastructure requirements in support of Key Management.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Army Key Management Infrastructure (AKMI) is the Army's implementation of the National Security Agency's (NSA) Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) ACAT IAM program.  AKMI supports Department of Defense (DoD) Global Information Grid (GIG) Net Centric and Crypto Modernization Initiatives and supports emerging requirements transitioned from the Army Key Management System (AKMS).  KMI automates the functions of Communications Security (COMSEC) electronic key management, control, planning, and distribution.  KMI supports the Army's ability to communicate and distribute data on the Army's tactical and strategic networks by limiting adversarial access to, and reducing the vulnerability of, Army Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence (C4I) systems.  

The AKMI System of Systems (SoS) include the Management Clients (MGC), Automated Communications Engineering Software (ACES) and Next Generation Load Device (NGLD) Family.  KMI provides an integrated, operational environment that brings essential key management personnel and functions in-band.  AKMI achieves an Over the Network Keying (OTNK) solution to support emerging cryptographically modernized systems.

Two critical components required for the transition of AKMS to AKMI include the development of the Mission Planning Management Support System (MPMSS) and the ability to support OTNK.

MPMSS creates a secure, highly automated interface enabling transparent provisioning of KMI products.  MPMSS capability is developed by NSA but each Service is responsible for interface development and final integration into their infrastructure.  ACES is the initial target for the interface to MPMSS.  

The developmental efforts for MPMSS are resourced in the 501 project line. 

One major enhancement in the KMI architecture is the ability for OTNK.  The end state for the Army is to make all 1.5 million legacy ECUs KMI aware with OTNK.  The OTNK capabilities within the AKMI SoS will be found in the Next Generation Fill device family as outlined within the NGLD Capabilities Production Document. NGLD will be an enduring solution to bridge the gap until ~1.5 million legacy ECUs can be recognized on the KMI network or until they can be upgraded to be fully KMI aware.  

The NGLD is reliant on a new KMI compliant cryptographic engine that must be developed.  The KOV-21 card used in current Army Tier 3 fill devices has hardware obsolescence issues and does not support OTNK.  Redesigning and developmental efforts using modern and readily available components for use in the Army's SKL devices have been initiated.  The redesign of the current KOV-21 card is referred to as the KOV-21 Replacement and is an extension of the KOV-21 card as a technology insertion.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>KMI Awareness initiative creates a secure, highly automated interface in providing future Over the Network Keying (OTNK) capability to legacy End Crypto Units (ECUs).  This initiative will allow ECUs to receive, authenticate, and decrypt OTNK messages and increases WarFighter survivability by minimizing the need for Soldiers to travel to obtain keys. The KOV 21 card, previously in production through NSA for use in the Simple Key Loader (SKL) and the Secure DTD 2000 System (SDS), is nearing the end of life due to unavailability of parts. Redesigning and developmental efforts using modern and readily available components for use in the Army's SKL and Next Generation Load Devices (NGLDs) are currently underway. The redesign of the current KOV 21 card is referred to as the KOV 21 Replacement and is an extension of the KOV 21 card as a technology insertion. The KOV 21 Replacement will also address requirements codified in the NGLD CPD and the KMI CPD that were technologically unachievable with the KOV 21 card.</r2:Description>

The RESCUE effort is focused on the development, maturation, evaluation, and certification of the technology needed to meet the requirements of the Army's NGLDs and can be reused, scaled, and/or repackaged to satisfy the requirements for legacy ECUs, enabling a KMI aware ECU fleet.  The RESCUE effort will mature the required cryptographic technology to a Technology Readiness level (TRL) of six (acceptable) or seven (desired).  Once the RESCUE reaches its desired TRL, it will be tailored for use as the cryptographic engine for the development of the KOV-21replacement card.  The KOV-21 replacement will be developed to be compatible with and installed in the SKL v3.1 to meet the Army's NGLD Medium requirement.  The KOV-21 replacement will also be used in the future Army NGLD Large device.</r2:Text>

501: Army Key Management System (RDTE)</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Army Key Management Infrastructure (AKMI) is a Non Program of Record (POR) under PD Network Enablers (PD Net E).  AKMI is the Army's implementation of the National Security Agency (NSA) Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) ACAT IAM Program of Record.  The AKMI will allow the Army to manage, control, plan, and distribute electronic key for the 1.5 million End Cryptographic Units (ECU)s necessary to communicate and distribute data on the Army's tactical and strategic networks. 

AKMI initial Army Acquisition Program Baseline (APB) was approved 2QFY12.  The AKMI System of Systems (SoS) will include the Management Clients (MGC), Automated Communications Engineering Software (ACES) and Next Generation Load Device (NGLD) Family.  Each component of the AKMI SoS is in a different phase of the acquisition cycle.  

The NSA KMI Program is replacing the NSA Electronic Key Management System (EKMS) program.  As the DoD Key Management Lead, NSA is dictating the change from EKMS to KMI by a sunset date of December 2017.  Components of the AKMI SoS will be retained and adapted from the legacy AKMS program while others will be developed and fielded to meet AKMI requirements.  

The MGC component of the AKMI SoS (AN/GYK-72(V)1) is currently being fielded.  The MGC is assigned to the COMSEC Account Manager/COMSEC Custodian.   MGC low rate initial production began in FY12 and full rate production was achieved in FY13.  The Army has fielded Spiral 1 Spin 1 MGCs to 20 test and pilot accounts.  The remaining Army accounts will be fielded Spiral 2 Spin 1 or Spiral 2 Spin 2 software version before the NSA mandated EKMS Tier 2 sunset of December 2017.  MGC hardware will begin transition to CSLA for sustainment once all accounts are fielded.

The ACES component of the AKMI SoS (AN/GYK-33) hardware platform will be a non-ruggedized laptop fielded to S6, Spectrum Managers and some COMSEC Account Managers at Battalion level and above.  ACES will be retained from the legacy AKMS program to support planning requirements and key distribution for KMI.  Software will continued to be released on an annual basis to coincide with the Capability Set delivery schedule.  As the Tier 2.5 component, ACES will operate between the MGC (Tier 2) and the NGLD (Tier 3).  It links the key data from the MGC with mission planning data for a single load by the NGLD into the ECUs.  ACES will require adaptations to meet AKMI requirements and incorporate capabilities provided by the AKMI SoS CONOPS. 

The NGLD family will become the primary Army fill device and Tier 3 component of the AKMI SoS.  The NGLD Capability Production Document (CPD) was signed 4QFY13.  The NGLD CPD calls for a family of 3 devices (small, medium, and large) to meet the AKMI requirements.  The Army is evaluating existing fill devices to determine if they meet the NGLD small requirement.  The Army will gain the NGLD medium capability through the SKL v3.1 in combination with a new KMI compliant cryptographic engine.  The SKL v3.1 will be available in FY15.  The AKMI program is partnering with RDECOM CERDEC to develop a KMI compliant cryptographic engine.  The Army NGLD large strategy is highly reliant on the development of the new KMI compliant cryptographic engine and will drive a final acquisition decision in FY18.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>DV5 - The Crypto Modernization line was established in Sept 2012.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program supports using National Security Agency (NSA) developed Communications Security (COMSEC) technologies within the Army providing encryption, trusted software, or standard operating procedures, and integrating these mechanisms into specified systems in support of securing the National Network Enterprise in as transparent a manner as possible.  

This entails architecture studies, system integration and testing, developing installation kits, and certification and accreditation of Automation Information Systems.  The program assesses, develops and integrates emerging Information Assurance (IA)/COMSEC tools (hardware and software) which provide protection for fixed infrastructure post, camp, and station networks as well as tactical networks.  The cited work is consistent with Strategic Planning Guidance and the Army Modernization and Strategy Plan.

The Cryptographic Modernization Initiative (CMI) is designed to investigate Courses Of Action (COAs), conduct a Material Solution Analysis (MSA), and execute upgrade activities to ensure all enduring Army communications and data equipment that employs embedded cryptographic hardware will be able to accept and utilize modern cryptographic key.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>This program creates tools that can be used with current and future methodologies in order to determine what amount of cryptographic solutions can be deployed at the tactical edge.  This experimentation will allow for the WarFighter to have optimized solutions tailored for their specific program requirements while also showing trade-offs between competing solutions.  Examples of common analysis to be performed are comparisons in encryption implementations, network initialization overhead, comparison of emerging Commercial Solutions for Classified architectures with COMSEC architectures, development of new network security and management protocols optimized for low-bandwidth environments and impact of emerging dynamic capabilities that evade or obstruct the adversary.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>FY 2016 RDTE $8.934M added to begin GCSS-Army Increment II functionality. Funding will be for technology maturation,requirements analysis and initial prototyping.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Global Combat Support System-Army (GCSS-Army) program has two components: a functional component titled GCSS-Army and a technology enabler component titled Army Enterprise Systems Integration Program (AESIP). GCSS-Army coupled with AESIP are information and communications technology investments that will provide key enabling support to the transformation of the Army into a network-centric, knowledge-based future force. The GCSS-Army approved Capability Description Document (CDD) and Capability Production Document (CPD) require an enterprise approach to replace current logistics and maintenance Standard Army Management Information Systems (STAMIS). GCSS-Army will provide the Army's Sustainment Support for the warfighter with a seamless flow of timely, accurate, accessible and secure information management that gives combat forces a decisive edge. AESIP will provide the system's enterprise hub services, centralized master data management and cross-functional business intelligence/analytics. GCSS-Army will implement best business practices to streamline supply, accountability, maintenance, distribution, and reporting procedures in support of the future force transition path of the Army Campaign Plan.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>GCSS-Army is the tactical unit / installation logistics and financial system for the U.S. Army. GCSS-Army is an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solution that will track supplies, spare parts and organizational equipment. It will track unit maintenance, total cost of ownership and other financial transactions related to logistics for all Army units. This modernized application will subsume outdated Standard Army Management Information Systems (STAMIS) that are not financially compliant and integrate about numerous local supply and logistics databases into a single, enterprise-wide authoritative system. GCSS-Army will be financially compliant and is a key component for the Army Enterprise strategy to be financially auditable by the end of FY17. When fully deployed, GCSS-Army will affect every supply room, motor pool, direct support repair shop, warehouse, DOL and property book office in the Army.
GCSS-Army will modernize automated logistics by implementing best business practices to streamline supply operations, maintenance operations, property accountability, and tactical logistics and financial management and integration procedures in support of the Future Force transition path of the Army Campaign Plan.  GCSS-Army is a key component of the Federated ERP Integration solution that will optimize tactical logistics and finance domain business processes into a single federated approach.  It will eliminate the need for extensive maintenance and modification of aging, diverse software systems resulting in improved and efficient change control and configuration management through implementation of an enterprise system.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>GCSS-Army has an evolutionary acquisition strategy as defined in DoD Directive 5000.01 and DoD Instruction 5000.02 and will define, develop, and deploy an initial operational capability based upon proven technology, time-phased requirements, projected threat assessments, and demonstrated manufacturing capabilities. Increment 1 will be a viable stand alone capability that will not require subsequent releases to be operational.  

GCSS-Army Increment I is being implemented in three releases.

Release 1.0 replaces: Standard Army Retail Supply System (SARSS) at one Direct Support Unit (DSU) in the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment (ACR), Fort Irwin, California. An Operational Assessment (OA) was conducted on Release 1.0 and information is gathered through Continuous Evaluation. 

Release 1.1 subsumes Release 1.0 and provides over 80% of the required GCSS-Army capability. 

Release 1.2 represents the complete baseline with all required capabilities provided.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Army Enterprise Systems Integration Program (AESIP), mission is to integrate Army business processes by providing a single source for enterprise hub services, centralized master data management, and business intelligence and analytics. AESIP is the principle GCSS-Army Business Intelligence system and will aggregate data for enterprise reporting. AESIP will support the Army's federated approach and enable the integration of end-to-end logistical and financial processes. The Army has successfully addressed concerns about the lack of integration of ERPs by leveraging AESIP core capabilities and expanding those benefits across the Army enterprise. AESIP will be an Army specific commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) web portal implementation via the NetWeaver Platform from developer Systems Applications and Products (SAP) American Group to support Army process scenarios and requirements that will provide core competencies:

Enterprise Service Bus (Hub Services) - For a Service oriented, Single Point of Entry to connect, mediate, and control the exchange of data.
Enterprise Business Intelligence/Business Warehouse - Aggregates data from ERP and non-ERP systems to provide flexible Enterprise level reporting.
Enterprise Master Data Management - For a single source of authoritative data and improved workflow and business processes. 

The AESIP solution establishes a framework for a fully integrated ERP centric environment that will ultimately provide Commanders Total Visibility from Factory to Battlefield thereby ensuring delivery of the right equipment to the right unit at the right time, while reducing backlogs of material on the battlefield.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Global Combat Support System-Army (GCSS-Army) program has two components: a functional component titled GCSS-Army and a technology enabler component titled Army Enterprise Systems Integration Program (AESIP).  GCSS-Army coupled with AESIP are information and communications technology investments that will provide key enabling support to the transformation of the Army into a network-centric, knowledge-based future force.  Building on the foundation of GCSS-Army Increment 1, Increment 2 will provide the Army enhanced Business Intelligence / Business Warehouse (BI/BW) and Army Pre-Positioned Stock (APS) functional capabilities to deliver greater efficiencies and to improve information flow to decision makers.  Upon the completion of Increment II, the Army War Reserve Deployment System (AWRDS) will be eligible for retirement since the necessary functionality will have been replaced by GCSS-Army increments.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Military Satellite Communication (MILSATCOM) systems are joint program/project efforts to satisfy ground mobile requirements for each Service, the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), the National Command Authority, the combatant commanders, the Office of the Secretary of Defense, and other governmental, non-DoD users.  The worldwide MILSATCOM systems are: the Super High Frequency (SHF) Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS); the Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS); the MILSTAR Extremely High Frequency (EHF) Low Data Rate (LDR) and Medium Data Rate (MDR); the Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF); and future MILSATCOM capabilities. All of these systems are required to support legacy, interim and emerging communication space architectures and Future Force requirements. The Army is responsible for materiel development, acquisition, product improvement, testing, fielding and integrated logistics support of ground satellite terminals and SATCOM control subsystems and all associated equipment used to provide range extension of Mission Command Networks and Systems. The Army also participates in the development of MILSATCOM programs, including architectures, payloads, waveforms, antennas and terminal developments to ensure US Army equities are appropriately addressed with our sister services.  This includes technology assessment efforts associated with the integration of MILSATCOM components to US Army Landwarnet. This responsibility also includes maintaining the life cycle logistics support required to achieve end-to-end connectivity and interoperability, satisfying JCS network operations in support of the President, JCS, combatant commanders, Military Departments, Department of State, and other government Departments and Agencies. Project EK 8 to support testing for Enroute Mission Command (EMC)has been added to SATCOM Ground Environment programs in FY16.  EMC supports Global Response Force (GRF) and other Army units with the requirement to conduct Airborne forcible entry operations with the ability to conduct mission command.  

This program is designated as a DoD Space Program.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>FY2016 funding in the amount of $1.594 million finances Project Manager, Defense Communications and Army Transmission Systems (PM DCATS) netcentric systems engineering, modem risk mitigation, and DoD Information Assurance Certification Accreditation Process (DIACAP) support.  Funding provides for SATCOM terminal upgrades, enhancement of baseband throughput capabilities, technology insertion and upgrades which enhance decision support capabilities, allowing for full utilization of Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) capabilities.  Both the Wideband SATCOM Operational Management System (WSOMS) and the Enterprise Wideband SATCOM Terminal System (EWSTS) Capability Production Documents (CPDs) contain Netcentric-Ready Key Performance Parameters (NR-KPPs) as required by CJCSI 6212.01C.  Netcentric efforts are required to facilitate the migration from the current trunk-based communications systems to Internet Protocol (IP) based systems and to engineer, test and integrate IP based capabilities into EWSTS and WSOMS systems.  Studies, risk mitigation, system integration and advanced demonstrations for netcentric baseband and policy based control will accommodate technology insertion, data sharing, remote operations, architecture efforts and use of commercial technology, thus ensuring the life of the Defense Enterprise Wideband System (DEWSS) terminal family beyond 2025 and reducing lifecycle costs and enterprise requirements on the WGS and Defense Satellite Communication System (DSCS) satellites in the future.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM) System Engineering (SE) provides centralized funding for US Army participation in the joint development of MILSATCOM programs. This includes engineering, technical and cost related analyses supporting architecture, payloads, network and terminal requirement and design decisions across all MILSATCOM programs.

FY16 funds support the continued systems engineering required to mature technology options that demonstrate potential based on the results of the AoA and BAA studies.  These efforts have a direct impact on the ability of the WIN-T Military Wideband SATCOM, commercial SATCOM, and Protected SATCOM on the move for WIN-T with minimal development and programmatic risk.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Transportable Tactical Command Communications (T2C2) extends the Warfighter Information Network Tactical (WIN-T) network to small company and team sized early entry units. The T2C2 system is based on combat proven capabilities and provides robust voice and data communication capabilities. The T2C2 systems will also integrate users into the higher capacity WIN-T network and extend that network to the tactical edge; T2C2 also enables warfighters in select small Command Posts (CP) (typically Company level) and select Army teams to send and receive time sensitive Situational Awareness (SA), Intelligence, and Mission Command (MC) information while At-the-Halt (ATH) in support of all Joint determined and defined operational phases.  These phases span from the initial Shaping Phase, designed to dissuade or deter adversaries and assure mission friends, to Deterrence, Initiative Seizure and Domination phases culminating with post maneuver Stabilization and Enabling of Civil Authorities enabling legitimate civil governance in safe and secure environment. FY16 funding will be used for FY16/17 testing of the T2C2 systems (Light and Heavy) to support a Full Rate Production (FRP) decision scheduled for 2018. These testing events include Product Verification Testing and Army Interoperability Certification (AIC) scheduled for FY2016 and Initial Operational Test &amp; Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) and Joint Integration Test Command (JITC) Certification in FY2017.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Transportable Tactical Command Communications (T2C2) program Acquisition Strategy (AS) is based on integration of existing Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS)/Non-Developmental Items (NDI) into new integrated systems fielded in the needed configuration for small teams or small unit Command Posts (CP) to allow these units to receive and transmit data. T2C2 will provide a high bandwidth tactical network extension for small unit CPs operating beyond line-of-sight from their higher headquarters and for teams operating outside the full tactical network architecture. A competitive award using an existing IDIQ contract will take advantage of the competitive forces of the commercial marketplace which will result in lower prices, better quality, and reduced time from requirements identification to award. The systems will be improved over time through technology insertions/refreshments via new competitions every three to five years. T2C2 will utilize a two-level maintenance concept, will be Soldier-maintained, and initially supported by Interim Contractor Support. An analysis will be conducted to determine the ultimate supportability path. This strategy will allow a capability to be integrated and delivered quickly to support a limited deployment of Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) units in FY17 required for Production Verification and Initial Operational Capability testing, with FRP planned for FY18. Fielding completion for all T2C2 systems will be in FY28.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Enroute Mission Command (EMC) supports the Global Response Force (GRF) and other Army units with the requirement to conduct Airborne forcible entry operations with the ability to conduct mission command, to include mission planning and rehearsal, while enroute on board US Air Force Air Mobility Command (AMC) aircraft. EMC provides a modernization to enroute communications to enable broadband reach-back data capability utilizing military or commercial networks with adequate bandwidth support required by Mission Command and Intelligence applications. EMC2 will provide commanders with the ability to obtain and share near real-time information regarding intelligence, situational awareness and command and control information while enroute to their objective.  The ability to adjust plans and strategize utilizing the latest Intel data will give the GRF the information dominance needed to execute their mission once they arrive at their objective.  FY16 Funding will be used for Electromagnetic Interference/Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMI/EMC), Flight Test and preparation for Post Fielding Assessment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Global Command and Control System-Army (GCCS-A): This project is the Army component system that directly supports the implementation of the Global Command and Control System Family of Systems. GCCS-A provides automated command and control tools for Army Strategic and Operational Theater Commanders to enhance warfighter capabilities throughout the spectrum of conflict during joint and combined operations in support of the National Security. The GCCS-A developed software systems dramatically improves the Army's ability to analyze courses of action; develop and manage Army Forces; and ensure feasibility of war plans. In accordance with Army Command Post Computing Environment and Joint Command and Control objectives, GCCS-A will be re-architected away from a scalable process architecture based server - thick client architecture to a virtualized server - web client architecture hosted on Battle Command Common Services and Mission Command Workstation by the end of Fiscal Year 2016. GCCS-A strategic tools for readiness reporting have been modernized and replaced with the Defense Readiness Reporting System - Army (DRRS-A), a suite of web based applications for Army Readiness, Force Registration and Force Projection.  Strategic and Joint Mission Command funding will be used to modernize GCCS-A as outlined in the Joint Command and Control Capability Development Document (JC2 CDD) and the Army Mission Command for Unified Action Capability Definition Package (AMCUA CDP).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>In FY16, $3.123 million will provide support for modernization of the Defense Readiness Reporting System - Army (DRRS-A).</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Global Command and Control System-Army (GCCS-A):  This project is the Army component of the Global Command and Control System (GCCS) Family of Systems (FoS). GCCS-A provides automated command and control tools, including Force readiness, planning and movement, and situational awareness, for Army Strategic and Operational Theater commanders to enhance warfighter capabilities throughout the spectrum of conflict during Joint and combined operations in support of National Security. GCCS-A dramatically improves the Army's ability to analyze courses of action, develop and manage Army forces and execute war plans. GCCS-A links the GCCS-Joint Common Operating Picture with the Army Mission Command systems. In accordance with Army Command Post Computing Environment and Joint Command and Control objectives, GCCS-A will be re-architected away from a scalable process architecture based server - thick client architecture to a virtualized server - web client architecture hosted on Battle Command Common Services and Mission Command Workstation by the end of Fiscal Year 2016. GCCS-A strategic tools for readiness reporting have been modernized and replaced with the Defense Readiness Reporting System - Army (DRRS-A), a suite of web based applications for Army Readiness, Force Registration and Force Projection. 

Fiscal Year 2016 funding supports GCCS-A 4.3 software enhancements and certification testing of the GCCS-A Bridge Effort in conjunction with Common Operating Environment testing to ensure that GCCS-A Bridge Effort software is successfully configured as a virtual machine on Battle Command Common Services and is interoperable with Army and Joint Mission Command Systems. Additionally, the funding will provide continued support of DRRS-A Modernization efforts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>GCCS-A is modernizing to meet the requirements defined in the Joint C2 Capability Development Document (CDD) and to align with the Joint and Army Enterprise architectures and Common Operating Environment (COE) standards.

In accordance with the Joint Requirements Oversight Committee (JROC) Memorandum (JROCM) 145-09 which states, "The JROC endorses efforts to develop and implement programmatic recommendations to support the "Do No Harm" Strategy", GCCS-A continues to synchronize and modernize along with the GCCS Family of Systems (FoS). 

The GCCS-A Modernization Strategy will consist of two separate program efforts. (1) A Bridge effort, Acquisition Category (ACAT) III level and (2) a Modernization development effort for the Army's Joint and Strategic command and Control capabilities and Common Operating Environment (COE) infrastructure software products. The GCCS-A modernization development effort will be in compliance with Joint Command and Control Capability Development Document (JC2 CDD) and Army Mission Command for Unified Action Capability Definition Package (AMCUA CDP). DRRS-A developmental efforts will continue to satisfy readiness reporting requirements from Army Readiness Division (DAMO-ODR).

In accordance with the Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) requirements document approved in 2011, entitled Net Enabled Mission Command (NeMC) Initial Capabilities Document (ICD), software capability will be developed in 2-year increments as capability sets designed to Collaborate, Collapse and Converge Mission Command products. The product development funded under this R-Form is an integral part of the Mission Command System of Systems, under a strategy designed to optimize opportunity for improved interoperability among the systems, to capture the benefits of competition where possible and to ensure the rapid integration of new capability into warfighter systems. This strategy is designed to reduce the physical footprint, logistics support requirements and increase operational efficiency through deployment as a virtualized server on Battle Command Common Services and web clients.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Joint Program Office (JPO) for Integrated Broadcast Service (IBS) Terminals supports all of the Joint Services and Special Operations Command (SOCOM). The IBS is the worldwide Department of Defense (DoD) standard network enterprise for disseminating time-sensitive tactical and strategic intelligence and targeting data to all echelons of Joint Service operational users. The JPO's role is to complete consolidation and replacement of existing IBS terminal capability. The Joint Tactical Terminal (JTT) family of systems currently consists of the JTT-Senior and JTT-IBS systems, and they satisfy Key Performance Parameters (KPPs) for the IBS Program. The JTT is the official IBS producer system, and ensures continued IBS interoperability to a variety of tactical producers/consumers across the Joint Services. JPO IBS Terminals performs JTT life cycle program management through fielding and sustainment of recently upgraded JTT equipment, as well as integration and testing of enhancements for modernization of the JTT fleet through block upgrades and/or new production. 

FY16 Base funding of $0.750 million supports a capabilities review and testing of off-the-shelf, smaller size IBS terminals against validated requirements, to include User testing.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Project 11A:   The Advanced Payloads Development project line is a shared funding line between multiple Payload programs.  These Payload programs support the Army's transformation by developing Reconnaissance, Surveillance and Target Acquisition (RSTA) and Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) payload systems for Brigade Combat Teams, Divisions, and Corps Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS).  This is in accordance with Headquarters Department of the Army (HQDA) and Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) UAS priorities.  

Small Tactical Radar - Lightweight (STARLite) Synthetic Aperture Radar/Ground Moving Target Indicator (SAR/GMTI)is a lightweight, high performance, all weather, multi-functional radar system for the Gray Eagle UAS. The STARLite system provides wide area, near real time Reconnaissance, Surveillance and Target Acquisition (RSTA) capabilities. It operates throughout the UAS flight mission profile in adverse weather and through battlefield obscurants. The SAR mode generates quality images for the battlefield commander for detection, classification and location of stationary commercial wheeled vehicle-size targets. The GMTI mode detects moving ground targets, to include man-sized detection, and provides location information and performs cross-cue with the Electro-Optic/Infrared (EO/IR) sensors.  STARLite is increasing its software capabilities based on Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) results which will increase automation and upgrade to a common Graphical User Interface (GUI) to align with the Common Operating Environment (COE) requirement to enable Sensor Processing and Exploitation (SPE).  The SPE software enhancements will improve performance, reduce operator workload and enhance operator effectiveness.  

Common Sensor Payload (CSP) - Electro Optical / Infra Red / Laser Designator (EO/IR/LD) provides High Definition (HD) Full Motion Video (FMV) in both the Electro Optical and Mid Wave IR spectrums with day/night capability to collect and display continuous imagery with the ability to designate targets of interest for attack by laser guided precision weapons.  It is the EO/IR/LD sensor for Gray Eagle UAS which supports force applications, battlespace awareness, force protection, and net-centric operations across the battlefield to provide wide area, near real time RSTA capabilities.  Additional initiatives will continue to focus on the transition of technologies directly supporting emerging requirements and the Army's Current and Future Force.  CSP is being procured for the Gray Eagle UAS program and has potential application to other platforms.   

Project 11B:   The Tactical Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) Payload (TSP) is a SIGINT sensor for the Gray Eagle that detects radio frequency (RF) emitters. The TSP system will provide a SIGINT capability to the tactical commander.  The TSP system will be a modular, scalable payload using an architecture that is software reconfigurable to allow for growth and flexibility as technology, and as the adversaries use of technology, changes.  This flexible architecture allows for third party software applications to be integrated into the TSP system. The TSP system processing, control and data dissemination is integrated into the Distributed Common Ground System - Army (DCGS-A) via the Operational Ground Station. It supports Manned/Unmanned (MUM) teaming with Brigade Combat Team ground SIGINT Terminal Guidance (STG) teams and manned airborne assets.  The TSP system improves situational awareness and shortens the targeting cycle by detecting and identifying emitters associated with high value targets (HVTs).  The TSP system is capable of processing conventional signals, standard military signals, and modern signals of interest.  This includes detection, recognition, identification, direction finding, and high confidence geo-location.  

Project 123:   The Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Joint Technology Center/Systems Integration Laboratory (JTC/SIL) is a Joint facility that develops, integrates, and supports the enhancement of its Multiple Unified Simulation Environment (MUSE) capability for Army systems and operational concepts.  The JTC/SIL conducts prototype hardware and software development, builds the UAS Institutional Mission Simulator (IMS) trainers for the Shadow, Hunter, and Gray Eagle programs, and provides modeling and simulation support. The MUSE is a real-time, operator in-the-loop simulation that may be integrated with larger simulations in support of Army and Joint training and exercises.  The MUSE is also employed as a Mission Rehearsal Tool for ongoing combat operations.  This project funds the management of the JTC/SIL and MUSE enhancements.  This system supports the Legacy to Objective transition path of the Transformation Campaign Plan (TCP).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>STARLite SAR/GMTI is a threshold requirement for the Gray Eagle UAS.  The acquisition strategy for STARLite program was based on a full and open competition for the Army.  A five year competitive production contract was awarded in April 2008 to Northrop Grumman for the build, integration, test and delivery of STARLite systems with preplanned improvements for Extended Range and Increased Reliability.  Full Rate Production (FRP) was successfully achieved in June 2013. A follow-on production contract was awarded in April 2014 for 3 years to procure all remaining STARLite Payloads required for the Gray Eagle platform. A STARLite system support contract was awarded in September 2013 to provide system sustainment.  STARLite is increasing its software capabilities based on Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) results which will increase automation and upgrade to a common Graphical User Interface (GUI) to align with the Common Operating Environment (COE) requirement to enable Sensor Processing and Exploitation (SPE). The SPE software enhancements will improve performance, reduce operator workload and enhance operator effectiveness. A competitive RDTE contract was awarded to Northrop Grumman October 2013 to perform trade studies and begin the development of the software improvements.

Common Sensor Payload (CSP) EO/IR/LD is a KPP (Key Performance Parameter) requirement for the Gray Eagle UAS.  The acquisition strategy for the CSP program was based on a full and open competition for the Army.  It was briefed and approved at the Army Systems Acquisition Review Council (ASARC) in Dec 2006.  A competitive contract was awarded in Nov 2007 to Raytheon for the build, integration, test and delivery of the CSP.  FRP was completed June 2013.  CSP program was approved by HQDA for fifty-five (55) High Definition (HD) payloads.  

The acquisition strategy for FY2016 is to complete STARLite SPE software developmental test and integration onto Gray Eagle; and Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) support to NVESD to continue enhancing the CSP usability for the Warfighter.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Tactical Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) Payload (TSP) is a SIGINT sensor for the Gray Eagle that detects radio frequency (RF) emitters. The TSP system will provide a SIGINT capability to the tactical commander.  The TSP system will be a modular, scalable payload using an architecture that is software reconfigurable to allow for growth and flexibility as technology, and as the adversaries use of technology, changes.  This flexible architecture allows for third party software applications to be integrated into the TSP system. The TSP system processing, control and data dissemination is integrated into the Distributed Common Ground System - Army (DCGS-A) via the Operational Ground Station. It supports Manned/Unmanned (MUM) teaming with Brigade Combat Team ground SIGINT Terminal Guidance (STG) teams and manned airborne assets.  The TSP system improves situational awareness and shortens the targeting cycle by detecting and identifying emitters associated with high value targets (HVTs). The TSP system is capable of processing conventional signals, standard military signals, and modern signals of interest.  This includes detection, recognition, identification, direction finding, and high confidence geo-location.

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>TSP is a threshold requirement for the MQ-1C Gray Eagle UAS. The TSP program entered the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase with a Milestone B decision in September 2011. The TSP Program EMD contract award was based on full-and-open competition and was focused on integration and test onto the Gray Eagle platform and integration and test of TSP software into the Operational Ground Station. The TSP EMD program is a derivative of systems that were fielded  as a Quick Reaction Capability on the MQ-1C UAS and a variety of other manned platforms. The demonstrated scalability of these fielded materiel solutions allows the TSP EMD program to leverage effort that directly supports the TSP EMD program.

The TSP program Acquisition Strategy was modified to accommodate the FY 2012 Appropriation that reduced the 11B Funding Line by $14.100 Million. The modified TSP program followed an incremental Acquisition Strategy with a TSP Block 0, Block 1 and Block 2. Schedule adjusted in accordance with the TSP Acquisition Decision Memorandum dated 22 Mar 2012. Block 0 was to be the QRC system to provide an early operational capability for the MQ-1C. The TSP Block 1 is the current Program of Record that entered EMD in FY 2011 to meet all the threshold requirements in the approved Capability Production Document (CPD).  Block 2 was to address future objective needs.

Based on available funding, the TSP acquisition strategy has been revised to merge Block 0 and current Block 1 capabilities into a single Block of capability.  Current capabilities that have not been integrated into the Block 1 are deferred and included in the Block 2 suite of requirements.

Block 1 is the initial production capability, with Block 2 being a continuation of the TSP program of record and will integrate the remaining CPD threshold requirements.

Block 1 Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) Milestone C was approved on 26 Mar 2014. TSP LRIP contract award was 12 Jun 2014.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Joint Technology Center/System Integration Laboratory (JTC/SIL) is a Joint facility that develops, integrates, and supports the enhancement of its Multiple Unified Simulation Environment (MUSE) capability for Army systems and operational concepts.  The JTC/SIL conducts prototype hardware and software development, builds the UAS Institutional Mission Simulator (IMS) trainers for the Shadow, Hunter, and Gray Eagle programs, and provides modeling and simulation support.  The MUSE is a real-time, operator in-the-loop simulation that may be integrated with larger simulations in support of Army and Joint training exercises.  The MUSE is also employed as a Mission Rehearsal Tool for ongoing combat operations.  This project funds the management of the JTC/SIL and MUSE enhancements.

This system supports the Legacy to Objective transition path of the Transformation Campaign Plan (TCP).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This project continues development of advanced tactical reconnaissance and surveillance sensor technologies and develops technology for the on-board fusion of multi-discipline intelligence sensors, i.e. Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), Imagery Intelligence (IMINT), and Measurement and Signature Intelligence (MASINT).  Hyperspectral, multi-spectral, interferometric synthetic aperture radar sensors, advanced target and image exploitation software will be developed.  Additionally, efforts will be directed toward the development of advanced multi-mode Electroptic/Infrared (EO/IR), multi-mode MTI/SAR radar, foliage penetration radar, multi-spectral/hyperspectral imageries (MSI/HSI), MASINT on-board fusion and registration, and cueing of the EO/IR/SAR/HSI imaging sensor.  
The Hyperspectral Longwave Imager for the Tactical Environment (HyLITE) is the next generation airborne day/night hyperspectral reconnaissance sensor for the detection and identification of camouflaged and concealed targets in all terrain environments.  Design improvements will be implemented and flight testing conducted to assess system performance.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

All funding is in support of the ACTIVE COMPONENT</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The budget line provides for all associated non-recurring engineering (NRE),development of supplemental type certificates (STC), testing, integration and Pre-Planned Product Improvement (P3I) of Army Aerial, Intelligence, Surveillance and reconnaissance (AISR)systems. Funding provides for DoD mandated safety equipment to meet current and evolving International Standards. It also enhances aircraft communications, navigations and surveillance (CNS); aircraft survivability equipment (ASE) and the integration of the AISR mission equipment package (MEP) as well as obsolescence issues involved with the conversion of  Liberty Project Aircraft (LPA)to the EMARSS POR, in regards to the Navy AAR-47 converting to Army AAR-57, Blue Force Tracker (BFT) to Blue Force Tracker-2 (BFT-2)and Common Missile Warning Systems (CMWS)upgrades. 


FY16 RDT&amp;E dollars in the amount of $1.740 million provides for all associated non-recurring engineering for conversion of initial Quick Reaction capability (QRC)systems into the EMARSS program of record (POR). Upgraded communications and MEP will ensure continued worldwide deployability and over match dominance for AISR.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>This program is not a New Start and funding transferred from PE 0605626.  For FY16 and beyond, funding to support the overall EMARSS effort is found in the following two lines; EH3 EMARSS Payloads (Project Manager Sensors - Aerial Intelligence (PM SAI)) and EH2 EMARSS ADV DEV (Project Manager Fixed Wing (PM FW)). PM SAI funding continues on this line from 0605626A - Aerial Common Sensor.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Enhanced Medium Altitude Reconnaissance and Surveillance System (EMARSS) is the Army's next generation C-12 based, direct support, manned airborne intelligence collection, processing, and targeting support system.  EMARSS provides a persistent capability to detect, locate, classify/identify, and track surface targets with a high degree of timeliness and accuracy.  EMARSS aircraft will be assigned to the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command's (INSCOM) Aerial Exploitation Battalions (AEB). EMARSS is an improvement over the existing Medium Altitude Reconnaissance and Surveillance System Quick Reaction Capability (MARSS QRC).

The Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) for EMARSS is 36 systems, the Army Procurement Objective (APO) is 24 systems and includes the following variants: EMARSS-G (Constant Hawk &amp; TACOP LiDAR); EMARSS-V (VaDER); EMARSS-M (Liberty Project Aircraft (LPA)); and EMARSS-S (Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) systems.

The modification and conversion leverages the following QRC systems: Constant Hawk (5); LPA (8); TACOP LiDAR (3); and VaDER (4) redeploying out of Afghanistan to meet the EMARSS Capabilities Production Document (CPD).

EMARSS Payloads will consist of Mission Equipment Packages (MEP) and Processing Exploitation &amp; Dissemination commercial derivative equipment such as, an Electro-optical/Infrared (EO/IR) sensor with Full Motion Video (FMV), a Communications Intelligence (COMINT) collection system, an Aerial Precision Geolocation (APG) system, tactical line-of-site (LOS) and beyond line-of-site (BLOS) communications suite, two Distributed Common Ground System - Army (DCGS-A) enabled operator workstations and a self-protection suite.  Payloads integrated on platforms will include: niche capabilities such as Wide Area Aerial Surveillance (WAAS), Light Imaging Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and improved Synthetic Aperture Radar / Moving Target Indicator (SAR/MTI) radar capability.   

EMARSS will operate in direct support of tactical missions.  EMARSS, integrating elements of the DCGS-A, will provide a near real-time response to Combat Forces with Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) tasking.   

FY 2016 RDTE funding in the amount of $3.532 million funds the product enhancement, sensor engineering support, and test and evaluation.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The EMARSS MEP/PED acquisition strategy capitalizes on significant existing investments in AISR systems by leveraging proven, mature (i.e. Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 8 or greater) sensors, communications subsystems and DCGS-A compliant workstations.  All MEP/PED systems leverage sensor integrations previously conducted on other Army and Joint programs.  The acquisition strategy supported by the EMARSS CPD includes design and testing of 24 MEP/PED systems and leverages proven Quick Reaction Capabilities for SAR/MTI, LIDAR, WAAS, FMV and COMINT.  

The EMARSS acquisition strategy capitalizes on significant existing investments in AISR systems by hosting proven, mature (i.e. Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 8 or greater) sensors, communications subsystems and DCGS-A compliant workstations into a commercial derivative aircraft.  All systems are based on the B350ER platform and leverage aircraft modifications and sensor integration previously conducted on other Army and Joint programs.  The acquisition strategy supported by the EMARSS CPD includes design and testing of 24 systems.   As a result of Congressional language contained in the 2014 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), the Army will forgo additional production of Boeing built EMD aircraft and will fulfill the end-state requirements of 24 systems by leveraging QRC platforms and modifying them into CPD compliant systems.  The EMARSS Program of Record (POR) will ultimately be comprised of four variants: (4) Boeing EMDs / EMARSS-S, (8) CH and TACOP/LiDAR / EMARSS-G, (4) VaDER / EMARSS-V and (8) Air Force Liberty Project Aircraft (LPA) / EMARSS-M AISR systems.  The Air Force LPA aircraft transitioned to the Army 4Q FY14.  The four EMARSS-S (EMD) systems will be brought to a production level configuration and available for fielding.  Milestone C (4QTR2014) permits the induction of the 20 QRC systems into the EMARSS POR.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

Army Aquisition Objective(AAO):  nine (9) aircraft

All funding is in support of the ACTIVE COMPONENT

FY16 base funding in the amount of $5.100 million dollars is linked to A02110, APA, ARL SEMA MODS (MIP) and AZ2050, APA, ARL Payloads (MIP) dollars.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This budget line provides for Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) and the technical drawing package associated with the Department of Army mandated installation of Aviation Survival Equipment (ASE) on a DeHavilland dash 8 and the associated validation testing required for the installed ASE.  This funding will also be utilized for the associated system level testing after the final sensor installation on the Aerial Reconnaissance Low Enhanced (ARL-E) DeHavilland dash 8 replacement platforms. 

FY 16 RDT&amp;E funding of $5.100 million dollars provides Department of Army mandated ASE compliance and total system level testing for the ARL-E DeHavilland dash 8 replacement Program of Record aircraft.  These aircraft will provide the Department of Army with a state of the art Aerial Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (AISR) platform ready for worldwide deployment in support of national interest.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>Beginning in FY16 ARL-E RDT-E funding line (ARL Payloads ADV DEV(MIP) 375206EH5 will be identified between Project Manager Sensors Aerial Intelligence (SAI) and Project Manager Fixed Wing (FW)(ARL ADV DEV (MIP) funding line 375206EH4). 

This program is not a New Start and funding transferred from PE 0605626-AC5.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Airborne Reconnaissance Low - Enhanced (ARL-E) program supports the Aerial Layer 2020 Strategy which recommended replacement of the current Airborne Reconnaissance Low Multifunction (ARL-M) and migrates the current ARL sensors plus new niche sensors to the meet the ARL-E Capabilities Production Document (CPD) requirements.  ARL-E payload procures the hardware, software, and infrastructure to rapidly install sensors which support a rapid plug and play, quick connect/disconnect, mounting system to allow the installation of various combinations of sensor-types in support of a wide-range of theater operations. The sensor suite will consist of a Communications Intelligence (COMINT) subsystem capable of supporting theater net centric geo-location efforts, High Definition Full Motion Video (FMV); Improved Synthetic Aperture Radar / Moving Target Indicator (SAR/MTI) radar capability and updated mission workstations, as well as radio and data/communications architecture. ARL-E will leverage existing sensors as well as integrating and installing niche sensors to augment current capabilities. Niche capabilities include Wide-Area Augmentation System (WAAS), Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and Hyper Spectral Imaging (HSI) sensors. The ARL Modernization Program standardizes the payload systems, upgrades the COMINT subsystem for improved Irregular Warfare tactical collection and geo-location, enhances the Full Motion Video (FMV) system with a High Definition capability, and improves the Synthetic Aperture Radar / Moving Target (SAR//MTI) capability.  The modernization program ensures continued ARL relevancy against current and emerging threat emitters and tactics across the full spectrum of operations.

ARL-E Payload is funding the development and testing of the Long Range Radar (LRR) to replace the current ARL Phoenix Eye Radar to meet the increased performance requirements of the Appendix J Payload for ARL-E approved CPD.LRR effort will add required SAR modes, address obsolescence, IA issues, and improved probability at greater required ranges. Effort will produce a prototype and flight testing to characterize the prototype performance. Funding is also planned for test and evaluation of LRR capability integrated in ARL-E system.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>ARL Procurement funding line split with ARL SEMA Mods (MIP) A02110000. FY16 base funding to support the overall ARL-E effort is found in the following two lines: AZ2050 ARL Payloads (per this form) and A02110 ARL SEMA Mods (separate form).  Separate funding lines support the Army Acquisition Executive's directive, codified in the October 28, 2011 memorandum, to assign overall acquisition lead for manned airborne intelligence systems to Program Executive Officer for Aviation (PEO-AVN); and overall sensor, processing, exploitation, and dissemination responsibilities to Program Executive Officer for Intelligence, Electronic Warfare, and Sensors (PEO-IEWS). 

The purpose of AZ2050 is to procure, upgrade, test and integrate sensors; communications architecture for sensor information exploitation and dissemination; test, nonrecurring engineering, and integration in support of the ARL-E Payload program ensuring ARL-E is rapidly deployable world-wide against current, new, and emerging threats. 

FY16 Base funding within AZ2050 - $69,068 supports the procurement of the Mission Equipment Payload (MEP) for integration on Aircraft #3 and 4. The MEP for these systems will consist of 1 set of Distributed Common Ground Station-Army (DCGS-A) workstations, 1 set of communication equipment (mission radios, Beyond line of Site (BLOS) and Line of Site (LOS) Data links), 1 COMINT subsystem, 1 Hyper spectral subsystem, 1 Vehicle and Dismount.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>Project 956 (DCGS-A Increment 1) is a designated Major Automation Information System (MAIS) program.

Project D07 (Increment 2) was created to clearly delineate between the DCGS-A Project 956 (Increment 1) development efforts beginning in FY15.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Distributed Common Ground System - Army (DCGS-A) is the Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) System of Systems (SoS) for Joint, Interagency, Allied, Coalition, and National data analysis, sharing and collaboration.  The core functions of DCGS-A are:  the vertical and horizontal synchronization of ISR Processing, Exploitation and Dissemination (PED) efforts; operations in a networked environment at multiple security levels; the control of select Army and joint sensor systems; the fusion of all acquired data and information, and distribution of relevant red (threat), gray (non-aligned), and environmental (weather and terrain) information; and providing the Warfighters' early warning, targeting, and sensor ground station capabilities.  DCGS-A provides a single integrated ISR ground processing system composed of common components that are interoperable with sensors, other information sources, all Warfighting Functions, and the Defense Information &amp; Intelligence Enterprise (DI2E) and Intelligence Community Information Technology Enterprise (ICITE).  DCGS-A is fielded in Fixed, Mobile, and embedded configurations emphasizing the use of reach and split based operations by improving accessibility of data in order to reduce forward deployed footprint.  As enhanced capabilities are developed and tested, a continuing series of software releases will be integrated into Army Common/commodity hardware and fielded to units IAW the Dynamic Army Resourcing Priority List (DARPL) process.

The Army Acquisition Executive designated PEO IEW&amp;S and DCGS-A as the Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE) Lead.  As such, DCGS-A is defining the architecture to fit within the Common Operating Environment (COE) as described by the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology) (ASA(ALT)) COE Implementation Plan.  This is in accordance with the G-3/5/7 priority to align all Army networks, procurements, and enhancements under one COE and one vision leveraging intelligence community investments.

DCGS-A consolidated, enhanced, and modernized the Tasking, Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (TPED) capabilities formerly found in nine Army intelligence programs of record (Common Ground Station (CGS), Guardrail Common Sensor (GRCS), Counterintelligence &amp; Interrogation Operations Workstation (CI&amp;I OPS WS), All Source Analysis System (ASAS), Enhanced TrackWolf (ETW), Digital Topographic Support System (DTSS), Integrated Meteorological System (IMETS), Tactical Exploitation System (TES), and Prophet Control) and two Quick Reaction Capabilities (Joint Intelligence Operations Center – Iraq (JIOC-I) and Imagery Work Station(IWS)).  DCGS-A provides these technologically advanced PED capabilities in tailored and scalable mobile, fixed, and embedded configurations in all maneuver and maneuver support units from Company Intelligence Support Team to Army Service Component Command, and in select maneuver sustainment units battalion and above.  The program develops software packages to be embedded in mission command and other select systems to provide required ISR/analytic capabilities.  DCGS-A is one of the Army's top modernization priorities.

DCGS-A software is tailored by echelon and scalable to each unit's mission.  DCGS-A provides commanders and staffs the ability to maintain an accurate and up to date understanding of the operational environment.  The DCGS-A contribution to commanders' visualization and situational awareness, rapid planning, and the synchronization of all warfighting functions, enable Army units to operate within the enemy's decision cycle.  This capability enhances tactical and operational maneuver and the conduct of full spectrum operations across the range of military operations from humanitarian to major combat operations and campaigns through all phases of the Joint Continuum of Military Operations.

The DCGS-A configurations range from laptops to systems integrated in tactical shelters and mounted on tactical vehicles to large commodity servers operating in a sanctuary based processing environment.  The fundamental intent and tenet of this approach is to reduce forward deployed equipment/footprint by co-locating the advanced analytics capabilities within the DCGS-A baseline with the regional data centers, where the data is stored.  This infrastructure consolidation simultaneously reduces processor and communications requirements in tactical units by limiting the number of large data files transported across tactical communications systems.  Following a successful operational assessment and Milestone C in 2QFY12/Full Deployment Decision in 1QFY13, the program is deploying DCGS-A Increment 1 Release 1 Software Baseline capability throughout the Army.

FY16 Base funding in the amount of $8.923 million for project 956, will be used for the continued development and testing of the DCGS-A Increment 1 Software Release 2 as well as the continued development and testing of the Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE) as it fits into the Army's overarching Common Operating Environment (COE) construct.   The COE has been directed as a priority effort to align all Army networks, procurements, and enhancements under one COE vision.  Funds used for efforts associated with the development of the CPCE/COE will include the continued merger/collapse of capabilities across multiple Battlefield Functional Areas (BFAs) and the consolidation of hardware used across the BFAs.  Funds used for efforts associated with the development of the software will include continued advancements in the Standard Sharable Geospatial Foundation to support the Tactical Common Operating Picture, as well as further investment into capabilities and widget development supporting All Source Intelligence, Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT), emerging architectural and infrastructure enhancements, and software integration efforts.  The FY16 funding will be used for integration of commercial technologies to the latest version(s) and changes due to Information Assurance updates.  Testing activities requiring these funds will include participation in Network Integration Evaluation and Exercises such as: Empire Challenge, ULCHI Freedom Guardian, and Joint Interoperability Certification test(s) for each software release. 

FY16 Base funding in the amount of $16.669 million for D07, will continue the iterative DCGS-A software releases that will increase the Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination capability our Army requires.  Increment 2 of the DCGS-A program will continue critical updates to the Army's ISR PED and multi-intelligence planning, analysis, and production capabilities through the exploitation of Cloud Computing and advanced analytics capabilities.  This approach will achieve Information Technology efficiencies through alignment with the Intelligence Community Information Technology Environment, while developing the incremental software updates required to remain current.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The COE has been directed by the ASA(ALT) and concurred by the Army G3/5/7 as a priority effort to align all Army networks, procurements, and enhancements under one COE vision.  Funds used for efforts associated with the development of the CPCE/COE will include the continued merger/collapse of capabilities across multiple Battlefield Functional Areas (BFAs) and the consolidation of hardware used across the BFAs.  Funds used for efforts associated with the development of the software will include continued advancements in the Standard Sharable Geospatial Foundation to support the Tactical Common Operating Picture, as well as further investment into capabilities and widget development supporting All Source Intelligence, Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT), emerging architectural and infrastructure enhancements, and software integration efforts.  The FY16 funding will be used for integration of commercial technologies to the latest version(s) and changes due to Information Assurance updates.  Testing activities requiring these funds will include participation in Network Integration Evaluation and Exercises such as: Empire Challenge, ULCHI Freedom Guardian, and Joint Interoperability Certification test(s) for each software release.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Distributed Common Ground System-Army (DCGS-A) program was created in response to the Department of Defense (DoD) Distributed Common Ground/Surface System (DCGS) Mission Area Initial Capabilities Document (MA ICD) dated 13 Aug 2004, which captured the overarching requirements for an Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) Family of Systems (FoS) that will contribute to Joint and combined Warfighter needs. That ICD was updated as the Distributed Common Ground/Surface System (DCG/SS) Enterprise ICD, and approved by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) 27 Feb 2009. The Army requirements were refined in the DCGS-A Capabilities Development Document (CDD), and approved by the JROC 31 Oct 2005. The DCGS-A program is currently in the Production and Deployment phase and was designated as a Major Automated Information System (MAIS) in OSD (AT&amp;L) Memorandum, 29 Mar 2010. 

DCGS-A is following an evolutionary acquisition approach to develop and field system capabilities over time to satisfy the requirements of the DCGS-A Capability Development Document (CDD). Following this approach, the first increment was defined and a Capability Production Document (CPD) was created with full consideration of all of the preceding supporting documents and analysis. As part of its initial staffing, a Cost Benefit Analysis was completed in support of the DCGS-A CPD. This analysis projected a significant cost avoidance/savings over the life cycle by not limiting the hardware configuration to a one size fits all unit types design but rather integrating the DCGS-A Software capabilities into common servers and other IT components fielded at that echelon. This approach was validated during the Milestone C and Full Deployment Decision process in FY2012 through the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE) approval of the Economic Analysis.  This Economic Analysis validated the cost savings achieved utilizing the acquisition approach outlined above. 

PM DCGS-A has been designated as the Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE) Lead for PEO IEW&amp;S. As such, DCGS-A is currently aligning it's architecture to fit within the Common Operating Environment (COE) as described by the ASA(ALT) COE Implementation Plan. This alignment is in accordance with the G-3/5/7 priority to align all Army networks, procurements, and enhancements under one COE and one vision. Our acquisition strategy supports this initiative as we continue to collapse PORs and reduce footprint following our capability migration path and iterative development of software releases which continue to increase capabilities to satisfy the remaining CPD requirements beyond Initial Minimal Capability. As DCGS-A continues the path through Increment 1 and beyond, each release will focus on the COE and continually align the Command Post activities with POR migration activities.  The program office expects to continue as the DCGS-A System Integrator for software development and hardware integration for Increment 1, and will continue to access multiple vendors by leveraging a variety of competitively awarded contracts.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>Project D07 (Increment 2) was created to clearly delineate between the DCGS-A Project 956 (Increment 1) development efforts beginning in FY15.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Distributed Common Ground System - Army (DCGS-A) is the Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) System of Systems (SoS) for Joint, Interagency, Allied, Coalition, and National data analysis, sharing and collaboration.  The core functions of DCGS-A are:  the vertical and horizontal synchronization of ISR Processing, Exploitation and Dissemination (PED) efforts; operations in a networked environment at multiple security levels; the control of select Army and joint sensor systems; the fusion of all acquired data and information, and distribution of relevant red (threat), gray (non-aligned), and environmental (weather and terrain) information; and providing the Warfighters' early warning, targeting, and sensor ground station capabilities.  DCGS-A provides a single integrated ISR ground processing system composed of common components that are interoperable with sensors, other information sources, all Warfighting Functions, compliant with standards providing the Defense Information &amp; Intelligence Enterprise (DI2E) and Intelligence Community Information Technology Enterprise (ICITE).  DCGS-A is fielded in Fixed, Mobile, and embedded configurations emphasizing the use of reach and split based operations by improving accessibility of data in order to reduce forward deployed footprint.  As enhanced capabilities are developed and tested, a continuing series of software releases will be integrated into Army Common/commodity hardware and fielded to units IAW the Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) process.

The Army Acquisition Executive designated PEO IEW&amp;S and DCGS-A as the Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE) Lead.  As such, DCGS-A is defining the architecture to fit within the Common Operating Environment (COE) as described by the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology) (ASA(ALT)) COE Implementation Plan.  This is in accordance with the G-3/5/7 priority to align all Army networks, procurements, and enhancements under one COE and one vision leveraging intelligence community investments.

DCGS-A provides technologically advanced Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (PED) capabilities through iterative software releases delivered in tailored and scalable mobile, fixed, and embedded configurations in all maneuver and maneuver support units from Company Intelligence Support Team to Army Service Component Command, and in select maneuver sustainment units battalion and above.  The program develops software packages to be embedded in mission command and other select systems to provide required ISR/analytic capabilities.  DCGS-A is one of the Army's top ten modernization priorities.

FY16 Base funding in the amount of $16.669 million will continue the iterative DCGS-A software releases that will increase the Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination capability our Army requires.  Increment 2 of the DCGS-A program will continue critical updates to the Army's ISR PED and multi-intelligence planning, analysis, and production capabilities through the exploitation of Cloud Computing and advanced analytics capabilities.  This approach will achieve Information Technology efficiencies through alignment with the Intelligence Community Information Technology Environment, while developing the incremental software updates required to remain current.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Increment 2 expands on the capabilities provided by Increment 1 by adding capabilities at the Army and below echelons while developing new, enhanced, and leap-ahead Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) and Standard and Shareable Geospatial Foundation (SSGF) enterprise capabilities to align with the Intelligence Community (IC) and Army's Common Operating Environment (COE) and transformation objectives.  Increment 2 will include capabilities from, and eventually displace, the Space Operations System (SOS) and the Guardrail Ground Baseline (GGB).  Increment 2 and beyond will build upon emerging technologies such as an artificial intelligence system capability, cognitive computing, additional exploitation tools, and capabilities on the explosive growth in unstructured data (social networks and smart devices (both user borne and unattended)), fusion of data collected through Tactical Mesh Sensors and disconnected processing, giant leaps in "Cloud" capability, interoperability with the Army's Joint Tactical Ground Station (JTAGS), the Theater Net-centric Geolocation (TNG) system, and On The Move (OTM) capabilities.  These requirements will be defined in future RDP and CD as necessary to ensure DCGS-A provides the data, information, intelligence, situation awareness, and interoperability needed to support the Warfighter.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Distributed Common Ground System-Army (DCGS-A) program was created in response to the Department of Defense (DoD) Distributed Common Ground/Surface System (DCGS) Mission Area Initial Capabilities Document (MA ICD) dated 13 Aug 2004, which captured the overarching requirements for an Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) Family of Systems (FoS) that will contribute to Joint and combined Warfighter needs. That ICD was updated as the Distributed Common Ground/Surface System (DCG/SS) Enterprise ICD, and approved by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) 27 Feb 2009. The Army requirements were refined in the DCGS-A Capabilities Development Document (CDD), and approved by the JROC 31 Oct 2005. The DCGS-A program is currently in the Production and Deployment phase and was designated as a Major Automated Information System (MAIS) in OSD (AT&amp;L) Memorandum, 29 Mar 2010.  The Information Systems Capability Development Document (ISCDD), currently in staffing, is an update to the 2005 CDD.

DCGS-A is following an evolutionary acquisition approach to develop and field system capabilities over time to satisfy the requirements of the DCGS-A Capability Development Document (CDD). Following this approach, the first increment was defined and a Capability Production Document (CPD) was created with full consideration of all of the preceding supporting documents and analysis. As part of its initial staffing, a Cost Benefit Analysis was completed in support of the DCGS-A CPD. This analysis projected a significant cost avoidance/savings over the life cycle by not limiting the hardware configuration to a one size fits all unit types design but rather integrating the DCGS-A Software capabilities into common servers and other IT components fielded at that echelon. This approach was validated during the Milestone C and Full Deployment Decision process in FY2012 through the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE) approval of the Economic Analysis.  This Economic Analysis validated the cost savings achieved utilizing the acquisition approach outlined above. 

The DCGS-A Increment 2 Acquisition Strategy will be a competitive contract award for managing the development, integration, documentation, and test for the Increment 2 Releases.  Anticipate RFP release in 1QFY16 and contract award in 3QFY16.

PM DCGS-A has been designated as the Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE) Lead for PEO IEW&amp;S. As such, DCGS-A is currently aligning its architecture to fit within the Common Operating Environment (COE) as described by the ASA(ALT) COE Implementation Plan. This alignment is in accordance with the G-3/5/7 priority to align all Army networks, procurements, and enhancements under one COE and one vision. Our acquisition strategy supports this initiative as we continue to collapse PORs and reduce footprint following our capability migration path and iterative development of software releases which continue to increase capabilities to satisfy the remaining CPD requirements beyond Initial Minimal Capability. As DCGS-A continues the path through Increment 2, each release will focus on the COE and continually align the Command Post activities with the DCGS-A platforms.  The program office expects to award a competitive contract for software development and hardware integration.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Gray Eagle provides Reconnaissance, Surveillance, Target Acquisition (RSTA), Command and Control, Communications Relay, Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), Battle Damage Assessment, and Manned-Unmanned Teaming capability.  Gray Eagle is a dedicated, assured, multi-mission Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) fielded to all Army Divisions, Army Intelligence and Security Command and Army Special Operations Command in support of the commander's warfighting priorities.   
	
The RDT&amp;E budget is driven primarily by the requirement for a Follow-On Operational Test &amp; Evaluation (FOT&amp;E).  This test effort will evaluate the changes in the concept of operation as well as changes to materiel, specifically the addition of the Universal Ground Control Station (UGCS), which replaces the currently fielded One System Ground Control Station (OSGCS).  It will be conducted during 3QFY15.  The scope of FOT&amp;E is similar to that of the Initial Operational Test &amp; Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) performed in FY12 in that both tests will use a Gray Eagle Company staged out at Edwards Air Force Base (EAFB) to support a rotational training unit "in the box" at National Training Center (NTC).  FOT&amp;E scope is expanded beyond the IOT&amp;E in that a platoon will break away from the parent Company and move to Goldstone Army Airfield on Fort Irwin, where it will also support the unit training at the NTC. 

The Ground Based Sense and Avoid (GBSAA) system provides an alternative means of complying with Federal Aviation Administration "see and avoid" regulations for Unmanned Aircraft Systems.

Justification:  No program funding in FY2016.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>Integration of the Universal Ground Products into the Gray Eagle System requires completion of a Follow-On Operational Test and Evaluation (FOT&amp;E).  FY2015 funds increase is required to accommodate the FOT&amp;E move to FY2015.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Gray Eagle provides Reconnaissance, Surveillance, Target Acquisition (RSTA), Command and Control, Communications Relay, Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), Battle Damage Assessment, and Manned-Unmanned Teaming capability.  Gray Eagle is a dedicated, assured, multi-mission Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) fielded to all Army Divisions, Army Intelligence and Security Command and Army Special Operations Command in support of the commander's warfighting priorities.   
	
The RDT&amp;E budget is driven primarily by the requirement for a Follow-On Operational Test &amp; Evaluation (FOT&amp;E).  This test effort will evaluate the changes in the concept of operation as well as changes to materiel, specifically the addition of the Universal Ground Control Station (UGCS), which replaces the currently fielded One System Ground Control Station (OSGCS).  It will be conducted during 3QFY15.  The scope of FOT&amp;E is similar to that of the Initial Operational Test &amp; Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) performed in FY12 in that both tests will use a Gray Eagle Company staged out at Edwards Air Force Base (EAFB) to support a rotational training unit "in the box" at National Training Center (NTC).  FOT&amp;E scope is expanded beyond the IOT&amp;E in that a platoon will break away from the parent Company and move to Goldstone Army Airfield on Fort Irwin, where it will also support the unit training at the NTC. 

The Ground Based Sense and Avoid (GBSAA) system provides an alternative means of complying with Federal Aviation Administration "see and avoid" regulations for Unmanned Aircraft Systems.

Justification:  No program funding in FY2016.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

A Capabilities Production Document (CPD) was approved 14 Mar 2009.  To meet the required capability, evolutionary acquisition has been employed to implement the incremental approach outlined in the CPD.  Gray Eagle completed IOT&amp;E and the program now has to complete software development, integration and testing of the universal products (UGCS, UGDT and other universal ground equipment).  PM JAMS is developing the R model of the HELLFIRE missile and participating in the integration and test activities for the entire Gray Eagle system.  PEO Missile and Space is budgeting for the procurement of missiles for the fielded systems.  PEO Intelligence and Electronic Warfare Systems (IEWS) develops, manages, and is responsible for meeting all Gray Eagle costs associated for payloads, payload integration, and payload sustainment.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Small Unmanned Aircraft System (SUAS) provides the battalion and below ground maneuver elements critical situational awareness and enhance force protection.  The system provides the small unit commander an organic and responsive tactical Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and Target Acquisition capability through the ability to view real-time Full Motion Video and sensor data via the system ground control stations.  Other compatible receivers, such as the One System Remote Video Terminal and appropriately equipped manned platforms may also receive the SUAS products.

A SUAS includes three hand-launched aircraft that do not require an improved launch/recovery location.  In addition to the aircraft, the system contains ground control equipment, which includes an interoperable hand controller.  The equipment is fully transportable in or on rucksack type packs that are organic to the unit.

The SUAS RDT&amp;E budget line included funding for development of the Tactical Open Government Architecture (TOGA) hand controller. The September 2014 submission of $2,320k was increased by a below threshold reprogramming of $464k and an above threshold reprogramming of $3,200k for a total of $5,984k. TOGA enhancements will mitigate capability gaps by creating compatibility with current and future SUAS platforms and integration into tactical networks as required. These enhancements will decrease weight (tablet technology for an efficient form factor), efficient graphical interface, decrease cognitive load and support Windows 7 migration to meet Warfighter needs.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Tactical Unmanned Aerial System (TUAS) RQ-7 provides the Army Brigade Commander with dedicated Reconnaissance, Surveillance and Target Acquisition (RSTA), Intelligence, Battle Damage Assessment (BDA), and Force Protection.  In line with the Army's Aviation Restructure Initiative (ARI) three Shadow Platoons are being integrated into the Combat Aviation Brigade's (CAB) Apache Reconnaissance Battalion.  This will provide Aviation Brigades with Manned-Unmanned-Teaming (MUM-T) and enhanced Aerial Scout capabilities.  The RQ-7B Shadow has logged over 924,000 flight hours, most of which were flown in support of Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO).  

The full Shadow system consists of four air vehicles with payload, two Universal Ground Control stations, two Universal Ground Data Terminals, one Portable Ground Control Station with Portable Ground Data Terminal, Ground Support Equipment, two launchers, ten High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWVs) with trailer(s), and a Light Medium Tactical Vehicle.  Each system is equipped with one maintenance Section Multifunctional (MSM) and is supported at the division level by a Mobile Maintenance Facility (MMF).  The baseline fielded payload was the electro-optic infrared (EO/IR), but half of those were replaced with a Laser Designator (LD) payload.  All 104 systems required by the Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) have been procured.  In 2010 the Army G8 established an RQ-7B UAV MODs program.  This budget line procures modifications including the Shadow v2, System Modifications, Mission Simulators, and One System Remote Video Terminal Upgrades (OSRVT).

Implements Shadow v2: Tactical Common Data Link with Type 1 Encryption and NATO interoperability; solves obsolescence associated with legacy computer hardware and the SOLARIS operating system. Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) and spares are also included. 

Justification:  FY2016 RQ-7 UAV Base funding of $7.297 million will be used for capability and reliability improvements, specifically: Air Vehicle modifications (development of the ability to operate in GPS denied environment) and Ground Equipment (interoperability) improvements.  Additionally, funds will be for system engineering and system test and evaluation support.  Funds will also be used to incorporate developmental improvements into Increment II OSRVT to maintain its interoperability with future supported systems &amp; developments.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>A System Capability Demonstration (SCD) was conducted with four contractors.  The results from the SCD in conjunction with proposal evaluations resulted in the competitive down select of a Best Value TUAS.  A successful Milestone II ASARC was conducted 21 Dec 1999 and a Milestone III Decision 25 Sep 2002.  The full rate production contract was awarded 27 Dec 2002 and in FY2009 the last of the authorized 104 systems was placed on contract.  Continued development of the selected TUAV system will be accomplished through a series of modifications and retrofits such as Shadow v2,  Communications Relay, Laser Designator, Block III engine, and reliability upgrades.  Development/integration of these improved capabilities will be through individual efforts on a (mostly) sole source cost-plus fixed fee engineering services contract with the Shadow prime contractor.  Development of the Block III engine is being accomplished through a competitive process.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

PM JPI will provide an Army tactical biometric collection capability to capture an adversary or neutral person's biometric data and enroll them into the DoD enterprise authoritative biometric database to identify and verify the identity of actual or potential adversaries.  U.S. forces are currently operating unilaterally or in combination with joint, multinational, and interagency partners, to identify unknown individuals and verify the identity of person(s) across the full range of military operations.  Capabilities proposed for JPIv2 will be configurable for multiple operational mission environments enabling identity dominance on the battlefield and across the DoD spectrum.

                                            <r2:Text>Funding supported refinement of a COTS/NDI Acquisition Strategy, based on transition from a developmental acquisition approach to a COTS acquisition approach which began in FY13.  Funding provided system engineering activities; technology assessment and development of the performance specification; continued market research and trade study analysis.  Additionally, funding provided support for pre-MS B planning and acquisition activities. Activities included requirements to support RFI, draft and final RFP packages, NIE testing approach (Type I SUT).  Also, contractor support provided Program, Acquisition, Engineering, Budgeting and Contracts planning preparation, and development.  In addition, Product Manager contractor support continued preparing and developing Army and OSD level statutory and regulatory documentation consistent with DoD Instruction 5000.2, the Defense Acquisition System, and compliant with existing statutory and regulatory policy for a FY16 MS B decision.  These requirements includes Systems Engineering Plan (SEP), Lifecycle Sustainment Plan (LCSP), Test and Evaluation Master Plan (TEMP), and cost analysis activities, including completion of the CARD, EA, and POE.  Funding supported government civilian labor and operations to include travel, training, supplies, infrastructure, and facility costs.</r2:Text>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Warfighter Information Network (WIN-T) Increment (Inc) 2 provides the Army with On-The-Move (OTM) networking capability.  The WIN-T Inc 2 network retains capabilities delivered by WIN-T Inc 1 and by leveraging proven government and commercial technologies, adds greater network throughput and automated  Network Management to optimize planning (to include spectrum use), initialization, monitoring and troubleshooting. WIN-T Inc 2 employs Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) Satellite Communications (SATCOM) OTM to extend the network in maneuver Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs) to Company level for the first time.  Using equipment mounted on combat platforms, WIN-T Increment 2 delivers a mobile capability that reduces reliance on fixed infrastructure and allows key leaders to move on the battlefield while retaining Situational Awareness and Mission Command capabilities. Using the Highband Networking Radio (HNR), with the Highband Networking Waveform (HNW) and high performance antennas, the WIN-T Inc 2 Line-of-Sight (LoS) network offers an adaptive 30 Megabit per second (Mbps) aggregate throughput to key leaders in their Command Post or in their vehicle. The WIN-T Inc 2 network is self-forming, which means that it automatically creates transmission paths based on terrain and environmental conditions; and self-healing, meaning that the paths will automatically re-route traffic to complete network transactions and calls even if one or more nodes break down or loses connectivity.  This offers greater network reliability and better end-to-end connectivity than traditional point-to-point networks.   WIN-T Inc 2 introduces the network management capability needed to keep the mobile and dispersed forces networked together through automated planning, initialization, monitoring, and troubleshooting.  Finally, WIN-T adopts "Colorless Core" technology that encrypts both classified and unclassified user information in the network and minimizes the number of users on the "core" of the network.  The Colorless Core allows commanders to utilize the tactical network without fear of the enemy intercepting information. Colorless Core is a technical insertion in the WIN-T Inc 1b network which enables efficient information sharing between Inc 1b and Inc 2.
 
WIN-T Inc 3 mature Network Operations (NetOps) technologies will be inserted into WIN-T Increment 2 units.

FY16 funds support Operational Testing (NIE 16.2) and tech insertion of NetOps Build 5 and upgrade to NetCentric Waveform (NCW) 10.x.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Acquisition Decision Memorandum of September 27, 2013 authorized the procurement of 98 additional communications nodes for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP), bringing the total LRIP quantity to 1,030 communications nodes. The Project Manager (PM) procured the authorized quantities on the current initial production contract (W15P7T-10-D-C007). This contract was awarded in 2010 as a three year contract with three option years.   Lots 1, 2, 3, 4 (minus Soldier Network Extensions [SNE]) and Lot 5 training bases have been procured. Lot 4 SNEs and Lot 5 CIs will be awarded in May 2015, following a successful Full Rate Production Decision.
