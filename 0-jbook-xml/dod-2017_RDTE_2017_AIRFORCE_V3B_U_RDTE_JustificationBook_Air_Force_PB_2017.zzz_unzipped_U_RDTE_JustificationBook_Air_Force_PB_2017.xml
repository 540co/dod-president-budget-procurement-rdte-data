                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The mission of USSTRATCOM is to establish and provide full-spectrum, global strike, coordinated space and information operations capabilities to meet both deterrent and decisive national security objectives and to provide operational space support, integrated missile defense, Global Command Control, Communications, and Computers Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR), and specialized planning expertise to the joint warfighter. This mission has been defined by the 2011 Unified Command Plan (UCP) change 1, the CJCS GSIN Planning Order (PLANORD) dated 06/1400Z Mar 10, the USSTRATCOM GSIN PLANORD dated 29/1943Z Jan 10 and a memorandum from the Senior Warfighter Forum (SWarF) to the VCJCS dated 13 October 2011 documenting data and information sharing deficiencies and recommendations to address them. This guidance continues to receive senior level attention as recently reiterated in the AFSPC/CC memo "Commander's Intent on On-going Material Decisions" dated 29 July 2015.

GSIN directly supports the above mission.  It nets together selected systems and sensors (from tactical to strategic), including the Nation's most modern and capable assets, taking advantage of their larger numbers, improved algorithms, mobility, and forward deployment to provide earlier cross-cueing and expanded decision space when every second counts. Using these traditionally stove-piped systems and sensors, GSIN enables the warfighter in several ways. First it will enable creation of a User Defined Operating Picture (UDOP) to provide a single, unambiguous missile event picture allowing real-time collaboration for nuclear C2 and improved senior leader situational awareness (SA) for effective decision-making. Secondly, it will improve Space Situational Awareness (SSA) by tapping additional sensor capability. Finally, GSIN will dramatically improve the ingestion of non-traditional, but readily available non-US government and commercial data to the space catalog.

The Nation's strategic C2,sensors, and mission planning programs cannot rapidly exchange information across multiple missions creating ambiguity that delays time critical national C2 decision making processes. GSIN will develop and establish a unified schema that will integrate disparate Missile Warning/Missile Defense (MW/MD) data into a single exposed data set providing redundant and unambiguous MW/MD data to national leadership. GSIN also enables existing sensors to provide data in net-centric formats consumable by other authorized systems and mission areas, thus reducing the need to acquire more sensors. Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning, execution, and future program planning.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>This program, BA 07 PE 0301112F, project 673768, Nuclear Planning and Execution System (NPES) Modernization, is a new start.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) conducts global operations in partnership with other combatant commands, services and U.S. government agencies to deter and detect strategic attacks against the United States.  USSTRATCOM is responsible for command of U.S. nuclear capabilities, space operations, global surveillance and reconnaissance, intelligence, communications, computers, global missile defense and combatting weapons of mass destruction.  To enable completion of these missions, it is modernizing the Nuclear Planning and Execution System (NPES).  NPES is a Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff system for nuclear operations and fulfillment of nuclear command and control (NC2) responsibilities.  NPES supports national strategic deterrence by providing a host of NC2 execution activities as well as contingency and crisis action planning capabilities to selected joint and combatant command staffs.  NPES is operated by USSTRATCOM and other specified users performing missions to deter and dissuade threats, and, when directed, defeat adversaries. 
 
The NPES system has evolved from several single-purpose command and control systems over the past 30 years and has reached a point where it requires modernization to meet national and strategic objectives and to comply with future concepts of operation. Additionally, modernization is needed to improve cybersecurity, system effectiveness, and supportability.  Modernization will also seek to lower the total cost of ownership and sustainment.  The modernization program will use proven/mature software engineering, technologies, and design tenets to provide a modern, secure, interoperable and reliable NC2 software capability.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Provides Electronic Support (ES) for key find, fix, track, target, engage and assess (F2T2EA) requirements supporting Space Superiority activities.  Funds developmental intelligence collection to support new capability acquisition and development.  This project also funds transportable intelligence collection and analysis capabilities that are modular (plug-and-play), and can keep pace with technological advances and emerging threats.  It provides intelligence support systems for Space Situational Awareness activities that provide the requisite current and predictive knowledge of space events and threat conditions and intelligence support to Space Protection Programs by providing architectural survivability analysis of critical mission assets for mission assurance.  It also supports phased threat system analysis and studies (A&amp;S), test support, lab equipment, and Material Acquisition and Exploitation (MAE) for system development and vulnerability/susceptibility assessments to support tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP) development and future threat technology studies necessary for mission area success and achievement of space superiority, and to preserve the US space advantage across all domains.   This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because it includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The four (4) aircraft E-4B National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC) fleet satisfies the military need for an airborne operations center with communications capabilities permitting military and civilian leadership to monitor and control military and civil national assets during all phases of conflict (nuclear and non-nuclear) or natural disaster. The E-4B NAOC fleet also satisfies the military requirement to provide a highly survivable node of the National Military Command System (NMCS). 

This Program Element's (PE's) developmental modifications include, but are not limited to, upgrades and enhancements to aircraft structures, propulsion system, fuel system, environmental control system, electrical generation and distribution systems, flight safety and navigation systems (with their associated communications equipment). Additionally modifications may enhance the aircraft's operations center facilities, to include but not limited to necessary for the Senior Leadership Command, Control and Communications System (SL3CS), National Leadership Command Capability (NLCC), Nuclear Command and Control Communications (NC3) and other communications necessary for the E-4B fleet to execute its mission. Funds may also be used to explore and develop modifications, upgrades, future systems and recapitalization efforts required to meet evolving mission requirements. Developmental modifications and studies/projects currently underway or planned for accomplishment under this program include:

- The Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) Compatible Terminal/ Presidential National Voice Conferencing (PNVC) Program integrates AEHF Compatible Command Post Terminals and PNVC capability onto the E-4B NAOC platform. This integration is necessary to replace the legacy Military Strategic, Tactical and Relay (MILSTAR) terminal, and provide access to protected wideband AEHF satellite networks. PNVC replaces the Survivable Emergency Conferencing Network (SECN), which will not be supported once the AEHF satellite network is in place.

- The Low Frequency Transmit System (LFTS) program replaces the currently installed Very Low Frequency/Low Frequency (VLF/LF) Transmit system, which is no longer sustainable after over 35 years of operation. In order to meet existing Presidential Policy Directive (PPD)-35 requirements and ensure there is assured connectivity between civilian and military leadership and military forces during real world situations, this system must be replaced. The transmit system consists of three primary equipment groups: a Control/Monitor group, a Power Amplifier/Coupler (PA/C) group, and a Trailing Wire Antenna (TWA) group.

- E-4B recapitalization includes those activities related the replacement of the current NAOC fleet. Efforts will involve early acquisition activities, to include but not limited to, preparation for a Materiel Development Decision (MDD), an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA), development of initial requirements/acquisition strategy, risk reduction activities, and other efforts necessary to initiate a recapitalization program.  

The FY2017 funding request was reduced by $4.0 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Acquisition Strategy: The acquisition strategy for each specific modification differs based on the urgency of the requirement, definition of the capability, and technology readiness level of the components.  

Management Strategy:  Program management for all aircraft modifications is executed by Commercial Derivative Aircraft program office at Tinker AFB.  The Program Executive Officer (PEO) for Mobility provides management oversight.

Contracting Strategy:  Contracting strategy differs for each individual modification, but normally includes a initial risk reduction study contract followed by a development contract.  Production installations and sustainment are typically accomplished with a separate contract.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>Prior Years Funding $180.602 was executed in PE 0303601F

In FY2014, PE 0303601F MILSATCOM Terminals, Project 672489  Family of Advanced Beyond Line-of-Sight Terminals(FAB-T) transferred to PE 0303601F MILSATCOM Terminals, Project 672490 Family of Advanced Beyond Line-of-Sight Terminals(FAB-T) in order to provide improved visibility.

In FY2016,  PE 0303601F, MILSATCOM Terminals, Project 672490, Family of Advanced Beyond Line-of-Sight Terminals(FAB-T)  transferred to PE 0303001F Family of Advanced BLoS Terminals (FAB-T), Project Family of Advanced Beyond Line-of-Sight Terminals(FAB-T)  in order to provide improved visibility.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Family of Advanced Beyond Line-of-Sight Terminals (FAB-T) program replaces legacy Milstar terminals and will provide Extremely High Frequency (EHF), protected high data rate communication for nuclear and conventional forces to include Presidential and National Voice Conferencing (PNVC).  FAB-T will provide this new, highly secure, state-of-the-art capability for DoD platforms to include strategic platforms and airborne/ground command posts via Milstar, AEHF, and Enhanced Polar System (EPS) satellites. FAB-T terminals will also support the critical command and control (C2) of the Milstar, AEHF and EPS satellite constellations. In FY16, the Air Force continued development of the FAB-T terminal, performing systems engineering, architectures, continuation of test efforts for Initial Operational Test &amp; Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) &amp; other activities to meet current &amp; future emerging SATCOM requirements.

The Presidential and National Voice Conferencing (PNVC) capability is a critical element of the Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3) System.  There are several components being developed that must be synchronized to expeditiously field this capability. In May 2015, the Air Force was designated as the end-to-end PNVC Integrator. The Defense Information Systems Agency will transfer $15M RDT&amp;E to the Air Force for PNVC Integration.  The Air Force will request a Prior Approval reprogramming for the remaining FY16 requirements.  This continuing effort was previously programmed and budgeted in DISA's PE 0303126K/Long-Haul Communications - DCS, PC01: Presidential and National Voice Conferencing Equipment and is not a New Start.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>FAB-T Acquisition Strategy:  In FY12, the government restructured the FAB-T development program to introduce competition into the acquisition strategy in order to reduce risk in delivering this capability as well as to drive down production costs. To ensure the best value to the government, the Air Force awarded production contracts in September 2013 to both contractors (Boeing and Raytheon). The production contracts began with production planning for both contractors. In June 2014, the Air Force down-selected to Raytheon. Development will continue with Raytheon and production of FAB-T Command Post Terminals. The first Production contract options to produce CPT terminals were exercised after a successful Milestone C decision was approved September 1, 2015.


PNVC Acquisition Strategy: On May 15, 2015 the Deputy Secretary of Defense assigned the PNVC End-to-End Integration responsibility to the Air Force; effective May 16, 2015, SAF/AQ designated the AFPEO for Space as the PEO.   The PNVC End-to-End Integrator program is responsible for requirements traceability, End-to-End system testing, site installation and checkout activities, training and technical manuals, network transition support, identifying deficiencies in the PNVC capability, and logistics supports for all PNVC components.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>This program, BA 07 PE 0303131F, project 672835, CVR Inc 2, is a new start.

This program, BA 07 PE 0303131F, project 676030, Global ASNT Inc 2 was initially funded in project 676029 as a new start for FY15.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Nuclear Deterrence Operations (NDO) is an Air Force Core Function.  Within this core function, Nuclear Command and Control (NC2) is the exercise of authority and direction by the President, as Commander in Chief, through established command lines, over nuclear weapon operations of military forces.  The President's authority and direction are exercised through the Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS).  The NCCS is the designated combination of flexible and enduring elements including facilities, equipment, communications, procedures, personnel, and the structure in which these elements are integrated, all of which are essential for planning, directing, and controlling nuclear weapon operations.

The Minimum Essential Emergency Communications Network (MEECN) portfolio modernizes the systems necessary to effectively provide assured communications connectivity between the President and the strategic deterrence forces in stressed environments. 

MEECN System Improvements (MSI) is a long-range planning process with users (Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC), Air Combat Command (ACC), Air Force Space Command (AFSPC), Air Mobility Command (AMC), Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), US Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM), and the Navy) to monitor and assess the performance of Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3) systems and develop recommendations for current and future strategic and tactical architectures, requirements, and issues based on available and emerging technologies. MSI is used to conduct technology testing; analyze technology strategies; conduct requirement trade space analysis, risk reduction demonstrations, and mission analysis; and build technology roadmaps as proactive support to the NC3 community.  MSI performs  analysis, integration, and testing activities for the NC3 Weapon System.  

Common Very Low Frequency/Low Frequency (VLF/LF) Receiver (CVR) Increment 2 (CVR Inc 2 ) will deliver a survivable, beyond-line-of-sight path for Emergency Action Message (EAM) reception.  The intent of CVR Inc 2 is to develop and produce a common VLF/LF receiver with an interoperable waveform for future platform integration to include airborne and ground based nodes, improve system performance, and reduce supportability costs through commonality. 

Global Aircrew Strategic Network Terminal (Global ASNT) replaces inadequate, unsustainable strategic communications equipment at bomber, tanker and reconnaissance Wing Command Posts (WCPs), Nuclear Task Forces, Munitions Support Squadrons (MUNSS), and for Mobile Support Teams (MSTs).  Global ASNT is a ground-based system that will provide survivable, secure communication paths to receive Emergency Action Messages (EAMs), Force Management messages, and Force Direction messages and disseminate them to bomber, tanker, and reconnaissance aircrews.   
  
Global ASNT is being fielded in separate capability increments. Global ASNT Increment 1 (Inc 1) includes early system engineering support for the planning and development for the future Global ASNT Increments. 

Global ASNT Inc 1 fields required Extremely High Frequency/Advanced Extremely High Frequency (EHF/AEHF) capabilities and replaces inadequate, unsustainable strategic mobile and fixed-site Single Channel Anti-jam Man-Portable (SCAMP) terminals and Secure, Mobile, Anti-Jam, Reliable, Tactical – Terminal (SMART-T) equipment.  

Global ASNT Increment 2 delivers a modernized Aircrew Alerting System (AAS) consisting of personal and general alerting equipment, and High Frequency (HF) and Ultra High Frequency (UHF) capabilities.  Increment 2 replaces inadequate, unsustainable Electromagnetic Pulse Hardened Dispersal Communication (EHDC) systems and Aircrew Alerting Communications Electromagnetic Pulse (AACE) systems.     

Global ASNT Increment 3 is planned to deliver a Very Low Frequency (VLF)/Low Frequency (LF) communications receive capability.  

This program is in Budget Activity 07, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal years.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Global ASNT replaces inadequate, unsustainable strategic communications equipment at bomber, tanker and reconnaissance Wing Command Posts (WCPs), Nuclear Task Forces, Munitions Support Squadrons (MUNSS), and for Mobile Support Teams (MSTs).  Global ASNT is a ground-based system that will provide survivable, secure communication paths to receive Emergency Action Messages (EAMs), Force Management messages, and Force Direction messages and disseminate them to bomber, tanker, and reconnaissance aircrews.  

Global ASNT is being fielded in separate capability increments. Global ASNT Increment 1 (Inc 1) includes early system engineering support for the planning and development for the future Global ASNT Increments. 

Global ASNT Inc 1 fields required Extremely High Frequency/Advanced Extremely High Frequency (EHF/AEHF) capabilities and replaces inadequate, unsustainable strategic mobile and fixed-site Single Channel Anti-jam Man-Portable (SCAMP) terminals and Secure, Mobile, Anti-Jam, Reliable, Tactical – Terminal (SMART-T) equipment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Global ASNT replaces inadequate, unsustainable strategic communications equipment at bomber, tanker and reconnaissance Wing Command Posts (WCPs), Nuclear Task Forces, Munitions Support Squadrons (MUNSS), and for Mobile Support Teams (MSTs).  Global ASNT is a ground-based system that will provide survivable, secure communication paths to receive Emergency Action Messages (EAMs), Force Management messages, and Force Direction messages and disseminate them to bomber, tanker, and reconnaissance aircrews. 

Global ASNT is being fielded in separate capability increments.  

Global ASNT Increment 2 delivers a modernized Aircrew Alerting System (AAS) consisting of personal and general alerting equipment, and High Frequency (HF) and Ultra High Frequency (UHF) capabilities.  Increment 2 replaces inadequate, unsustainable Electromagnetic Pulse Hardened Dispersal Communication (EHDC) systems and Aircrew Alerting Communications Electromagnetic Pulse (AACE) systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Information Systems Security Program (ISSP) Element provides cradle-to-grave research, development, acquisitions, supply, sustainment, depot maintenance, and demilitarization of the Air Force (AF) cryptographic and key distribution/management systems (known as the Key Management Enterprise (KME).  Additionally, ISSP funds the AF operation of its AF KME, one of two Department of Defense (DoD) Tier 1 key distribution centers.  The AF and the DoD require the capability to secure, collect, process, store, and disseminate an uninterrupted flow of information, while denying an adversary the ability to intercept, collect, destroy, interpret, or manipulate our information flows. Secure communication allows the DoD to achieve and maintain decision superiority, the key to successful application of the military instrument of national power. AF Communications Security (COMSEC) equipment protects information such as warfighter positions, mission planning, target strikes, commanders' orders, intelligence, force strength, and force readiness and ensures adversaries cannot interpret, manipulate, or destroy information. When an adversary is capable of interpretation, manipulation, or destruction of the information used by the warfighter, DoD military forces will suffer significant and/or devastating mission degradation that can result in loss of life and resources and/or disclose information that could be used against the United States in a public forum.

The overall focus of the Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) efforts within this program is to transform electronic key delivery and cryptographic devices to meet the next generation warfighting requirements. These efforts are driven by the National Security Agency's (NSA) first tenet calling for an AF KME that allows for totally "man-out-of-the-loop" electronic crypto key distribution system from the generation of the key in the key processor all the way into the using End Crypto
Unit (ECU). This eliminates the current key vulnerability of compromise/interruption by individuals transporting or loading the key.  NSA's second tenet requires an inventory of cryptographic devices that are more robust, modular, scalable, capable, net-centric, and durable.  This enables more effective and efficient performance including reduced inventory, expanded data rates, simplified upgrades, and ensured global information grid-compatibility.

The FY 2017 funding request was reduced by $3.5 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.  

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, as these budget activities include development efforts in the AF KME to upgrade systems currently fielded or have approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Air Force Electronic Key Management System (AFEKMS) consists of multiple developments supporting the Air Force requirements portion of the DoD EKMS Program. The National Security Agency (NSA) acts as the Executive Agent for the DoD EKMS Program. AFEKMS, as part of the AF Key Management Enterprise (KME) and in concert with the overarching DoD EKMS program, provides a secure and flexible capability for the electronic generation, distribution, accounting, and management of key material, with users across DoD Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) and all AF weapon systems. AFEKMS supports U.S. DoD Information Assurance. Information Assurance emphasizes confidentiality, access control, multi-level secure databases, trusted computing, and information integrity. DoD EKMS has a three-tier hierarchical structure. This tiered structure provides capability to distribute, manage, and account for COMSEC keying material. Tier 1 installations comprise the key material generation and control capability. Tier 2 installations comprise the local distribution network (COMSEC accounts) and Tier 3 is where keying material is transferred from the EKMS infrastructure to the consumers End Cryptographic Units (ECUs). Additionally, AFEKMS resources provide maintenance/distribution of AF Communications Security (COMSEC) publications for all AF users. 

EKMS improves protection of national security-related information by substantially enhancing confidentiality, integrity, and non-repudiation characteristics over the legacy manual key management systems. EKMS has and continues to greatly accelerate availability of crypto key materials through electronic transmission via Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) versus the manual handling and shipping of materials. While the current EKMS level-of-effort is directed at enhancing current and developing systems, the ultimate goal is for it to seamlessly transition to the net-centric DoD Key Management Infrastructure (KMI). The AFEKMS Program continues to provide software development to support emerging requirements during the KMI transition period. Activities include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution as well as development activities to extend life of the Simple Key Loader to bridge the gap between EKMS and the KMI implementation.

NOTE:  AF KME Software development (e.g., Data Management Device - DMD, Common User Application Software - CUAS, and Simple Key Loader - SKL) is rolled up into Tier 2/Tier 3 Development. Software upgrades can be bundled and tracked as a unit, thereby allowing less management overhead and more focus on configuration management and control.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>AF KME Post Production software development focuses on extending life of EKMS through transition to Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) capabilities.  This will be accomplished via  the Intermediary Application (iApp)  software and Tri-Service development of  KOV-21 replacement chip through Communications-Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC) by U.S. Army.  The iApp is designed to include all major Data Management Device (DMD) capabilities. The iApp is designed to meet certification and accreditation requirements and iApp user interface is designed for ease of adoption and minimal user training for EKMS DMD, Consolidated Tier 3 Testing Infrastructure (CETTI) User Application Software (UAS), and Simple Key Loader (SKL).  The CERDEC effort develops a replacement KOV-21 Card for current Simple Key Loader (SKL) to extend life of SKL until KMI compatible key loader is available.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The AF Cryptographic Modernization Effort modernizes cryptographic devices protecting critical national security information across cyber domain operations. In September 2000, the Defense Review Board (DRB) tasked National Security Agency (NSA) to evaluate the security posture of the cryptographic inventory. Systems with aging algorithms, those approaching non-sustainability, and those generally incompatible with modern key management systems were also identified and have been replaced or are being fielded. Priority systems that required immediate replacement were also identified. In addition, NSA documented the need to modernize the cryptographic inventory with capabilities designed to enable network-centric operations. Replacements/Modernization of the near term vulnerable systems must occur within the timeframe specified by device and algorithm in Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Notice (CJCSN) 6510. The DoD Cryptographic Modernization Program was established to develop a modern cryptographic base that provides this assured security robustness, interoperability, advanced algorithms, releasability, programmability, and compatibility with the future Key Management Infrastructure (KMI-See PE 0303140F, BPAC 67523, AF KMI for a full description).  This AF effort supports an integrated effort across the cyber domain to transform to next-generation cryptographic capabilities.  It provides U.S. forces and multinational and interagency partners the security needed to protect the flow and exchange of operational decision making information in accordance with national and international policy/standards, the validated operational requirements of the warfighters, and the intelligence communities.  

The AF Cryptographic Modernization Effort is a collection of projects accomplished in three phases: replacement, modernization, and transformation. The replacement phase of the program focused on updating and/or replacing out-of-date algorithms along with unsustainable cryptographic products. The modernization phase provides crypto devices with common solutions that are more robust, modular, scalable, and provide the durability to existing cryptographic end items, as well as updating mid-term aging/unsupportable crypto equipment. Manpower and logistics requirements will be reduced and manpower efficiencies gained, while incremental capability enhancements and footprint reduction are provided. The third phase of the Cryptographic Modernization Program, transformation, provides common joint solutions which enable secure, transparent, network-centric capabilities across the cyber domain. Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning/execution and future program planning.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Air Force Key Management Infrastructure (AF KMI) Program consists of multiple developments supporting the AF requirements/portion of the DoD Key Management Infrastructure (KMI). The National Security Agency (NSA) acts as the Executive Agent for the DoD KMI Program. AF KMI, in concert with this overarching DoD KMI Program, will provide a secure and flexible capability for the electronic generation, distribution, accounting, and management of key material and other communications security (COMSEC) materials for all DoD Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) systems and for the Services' weapon systems. KMI represents a broad-scale replacement of the current Electronic Key Management System (EKMS). KMI will provide capabilities that will allow networked operation in consonance with the Global Information Grid (GIG) and other DoD, fellow Service, and AF enterprise objectives. It thereby will assure a viable support infrastructure for future weapons and C4I programs to incorporate key management into their system designs.

The DoD KMI will greatly improve protection of national, security-related information by substantially enhancing confidentiality, integrity, and non-repudiation characteristics over the legacy EKMS. KMI will greatly accelerate the availability of crypto key materials through electronic transmission versus shipping of materials, will enhance mission responsiveness and flexibility, and will eventually take the man "out-of-the-loop" in the distribution of crypto key materials.

The AF KMI Program in concert with the DoD KMI Program is transitioning the Air Force from the legacy EKMS to modern DoD KMI and building the AF KMI Last Mile architecture. This Research and Development effort includes system engineering, development and testing to successfully implement the AF KMI Last Mile architecture as part of the AF Key Management Enterprise (KME). The AF KMI Last Mile program is a holistic solution integrating the legacy and new and evolving cryptographic programs, materials, products, sources and consumers. The AF KMI Last Mile capabilities include as part of the AF KME distribution, management, and load of cryptographic materials from the KMI (COMSEC account) to the cryptographic load devices. It builds the linkage interfaces that will allow KMI systems to communicate and integrates other related developments to meet operational needs. AF KMI Last Mile is currently in the Development Phase. Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.

In parallel with AF KMI, DoD and the Services are addressing the need for a new generation of future KMI-aware End Crypto Unit(ECU)that will be capable of direct interaction with the DoD KMI Enterprise, under the Joint Crypto Modernization Initiative  (PE0303140F, BPAC 675100, Cryptographic Modernization, supports this initiative).In some cases these new ECUs, although needing to be supported by KMI, will not be KMI network-connected. "Last mile" transport of black (aka benign, or encrypted) and red (unencrypted) keying material from a KMI client to a new generation ECU or current legacy ECU will need to be handled in the early years by one of two data transfer devices. Initial early systems engineering must also be addressed to accommodate future connectivity between the DoD KMI and future KMI Aware/Enabled ECUs.  This enabling form factor functionally defined as a common ECU KMI aware/enabled key load module.  This is targeted to be a standardized module to be provided to ECU developers and, as such, it must precede any future ECU developments.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Global Combat Support System-Air Force (GCSS-AF) provides the warfighter and supporting elements with timely, accurate, and trusted Agile Combat Support (ACS) information.  This information will have the appropriate level of security needed for the Air Expeditionary Forces (AEF) to execute the Air Force mission throughout the full spectrum of military operations.  The GCSS-AF program modernizes, consolidates, develops, and integrates Air Force and Department of Defense combat support information systems. 

The infrastructure and Air Force enterprise common services are a critical basis for the target Common Computing Environment (CCE) effort which Air Force Guidance Memorandum has directed for all new and modernizing IT applications.  This effort is the Air Force evolution to DoD Joint Information Environment (JIE) leveraging Core Data Centers (CDCs) and DISA-brokered cloud capabilities in compliance with the Air Force Information Technology (AF IT) baselines.  This framework is a set of baseline-driven platform and infrastructure services in both physical and virtual hosting environments.  It is comprised of development tools, an initial set of enterprise services, and governance processes critical to JIE management.   

This system is implemented worldwide to support both wartime and peacetime requirements using hardware, software, and communications capabilities available from standard open systems government contracts and communications infrastructure programs. In this manner, GCSS-AF avoids added costs, removes business processing inefficiencies, reduces deployment footprint, and improves information flow speed.

Activities also include Enterprise Protection Risk Management (EPRM), an automated risk management framework to assess and mitigate cyber and other threats to Air Force information technology and mission assets. This capability eliminates stove pipes and provides commanders with better situational awareness of vulnerabilities. Additionally, this capability promotes efficiency and sound resource allocation by enabling commanders to make better decisions when selecting risk reduction counter measures.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Global Force Management Data Initiative (GFM DI) is a Joint Staff and the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) initiative to standardize force structure data, making it visible, accessible, and understandable across the Department of Defense (DoD). This initiative is accomplished through each service’s Organizational Server. The Air Force Organizational Server (AFOS) consumes data from various Air Force Authoritative Data Sources (ADSs), validates it, formats it in a consistent force structure data standard, and publishes it for consumption by programs of record that use force structure data. The AFOS is the ADS for Air Force Authorized Force Structure and provides critical unit, billet, crew platform, vehicle, and command relationship data within the Air Force to the Joint Staff (J8) for war and contingency planning, by providing visibility of the entire force structure as a function of time: past, present and future.

The AFOS produces consistent force structure data in the Global Force Management Information Exchange Model format that is well defined, centrally managed, and interoperable as a standardized representation of the organization’s hierarchy in all other programs of record that use force structure data. The end goal of the GFM-DI AFOS is to integrate the four force management processes (Assignment, Manpower &amp; Personnel, Readiness, and Allocation), and ensure the data is available to meet the needs of all users, systems and functions. 

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The program will utilize an evolutionary acquisition strategy with incremental development efforts resulting in migration to a Joint Information Environment (JIE)-compliant platform, replacement of system Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) components with newer, more capable elements, and additional software releases to implement additional requirements. 

The anticipated contract structure will be Firm-Fixed Price contract.

The Air Force Organizational Server (AFOS) PMO will utilize a mix of Service Level Agreements (SLA) and Interface Requirement Agreements with AFOS stakeholders and support agencies as part of its management strategy. SLAs will be developed with the Lead Developmental Test Organization and the Capabilities Integration Environment at Maxwell AFB-Gunter Annex. The AFOS PMO also maintains Memorandum of Agreements (MOAs) with several AFOS input and output systems, including Manpower Programming &amp; Execution Systems,  Air Force Directory Services, Air Force Equipment Management System, and Force Structure Data Management.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY2016, PE 0303601F, MILSATCOM Terminals, Project 672490, Family of Advanced Beyond Line-of-Sight Terminals (FAB-T) was transferred to PE 0303001F, FAB-T, Project 672490 FAB-T for improved visibility of ACAT I programs.

FAB-T was funded FY13 and prior in PE 0303601F, Project Number 672487 and Project Number 672489.  In FY14, it was transferred to Project Number 672490 in the same PE.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM) terminals program develops and fields equipment enabling users to communicate via legacy and future systems to include Milstar, Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF), Ultra High Frequency (UHF) Follow-On (UFO), Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS), Defense Satellite Communication System (DSCS), Enhanced Polar Systems (EPS), and other military and commercial satellites, to support tactical Air and Space Expeditionary Force requirements and maintain essential connectivity for strategic forces.  Program RDT&amp;E currently includes the following efforts:      

1) Development work to identify commercial/military technology solutions to improve MILSATCOM terminal capabilities for the warfighters.  Focus includes, but is not limited to, increasing throughput, facilitating sustainability, reducing footprint on existing user platforms and future concept terminals to provide more resilient and/or higher data rate satellite communications to warfighters.   

2) The Family of Advanced Beyond Line-of-Sight Terminals (FAB-T) program replaces legacy Milstar Command Post Terminals (CPT) and will provide Extremely High Frequency (EHF), protected high data rate communication for nuclear and conventional forces to include Presidential and National Voice Conferencing (PNVC).  FAB-T will provide this new, highly secure, state-of-the-art capability for DoD platforms to include strategic platforms and airborne/ground command posts via Milstar, AEHF, and Enhanced Polar System (EPS) satellites. FAB-T terminals will also support the critical command and control (C2) of the Milstar, AEHF, and EPS satellite constellations. In FY15, the Air Force continued development of the FAB-T terminal,  Milestone C decision was approved on September 1, 2015. 

3) The Presidential and National Voice Conferencing (PNVC) capability is a critical element of the Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3) System. There are several components being developed that must be synchronized to expeditiously field this capability. In May 2015, the Air Force was designated as the end-to-end PNVC Integrator. The Defense Information Systems Agency will transfer $15M RDT&amp;E to the Air Force for PNVC Integration. The Air Force will request an ATR for FY15 and/or FY16 funds for remaining FY16 requirements.  This continuing effort was previously programmed and budgeted in DISA's PE 0303126K/Long-Haul Communications - DCS, PC01: Presidential and National Voice Conferencing Equipment and is not a New Start.

4) The Joint Terminal Engineering Office (JTEO) provides tri-service coordination of terminal development, acquisition and fielding activities.   

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>FAB-T Acquisition Strategy:  In September 2002 the program office awarded Boeing the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) Cost Plus Award Fee (CPAF) contract; in April 2012 the contract was converted to a Firm Fixed Price (FFP).  In 2012 the government introduced competition into the acquisition strategy to reduce risk in delivering this capability as well as to drive down production costs. In September 2012 the program office awarded a System Development and Demonstration (SDD) contract to Raytheon, Firm Fixed Price (FFP). To ensure best value to the government, the Air Force awarded production contracts in September 2013 to both contractors (Boeing and Raytheon).  The production contracts began with production planning for both contractors. In June 2014, the Air Force down-selected to Raytheon for development and production of FAB-T Command Post Terminals.  The first Production contract options to produce CPT terminals were exercised September 14, 2015 after a successful Milestone C decision was approved September 1, 2015.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>(U) This Program provides signals intelligence (SIGINT) development efforts for all USAF airborne platforms.  The funds in this Program are distributed among all Airborne SIGINT Enterprise (ASE) projects based on the development priorities established by the USAF SIGINT Capabilities Working Group (SCWG) in order to build a total SIGINT capability.  As a result, the USAF will move funds between projects periodically to develop the highest priority projects in response to urgent warfighter needs.  This PE will participate in the development, integration, testing, and implementation of international and Air Force standards (to include NATO standardization agreements) to ensure joint, allied, and coalition interoperability.  Modernization efforts include sensors for the platforms and where appropriate, their interfaces with the Air Force Distributed Common Ground System (AF DCGS).  This approach supports a synergistic development effort providing a true Air Force-wide capability.  

(U) This enterprise will use the Air Force SIGINT Architecture (AFSA) for planning and decision-making and, in turn, employ open architecture standards whenever possible to allow maximum ease of future upgrades and system interoperability.  The primary goal of the ASE is to produce an architecture-based, capability-focused SIGINT investment strategy for the USAF.  Funds in any project may be used to fund initiatives in other projects within this Progam at the discretion of the SCWG.  Funds in any project can also cover activities to include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning. 

(U) This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>(U) This project supports design studies, engineering analysis, non-recurring engineering, and other efforts associated with the integration and modification of the RC-135 SIGINT sensors and their associated air and ground components. Through extensive utilization of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) based solutions to field needed capabilities, it also incurs a need for continuous identification of suitable replacements for components affected by Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and integration efforts consistent with the COTS technology cycle.  These efforts provide required engineering for preliminary assessments of technical feasibility, operability, or military utility as well as specific engineering implementations integrated into the various baseline modifications.  These funds will be split between the RC-135V/W RIVET JOINT, the RC-135U COMBAT SENT, and the RC-135S COBRA BALL programs.  Funding reflects the SIGINT Capabilities Working Group (SCWG) priorities and the accomplishment of other Airborne SIGINT Enterprise (ASE) initiatives.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>(U) In FY 2016, PE 0304260F, Airborne SIGINT Enterprise, Project 675181, High Altitude SIGINT Development - High Altitude, efforts are transferred to PE 0304260F, Airborne SIGINT Enterprise, Project 675183, Common Development (Airborne SIGINT Development - Common Development) in order to simplify contracts as there will be only one High Altitude platform project going forward.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>(U) This project covers the costs of SIGINT integration for high altitude intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) platforms.

(U) This project supports sensor integration and test, flight test, design studies, engineering analysis, non-recurring engineering and other efforts associated with the insertion of new capabilities integrated into the Airborne Signals Intelligence Payload (ASIP) or other SIGINT sensors and their associated air and ground components for the High Altitude SIGINT platforms. The project also identifies suitable replacements for components affected by Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS).  This project provides the warfighter with a near-term, increased combat capability. Enhancements are implemented as soon as technology and risk achieve satisfactory levels. Capability improvements will be inserted into the sensors through individual development efforts that exploit signals of interest identified as service priorities by the Air Force SIGINT Capabilities Working Group (SCWG). Funding includes completion of developmental logistics tasks associated with the design, development, and integration of ASIP.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>(U) In FY 2016, PE 0304260F, Airborne SIGINT Enterprise, Project 675181, High Altitude SIGINT Development - High Altitude efforts were transferred to PE 0304260F, Airborne SIGINT Enterprise, Project 675183, Common Development (Airborne SIGINT Development - Common Development) in order to simplify contracts as there will be only one High Altitude project going forward.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>(U) This project supports design studies, engineering analysis, non-recurring engineering, program management administration and other efforts associated with the insertion of new capabilities integrated into ASIP and other sensors and their associated air and ground components that will be used on/by more than one platform.  The common development SIGINT project also supports development of new sensors capabilities, normalization of quick reaction capabilities, and identifies suitable replacements for components affected by diminishing manufacturing sources.  New capabilities are developed by separate projects. This project also supports the development of projects common to the Airborne SIGINT Enterprise (ASE) Program Element (PE) overall to include, but not limited to: the Air Force SIGINT Architecture (AFSA) maintenance, modeling and simulation efforts, and NATO SIGINT efforts.

(U) Development supports Airborne Signals Intelligence Payload (ASIP) high altitude system upgrades. The ASIP sensor is designed to be a common SIGINT system that will allow for for maximum coverage of the electromagnetic spectrum through the use of an integrated high and low band system.

(U) Capability improvements will be inserted into the ASIP sensor through individual development efforts that exploit signals of interest identified as service priorities by the Air Force SIGINT Capabilities Working Group (SCWG).  This project provides the warfighter near term increased combat capability. Enhancements are implemented as soon as technology and risk achieve satisfactory levels.  Compatability improvements will be inserted into the ASIP through individual development efforts that exploit signals of interest identified as Service priorities by the USAF SCWG. Sensors will be integrated and tested on the various platforms as funding permits.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>(U) Project 675185, Non-Traditional SIGINT (NTS) changed from COMPASS BRIGHT.  Non-Traditional SIGINT (NTS) includes both COMPASS BRIGHT and Operational Reconnaissance Projects.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>(U) COMPASS BRIGHT develops, demonstrates, and rapidly transitions advanced Air Force specific Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) capabilities against emerging and future target signals of interest.  This program pursues SIGINT technologies for program transition, to include Communications Intelligence (COMINT), Electronic Intelligence (ELINT), Audio, Analytics, Special Signals of Interest, and Radio Frequency (RF) Measurement and Signature Intelligence (MASINT).  The COMPASS BRIGHT program objective is to develop technologies for application in SIGINT and MASINT systems or subsystems. Acquisition and production of these developed technologies will occur within the appropriate platform programs. COMPASS BRIGHT projects are selected through a data call process, whereby the USAF evaluates proposals from the laboratories and industry partners, to select those projects that are most promising. This program includes total government and contractor costs for these projects.

(U) Operational Reconnaissance (Ops Recce) is part of the ELINT initiative to improve overall USAF ISR capability through development and use of sensor data from non-ISR platforms and innovative use of sensors.  This program pursues Ops Recce capabilities for transition through development, testing, demonstration and implementation efforts across all platforms.  The Ops Recce program objective is to provide increased battlespace awareness through the use of sensors/platforms to achieve effects beyond what those sensor/platforms were originally designed.   

(U) The program office authority extends to accomplishment of out-of-cycle NTS efforts.  These tasks may be filtered through the SCWG outside the normal vetting process to expedite acquisition of high-end capabilities for the warfighter.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>(U) This project supports special Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) studies as well as the development and integration of advanced SIGINT capabilities for special programs including, but not limited to:  Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) sensors, the Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (PED) associated with these systems, and other efforts approved by the USAF SIGINT Capabilities Working Group (SCWG).  Development efforts will include, but are not limited to: new signal sets, antenna improvements, sensitivity upgrades, and data distribution upgrades.  This project provides the warfighter with near term combat capabilities with increased capability improvements accomplished as technologies and risks achieve satisfactory levels.  Sensors will be integrated and tested on various platforms including the MQ-1B/MQ-9A Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) as funding permits.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program element funds the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) Aerospace Management System Division (AMSD), the designated Air Force (AF) Communications, Navigation, Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) and Navigation Safety Center of Excellence (COE).  The COE provides expertise to Headquarters Air Force, AF major commands (MAJCOM), and weapon system program offices regarding CNS/ATM system technical functions and performance standards for operation in the US National Airspace System (NAS) and international civil airspace.  This centralized capability supplements the MAJCOMs and over 50 AF weapon system program offices with resident CNS/ATM technical expertise.

This funding enables the AMSD to monitor and participate in government and industry technical forums responsible for the development and assessment of international civil aviation standards for operations in worldwide airspace.  Division personnel analyze civil standards as they are being developed and work to influence them to support Department of Defense (DOD) interests.  CNS/ATM experts identify specific technical and engineering criteria and document them in generic performance matrices (GPMs).  The COE works with MAJCOM and program office personnel to develop strategies for implementing CNS/ATM requirements on AF weapon systems.  Specifically, CNS/ATM experts work with program office systems engineers to tailor the GPMs to apply civil standards to each platform's unique avionics architecture.  Once CNS/ATM component integration and testing is completed, COE personnel validate platform CNS/ATM performance against the standards necessary to operate in civil airspace.  

The program office manages an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract that enables a centralized procurement of CNS/ATM and navigation safety avionics equipment. These contracts are used by aircraft program offices across the DOD, among other federal agencies, and in support of foreign military sales.

This program performs periodic audits required by civil aviation assurance standards on processes used to develop and distribute the Digital Aeronautical Flight Information File (DAFIF) to DOD users. This electronic navigation database, developed and maintained by the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA), contains critical safety of flight information used by DOD flight crews to fly instrument flight rules procedures worldwide.  

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN) is a satellite ground terminal network comprised of two communication nodes (Schriever AFB &amp; Vandenberg AFB) and 15 antenna systems. The antennas are distributed around the globe at seven locations -- Vandenberg Tracking Station (VTS), Diego Garcia Station (DGS), Guam Tracking Station (GTS), Hawaii Tracking Station (HTS), New Hampshire Tracking Station (NHS), Thule Tracking Station (TTS) and Telemetry and Commanding Station (TCS) at RAF Oakhanger, England -- to ensure global coverage for 140 satellites in various orbits. The AFSCN conducts an average of 450 satellite contacts per day supporting Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT), Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), Missile Warning, Communications, Weather, Launch Vehicle Support, and Research and Development (R&amp;D) in support of Department of Defense (DoD), Intelligence Community (IC), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) operations. While most of the 450 satellite contacts/day are routine command and control activities, the AFSCN is also used for satellite emergencies (e.g. tumbling satellite) because its high power antennas are often the only earthbound assets that can contact a non-responsive satellite to re-establish command &amp; control. During FY14 and FY15 the AFSCN supported 28 space vehicle emergencies resulting in the preservation of $8.5B worth of satellites. In addition to routine and emergency satellite operations C2, the AFSCN provides support to launch vehicle and early orbit operations, ensuring worldwide antennas receive telemetry as the rocket travels through the atmosphere and transmit commands to a newly orbiting satellite to initiate early orbit checkout. Finally, the AFSCN provides Factory Compatibility Testing (FCT) to ensure satellites and rockets can communicate via the AFSCN before the satellite is launched. These funds are used to develop next-generation tools to improve the AFSCN and ensure the capability is available to support DoD, Intelligence, and civil users.

REMOTE TRACKING STATION (RTS) BLOCK CHANGE (RBC)- SATELLITE ANOMALY RECOVERY AND SUPPORT UPGRADE; ENHANCED HIGH-POWER AMPLIFIER (EHPA): The Air Force will complete development testing of the Enhanced High Power Amplifier (EHPA) first article. The AFSCN is in jeopardy of losing the emergency high power satellite contact capability due to obsolete parts used in the legacy AFSCN system. The EHPA program will develop a new high power amplifier that resolves the obsolescence issue well into the 2020s. FY16 funds support the transition and operational turnover of the first EHPA.

UNIFIED S-BAND (USB) UPLINK: The Air Force is adjusting the AFSCN for spectrum-sharing with industry and demonstrating the ability to migrate away from the current L-Band uplink / S-Band downlink spectrum to the Unified S-Band (USB) spectrum. RDT&amp;E funds support a first article integration of USB into the AFSCN baseline to begin supporting factory compatibility testing. FY 2016 funding provides S-Band uplink transmitter to enable commanding of satellites using USB frequency in addition to L-Band frequency. USB capability is currently only being implemented on the RBC transportable to allow factory compatibility testing prior to launch of dual band satellites (per revised AFSPC requirement). RBC transportable is made up of 3 portable components: a Core equipment van, an HPA van, and an antenna van. 

ELECTRONIC SCHEDULING AND DISSEMINATION (ESD 3.0): ESD 3.0 is a significant upgrade to the currently fielded version 2.7.  The upgrade will allow satellite operators to request contact time with their satellites via the shared AFSCN antennas, automatically deconflict overlapping requests, create a schedule, and publish the schedule in real-time to all users. The Air Force completed the first ESD 3.0 operational confidence test 3Q FY15. Deficiencies from that event are expected to be resolved in FY16. Initial Developmental Testing (DT) is scheduled for 4Q FY16. Operational Testing (OT) and PEO Certification is anticipated in 3Q FY17. Turnover to operations is expected by 4Q FY17. 

AFSCN ENHANCEMENT AND DEFICIENCY RESOLUTION: Provides test, cyber security, requirements management, and system architecture support to the AFSCN.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development.  BA 7 includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This budget activity funds operational development necessary to acquire, sustain, and enhance segments of the Air Force Weather Weapon System (AFWWS).  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning. Program Management Administration costs include Federally Funded Research and Development Centers and Advisory and Assistance Service.  AFWWS provides timely, accurate, consistent and relevant space and atmospheric (a.k.a. terrestrial) weather information for global battlespace situational awareness. AFWWS supports worldwide operations of Air Force and Army warfighters, Special Operation Forces, and other government agencies with weather observing and forecasting capabilities at in-garrison and deployed locations, as well as centralized, reach-back capabilities.  AFWWS activities align under four capability areas:  Weather Data Collection, Weather Data Analysis and Dissemination, Weather Forecasting, and Product Tailoring/Warfighter Applications.  This alignment ensures an integrated and systems-oriented approach to program management decisions.  

Weather Data Collection provides automated atmospheric and space environmental sensing capabilities at fixed and deployed locations worldwide. Projects include Next Generation Radar (WSR-88D) and Upper Air Observing Follow-On.  Funding will enhance system technical performance based upon state-of-the-art signal processor technology for enhanced discrimination of precipitation types, severe weather detection, and rainfall amount estimations and will continue operationalizing new upper air sounding capability.  

Weather Data Analysis and Dissemination provides a net-centric infrastructure that assimilates worldwide sources of atmospheric and space weather data and produces decision-quality information for warfighters.  Improved analysis of real-time weather information supports DoD's Warfighting and Enterprise Information Environment Mission Areas, as well as DoD's role in transformation of the National Airspace System through the Next Generation Air Transportation System, and enhances Air Force energy security plans. In FY16 the Air Force Weather-Web Services (AFW-WEBS) moved into this capability area from Weather Forecasting to better align its function of integration of net-centric capabilities. FY17 funding will implement Inc 4, Build C, Release 3; develop and implement Inc 4, Build C, Release 4; and develop Inc 4, Build D, Release 1 in order to enhance the capability to ingest, process, store, access, and disseminate meteorological/oceanographic data via upgrades to the web services architecture to expand the Open Geospatial Consortium services and upgrade the large-scale data processing to accommodate new environmental satellite and numerical weather modeling data. 

Weather Forecasting provides advanced scientific numerical weather prediction capabilities for automated, high resolution forecast products for mission execution, rehearsal, and planning. Weather Forecasting includes projects for Numerical Weather Modeling; Weather Services - Live, Virtual, Constructive (WS-LVC, formerly Environmental Data Cube System Support), and the Space Weather Analysis and Forecast System.  FY17 funding will complete Air Force Global Air Land Weather Exploitation Model (GALWEM) integration into operations and continue to integrate ensemble and four-dimensional data ingest schemes in order to improve convection and cloud forecasting techniques and enhancing aerosol modeling algorithms.

Product Tailoring/Warfighter Applications provide timely, local, and regional target-scale weather information to operational commanders for a given Area of Responsibility and at tactical levels they provide front-line weather information to warfighters, including weather forces, conducting combat operations.  This supports the 'train as you fight' concept by assuring fixed and deployable systems have an equivalent operator look and feel. Wx Common Component.

The FY17 funding request was reduced by $6.590M to account for the availability of prior year execution funds.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>SWAFS is designed to enhance and sustain a single integrated space weather software baseline operating in a net-centric environment at all security levels within the 557th Weather Wing enterprise architecture. 

SWAFS was declared FOC in FY15 and then modified to focus on the Global Assimilation of Ionospheric Measurements(GAIM)Full Physics model, to satisfy future requirements, including the development of other new models and science algorithms that do not currently exist and processing space weather data that is not currently available.  Funding also provides for program office and related support activities.  

Capabilities provided:

Return to service; corrective, adaptive, and capability improvement maintenance for the operational software baseline

SWAFS accepts space weather data and uses models and/or algorithms to create and disseminate specified space weather analysis and forecast products

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>To support the Air Force worldwide flying mission, this program element funds research, development, and management of new air traffic control communications, surveillance, positioning, and precision approach and landing systems. When applicable, this includes joint efforts with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and coordination with the International Civil Aviation Organization and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). ATCALS development funding currently focuses on the Next Generation (NextGen) Air Transportation System (ATS) and Deployable Radar Approach Control (D-RAPCON) programs as described below.

NextGen ATS. This is an interagency effort designed to enable the transition from a ground infrastructure dominated Air Traffic Management capability for the U.S. National Airspace System (NAS) to a capability that leverages advances in Performance Based Navigation (PBN), non-radar based surveillance services, and transition from solid-state analogue voice communications to networked digital voice and data exchange. Per Deputy Secretary of Defense Direction (28 Dec 07 Memo), the Air Force is the DoD lead Service for NextGen ATS implementation and architecture development. NextGen ATS will be built on key elements from existing programs and technologies and on new systems under development. As these technologies and architectures mature, ground system upgrades will be coordinated and fielded concurrently with aircraft avionics capabilities that are acquired and integrated into Air Force aircraft (manned and unmanned). These efforts are a subset of the Communication, Navigation, and Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) program in PE 0305099F and will involve aircraft avionics as well as fixed based and deployable air traffic control and landing systems. FY17 efforts will continue to use the Lead Service Office (LSO) Enterprise Architecture process to develop a NextGen ATS DoD Strategic Roadmap, Integrated Master Schedule (IMS), and Command and Control Core Function Support Plan, outlining DoD and Air Force equities and requirements, via in-depth analysis of FAA NextGen ATS programs and timelines. Portfolio analysis will be captured in DoD NextGen ATS charters to guide Services through a broad and complex NextGen ATS environment. To minimize integration costs, the LSO and Joint Program Office (JPO) along with the Air Force Flight Standards Agency (AFFSA) will also assist aircraft depots, program offices, and major commands in combining military (Mode-5 Identification Friend or Foe (IFF), Global Positioning System (GPS) Military (M)-Code), and civil avionics upgrades, including Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B), Data Communication (DataComm), and PBN. To support LSO and JPO NextGen ATS decision making, AFFSA and major command users will use supporting infrastructure tools, such as the CNS/ATM Global Aviation Initiatives, Mandates, and Standards (GAIMS) database and a DoD Fleet-Wide Avionics Repository (F-WAR). In support of remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) operations, JPO efforts will also continue to support requests for implementation of GBSAA at new locations. Additionally, AFFSA will continue efforts to examine new civil air traffic control and landing system technologies that may have military utility such as a remote virtual Air Traffic Control tower capability. In total, these efforts will focus on enabling DoD aircraft to take advantage of NextGen envisioned NAS efficiencies, developing policies/procedures to reduce costs while ensuring airspace access, seamlessly integrating RPAs into the NAS and international airspaces, improving the display of aircraft position to air traffic controllers, determining future requirements for digital communications with manned and unmanned aircraft, and enhancing flight safety.  

Deployable Radar Approach Control (D-RAPCON).  D-RAPCON will replace the 40 year old AN/MPN-14K and AN/TPN-19 Airport Surveillance Radar (ASR) and Operations Shelter (OPS) subsystems with state of the art digital systems. Modification and overhaul of the existing systems has proven to be ineffective due to diminishing manufacturing sources.  On average, due to systemic equipment failures, no more than three of the existing 17 systems are deployable at any given time.  The current AN/TPN-19 and AN/MPN-14K Operational Availability rates are 69% and 67% respectively versus a requirement for D-RAPCON of 98%.  D-RAPCON will provide aircraft surveillance/sequencing, air traffic control communications, and automation capabilities for terminal area air traffic control operations. D-RAPCON will also be deployed with a fixed base or deployable Instrument Landing System and a fixed or mobile control tower to provide a complete air traffic control capability.  The D-RAPCON will support tactical military and worldwide humanitarian operations and provide a capability to support domestic disaster relief.  The primary surveillance radar coverage (non-cooperative targets) is out to 60 nautical miles (nm) and the secondary surveillance radar coverage (cooperative targets) will increase from 120 nm to 200 nm.  The D-RAPCON Capability Development Document (CDD) was approved by the Air Force Requirements Oversight Council on 8 Feb 11.  FY17 funds will complete developmental testing (DT) and operational testing (OT), and perform any deficiency mitigation work as necessary. In FY17, the program office will also be preparing for MS C and approval for a production representative unit and, a full rate production decision (FRP). Prior to FRP approval, there are also six system certifications which must be accomplished. These include: Air Traffic Control Radar Beacon System Identification Friend or Foe, Mark XII/Mark XIIA Systems Certification; National Airspace System Certification; Shelter/Transportability Certification; Electro-Magnetic Spectrum Certification; Information Assurance Certification; and Accreditation and Interoperability and Supportability Certification. Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.  Related OPAF funds are in the PE 0305114F Weapon System Code 833010.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>ATCALS is a basket program element with multiple programs in various stages of acquisition which provide the air traffic control infrastructure to support peacetime and wartime missions.  The current acquisition strategy is focused on replacing 1960/70s era deployable and fixed based equipment with mature off-the-shelf technology with remote maintenance capability while also looking to the future under the NextGen ATS initiative.

Current contracting efforts include D-RAPCON development and GBSAA/NextGen ATS planning/implementation.  The contracting strategy for D-RAPCON development is based on award of a competitive fixed price incentive firm contract emphasizing off-the-shelf technology and maximizing the use of non-developmental items. The contract includes engineering, manufacturing, and development and test with follow-on production options.  GBSAA and NextGen ATS Enterprise Architecture Implementation Tasks are being executed via Military Inter-Departmental Purchase Requests, and Project Orders with various organizations (FAA, MITRE, Army, AFRL, and Air Force Flight Standards Agency).       

The Air Force Program Executive Officer (PEO) for Battlefield Management (BM) is the PEO for ATCALS.  PEO/BM is also the delegated milestone decision authority for ATCALS.  Under PEO/BM is the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center Airspace Management Systems Division (AFLCMC/HBA) which includes program management, contracts, legal, and financial management support.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Full-scale and subscale Aerial Targets assure warfighter's weapon systems will perform effectively against real-world enemy fighters and cruise missiles.  Aerial Targets provide adherence to Public Law Title 10, Section 2366 "Live Fire/Lethality" developmental/operational test requirements.  Targets are used to validate operational missile/weapon system effectiveness and fighter Operational Flight Program (OFP) updates.  Targets are essential for development testing/operational testing for all air-to-air and surface-to-air missiles, and for the F-22A, F-35, F-18, F-16, and F-15, aircraft.  The objective is to provide realistic targets for missile testing to enable the development of offensive counter-air systems (air-to-air and surface-to-air) capable of defeating changing enemy airborne threats. This program element funds development, improvements, and updates of full-scale/subscale aerial targets and target control systems to ensure aerial targets represent enemy threat airborne systems.  Specialized target payload subsystems are developed for requirements to include but not limited to missile scoring, electronic attack, electronic countermeasures and infrared (IR) countermeasures, radar and IR signature augmentation, and chaff and flare dispensing systems.  

This program is in budget activity 7 - Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Full-scale aerial targets, subscale aerial targets, and companion Target Control Systems (TCS) assure the effectiveness and currency of warfighter weapon systems to combat real-world enemy fighters and cruise missiles.  The BQM-167A Air Force Subscale Aerial Target (AFSAT) is a reusable jet-powered target aircraft measuring approximately 20 feet long with a mission to simulate threat aircraft for testing and evaluation of surface-to-air, ship-to-air, or air-to-air missiles.  The target accomplishes this mission through the use of optional payloads including chaff and flare, electronic attack, and infrared devices.  Funding supports continued improvement of launch phase performance and overall performance enhancement efforts.  Funding supports development, improvements, and updates of target control systems and specialized target payload subsystems for requirements to include but not limited to missile scoring, electronic attack and infrared (IR) countermeasures, radar and IR signature augmentation, and chaff and flare dispensing systems. 

Electronic Attack (EA) pod upgrade provides new techniques and capabilities critical to subscales and full-scales to realistically emulate foreign threat systems in support of weapons testing.  

TCS provides a myriad of sub-systems that together delivers the capability to control and track mission aerial targets (full-scale and subscale) and to track a mix of other critical mission participants (to include relay platforms, shooters, and the missile system under test).  In this role, TCS ensures an optimum integrated aerial target environment that enhances both weapon system assessments and companion aircrew skills, all the while assuring the full safety of mission participants throughout the conduct and fulfillment of T&amp;E objectives.  Funding supports continued improvement (modernization) of TCS capabilities to effectively meet the multi-service T&amp;E demands of current and future warfighter weapon systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Full-scale Aerial Targets assure warfighters weapon systems perform effectively against real-world enemy fighters and cruise missiles.  Aerial Targets support adherence to Public Law Title 10, Section 2366, which requires major systems and munitions programs to conduct survivability and lethality testing before full-rate production.  The Aerial Targets program provides targets to satisfy "Live Fire/Lethality" developmental/operational test requirements.  Targets are used to validate operational missile/weapon system effectiveness and fighter operational flight program (OFP) updates.  Targets are required for developmental/operational testing for all air-to-air and surface-to-air missiles, and for the F-22A, F-35, F-18, F-16, and F-15, aircraft.   The United States Air Force's (USAF) Air Superiority Modernization/Mission Area Plan has identified aerial targets as a capability shortfall; the QF-16 program will fulfill this requirement.  Funding supports continued development of the follow-on full-scale aerial target (QF-16) and simulators, development, improvements, and updates of target control systems and specialized target payload subsystems for requirements such as: missile scoring, electronic attack and infrared (IR) countermeasures, radar and IR signature augmentation, and chaff and flare dispensing systems. Development is required to evolve QF-16 threat capabilities to meet current and future threats identified by OSD.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) conducts specialized investigative activities and force protection support for Air Force (AF) commanders worldwide. This assists AF commanders in protecting their people and resources. AFOSI's mission includes investigating criminal matters affecting AF personnel, contract fraud and economic crimes involving AF weapons systems and spare parts, the investigation of environmental crime, counterdrugs, computer intrusion detection and forensic media analysis of computer crimes. This element supports Technical Surveillance Countermeasures (TSCM), Computer Crime Investigations (CCI), and technical support to criminal and counterintelligence investigations and operations conducted by AFOSI. AFOSI's TSCM mission conducts counterintelligence investigations
for both AF and DoD facilities and programs in order to deter and detect technical surveillance operations conducted by Foreign Intelligence Services to compromise classified or sensitive information. The purpose of CCI research is to improve AF and DoD Information Operations capability by enhancing AFOSI's ability to deter or prevent spies, hackers, or saboteurs from manipulating, damaging, or stealing sensitive war fighting data or systems. Failing that, to investigate, identify, and prosecute
those who do. While most research to meet operational requirements is Operational System Development, there is also research in the category of Engineering and Manufacturing Development due to a need for modifications to present technology. The equipment required to provide technical support to investigations is unique and complex. This equipment must be continually updated to provide state-of-the-art capabilities to detect and neutralize criminal activities targeted against the AF and DoD.
In an era of advancing technology, reduced manning, and increasingly high level fraud, environmental crime and computer crime investigations, technical investigative equipment must be continuously updated to enable AFOSI special agents to have the most cost effective and best possible means of thwarting criminal acts. The evolution of a new wave of computer crimes has made AFOSI responsible for the collection, investigative analysis, national level law enforcement coordination, and dissemination of hacker activity and intrusion incidents for the Air Force. AFOSI's computer crime equipment must stay on the leading edge of technology to collect criminal information as well as pursue and apprehend criminals through a global medium. AFOSI must continually update its existing high tech computer surveillance equipment to support ongoing and future investigative operations to identify hackers and hacker groups, as well as potential hostile government activities targeting Air Force communication and control systems. Critical Infrastructure Protection identifies weaknesses in the Air Force Critical infrastructure, highlights critical
countermeasures and acquires and deploys cost-effective solutions. The intent is to provide an Air Force-wide review of current infrastructure vulnerabilities; prioritize AF protection planning and integrate with existing programs; identify gaps based on AF needs; direct studies to refine AF requirements.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Market Research is accomplished jointly within the DoD, Counterintelligence, and Law Enforcement communities with the various government laboratories and major  contractors to identify locations with the ability to develop investigative tools unique to our mission needs. These technologies, capabilities, and limitations of current and future investigative tools is sometimes highly sensitive or classified. Market Research also allows inter-agency coordination and deconfliction to occur,
reducing or eliminating duplicitous development efforts. Annually, stakeholders meet to discuss initiatives, challenges and organizational goals to coordinate or consolidate requirements to increase efficiency. Once Market Research and any applicable coordination/deconfliction is completed, acquisition channels are analyzed and selected based on the ability to meet operational and technical security requirements.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The OC-135B aircraft supports the implementation of the United States Government (USG) Open Skies Treaty. This program addresses the requirements in the Presidential Policy Directive-15 (PPD-15).  The Open Skies Treaty allows signatories to conduct observation flights over each other's territory using fixed-wing, unarmed observation aircraft. The aircraft can use optical cameras, video cameras, sideways-looking synthetic aperture radar, and infrared line scanning devices.  There are 34 participating states to the Open Skies Treaty.  The Air Force is required to allow over flight of USAF bases per multilateral request; to acquire, operate, and maintain the aircraft and equipment utilized during over flights of partner countries; to provide required sensor media and initial media processing; and to provide airfield servicing, logistics, and maintenance for foreign over flights of the US.

Open Skies Sensors - Mission equipment on the OC-135B includes wet film optical framing and panoramic cameras.  Open Skies Sensors program addresses the requirements in the Presidential Policy Directive-15 (PPD-15), which states," The United States shall begin budgeting no later than FY14 to upgrade the sensors on the current aircraft by replacing film-based cameras with available electro-optical sensors. (U)" Additionally, current cameras are nearly obsolete, unreliable, hard and increasingly expensive to maintain, and repair parts must be individually manufactured.  In addition, the web film manufacturers are discontinuing production of the film stock. Furthermore, the ultimate imagery product customer desires digital format products. This camera replacement program will replace the wet film cameras with modern, digital cameras. Modern, digital cameras will be more reliable, maintainable and cost effective. The customer will be able to more readily use the imagery products. Equipment service life will be extended significantly.

Test articles will be procured for the purpose of developmental testing and to support Treaty certification of the sensors.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Technical Surveillance Countermeasures (TSCM) develops future technologies capable of thwarting advanced, hostile force technical capabilities.  The technologies will provide secure environments for austere mission planning locations and theater commander centers, and will collect information for counterthreat operations in support of DoD and AF requirements.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Research and Development Space and Missile Operations (RDSMO) program, executed by the Advanced Systems and Development Directorate at Kirtland AFB, NM, conducts space and missile Research and Developmental Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) and Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) in support of experimental, demonstration, and operational satellites.  The program develops, acquires, and operates satellite command and control (C2) and fixed/deployable telemetry, tracking, and commanding (TT&amp;C) antenna systems in support of AF and DoD missions.  The RDSMO program is responsible for the design, development, integration, testing, sustainment, and operations of the Multi-Mission Satellite Operations Center (MMSOC) C2 systems installed in the RDT&amp;E Support Complex (RSC) at Kirtland AFB, NM and at the Satellite Operations Center 11 (SOC 11) located at Schriever AFB, CO.  

FY17 funds include incremental development and establishment of new capabilities for the MMSOC, systems engineering, special studies, integration and test efforts in support of demonstrations and operational architectures designed to increase operations and maintenance affordability, efficiency and resiliency for global satellite command and control through military and commercial capabilities.  

The main objective of MMSOC is to develop the capability to rapidly support R&amp;D and operational systems and to transition R&amp;D space vehicle technology with residual military utility to operational status for immediate warfighter support. MMSOC is a multiple mission operation system that uses standard software to (1) perform satellite command and control (C2) in support of launch requirements; (2) develop and test tactics, techniques, procedures and concepts to conduct satellite operations; (3) provide a satellite C2 incremental block evolution resource for RDT&amp;E of new systems and concepts; and (4) deliver operational flexibility for new and currently flying assigned satellites.  A secondary objective of MMSOC is to provide a foundational C2 platform and product line for the Enterprise Ground Services (EGS) effort to build upon.  

In FY17, this Program Element supports EGS.  EGS is performing technology maturation, experiments and prototyping for increased commonality and resiliency in space program ground systems.   

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>Enterprise Ground Services (EGS) is envisioned to provide a robust enterprise ground architecture for Air Force space systems, which leverages mission commonality and automation to reduce sustainment costs and re-focus manpower on warfighting capabilities.  In addition, EGS will enable a near-real-time common operating picture of enterprise-wide tactical health, status, indications, and warnings for Air Force satellites.  The end-state will be a modern technical infrastructure which is cyber-secure and resilient against the Advanced Persistent Threat and employs streamlined architecting, acquisition, and operational processes.  Through early architecture studies and prototyping, the government will establish clear ownership of the technical baseline to meet Better Buying Power principles as the EGS effort evolves through development.  This effort provides focus and expertise for the development, test, certification and enforcement of standards and interfaces for all AFSPC satellite ground systems to enable transition planning for legacy ground systems, new capability demonstrations, and systems acquisition leading to an enterprise ground architecture for Air Force space systems.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Located at Peterson AFB, Colorado, the Space Innovation, Integration and Rapid Technology Development program develops and modifies modeling and simulation tools that Air Force Space Command's Space Analysis Center uses for operations research, military utility analyses, tradeoff studies, and other evaluations of space mission areas to guide planning, programming, requirements generation, analyses of alternatives, and other activities.  Development activities incorporate changes in fielded and projected space operational capabilities, as well as technical improvements, into the group's software tools to ensure their data and technology remain current.  Its innovation, education, and training activities foster solutions to operational deficiencies and enhance the integration of space systems into Air Force operations, thereby enabling service and joint warfighters to realize the full potential of existing and planned space capabilities.  

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Integrated Broadcast Service (IBS) fulfills the warfighter's requirements for worldwide threat warning and situational awareness information with timely production and simultaneous dissemination of Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) derived combat information. It also provides target tracking data to support threat avoidance, targeting, force protection, and situational awareness. This information is continually refined in near real time by strategic, operational and tactical sensors.

IBS is comprised of the following:
- A Common Interactive Broadcast (CIB) on UHF satellite channel using a Common Message Format (CMF) and a MIL-STD Demand Assigned Multiple Access (DAMA) compliant waveform and Line of Sight (LOS) using the Wideband Networking Waveform (WNW) and Joint Tactical Terminal (JTT). 
- IBS-Network Services (IBS-NS) includes two Global IBS Network Servers (GINS) and four Theater Interface Nodes (TINs) to support the geographic Combatant Commanders, all built to validated warfighter requirements.
-- Two GINS receive data from each theater and integrate this data into a worldwide picture available to all network/broadcast users. 
-- Four regional TINs allow local and out-of-theater users (not directly receiving IBS broadcast) to receive the CIB information broadcast.  Additionally, the TIN will receive and inject data into the CIB for producers without access to the theater CIB. 

This PE funds:
- Modernization of IBS (IBS-NS, CIB, and CMF) 

This project will identify and implement an open, scalable system architecture that will accommodate growth as the virtual world grows and cyber operations change.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Spacelift Range System (SLRS), also known as the Launch and Test Range System (LTRS), provides public safety and assured access to space.  SLRS operates at the Eastern Range (ER) at Patrick AFB/Cape Canaveral AFS, FL and the Western Range (WR) at Vandenberg AFB, CA.  SLRS provides tracking, telemetry, communications, flight safety, and other capabilities to support launch of national security space (NSS), civil and commercial space payloads, Intercontinental and Sea Launched ballistic missile and missile defense evaluations, and aeronautical and guided weapon tests.  SLRS enables national security, civil, and commercial spacelift operations to be conducted safely; together with national security space launch capability, SLRS provides assured access to space for the nation.  The ER and WR are part of the Department of Defense Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB).

SLRS is comprised of twelve subsystems that together provide this capability to the ranges. The Range Safety and Command Destruct subsystems provide the capability to destroy an errant rocket, if necessary to protect public safety. These subsystems rely on the Telemetry, Radar, and Optics subsystems to provide tracking data.  The Weather and Surveillance subsystems allow range operators and customers to determine if conditions are safe for launch. The Communications, Data Handling, and Timing &amp; Sequencing subsystems ensure critical data is expeditiously routed from remote sensors (e.g. radars, optics, etc.) to range operators and customers. Finally, the Planning and Scheduling subsystem ensures all assets are available when needed for a launch or test operation.

As aging range systems exhibit decreasing reliability, leading to higher operations and maintenance costs and increasing the risk of launch delays, the Air Force requires RDT&amp;E funds to conduct architecture analyses to optimize investment planning.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) established the Senior Year Program in 1955. The program has evolved significantly over the years to include the U-2 airframe, engines, sensors, cameras, recorders, data links, life support systems, test facilities and equipment. The U-2S model airframes were constructed in the late 1980s, with the last aircraft rolling off the assembly line in 1989. The U-2S provides global reconnaissance signals intelligence (SIGINT) and geospatial intelligence (GEOINT) 24 hours a day, seven days a week in support of national and DoD worldwide missions. The U-2 is currently deployed to forward operating locations (FOL) around the world. Modifications to the aircraft and payloads are required to ensure continued operational effectiveness in support of Combatant Commander Requirements and in accordance with previous NDAA guidance.

In the 2013 PB, the Air Force decided to retain the U-2 weapon system instead of retiring it. At that time sustainment efforts and capability upgrades to the platform and payloads were pursued to support National and Combatant Commander requirements.

In the 2015 PB, the Air Force decided to retire the U-2 in 2016. In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2244a, the U-2 weapon system is identified as Equipment Scheduled For Retirement Or Disposal: Limitation On Expenditures For Modifications, stating that modification to any aircraft (i.e., a given tail number, weapon, or item of equipment that the SECAF plans to retire or otherwise dispose of within 5 years after the date on which the modification would be completed) are prohibited.

In the 2016 PB, the Air Force re-phases U-2 divestiture to begin in FY2019 and to complete no later than FY2020. In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2244a, the Secretary of the Air Force may waive the prohibition on modifications if the Secretary determines that carrying out the modification is in the national security interest of the United States. Therefore, modifications required to address sustainment issues (diminishing manufacturing sources, vanishing vendor items) or operational utility may be submitted to the Secretary for approval to ensure operational effectiveness and to comply with guidance received in previous and current NDAAs for the timeframe of phased divestiture. The National Security Waiver was signed by the Secretary of the Air Force on 26 May 2015.

In FY17, the Air Force will continue to address reliability, maintainability, sustainability, and safety issues and support U-2 integration of payloads and capabilities by taking prudent acquisition actions to meet operational requirements, comply with previous NDAA guidance, and IAW 10 U.S.C. Prudent acquisition activities also include trade studies, analyses, preliminary systems engineering, system and subsystem level testing in accordance with DoD and military standards, and specification development  in support of both current program planning and execution as well as studies supporting analysis and investment in future U-2 program planning. 

The U-2 Program provides funding for an Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar System (ASARS) technology maturation effort. This effort will design, fabricate, integrate, and demonstrate system capability enhancements for a high altitude deep look SAR system.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This PE focuses USAF efforts on long endurance platform projects and their associated sensors and communications suites.  Efforts include, but are not limited to, optionally piloted airships, Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPAs), or more standard aircraft platforms flown as manned or unmanned. 

The Integrated Sensor Is Structure (ISIS) project intended to develop a radar that is fully integrated into a station-keeping, stratospheric airship.  The ISIS project effort was completed in FY 2015. 

The Medium Altitude Global ISR and Communications (MAGIC) project was developing a multiple-day, medium altitude ISR unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to provide long endurance surveillance with a multiple sensor payload.  This concept was initiated by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) as a Joint Capabilities Technology Demonstration (JCTD) in FY 2010.  Aurora Flight Sciences (AFS)'s Orion Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) concept was chosen as the JCTD candidate by OSD/Director of Defense, Research and Engineering (DDR&amp;E) per the recommendation of the Combatant Commands.  The MAGIC/Orion RPA initiative was subsequently released from the JCTD process and transitioned to the Air Force as the sponsor and 645th Aeronautical Systems Group (AESG, a.k.a. BIG SAFARI Systems Program Office) as the manager of this developmental initiative in FY 2011.  AFS and the 645th AESG performed flight test series demonstration August 2013 to March 2015 at Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake, CA.  The flight test demonstration completed in FY 2015.  The Block 0 (a.k.a. prototype) air vehicle and associated ground test articles have been re-located to Aurora Flight Sciences in Manassas, VA.  Follow-on development of the Orion RPA Block 1 air vehicle and system continues with the remainder of the FY 2015 $20M Congressional Add and the addition of the FY 2016 $5M Congressional Add.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Medium Altitude Global ISR and Communications (MAGIC) project was an Air Force led technology and concept development to demonstrate the ability for a Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) to stay airborne in the medium altitude structure for a multiple day duration mission with a minimum of 1,000 pounds payload capacity of intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance sensor systems.  The MAGIC concept was initiated by OSD/DDR&amp;E in FY 2010 in response to the Combatant Commanders ranking this type of initiative as the highest priority for a Joint Concept and Technology Demonstration (JCTD).   In FY 2011, the Air Force accepted this initiative as the sponsor and MAGIC was subsequently removed from consideration as a JCTD and transitioned into the Air Force as a developmental project.  

The MAGIC project was intended to provide the USAF with data regarding sensor and aircraft performance parameters at a multiple day duration at medium altitude flight.  The objectives laid out in the JCTD competition and selection of Aurora Flight Sciences (AFS)'s Orion RPA for the long endurance demonstration was managed by the 645th Aeronautical Systems Group (AESG).

In FY 2010, OSD/DDR&amp;E (now ASD/R&amp;E) provided $5M of initial funding to AFRL to initiate the MAGIC project.  In FY 2011, ASD/R&amp;E provided an additional $5M to keep the MAGIC project development moving forward.  The Air Force provided $10M of FY 2011.  Congressional Adds of $19M in FY 2012, $50M in FY 2013, and $20M in FY 2015 provided the Endurance UAV program manager with the funding for the continuation of the Orion RPA development and initiation of the three phase flight testing series.     

Orion RPA flight test series and demonstrations were accomplished at Naval Air Weapons Station (NAWS) China Lake, CA between August 2013 and March 2015.  The objectives to test/demonstrate basic air vehicle performance, expansion of the flight characteristic envelope, a multiple day sortie and integration of a nominal sensor payload were successfully accomplished on the prototype (Block 0) Orion RPA in a controlled environment non-representative of an operational setting.  Subsequent development efforts concentrated on the validation of the Orion RPA system requirements and concept design/specifications for a follow-on air vehicle (Block 1) capable of operational deployment in the event that the Air Force chooses the Orion RPA as a quick reaction capable system for a theater of operation or a program of record.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The acquisition strategy for the Air Force to develop a long endurance, persistent ISR capability for the Combatant Commanders was an outgrowth of a Joint Capabilities Technology Demonstration (JCTD) started in FY 2010.  Development efforts contracted with Aurora Flight Sciences and their Orion RPA include:  completion of studies analysis, development of a prototype air vehicle (Block 0), bench testing of engines and other aircraft components, ground continuity testing of select avionics, flight controls, and engine components, slow and high speed ground taxiing and a full flight series testing of the Orion RPA capabilities to include a multiple day, long duration flight demonstration.  Efforts continue between the Aurora Flight Sciences production and management teams and the 645 AESG Systems Program Office to continue hardware and software engineering and development to meet operational airworthiness standards and mission requirements for a deployable air vehicle (Block 1).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Airborne Reconnaissance Systems (ARS) program coordinates the development of advanced technologies (sensors, data links, targeting networks and products, and quick reaction capabilities) in support of multiple airborne reconnaissance platforms, both manned and unmanned.  Its objectives are to develop, demonstrate, and rapidly transition advanced, interoperable, multi-platform solutions to reduce the find, fix, target, and track kill chain timeline, and to provide safe separation and collision avoidance for Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPAs).  It provides for modeling/simulation, training and systems engineering.  This program also coordinates the development of common collection, processing, and dissemination solutions for near-real time Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR).

Funds in any project can also cover activities to include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The purpose of the Imaging and Targeting Support (I&amp;TS) project is to develop and demonstrate next-generation, persistent, wide area surveillance, aircraft avoidance, and common imagery reconnaissance sensor capabilities (radar and electro-optical systems), including sensor data processing, for multiple airborne platforms, as well as sensor products to aid in rapid targeting (geolocation models, sensor-based exploitation tools, sensor networking capabilities).

Developmental efforts pursued are: improved sensor capabilities such as hyperspectral imagery (HSI), measurement and signature intelligence (MASINT), polarimetric imaging, ground moving target indication(GMTI), foliage penetration, and additional radar, electro-optical, and other modalities; increased geolocation accuracy; increased dismount detection capability; advanced sensor data correlation; automated target detection; network centric warfare; and other Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) and associated Tasking, Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (TPED) capabilities. These efforts are intended to reduce both target search and kill chain timelines as well as supporting traditional intelligence activities. This project will also increase interoperability among developed systems by developing common standards and tools.

The funds in this project, less Congressional adds and Quick Reaction Capabilities (QRCs), are distributed in priority order, as supported by the Challenging Targets Initial Capabilities Document and set by the GEOINT Capabilities Working Group, for the goal of building a comprehensive Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) capability for the USAF. On an annual basis, developmental technologies are reviewed against warfighter capabilities and requirements based on strategic roadmaps. Efforts advancing the technological maturity of promising sensors and processing capabilities are reviewed and prioritized into a recommended list for senior executive direction to implement in the coming year.

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Imaging and Targeting Support efforts are prioritized on an annual basis by the GEOINT Capabilities Working Group (GCWG), in accordance with the validated gaps in the Challenging Targets ICD. Resulting funded efforts are then contracted for and/or executed by either various program offices, laboratories, industry, and/or other government agencies (OGAs).

ASARS technology maturation is conducted by AFLCMC/WIN, in conjunction and cooperation with AFLCMC/Warner Robbins (U-2 system program office).

Acquisition strategy is to maximize commercial and national development efforts and investment through multiple contracting methods, including the use of Engineering Change Proposals (ECP) to modify existing contracts and new contracts that were awarded both competitively or on a sole source basis.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Joint Technology Center/Systems Integration Laboratory (JTC/SIL) is a center of technical excellence to support Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) and Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) programs within the services.  The mission includes Service-specific and Joint Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) programs throughout DoD. The JTC/SIL provides a Government testbed for interoperability, rapid prototyping, technology insertion and transition, systems engineering, modeling/simulation, training and C4ISR optimization. The cornerstone of JTC/SIL's diverse tool set is the Multiple Unified Simulation Environment (MUSE), which is the DoD simulation/training system of choice for many UAS, RPA and ISR systems. The MUSE is also known as the Air Force Synthetic Environment for Reconnaissance and Surveillance (AFSERS) in its Air Force application.  The MUSE/AFSERS simulates Air Vehicles, Sensors, Datalinks, Takeoff and Landing Systems, and to some degree, surrogate UAS and RPA ground stations, when actual ground stations are unavailable. 

The Services and combatant commanders have a requirement for the capability to train with a system that provides a real-time simulation environment containing multiple intelligence systems that can be integrated with larger force-on-force simulations. The MUSE creates a realistic operational environment which supports the ability to assess military utility, architecture and concept of employment development, and Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP) refinement, conduct emerging concepts experimentation, and optimize C4ISR within warfighting exercises and experiments. It is the preferred simulation system used by the combatant commanders and Joint Services to support command and battle staff C4ISR training.

The MUSE/AFSERS also creates a realistic operational environment that supports: an embedded training capability for multiple Program Managers; tools to minimize acquisition and life cycle cost and schedule impacts; ability to conduct emerging concepts experimentation, future systems exploration, systems integration, and technology insertion; applications for Joint and Service-specific warfighting exercises; and C4ISR optimization.

MUSE/AFSERS is currently in use within all Services and most unified commands simulating MQ-1, MQ-9, RQ-4, MQ-1C, M/RQ-5, RQ-7, national and commercial satellite collectors, P-3, E-8, and the U-2. During warfighting exercises, the JTC/SIL integrates imagery simulations with associated C4ISR systems to support the execution of critical imagery processes. For those assets normally not available for training, the JTC/SIL provides surrogate systems and interfaces. Distributed training environments, virtually linking participants from various locations worldwide, are routinely supported within the MUSE architecture. The MUSE/AFSERS is also used as a mission rehearsal tool for current, on-going military combat operations.

The JTC/SIL supports the OSD UAS Task Force staff and the Standards and Interoperability Integrated Product Team, as well as the joint team working the Ground Segment Interface. The JTC/SIL is the primary custodian of this interface and in that role performs various supporting tasks including development of tools for helping the definition and execution of open architecture for joint service ground control systems, developing and maintaining standardization agreement (STANAG) 45 joint interoperability tasks to be defined on an annual basis.  

Activities also include studies and analysis supporting current and future program planning and project execution.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>In FY 2017, Common-Airborne Sense and Avoid(C-ABSAA) will transfer to PE 0604257F, Advanced Technology and Sensors, Project 645148, Common-Airborne Sense &amp; Avoid (C-ABSAA), in order to provide greater visibility into this capability.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Common-Airborne Sense and Avoid (C-ABSAA) is an analysis and developmental effort in the pre-Material Development Decision phase of the acquisition lifecycle which supports emerging warfighter requirements to fully integrate Group 4-5 RPA into the National Airspace System (NAS), international airspace, other nations' sovereign airspace, and operational combat airspace to conduct the entire range of military operations across all mission environments. C-ABSAA also supports the "Worldwide Operations" Key Performance Parameter (KPP) in larger Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) requirement documents, and Public Law 112-239 directing DoD collaboration with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the National Air and Space Administration (NASA) to safely integrate RPA in the NAS. Funding in this project supports the development of a Sense and Avoid (SAA) capability for Group 4-5 RPA and covers analysis, research, and developmental activities as well as infrastructure and other government costs. Ongoing activities include support to the development of warfighter requirements and analysis of possible solution alternatives, collaboration with the FAA, NASA, and other Services to develop national policy and standards, and SAA related studies, analysis, modeling and simulation, program planning and project execution. RPA platform specific integration and testing is not included.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Gorgon Stare provides city-sized wide area airborne surveillance for Combatant Commanders and is managed by the 645th Aeronautical Systems Group, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance and Special Operations Forces (ISR&amp;SOF) Directorate.  The Gorgon Stare system provides a podded wide area airborne sensor suite integrated on specially-modified MQ-9 Reaper Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA).  The Air Force Requirements Oversight Council (AFROC) approved Air Combat Command's recommendation to transition Gorgon Stare from a Quick Reaction Capability to an Air Force Enduring Capability in November 2014. Gorgon Stare's requirements are documented in the Gorgon Stare Wide Area Airborne Sensor Capabilities Production Document (draft).  The acquisition strategy for this Air Force podded sensor suite solution is sustainment of the currently fielded capabilities with any upgrades implemented via validated -1067s or Urgent Operational Needs.  

Development efforts conducted with FY 2014 Congressionally added RDT&amp;E funds included system integration lab testing of Near Vertical Direction Finding (NVDF) with Gorgon Stare Increment 2 Wide Area Motion Imagery (WAMI) sensors.  Funds spent on NVDF will provide a ramp for future airborne integration efforts as required.  Development efforts conducted with $10M of FY 2015 Congressionally added funds include efforts focused on Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) in support of an Urgent Operational Need.  Development efforts conducted with $10M of FY 2016 Congressionally added funds will continue the RDT&amp;E efforts for persistent day and night wide-area motion imagery (WAMI) capability considered by operational commanders to be a critical ISR program for combat units.

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution as well as future program planning.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Hyperspectral Sensors project develops Hyperspectral Imagery (HSI) sensors and capabilities for MQ-1 Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) and other manned or unmanned aircraft.  Within this project, the Airborne Cueing &amp; Exploitation System-Hyperspectral (ACES HY) program helps to fulfill a portion of the sponsoring combatant command and Central Command's current HSI requirements. The ACES HY program developed sensors for the MQ-1B Predator Block 15 and included development of the required training, maintenance and fielding plans to support a working architecture. 

Activities within this project also include studies and analysis supporting current and future program planning and tech development for advanced HSI sensors and capabilities, including high altitude HSI sensor developments per the HSI strategic roadmap.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

In FY 2017, PE 0305206F, Airborne Reconnaissance Systems, Project 676025, Data Compression, efforts will transfer to PE 0604257F, Advanced Technology and Sensors, Project 646025, Data Compression, in order to provide greater visibility into this capability.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Data Compression effort provides the warfighter a capability to efficiently compress and decompress airborne ISR sensor data and transmit near real time to tactical users through current and future bandwidth limited commercial satellite communications (SATCOM) or military SATCOM. The effort is developing, testing and will implement new sensor data compression and decompression algorithms for current and emerging airborne ISR sensors. Additionally, the program develops compression and decompression capabilities for manned and unmanned airborne platforms, associated ground stations, and DCGS. Outputs will meet standard certification for use within the DoD GEOINT and MASINT architectures.

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current and future program planning and execution.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The RC-135 operational systems development and enhancement activities support the design studies, engineering analysis, non-recurring engineering, and other efforts associated with the integration and modification of the RC-135 programs and their specialized mission systems, both air and ground.  Associated ground systems include RIVET JOINT Mission Trainers (RJMT, a.k.a. mission crew simulators), Ground Data Processing Systems (GDPS), Distributed Mission Shelters (DMS), Mission Crew Training Systems (MCTS), Airborne Capabilities Extension System (ACES), and the Operational Flight Trainers (OFT, a.k.a. flight deck simulators).  Extensive utilization of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) based solutions allows rapid fielding of needed capabilities through upgrades and supports Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS)/Vanishing Vendor Items (VVI) logistics mitigation efforts.  The results of these efforts provide for preliminary assessments of technical feasibility, operability, or military utility as well as specific engineering implementations for integration into the various systems baseline configurations.  

These activities are managed by the Air Force through the 645th Aeronautical System Group (645 AESG).  The 645 AESG (a.k.a. BIG SAFARI Systems Program Office or SPO) manages engineering, ground and support systems modifications, integration, flight testing, product assurance, acceptance testing, logistics, and training activities.  

Aircraft, sensor systems, and associated ground support system engineering planned for FY 2017 budget includes developmental planning, execution and support for the RC-135V/W RIVET JOINT Baselines 12 and 13, the RC-135U COMBAT SENT Baselines 5 and 6, and the RC-135S COBRA BALL Baseline 5 and 6 configurations.  The world-wide challenge of keeping pace against technologically agile targets used by both nation and non-nation-state adversaries and the rapid evolution of COTS technologies demands a responsive and adaptive acquisition strategy for fielding incremental spiral upgrades and baseline capabilities that are logistically supportable at all locations.  The BIG SAFARI SPO uses an incremental baseline strategy to mitigate risk, find affordable solutions and field needed capabilities on the aircraft and associated ground support and training systems.  Obsolescence and DMS/VVI logistical concerns are addressed with each baseline upgrade strategy and assessed annually as part of the fleet sustainment responsibilities.  

RIVET JOINT Baseline 12 upgrades consist of, but are not limited to, increased digital signal exploitation, increased digital signal recorder bandwidth, enhanced spatial processing/exploitation, enhanced weather radar, digitally enhanced electronic flight instrument system (EFIS), continued Communications, Navigation and Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) and Required Navigational Performance (RNP) compliant cockpit avionics enhancements, Air Force Distributed Common Ground System (AF-DCGS) interoperability, operator work station 3-D map projection, enhanced operator reporting management tools, modernized communications security (COMSEC) protocols, and a new steerable beam antenna.  RIVET JOINT Baseline 13 upgrades consist of, but are not limited to, providing a continuous recording capability, Super Wideband Compressive Receiver (SWCR) and Nyquist Folding Receiver (NYFR), global air traffic management (GATM) avionics upgrades such as new autopilot, automated data system-broadcast (ADS-B) and Mode 5 identify friendly or foe (IFF) systems, and family of beyond-line-of-sight terminals (FAB-T) advanced extremely high frequency (AEHF) communications suite. 

COMBAT SENT Baseline 5 upgrades consist of, but are not limited to, active ranging and theater networked geo-location (TNG) capability, Proforma search and classification tools, cooling duct and lighting improvements, CORVUS related precision electronic intelligence (ELINT) SWCR enhancements, RJ Baseline 13 communications intelligence (COMINT), upgraded computer architecture, primary sensor measurement system (PRISMS), wideband global satellite (WGS) communications enhanced integration, development of an airborne tracking system, communications upgrade to include Multifunctional Information Distribution System Joint Tactical Radio System (MIDS-J), and continued Communications, Navigation and Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) and Required Navigational Performance (RNP) compliant cockpit avionics enhancements.  COMBAT SENT Baseline 6 developmental enhancements consist of, but are not limited to, steerable beams for the COMINT sub-system, improved SWCR capability and specific emitter ID/SET ELINT sub-system, PRISMS merge with manual precision collections, millimeter wave and low band capabilities with PRISMS, digitizing antennas, direction finding of High Frequency signals and expanded streaming audio services and 360 degree aircraft tracking system.

COBRA BALL Baseline 5 upgrades consist of, but are not limited to, RJ Baseline 11 COMINT, Medium-Wave Infra-Red Acquisition (MIRA) sensor/processor upgrade, measurements and signature intelligence (MASINT) Collection System (MCS) optical upgrade, WGS communications enhanced integration, communications upgrades to include MIDS-J and an intercom system (FORCE), U-Band antenna, continued CNS/ATM and RNP compliant cockpit avionics enhancements, and foreign instrumentation intelligence (FISINT) system refresh.  COBRA BALL Baseline 6 developmental enhancements consist of, but are not limited to, high gain S-Band antenna, large format Sapphire windows, RJ Baseline 13 COMINT capability, FISINT analog to digital receiver, and Brave version of the digital cockpit avionics systems to continue CNS/ATM and RNP compliance initiatives.          

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.  

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational Systems Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production fielding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The RC-135 RIVET JOINT, COBRA BALL, and COMBAT SENT configured aircraft are maintained and kept technologically relevant through a baseline or incremental upgrade acquisition strategy.  Technology upgrades and quick reaction capability (QRC) developments are acquired through the 645th Aeronautical Systems Group (AESG) in accordance with the BIG SAFARI Program Management Directive (PMD) and Class Justification and Approval (J&amp;A) document for acquisition of supplies and services using an "other than full and open competition" criteria.  The supplies and services procured by 645 AESG satisfy National Security requirements (FAR 6.302-6) through the use of their standing J&amp;A or address Unusual and Compelling Urgency requirements (FAR 6.302-2) through an individually prepared J&amp;A supported by the BIG SAFARI Life Cycle Management Plan (LCMP) across the full spectrum of system life cycle management from developmental engineering to system retirement ("cradle to grave") support.  Due to the ever changing threat and rapidly evolving electromagnetic combat environment encountered during our prolonged commitment to Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) and the global war on terrorism, the acquisition program manager has the authority to redirect funding as necessary to meet current stated and emerging Combatant Commander (CCMD) and/or Intelligence Community (IC) requirements to better meet the war fighting objectives.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Air Force Distributed Common Ground System (AF DCGS) is the Combat Air Force (CAF) weapon system architecture for planning and direction, collection, processing and exploitation, analysis and production, and dissemination (PCPAD) of data from Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions. Since AF DCGS is also a major component of the DoD DCGS, the system is designed to complement and interoperate with the DoD, Army, Navy and Marine Corps DCGS. The AF DCGS mission is to provide Joint Task Force (JTF) Commanders, Air Component Commanders, Unified Commands, and other directed organizations with global, time-sensitive ISR PCPAD across the spectrum of military operations. AF DCGS is a multi-INT network linked weapon system (AN/GSQ-272) capable of exploiting intelligence data from manned platforms, remotely piloted aircraft (RPA), non-traditional ISR platforms, national and commercial satellites, and other collection systems. AF DCGS is designed to support joint operational requirements by providing a common PCPAD means to provide time-sensitive intelligence to field commanders and in support of the Air Operations Center (AOC) mission requirements. Currently, the AF DCGS worldwide architecture is composed of two worldwide core sites, three regional core sites, two remote Air Force Forces (AF FOR) sites, four National Mission Partner (NMP) sites, three support sites, and multiple National Guard Bureau (NGB) sites. Currently, AF DCGS is supporting ongoing operations from forward deployed and in-garrison CONUS and OCONUS based locations. The system employs a concept of data distribution, information sharing and collaborative work centers. AF DCGS provides the national leadership and the warfighter with integrated and interoperable national and airborne reconnaissance by providing quality and fused Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), Measurement and Signature Intelligence (MASINT), and Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) tailored to the warfighter for all levels of conflict.  

AF DCGS is transforming by integrating the necessary technologies and tools to provide increased capabilities and meet emerging and urgent operational needs.  These efforts will also integrate commercial-off-the-shelf and government-off-the-shelf upgrades to provide current technologies and achieve necessary application services.  The next series of upgrades will meet the operational need to integrate new and/or improved sensor capabilities, as well as enhance interoperability by migrating to an Open Architecture (OA) to improve data sharing ability per DoD direction.

The DCGS Data Compression effort provides the warfighter a capability to efficiently compress and decompress airborne ISR sensor data and transmit near real-time to tactical users through current and future bandwidth limited commercial satellite communications (SATCOM) or military SATCOM. The effort will develop, test and implement new sensor data compression and decompression algorithms for current and emerging airborne ISR sensors. Additionally, the program develops compression and decompression capabilities for manned and unmanned airborne platforms, associated ground stations, and DCGS. Outputs will meet standard certification for use within the DoD GEOINT and MASINT architectures.

Activities include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.

The FY 2017 funding request was reduced by $2.785 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Air Force Distributed Common Ground System (AF DCGS) is the Combat Air Force (CAF) weapon system architecture for planning and direction, collection, processing and exploitation, analysis and production, and dissemination (PCPAD) of data from Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions. Since AF DCGS is also a major component of the DoD DCGS, the system is designed to complement and interoperate with the DoD, Army, Navy and Marine Corps DCGS. The AF DCGS mission is to provide Joint Task Force (JTF) Commanders, Air Component Commanders, Unified Commands, and other directed organizations with global, time-sensitive ISR PCPAD across the spectrum of military operations. AF DCGS is a multi-INT network linked weapon system (AN/GSQ-272) capable of exploiting intelligence data from manned platforms, remotely piloted aircraft (RPA), non-traditional ISR platforms, national and commercial satellites, and other collection systems. AF DCGS is designed to support joint operational requirements by providing a common PCPAD means to provide time-sensitive intelligence to field commanders and in support of the Air Operations Center (AOC) mission requirements. Currently, the AF DCGS worldwide architecture is composed of two worldwide core sites, three regional core sites, two remote Air Force Forces (AF FOR) sites, four National Mission Partner (NMP) sites, three support sites, and multiple National Guard Bureau (NGB) sites. Currently, AF DCGS is supporting ongoing operations from forward deployed and in-garrison CONUS and OCONUS based locations. The system employs a concept of data distribution, information sharing and collaborative work centers. AF DCGS provides the national leadership and the warfighter with integrated and interoperable national and airborne reconnaissance by providing quality and fused Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), Measurement and Signature Intelligence (MASINT), and Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) tailored to the warfighter for all levels of conflict.  

AF DCGS is transforming by integrating the necessary technologies and tools to provide increased capabilities and meet emerging and urgent operational needs.  These efforts will also integrate commercial-off-the-shelf and government-off-the-shelf upgrades to provide current technologies and achieve necessary application services.  The next series of upgrades will meet the operational need to integrate new and/or improved sensor capabilities, as well as enhance interoperability by migrating to an Open Architecture (OA) to improve data sharing ability per DoD direction.

AF DCGS was previously managed by four primary efforts: Geospatial Intelligence-1, Systems Release-1 (SIGINT Intelligence), Net Comms-1 (Network/Comm Infrastructure), and Data Links-1.  Beginning in FY16, to better align with ACC focus areas and required operational capabilities, AF DCGS management has evolved into eight efforts consisting of: GEOINT (GB 4.1), GEOINT Transformation-1, Systems Release (SR 3.0), SIGINT Transformation-1, Sensor Integration-1, Multi-INT-1, Network Infrastructure Transformation-1, and DCGS Reference Imagery Transition (DRT): 

1. *GB 4.1: The GEOINT Baseline 4.1 (GB4.1) effort completes the Bulk Release process and provides a common baseline across the weapon system.  It also integrates Airborne Cuing and Exploitation System, Hyper Spectral ACES-HY (MQ-1) and Global Hawk (GH) Block 40 capability into AF DCGS.
2. GEOINT Transformation-1: The GEOINT Transformation effort rapidly integrates new capabilities and migrates GEOINT-specific applications &amp; capabilities into the open architecture framework.
3. *SR 3.0: The Systems Release (3.0) effort completes SIGINT Bulk Release process and provides a common baseline across the weapon system. Provides the ability to TPED the Airborne Signals Intelligence Payload (ASIP) family of systems and integrates the Common Intelligence Collections System (CICS) capability. 
4. SIGINT Transformation-1: Rapidly integrate new capabilities, leverage mission partner methods and tools, exchange data, and migrate the SIGINT-specific applications/capabilities into the open architecture framework. 
5. Sensor Integration-1: The Sensor Integration effort rapidly integrates AF, Joint, &amp; Coalition Sensor data into DCGS Enterprise to ingest data, perform sensor planning, and Command &amp; Control.
6. Multi-INT-1: Provides and supports Open Architecture (OA)-based Enterprise Services, moves to commodity hardware, a virtual desktop environment, and facilitates enterprise-wide collaborative tools.
7. Network Infrastructure Transformation-1: The Infrastructure Transformation effort modernizes the AF DCGS infrastructure to improve data ingest, transfer, and storage capabilities while migrating the network toward a cloud architecture.
8.*DRT: The Air Force DCGS Reference Imagery Transition (DRT) effort provides data ingest, transfer, and storage capabilities for NGA reference imagery data.

NOTES:
In FY15: GEOINT-1 and SR-1 did not have any associated RDT&amp;E funding.  The Other Procurement Air Force (OPAF) funding is exhibited in the Procurement Documentation. 
*For FY16-FY17, this effort does not have any associated RDT&amp;E funding.  The Other Procurement Air Force (OPAF) funding is exhibited in the Procurement Documentation.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This initiative will provide the warfighter a capability to efficiently compress and decompress airborne ISR sensor data and transmit near real-time to tactical users through current and future bandwidth limited commercial SATCOM or military SATCOM.  The effort will develop, test and implement new sensor data compression and decompression algorithms for current and emerging airborne ISR sensors.  Additionally, the program develops compression and decompression for manned and unmanned airborne platforms, associated ground stations, data storage and the DCGS.  The effort includes life-cycle systems engineering of airborne hardware &amp; software including updates and integration support.  Algorithms will be suitable for service-wide use within the DoD GEOINT and MASINT architectures as part of ISR enterprise standards.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The program began developing and testing compression and decompression algorithms for airborne ISR sensor data.  The program will eventually build, integrate and test sensor specific hardware (with the algorithms embedded) for onboard data compression.  The effort initially focused on compression and decompression of complex and detected Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data followed by applications of compression technologies to other DoD IMINT/MASINT sensor data (Spectral, Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR), Phase History SAR) and ground architecture.  Algorithms will be suitable for service-wide use as part of ISR enterprise standards.

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>This program, BA 07 PE 0305220F, project 675149, RQ-4 Capability Enhancements, is a new start.
This program, BA 07 PE 0305220F, project 675149, Ground Segment Modernization Program (GSMP), is a new start.
This program, BA 07 PE 0305220F, project 675149, Capability Enhancements Government Test and Non-Prime Support, is a new start.

In FY 2017 and beyond, Program 0305220F, RQ-4, Project 675145, RQ-4 Block 30, Project 675146, RQ-4 Block 40, and Project 675147, RQ-4 Ground Segment/Comm System, modernization efforts were transferred to Program 0305220F, RQ-4, Project 675149, RQ-4 Capability Enhancements in order to allow greater visibility into Global Hawk modernization efforts.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element funds five (5) related Air Force projects sharing the RQ-4 platform in common: the RQ-4 Block 30, the RQ-4 Block 40, the RQ-4 Ground Segment/Communication System, RQ-4 Capability Enhancements, and Multi-Platform Radar Technology Insertion Program (MP-RTIP) in FY17 and forward.

Global Hawk:
The RQ-4 Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) provides a high altitude, deep look, long-endurance Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) capability that complements space and other airborne collectors during peacetime, crisis, and war-fighting scenarios.  This funding supports the development of RQ-4 aircraft, payloads, ground and support segments.  The Block 20/30/40 RQ-4B RPA is the successor to the Block 10 RQ-4A, and is designed to employ 3,000 pounds of payload and enable Multi-Intelligence (multi-INT) collecting.  

Block 30 (Project 675145) employs upgraded Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR) sensors known as the Enhanced Integrated Sensor Suite (EISS), the Airborne Signals Intelligence Payload (ASIP) sensor, and is being upgraded with a modular ISR payload adapter to accommodate Next Gen Sensors. Activities include mission planning development and testing, Mode 5 Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B), enhanced weather capability development and testing, ice protection system development and testing, airspace and interoperability and communication enhancements and updates, airframe upgrades, sensor upgrades and integration of alternate sensors, risk reduction and integration, periodic Operation Flight Program updates and releases, and resolution of issues with Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS). This will include systems engineering/program management, configuration and data management, test and evaluation, management services, Deficiency Report/Materiel Improvement Project (DR/MIP) Investigations, studies and analysis and fielding support for Projects 675146 (Block 40), 675147 (Ground Segment/Comm System), and 675149 (Capability Enhancements).

The Block 40 (Project 675146) employs the MP-RTIP (Project 67RTIP) radar sensor. In FY15 and beyond, this includes the Block 40 costs for the development of enhanced weather capability development and testing, additional sensor modes, mission planning development and testing, airspace integration activities including Mode 5 Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B), airspace and interoperability and communication enhancements and updates, airframe and sensor enhancements to the Block 40 fleet.  Activities also include studies and analysis, providing support to future system enhancements, communication and interoperability enhancements, periodic Operational Flight Program updates and releases, current and future program planning, and project execution.  

The Ground Segment/Communication System (Project 675147) includes the Ground Segment Modernization Program (GSMP), Communication System Modernization Program (CSMP), and the Next Generation Communication System. The ground segment currently includes the Mission Control Element (MCE), the Launch and Recovery Element (LRE), and the networking resources required to simultaneously disseminate intelligence while remaining compliant with Department of Defense (DoD) cybersecurity network requirements to operate on the Global Information Grid. As a result of the reinstatement of the Block 30s in the FY15 PB, the requirement for ground stations operations significantly increased which increased the need for efforts to address DMS issues.  The GSMP supports a 20 year operational lifecycle, and comprises an approach that enhances capability and combines the functionality of legacy MCEs and LREs into a single building-based configuration.  It will also enhance interoperability data dissemination and provide a robust training capability.  The CSMP will provide enhancements across the RQ-4 communication network.

RQ-4 Capability Enhancements (Project 675149) begins in FY17 and is intended to provide greater visibility into Global Hawk modernizations by consolidating the majority of the efforts from Project 675145 (Block 30), Project 675146 (Block 40), and Project 675147 (Ground Segment/Comm System) consistent with the approved acquisition strategy.  Activities include airspace and interoperability and communication enhancements and updates, airframe upgrades, sensor upgrades and integration of alternate sensors, risk reduction and integration, ice protection system development and testing, program protection projects, cybersecurity, government furnished equipment repair, legacy data items (technical data packages), resolution of issues with DMS, periodic Operation Flight Program updates and releases, and additional sensor modes.  This will include systems engineering/program management, configuration and data management, test and evaluation, management services, DR/MIP Investigations, studies and analysis and fielding support for Projects 675145 (Block 30), 675146 (Block 40), and 675147 (Ground Segment/Comm System).  Activities also include the GSMP, CSMP and the Next Generation Communication System.  The RQ-4 program will maintain and upgrade interoperability for Blocks 20/30/40 with system of systems partners and continue to incorporate applicable synergies with other platforms such as the U.S. Navy's Triton, other RPA weapon systems, and Transport, Processing, Exploitation &amp; Dissemination (T-PED) elements. The networking capability for intelligence dissemination is required to provide the data transport interface between the Weapons System, Operations Centers, and external Intelligence Community customers.

When judged feasible and affordable, this program will participate in the development, testing, and implementation of international standards to enhance joint, allied, and coalition interoperability. Studies and activities may be initiated to further explore the utility of incorporating the emerging architectural standards such as the USAF Unmanned Aeriel System (UAS) Command and Control Initiative (UCI) or the DoD's Unmanned Control Segment standards (UCS) and Open Mission Systems (OMS).  GSMP and CSMP will incorporate UCI and UCS standards. 

Common-Airborne Sense and Avoid (C-ABSAA):
In FY 2016, PE 0305220F, RQ-4, Project 675148, Common-Airborne Sense and Avoid (C-ABSAA), efforts transferred to PE 0305206F, Airborne Reconnaissance Systems, Project 675148 in order to provide greater visibility into this capability and prepares for expanded applications by making the capability program and platform agnostic.

C-ABSAA is an analysis and developmental effort in the pre-Material Development Decision phase of the acquisition lifecycle which supports emerging warfighter requirements to fully integrate Group 4-5 RPA into the National Airspace System (NAS), international airspace, other nations' sovereign airspace, and operational combat airspace to conduct the entire range of military operations across all mission environments.  C-ABSAA also supports the "Worldwide Operations" Key Performance Parameter (KPP) in larger RPA requirement documents, and Public Law 112-239 directing DoD collaboration with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the National Air and Space Administration (NASA) to safely integrate RPA in the NAS.  Funding in this project supports the development of a Sense and Avoid (SAA) capability set for Group 4-5 RPA and covers analysis, research, and developmental activities as well as infrastructure and other government costs.  Activities included support to the development of warfighter requirements and analysis of possible solution alternatives, the collaboration with the FAA, NASA, and the other Services to develop national policy and standards, and SAA related studies, analysis, modeling and simulation, program planning and project execution.  RPA platform specific integration and testing is not included.

MP-RTIP:
The MP-RTIP sensor was designed as a family of modular, scalable sensors to provide next generation capabilities to support sustainable network centric operations with integrated Command and Control, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C2ISR) capability. MP-RTIP provides the RQ-4 Block 40 aircraft with advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Moving Target Indicator (MTI) sensor capabilities.

This project (67RTIP) includes all MP-RTIP design, development, test, and integration efforts for the RQ-4 Block 40 platform. Integration activities include platform integration of the MP-RTIP sensor and sustainment logistics planning support. MP-RTIP studies and development insertion include the implementation of Maritime Modes (MM) and other radar modes,  electronic protection, product improvements and other advanced capabilities.  

Activities also include studies and analysis supporting current and future program planning and future modes development based on user requirements.

Per direction of USD(AT&amp;L), the RQ-4 program was restructured from the original project 675144 (Baseline) into multiple projects: (1) Block 30, (2) Block 40, (3) GroundSegment/Communications System, and (4) C-ABSAA. Prior year funds in the amount of $2031.377M were accounted for in project 675144.

The Cost to Complete and Total Cost for Major Defense Acquistion Program (MDAP) projects in this program element are documented in the R3. Total Cost on the R2 is not reflective of the total cost for MDAP projects since the R2 does not account for prior years funding for in project 675144.

The FY 2017 funding request was reduced by $33.19 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The RQ-4 program uses an evolutionary acquisition strategy to provide the warfighter with a near-term combat capability with increased time-phased capability improvements as technology and risk achieve satisfactory levels. Northrop Grumman Corporation is the prime contractor. A suite of contract vehicles is used for development efforts: primarily, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts cover development, system upgrade, production, retrofit, fielding, and sustainment efforts through FY 2020.  MS-177 Sensor Enhancement RDT&amp;E is being contracted directly with the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), UTAS.

The program successfully completed Milestone (MS) C in February 2015 and is transitioning core program activities to the Operations and Support phase of the Defense Acquisition System over the next several years. Future required capabilities beyond the core Acquisition Category (ACAT) IC RQ-4 program will be completed as separate ACAT II and ACAT III modification programs.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>The RQ-4 Block 40 Project was directed by an Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) signed 14 Jun 2011 by USD (AT&amp;L). At the time of the ADM signature, and subsequent designation of projects, budgets had already been finalized.  Prior budgets for all projects are captured under the RQ-4 Baseline project, as its related Project (675144) was the core project for the RQ-4 program prior to the directed restructure.

In FY 2017 and beyond, Program 0305220F, RQ-4, Project 675146, Block 40, modernization efforts will be transferred to Program 0305220F, RQ-4, Project 675149, Capability Enhancements.  The transfer of these efforts will allow greater visibility into Global Hawk modernization efforts.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The RQ-4 Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) provides a high altitude, deep look, long-endurance Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) capability that complements space and other airborne collectors during peacetime, crisis, and war-fighting scenarios. 

RDT&amp;E funding in this project supports design, development, integration, and testing of items needed to meet validated requirements for Block 40 aircraft, including further development, integration and test of the Multi-Platform Radar Technology Insertion Program (MP-RTIP) sensor capabilities. The Block 40 program provides critical Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI) data to the warfighter. This funding also supports continued aircraft/communications systems upgrade to include Identification Friend of Foe (IFF) Mode 5/ADS-B, program protection projects, mission planning upgrade development and testing, airspace and interoperability and communication enhancements and updates, enhanced weather capability, development and testing of ice protection system, additional radar modes, sensor enhancements, reliability and maintainability improvements, and support of demonstration and technology insertion. Funding continues RQ-4 unique development and integration of upgraded capabilities. 

This program will participate in the development, testing, and implementation of international standards to enhance joint, allied, and coalition interoperability.  Likewise, studies and activities will be initiated to further explore the utility of incorporating the emerging architectural standards such as the USAF Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) Command and Control Initiative (UCI), the DoD's Unmanned Control Segment standards (UCS), or Open Mission Systems (OMS) as well as technology insertion activities in support of Better Buying Power (BBP).

The RQ-4 program will maintain capability and interoperability for Block 40 including efforts with system of systems partners and continue to incorporate applicable synergies with other platforms, such as the U.S. Navy's Triton, other RPA weapon systems, and Processing, Exploitation &amp; Dissemination (PED) elements.

Activities also include studies and analysis, support to future system enhancements, communication and interoperability enhancements, current and future program planning, and project execution.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The RQ-4 program uses an evolutionary acquisition strategy to provide the warfighter with a near-term combat capability with increased time-phased capability improvements as technology and risk achieve satisfactory levels. Northrop Grumman Corporation is the prime contractor. A suite of contract vehicles is used for development efforts: a legacy EMD "C" contract is being phased out with the completion of current efforts; IDIQ contracts cover development, upgrade, production, retrofit, fielding, and sustainment efforts through FY 2020.

The program successfully completed Milestone (MS) C in February 2015 and is transitioning core program activities to the Operations and Support phase of the Defense Acquisition System over the next several years. Future required capabilities beyond the core Acquisition Category (ACAT) IC RQ-4 program will be completed as separate ACAT II and ACAT III modification programs.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>The RQ-4 Ground Segment/Communications System Sub-Program was directed by an Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) signed 14 Jun 2011 by USD (AT&amp;L). At the time of the ADM signature, and subsequent designation of sub-program projects, budgets had already been finalized.  The budgets for all projects are captured under the RQ-4 baseline project, as its related Project (675144) was the core project for the RQ-4 program prior to the directed restructure.   

In FY 2017 and beyond, Program 0305220F, RQ-4, Project 675147, Ground Segment/Comm System, modernization efforts will transfer to Program 0305220F, RQ-4, Project 675149, Capability Enhancements. The transfer of these efforts will allow greater visibility into Global Hawk modernization efforts.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The RQ-4 Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) provides a high altitude, deep look, long-endurance intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capability that complements space and other airborne collectors during peacetime, crisis, and war-fighting scenarios.  

RDT&amp;E funding in this project supports design, development, integration and testing of the weapon system's ground elements and communications capabilities to enhance functionality and maintain interoperability, as well as support for demonstration and technology insertion.  The ground segment currently includes the Mission Control Elements (MCE), the Launch and Recovery Elements (LRE), and the networking resources required to simultaneously disseminate intelligence information while remaining compliant with DoD cybersecurity network requirements to operate on the Global Information Grid.

The RDT&amp;E funding in this project also supports the Ground Segment Modernization Program (GSMP) and Communication System Modernization Program(CSMP) efforts, as well as next generation communications capabilities. GSMP resolves fleet grounding Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) and obsolescence issues associated with ground segment equipment and provides critical warfighter capabilities such as building-based multi-aircraft control. It will also enhance interoperability data dissemination as well as provide training capability.  CSMP resolves critical DMS and obsolescence issues in the RQ-4 communication infrastructure and provides enhancements across the RQ-4 communication network. Both GSMP and CSMP will employ the USAF Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) Command and Control Initiative (UCI), the DoD's Unmanned Control Segment standards (UCS), and Open Mission Systems (OMS) using a service-oriented, open architecture approach.  Prior to GSMP/CSMP fielding, funding from this project supports modifications to the legacy system to support operations.

This program will participate in the development, testing, and implementation of international standards to enhance joint, allied, and coalition interoperability.  Likewise, studies and activities will be initiated to explore the utility of next-generation communications technologies, as well as emerging architectural standards such as UCI and UCS as well as technology insertion activities in support of Better Buying Power (BBP).  

The RQ-4 program will maintain and upgrade interoperability for Blocks 20/30/40 with system of systems partners and continue to incorporate applicable synergies with other platforms such as the U.S. Navy's Triton, other RPA weapon systems, and Processing, Exploitation &amp; Dissemination (PED) elements.  The networking capability for intelligence dissemination is required to provide the data transport interface between the Weapons System, Operations Centers, and external Intelligence Community customers.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The RQ-4 program uses an evolutionary acquisition strategy to provide the warfighter with a near-term combat capability with increased time-phased capability improvements as technology and risk achieve satisfactory levels. Northrop Grumman Corporation is the prime contractor. A suite of contract vehicles is used for development efforts: a legacy EMD "C" contract is being phased out with the completion of current efforts; and IDIQ contracts cover development, upgrade, production, retrofit, fielding, and sustainment efforts through FY 2020.

The program successfully completed Milestone (MS) C in February 2015 and is transitioning core program activities to the Operations and Support phase of the Defense Acquisition System over the next several years. Future required capabilities beyond the core Acquisition Category IC (ACAT) RQ-4 program are planned to be added over time as separate ACAT II and ACAT III modification programs.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Common-Airborne Sense and Avoid (C-ABSAA) is an analysis and developmental effort in the pre-Material Development Decision phase of the acquisition lifecycle which supports emerging warfighter requirements to fully integrate Group 4-5 RPA into the National Airspace System (NAS), international airspace, other nations' sovereign airspace, and operational combat airspace to conduct the entire range of military operations across all mission environments.  C-ABSAA also supports the "Worldwide Operations" Key Performance Parameter (KPP) in larger Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) requirement documents, and Public Law 112-239 directing DoD collaboration with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the National Air and Space Administration (NASA) to safely integrate RPA in the NAS.  Funding in this project supports the development of a Sense and Avoid (SAA) capability set for Group 4-5 RPA and covers analysis, research, and developmental activities as well as infrastructure and other government costs.  Ongoing activities include support to the development of warfighter requirements and analysis of possible solution alternatives, the collaboration with the FAA, NASA, and the other Services to develop national policy and standards, and SAA related studies, analysis, modeling and simulation, program planning and project execution.  RPA platform specific integration and testing is not included.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The transfer of these efforts will allow greater visibility into Global Hawk modernization efforts.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The RQ-4 Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) provides a high altitude, deep look, long-endurance Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) capability that complements space and other airborne collectors during peacetime, crisis, and war-fighting scenarios. RDT&amp;E funding in this project supports design, development, integration, and testing of capabilities needed to meet validated requirements for RQ-4 aircraft, including continuing aircraft system upgrade for current and  alternate sensor payloads.

This funding supports aircraft systems upgrade to include continuing aircraft operations surety, cybersecurity, information assurance, and mission critical repair of Government Furnished Equipment (GFE). 

Activities include airspace and interoperability and communication enhancements and updates, periodic Operational Flight Program updates and releases, airframe and software upgrades, deficiency report resolution across RQ-4 fleet, sensor enhancements and alternate sensor upgrades, enhanced comms capabilities, program protection projects, support for demonstration and technology insertion, development and testing of ice protection system, program protection projects, and studies and analysis supporting future system enhancements.  Additionally, this project supports design, development, integration, and testing of items needed to meet validated requirements for Block 40 aircraft, including further development, integration and test of the Multi-Platform Radar Technology Insertion Program (MP-RTIP) sensor capabilities, continued aircraft/communications systems upgrade, additional radar maritime modes, reliability and maintainability improvements, Ground Segment Modernization Program (GSMP) and Communication System Modernization Program (CSMP) efforts, as well as next generation communications capabilities. GSMP resolves fleet grounding Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) and obsolescence issues associated with ground segment equipment and provides critical warfighter capabilities such as building-based multi-aircraft control. It will also enhance interoperability data dissemination as well as provide training capability. CSMP resolves critical DMS and obsolescence issues in the RQ-4 communication infrastructure and provides enhancements across the RQ-4 communication network. 

RDT&amp;E funding in this project also supports design, development, integration and testing of the weapon system's legacy ground elements and communications capabilities to enhance functionality and maintain interoperability prior to GSMP/CSMP fielding.  The ground segment currently includes the Mission Control Elements (MCE), the Launch and Recovery Elements (LRE), and the networking resources required to simultaneously disseminate intelligence information while remaining compliant with DoD cybersecurity network requirements to operate on the Global Information Grid.

The RQ-4 program will maintain and upgrade interoperability for Blocks 20/30/40 with system of systems partners and continue to incorporate applicable synergies with other platforms such as the U.S. Navy's Triton, other RPA weapon systems, and Processing, Exploitation &amp; Dissemination (PED) elements. The networking capability for intelligence dissemination is required to provide the data transport interface between the Weapons System, Operations Centers, and external Intelligence Community customers.

This program will participate in the development, testing, and implementation of international standards to enhance joint, allied, and coalition interoperability. Likewise, studies and activities will be initiated to further explore the utility of incorporating the emerging architectural standards such as the USAF Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) Command and Control Initiative (UCI), the DoD's Unmanned Control Segment standards (UCS), or Open Mission Systems (OMS) as well as technology insertion activities in support of Better Buying Power (BBP).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The RQ-4 program uses an evolutionary acquisition strategy to provide the warfighter with a near-term combat capability with increased time-phased capability improvements as technology and risk achieve satisfactory levels. Northrop Grumman Corporation is the prime contractor. A suite of contract vehicles is used for development efforts: primarily, IDIQ contracts cover development, upgrade, production, retrofit, fielding, and sustainment efforts through FY 2020.

The program successfully completed Milestone (MS) C in February 2015 and is transitioning core program activities to the Operations and Support phase of the Defense Acquisition System over the next several years. Future required capabilities beyond the core Acquisition Category (ACAT) IC RQ-4 program will be completed as separate ACAT II and ACAT III modification programs.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>Beginning in FY09, the Multi-Platform Radar Technology Insertion Program (MP-RTIP) funding was transferred to program 0305220F (RQ-4) Global Hawk (GH).  Therefore, the data in this package includes only FY09 and subsequent funding related to program 0305220F.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The MP-RTIP sensor was designed as a family of modular, scalable sensors to provide next generation capabilities to support sustainable network centric operations with integrated Command and Control, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C2ISR) capability. MP-RTIP provides the RQ-4 Block 40 aircraft with advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Moving Target Indicator (MTI) sensor capabilities.

This project (67RTIP) includes all MP-RTIP integration efforts for the RQ-4 Block 40 Platform. Integration activities include platform integration of the MP-RTIP sensor and sustainment logistics planning support. MP-RTIP studies and development insertion include the implementation of Maritime Modes (MM), Maritime Inverse SAR (MISAR), product improvements and other advanced capabilities.

Activities also include studies and analysis supporting current and future program planning and future modes development based on user requirements. This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY 2016, PE 0305221, Network-Centric Collaborative Targeting, Project 675197 efforts for SUTER were transferred to PE 0305221, Network-Centric Collaborative Targeting, Project 675275, SUTER in order to ensure dedicated RDT&amp;E funding to develop SUTER capabilities.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Network Centric Collaborative Targeting (NCCT) is the Air Force program of record responsible for developing core technologies and sub-nodal analysis tools to horizontally and/or vertically integrated network collaborative Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) sensor systems within and across intelligence disciplines.  Operational uses of core technologies can include, but are not limited to, Signals Intelligence to Signals Intelligence (SIGINT-SIGINT) correlation and Ground Moving Target Indicator to Signals Intelligence (GMTI-SIGINT) correlation.  Operational uses of sub-nodal analysis tools can include, but are not limited to, determining which nodes of the adversary's Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence (C4I) network to engage or protect to achieve desired effects, and modeling execution plans to determine the need to disrupt or monitor the required network aim-points in order to redirect activities based on changing battlefield conditions.  NCCT software applications employ Machine-to-Machine (M2M) interfaces and Internet Protocol (IP) connectivity to coordinate sensor cross-cues and collection activities.  NCCT correlation and fusion services ingest collection data to produce a single, composite track (geo-location and identification) for high-value targets.  NCCT research and development funding supports evolutionary development of the NCCT message set and network management systems (for example Operations Interfaces, Network Controllers, Fusion Engines, Data Guards, Interface to Command &amp; Control, and Interface to Overhead Intelligence Operations (OIO)), the migration of the NCCT technologies to emerging network centric technologies such as Service Oriented Architectures (SOA), global web-enabled services, and satisfying DoD standards and Information Assurance requirements.   

NCCT Core Technology develops the hardware and software to horizontally integrate dissimilar Joint and Coalition Battle Management, Command &amp; Control (BMC2), and ISR assets and systems into integrated target tracks shared across networked platforms.  NCCT Core Technology includes, but is not limited to, network management software, operator interfaces, standard network messages and formats, correlation software and data rules of interaction, NCCT multi-level security hardware and software items, and platform specific Platform Interface Modules (PIMs).  Current NCCT-enabled systems include, but are not limited to, the RC-135V/W/S/U RIVET JOINT, COBRA BALL, COMBAT SENT, EC-130H COMPASS CALL, Distributive Common Ground System (DCGS) SIGINT components, Falconer Aerospace Operations Centers (AOC), Forward Processing/Exploitation/Dissemination (FPED), Gorgon Stare (GS), OIO, and multiple airborne coalition partner platforms.  Prospective Coalition, Joint or Service systems are required to fund their respective integration, unique core technology improvements/upgrades to support system integration. The FY 2017 RDT&amp;E funding in response to Air Combat Command's validated requirement to allow not only NCCT to sustain the capability to operate in a tactical environment but in addition provide development in the Core Technology to provide enhanced capabilities for an Anti-Access Area Denial (A2AD) strategy in the future.  

SUTER develops concepts, Tactics/Techniques/Procedures (TTPs) and technologies for synchronizing the capabilities of ISR and non-kinetic capabilities in a coordinated fashion with traditional kinetic weapons to prosecute targets connected together or dependent upon some form of communications network.  Suter's planning, execution and assessment capability is implemented in a virtual architecture available to all AOCs, taking advantage of the military value added from the synergies of Joint composite ISR, non-kinetic, and/or kinetic strike packages operating against networked target sets.  This virtualized Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) utilizes software applications which employ M2M interfaces and IP communications to impact these target sets by "attacking" or influencing/shaping links, nodes or end points in the network to include: RF and terrestrial links, switches, routers, hubs, servers, IP addresses, cell phones, antennas, radars, microwave relays, SATCOM receivers, transceivers, etc. The three main pieces of the Suter CONOPS include: first, the use of Suter's sub-nodal analysis software to determine which nodes of the adversary's C4I network to engage or protect to achieve desired effects; second, the Suter's distributed operations architecture to tie together relevant planning cells (e.g. AOCs, JIOWC, etc.) so they can collaborate in developing and modeling the execution plan(s) needed to disrupt or monitor the required network aim-points; and third, via Suter's combined network Graphical User Interface (GUI), all involved "players" monitor the plan's execution, provide Near-Real Time (NRT) updates to the status of on-going activities, provide continuous assessment/updates of the execution of the plan, and, within authorities (Rules of Engagement/ROEs), re-direct activities based on changing battlefield conditions.  Suter is the technology that assists Combatant Commanders and Components to exercise synchronized dynamic Command and Control (C2) of ISR, kinetic and non-kinetic Joint operations against conventional and terrorist threat networks. Suter provides decision makers and operators supporting airborne, ship-borne, cyber and land-based C2ISR platforms and at supporting locations continuous Predictive Battle-space Awareness (PBA) of the information superiority fight. It also incorporates the M2M capabilities that rapidly synchronize the employment of kinetic weapons, non-kinetic weapons and ISR assets to target challenging threat systems responsively.  Suter depicts a dynamic, multi-security-level picture of current and predicted threat network status, capitalizing on data inputs from sources such as Modernized Intelligence Database (MIDB), Net-Centric Collaborative Targeting (NCCT), Joint Targeting Database (JTDB), Computer Network Operations Database (CNODB), NASIC Links and Nodes, and Integrated Broadcast Service (IBS).  Suter provides a GUI that can be tailored to support the integration of ISR, kinetic, and non-kinetic composite target packages supporting COCOM and Component specified information superiority effects and objectives.

FY 2017 funding is dedicated to upgrading the virtualized SOA for the operational Suter system delivered in FY 2015, consisting of improvements in core technology security/Information Assurance, and addition of additional systems and data types.


The NCCT program is categorized as Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The NCCT Core Technology capabilities are developed, maintained and sustained with baseline/incremental upgrades plus any Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) developments acquired through the 645th Aeronautical System Group (AESG, a.k.a. BIG SAFARI System Program Office or SPO) in accordance with the BIG SAFARI Program Management Directive (PMD) and the BIG SAFARI Class Justification and Authorization (J&amp;A) documents for acquisition of supplies and services.  The procured supplies and services are supported by the BIG SAFARI Life Cycle Management Plan (LCMP) across the full spectrum of system life cycle management -- developmental engineering to system retirement ("cradle to grave" support concept).  Due to the rapidly changing threat environment encountered during our prolonged commitment to Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO), the acquisition program manager has the authority to redirect funding as necessary to meet current stated and emerging/evolving Combatant Commander requirements.

645th AESG, Wright Patterson AFB OH, manages the Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contracts used to develop the NCCT Core Technology.  645th AESG will develop NCCT Core Technology software on common hardware for systems and platforms designated to field this ISR capability.  Individual program management offices may contract directly with their prime contractors or through the 645th AESG for integration of these ISR capabilities on their respective systems and platforms.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>In FY 2016, PE 0305221, Network-Centric Collaborative Targeting, Project 675197 efforts for SUTER were transferred to PE 0305221, Network-Centric Collaborative Targeting, Project 675275, SUTER in order to ensure dedicated RDT&amp;E funding to develop SUTER capabilities.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>SUTER is a project responsible for developing sub-nodal analysis tools to horizontally and/or vertically integrate network collaborative Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) sensor systems within and across intelligence disciplines.  Operational uses of sub-nodal analysis tools would include, but are not limited to, determing which nodes of the adversary's Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence (C4I) network are engaged or protected to achieve desired effects, and modeling execution plans to determine the need to disrupt or monitor the required network aim-points in order to redirect activities based on changing battlefield conditions.

SUTER develops concepts, Tactics/Techniques/Procedures (TTPs) and technologies for synchronizing the capabilities of ISR and non-kinetic capabilities in a coordinated fashion with traditional kinetic weapons to prosecute targets connected together or dependent upon some form of network.  SUTER's planning, execution and assessment capability is implemented in a virtual architecture available to all AOCs, taking advantage of the military value added from the synergies of Joint composite ISR, non-kinetic, and/or kinetic strike packages operating against networked target sets.  This virtualized Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) utilizes software applications which employ machine-to-machine interfaces and Internet Protocol (IP) communications to impact these target sets by "attacking" or influencing/shaping links, nodes or end points in the network to include: RF and terrestrial links, switches, routers, hubs, servers, IP addresses, cell phones, antennas, radars, microwave relays, SATCOM receivers, transceivers, etc.  The three main pieces of the SUTER CONOPS include: first, the use of SUTER's sub-nodal analysis software to determine which nodes of the adversary's C4I network to engage or protect to achieve desired effects; second, the use of SUTER's distributed operations architecture to tie together relevant planning cells (e.g. AOCs, JIOWC, etc.) so they can collaborate in developing and modeling the execution plan(s) needed to disrupt or monitor the required network aim-points; and third, via SUTER's combined network Graphical User Interface (GUI), all involved "players" monitor the plan's execution, provide Near-Real Time (NRT) updates to the status of on-going activities, provide continuous assessment/updates of the execution of the plan, and, within authorities (Rules of Engagement or ROEs), re-direct activities based on changing battlefield conditions.  SUTER is the technology that assists COCOMs and Components to exercise synchronized dynamic Command and Control (C2) of ISR, kinetic and non-kinetic Joint operations against conventional and terrorist threat networks.  SUTER provides decision makers and operators supporting airborne, ship-borne, cyber and land-based C2ISR platforms and at supporting locations continuous Predictive Battle-space Awareness (PBA) of the information superiority fight.  It also incorporates the M2M capabilities that rapidly synchronize the employment of kinetic weapons, non-kinetic weapons and ISR assets to target challenging threat systems responsively.  SUTER depicts a dynamic, multi-security-level picture of current and predicted threat network status, capitalizing on data inputs from sources such as Modernized Intelligence Database (MIDB), Net-Centric Collaborative Targeting (NCCT), Joint Targeting Database (JTDB), Computer Network Operations Database (CNODB), NASIC Links and Nodes, and Integrated Broadcast Service (IBS).  SUTER provides a GUI that can be tailored to support the integration of ISR, kinetic, and non-kinetic composite target packages supporting Combatant Commands and Component specified information superiority effects and objectives across the full spectrum of conflict from tactical operations to an Anti-Access Area Denial (A2AD) strategy.

FY 2017 funding is dedicated to upgrading the virtualized SOA for the SUTER program system delivered in FY 2015, improvements in core technology security/Information Assurance, and addition of additional systems and data types.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The SUTER capabilities are developed, maintained and sustained with baseline/incremental upgrades plus any Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) developments acquired through the 645th Aeronautical System Group (AESG, a.k.a. BIG SAFARI System Program Office or SPO) in accordance with the BIG SAFARI Program Management Directive (PMD) and the BIG SAFARI Class Justification and Authorization (J&amp;A) documents for acquisition of supplies and services.  The procured supplies and services are supported by the BIG SAFARI Life Cycle Management Plan (LCMP) across the full spectrum of system life cycle management -- developmental engineering to system retirement ("cradle to grave" support concept).  Due to the rapidly changing threat environment encountered during our prolonged commitment to Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO), the acquisition program manager has the authority to redirect funding as necessary to meet current stated and emerging/evolving Combatant Commander requirements.  645th AESG, Wright Patterson AFB OH, manages the Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contracts used to develop SUTER.  645th AESG will develop SUTER software on common hardware for systems and platforms designated to field this ISR capability.  Individual program management offices may contract directly with their prime contractors or through the 645th AESG for integration of these ISR capabilities on their respective systems and platforms.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Common Data Link Executive Agent (CDL EA) provides the DoD standard for interoperable, multi-service, multi-agency, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) datalinks for 10,000+ DoD manned/unmanned airborne and ground platforms.  As the DoD CDL EA, the Air Force is responsible for cross-service application of CDL RDT&amp;E Military Intelligence Program (MIP) funds facilitating compliance to Congressional and DoD mandates.  The EA develops, modifies, distributes, and maintains specifications for the CDL waveform family; ensuring design configuration control, commonality, and interoperability among ISR platforms.  Additionally, funds support managing resources allocated for development, maturation, and migration of CDL technologies. 

CDL EA enables compliance with OSD and Congressional mandates to effectively utilize spectrum, use approved cryptographic equipment, and provide direct support to current operations.  CDL is a vital link in DoD's existing and emerging communication architectures, providing flexibility to accommodate Command and Control (C2) data and myriad types of Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT), and Full-Motion Video (FMV) data.  The CDL specifications permit current and future ISR asset operations worldwide by providing sensor data directly via point-to-point broadcast to ground sites, airborne platforms and dismounted users.  Also, CDL provides the capability to relay data via air-to-air or compatible satellite links when the asset and ground site are not in line-of-sight. 

CDL EA's research and development activities support a broad swath of tactical, operational, and strategic ISR users and include achieving higher data rates, multi-access and multi-node network management, crypto upgrade, advancements needed to operate in contested environments, terminal and antenna design enhancements, operations in other spectral bands, and improving spectrum efficiency.  Further, CDL development improves large area surveillance missions while supporting continuous improvements and implementation of line-of-sight platform and CDL terminal Command and Control (C2), plus increased ISR (C2ISR) capabilities.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support current and future requirements documentation, program planning and execution. CDL prototype terminal designs provide for future technology insertion and reduce non-recurring engineering and life-cycle costs to the user. 

In addition, the Gigabit Encryption thrust enables CDL to develop a miniaturized gigabit rate Communication Security (COMSEC) device capable of managing CDL data.  The miniaturized COMSEC device will allow faster throughput while reducing Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) requirements.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>In FY 2017 Project: 676001, NATO AGS, will complete.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program funds the U.S. contribution to the Alliance Ground Surveillance (AGS) system, a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Direct Commercial Sale acquisition.  AGS is an airborne ground surveillance capability that provides continuous, wide area surveillance in all weather conditions.  It will provide NATO decision makers with near real time information and situational awareness concerning friendly, neutral and opposing ground and maritime forces to support mission planning and execution, including force protection and targeting.  All NATO nations will have access to AGS collection data, creating opportunities for burden sharing with similar U.S. assets.  

The AGS program includes: air and ground segment acquisitions, operations of the NATO AGS Management Agency (NAGSMA), development of operations and support concepts and definition and establishment of an initial support capability.  The air segment consists of five (5) air vehicles based on unique exportable configurations of the United States Air Force Global Hawk air frame, Navy Triton command and control architecture and the U.S. Multi-Platform Radar Technology Insertion Program (MP-RTIP) radar.  The U.S. will also integrate new Maritime Moving Target and Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar capability into the MP-RTIP radar for NATO AGS.  The ground segment consists of fixed site and transportable/mobile ground stations for air vehicle Command and Control (C2), data exploitation and distribution.  Operations and continuing In-Service Support will be funded through a future NATO Military Commanders' Capability Package funded within the NATO Security Investment Program (NSIP).

U.S. participation in NATO AGS was ratified by Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) signature/approval of the NATO AGS Program Memorandum of Understanding (PMOU) in June 2009 and includes 15 nations. In FY 2012, OSD transferred the NATO AGS program to the U.S. Air Force (USAF) for management and execution of the Research and Development effort.  

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element contains Distributed Common Ground/Surface System (DCGS) Family of Systems interoperability efforts for which the AF is lead service. The DCGS Family of Systems, including AF DCGS, was directed to migrate to a net-centric DoD Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) enterprise enabling the Services to operate and share intelligence products more effectively in a joint environment.  All Services must pursue a common path based on a set of common enterprise services consistent with the Department's net-centric vision while maintaining flexibility to support the full range of warfighter missions.  Specifically, DoD charged the Air Force to lead the development, upgrade, integration, and test of common DCGS Integration Backbone (DIB) enterprise services.  The DIB is a set of enterprise standards and services that enable interoperability and component reuse.  All the military services are mandated to incorporate DIB interoperability standards and commit to DIB architecture as the migration path to common DCGS enterprise services. 

The Distributed Common Ground Systems-Imagery (DCGS-I) Testbed is an integration and test environment, used by the Services and Agency DCGS program offices to conduct integration of DCGS components and test interoperability interfaces with new sensors, applications, and net-centric operations. This testbed also supports the integration and testing of DoD DCGS components prior to introduction into the operational environment.  Periodic upgrades ensure the Testbed stays current with DCGS standards and architecture.

Support to OUSD(I), AF DCGS, and NATO interoperability efforts is also provided through this program element. This includes development, testing, and implementation of international standards (to include NATO standardization agreements) to ensure joint, allied, and coalition interoperability. 

The Common Imagery Processor effort develops a common imagery sensor processing capability within the DCGS architecture.  The imagery processor accepts airborne imagery data, processes it into an exploitable format, and provides it to other elements within the weapon system and the DCGS Enterprise. Current efforts are transitioning the legacy imagery processor from a hardware/software capability to a virtual software capability, thereby improving enterprise processing capabilities.   Efforts continue to keep the capability on track to handle the current sensors. Activities also include testing, development, and demonstrations integrating updated and new/emerging sensors into DCGS.

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.

The FY 2017 funding request was reduced by $4.86 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Imagery Processing effort develops imagery sensor processing capability within the DCGS architecture.  The imagery processor accepts airborne imagery data, processes it into an exploitable format, and provides it to other elements within the weapon system and/or the DCGS Enterprise. Current efforts are transitioning the legacy imagery processor from a hardware/software capability to a virtual software capability, thereby improving enterprise processing capabilities.   Efforts continue to keep the capability on track to handle the current sensors. Activities also include testing, development, and demonstrations integrating updated and new/emerging sensors into DCGS.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a space-based navigation system that fills validated Joint Service requirements for worldwide, accurate, common grid three dimensional positioning/navigation for military aircraft, ships, and ground personnel. The consistent accuracy, unaffected by location or weather and available in real  time, significantly improves effectiveness of reconnaissance, weapons delivery, mine countermeasures and rapid deployment for all services. GPS must comply with Title 10 United States Code (USC) Sec. 2281 which requires that the Secretary of Defense ensures that continued sustainment and operations of GPS for military and civilian purposes and 51 USC Sec. 50112 which requires that GPS complies with certain standards and facilitates international cooperation.

The system is composed of three segments: User Equipment (funded under PE 0305164F), Space (funded under this PE and PE 0305165F) and a Control Network (funded under PE 0305165F and PE 0603423F).  The satellites broadcast high accuracy data using precisely synchronized signals which are received and processed by user equipment installed in military platforms. This equipment computes the platform position and velocity and provides steering vectors to target locations or navigation waypoints. The control segment provides daily updates to the navigation messages broadcast from the satellites to maintain system precision in three dimensions to 16 meters spherical error probable worldwide. Additionally, GPS supports the United States Nuclear Detonation (NUDET) Detection System (NDS) mission and provides strategic and tactical support to the following Department of Defense (DoD) missions: Joint Operations by providing capabilities for Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT); Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence (C3I); Special Operations; Military Operations in Urban Terrain (MOUT); Defense-Wide Mission Support; Air Mobility; and Space Launch Orbital Support.

GPS III is the next generation Space Vehicle (SV) to join the GPS constellation. GPS III SVs will deliver significant enhancements, including a new civil (L1C) Galileo- compatible signal, and enhanced anti-jam power. Two auxiliary payloads, Search and Rescue/GPS (SAR/GPS) and Laser Retro-reflector Array (LRA) will be added no earlier than SV11. The SAR/GPS payload provided by Canada will fill a validated National Search and Rescue Committee requirement to provide enduring, space-based distress alerting capability to detect, locate, and relay distress alerts to fulfill its responsibilities under international agreements for Search and Rescue. SAR integration costs are split 50%/50% between the Coast Guard and the Air Force (costs presented in this document represent the USAF 50% share). LRA, built by the Naval Research Lab (NRL), is a passive reflector that will improve accuracy and provide better ephemeris data. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) funds the integration costs of the LRA.

This program funds GPS III and supports research, development, test and evaluation (RDT&amp;E) of GPS III SV01-02 and risk-reducing simulators through a systems engineering approach that matures and delivers SVs for launch. This PE includes SV01-02 engineering studies and analyses, trade studies, system development, test and evaluation efforts, integrated logistics support products, on-orbit support, and mission operations support for civil and military applications that protect U.S. military and Allied use of GPS.

The program also includes Contingency Operations (COps) as risk mitigation to late Next Generation Operational Control System (OCX) delivery.   The current acquisition schedule of OCX Block 1 (capability to operate GPS III satellites) puts GPS constellation sustainment at risk since the current control segment cannot operate GPS III satellites.  GPS III COps is a modification to the current control segment to operate GPS III satellites' PNT and NUDET Detection System (NDS) until OCX Block 1 is delivered.  

On 3 July 2015, USD(AT&amp;L) approved the first phase of a two-phased GPS III SV acquisition strategy starting no earlier than SV11. Phase 1 is a Production Readiness Feasibility Assessment which will provide data and insight into contractors' GPS III Production Design with emphasis on a mature navigation payload to include a regional M-Code capability that is consistent with the GPS Enterprise Analysis of Alternatives (AOA). Phase 1 utilizes FY15-17 RDTE funding for up to three contractors' GPS production designs. Phase 2 has not been approved and options continue to be explored. Notionally, Phase 2 will be a full and open competition for up to 22 GPS III SVs with an expected decision no earlier than SV11. Phase 2 is funded via Space Procurement Air Force (3021) in PE 0305265F, BPAC: 23GPS3.

Space Modernization Initiative (SMI) focuses on space vehicle affordability and capability, addresses obsolescence, future requirements and resiliency needs, and expands the industrial base to enhance future competition. Phase 1 will address GPS Enterprise AoA recommendations to increase GPS signal strength from  space by maturing navigation payload technologies that include a new regional M-Code capability. The Air Force is using its research laboratories to mature an On-Orbit Reprogrammable Digital Waveform Generator which will provide signal flexibility (to change the signal form while the satellite is on-orbit). This effort will be funded with Air Force Research Lab’s Science &amp; Technology (S&amp;T) funding and PE 0305265F to increase the number of alternate navigation payload awards.

In FY17, this Program Element supports Enterprise Ground Services (EGS). EGS is performing tech maturation, experiments and prototyping for increased commonality and resiliency in space program ground systems.

This program is a Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full-rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Search and Rescue GPS (SAR/GPS) is an approved auxiliary payload on GPS III beginning no earlier than SV11. SAR/GPS fills validated National Search and Rescue Committee requirements to provide enduring, space-based distress alerting capability to detect, locate, and relay distress alerts to fulfill its responsibilities under international agreements for Search and Rescue.

In addition, the USAF has on-going requirements to rescue US Military personnel in harm's way per Air Force Doctrine Document 2-1.6. The implementation of a US Medium Earth Orbiting (MEO) Search and Rescue Space Segment is via a Canadian-provided 406 MHz SAR repeater on GPS III SVs. This system presents a cost effective, low-risk opportunity that accommodates existing and planned 406 MHz beacons across the globe. Per National Security Presidential Directive (NSPD)-39, USAF and USCG, the US operators of the civil Cosmicheskaya Sistyema Poiska Avariynich Sudov-Search and Rescue Satellite-Aided Tracking (COSPAS/SARSAT) system and the international search and rescue system, share costs (50/50) associated with integrating the Canadian-provided SAR repeater to GPS III beginning no earlier than SV11. Costs presented in this document represent the USAF 50% Share.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>GPS III is the next generation Space Vehicle (SV) supporting the GPS constellation and is funded in PE 35265F. GPS III SVs will deliver significant enhancements, including a new civil (L1C) Galileo-compatible signal, enhanced anti-jam power, and a growth path to full warfighter capabilities. GPS III SV03-10 is in the Production &amp; Deployment Phase.

RDT&amp;E, AF PE 0305265F funds GPS III and supports research, development, test and evaluation of GPS III SV01-02 and risk-reducing simulators through a systems engineering approach that matures and delivers SVs for launch. This PE includes SV01-02 engineering studies and analyses, trade studies, system development, test and evaluation efforts, integrated logistics support products, on-orbit support, and mission operations support for civil and military applications that protect U.S. military and allied use of GPS. The program also includes contingency operations as risk mitigation to late Next Generation Operational Control System (OCX) delivery which will allow for command and control of GPS III SVs.

Space Modernization Initiative (SMI) focuses on space vehicle affordability and capability, addresses future requirements and resiliency needs, and expands the industrial base to enhance future competition. Phase 1 will address GPS Enterprise Analysis of Alternative (AoA) recommendations to increase GPS signal strength from  space by maturing navigation payload technologies that include a new regional M-Code capability. The Air Force is using its research laboratories to mature an On-Orbit Reprogrammable Digital Waveform Generator (ORDWG) which will provide signal flexibility (to change the signal form while the satellite is on-orbit). This effort will be funded with Air Force Research Lab’s Science &amp; Technology (S&amp;T) funding and PE 0305265F to increase the number of alternate navigation payload awards.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>Enterprise Ground Services (EGS) will provide a robust enterprise ground architecture for Air Force space systems, which leverages mission commonality and automation to reduce sustainment costs and re-focus manpower on warfighting capabilities.  In addition, EGS will enable a near-real-time common operating picture of enterprise-wide tactical health, status, indications, and warnings for Air Force satellites.  The end-state will be a modern technical infrastructure which is cyber-secure and resilient against the Advanced Persistent Threat and employs streamlined architecting, acquisition, and operational processes.  Through early architecture studies and prototyping, the government will establish clear ownership of the technical baseline to meet Better Buying Power principles as the EGS effort evolves through development.  This effort provides focus and expertise for the development, test, certification and enforcement of standards and interfaces for all AFSPC satellite ground systems to enable transition planning for legacy ground systems, new capability demonstrations, and systems acquisition leading to an enterprise ground architecture for Air Force space systems.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The GPS III next generation space segment rapidly and affordably responds to warfighter capability requirements. The acquisition approach utilizes a disciplined systems engineering approach which focuses on mitigating cost and schedule risk through a lower risk incremental delivery of mature technologies. This approach focuses on mission success and on time delivery. The GPS III SVs will have GPS IIF capabilities plus up to a 3x-8x increase in anti-jam signal power, 3x improved accuracy, 3+ year increased design life, a new civil (L1C) signal compatible with the European Galileo system and a satellite bus capable of supporting future SV capability additions.

On 3 Jul 2015 USD(AT&amp;L) approved the first phase of a two-phased GPS III SV acquisition strategy starting no earlier than SV11. The strategy utilizes FY15-17 RDTE funding for the Phase 1 effort to mature up to three contractors' GPS III production designs. The Phase 1 Production Readiness Feasibility Assessment will provide data and insight into contractors GPS III Production Design with emphasis on a mature navigation payload that includes a regional M-Code capability that is consistent with the GPS Enterprise analysis of alternatives. Phase 1 requires contractors to provide a GPS III space vehicle and navigation payload production designs, manufacturing plans,and a navigation payload engineering brass board (hardware). The Air Force is using its research laboratories to mature an On-Orbit Reprogrammable Digital Waveform Generator which will provide signal flexibility (to change the signal form while the satellite is on-orbit). This effort will be funded with Air Force Research Lab’s Science &amp; Technology (S&amp;T) funding and PE 0305265F to increase the number of alternate navigation payload awards.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Please refer to the Performance Base Budget Overview Book for information on how Air Force resources are applied and how those resources are contributing to Air Force performance goals and most importantly, how they contribute to our mission.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC) Mission System (JMS) Program is a Space Command and Control (C2) capability for the Commander,  Joint Functional Component Commander for Space (JFCC SPACE).  The JMS program is predominately a software effort that will produce an integrated, net-centric Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and the necessary software applications to accomplish required missions.  The program will provide a collaborative environment that will enhance and modernize space situational awareness (SSA) capabilities; create decision-relevant views of the space environment; rapidly detect, track and characterize objects of interest; identify / exploit traditional and non-traditional sources; perform space threat analysis; and enable efficient distribution of data across the Space Surveillance Network (SSN).  Furthermore, it provides a viable migration path from the legacy Space Defense Operations Center (SPADOC) system, which has 75% of its components beyond end of life or end of service, and the majority of its software no longer vendor-supported.   JMS Increment 3 will expand upon the Increment 2 architecture and deliver Battle Management Command and Control (BMC2) capabilities for capacity and timeliness to manage major theater engagements of many on many threats; synchronize forces and enable automated courses of action (COA) and C2; expand information architecture to include intelligence community, non-traditional, commercial, and international sources.  JMS is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Rapid Cyber Acquisition (RCA) provides combatant commanders with the ability to rapidly respond to emerging cyber needs. RCA provides rapid fielding of capabilities in three areas: defend the Air Force portion of the DoD Global Information Grid (GIG) in response to new and emerging threats; network attack and cyber exploit capabilities through all phases of warfare; and new cyber operations capabilities that address gaps to support evolving missions.

Rapid Cyber Acquisition delivers cyber capabilities to 24th Air Force (24 AF) warfighters in mission-relevant timeframes. RCA provides capabilities in support of US national security interests, to counter current and future cyber threats, and to enhance the nation's ability to operate in cyberspace. It expedites cyber development and modifications of USAF and DoD cyber capabilities. RCA provides solution sets for cyberspace operations: attack, defense, command and control/situational awareness, exploitation, critical infrastructure support, and combat support. RCA provides integration, and technical support to other Service and Government Agency activities to leverage select Air Force-developed technologies and/or operational capabilities. RCA will develop materiel or non-materiel cyber solutions, conduct rapid prototyping, integration and transition activities for cyber systems. Activities include, but are not limited to: development of software/hardware cyber systems; integration and transition of DoD lab-developed cyber capabilities to the warfighter; testing and evaluation; program management administration, studies, analysis, pilots, demonstrations, and risk reduction for emerging technologies. Congress will be notified when projects have been approved for development by the end of the fiscal year via Congressional Notification Letters.

The FY2017 funding request was reduced by $0.849 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances. 

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Rapid Cyber Acquisition utilizes a flexible acquisition strategy that facilitates delivering material and non-material solutions to solve cyber needs.  This approach allows flexibility for solutions to enter into the acquisitions process at any phase of the acquisitions life cycle management system.  These plans are intended to meet the written acquisition planning requirements and guidance. All plans will contain sufficient information for the Milestone Decision Authority to determine readiness to enter into the applicable phase of the acquisition process. Rapid Cyber Acquisition considers existing contracting vehicles, including but not limited to: Network Centric Solutions (NETCENTS), NETCENTS 2, Information Technology Enterprise Solutions-2 (ITES-2), Government-Wide Acquisition Contract vehicles (Alliant, Encore II, Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement IV (SEWP IV)), General Services Administration Federal Supply Schedules, HNCY Cyber Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract, National Security Agency vehicles and Cyber Warfare Systems Branch Class Justification and Approval document. Multiple award contractual vehicles, such as National Aeronautics and Space Administration's SEWP IV, provide a wide range of commercially-available products and services that should be able to meet many requirements related to Rapid Cyber Acquisition. These multiple-award vehicles have already met the statutory requirements of the Competition in Contracting Act and only require that Rapid Cyber Acquisition provide a fair opportunity to all contract holders, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 16.505, unless an exception to fair opportunity applies.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The United States Nuclear Detonation (NUDET) Detection System (USNDS) provides a near real-time worldwide, highly survivable/endurable capability to detect, locate, and report any nuclear detonations in the earth's atmosphere or in near space. USNDS supports NUDET detection requirements across five mission areas: Integrated Tactical Warning and Attack Assessment (ITW/AA), Nuclear Force Management (NFM), Space Control (SC), Treaty Monitoring (TM), and a classified mission.

The USNDS program is jointly sponsored and funded by the Department of Defense (DoD), through the US Air Force (AF), and the Department of Energy (DOE), through the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) and its Nuclear Detonation Detection (NA-22) office, respectively. NNSA/NA-22 supplies, at no cost to DoD, USNDS space sensors as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) to the AF's USNDS Program Office, which is responsible for all acquisition and systems engineering, integration and test (SEIT) activities on space vehicles (SVs), to include Global Positioning System (GPS) and additional hosts, and their supporting ground control segments. The AF directly funds the development of the USNDS ground segment (described below).  

DoD funds their contribution to the NDS program in Program Element (PE) 0305913F with RDT&amp;E, OPAF, SPAF and O&amp;M dollars.

USNDS consists of space sensors and complex ground segments. The space segment sensors, funded by DOE, consists of three nuclear detection sensor payloads: the Radiation Detection Capability (RADEC) payload for Defense Support Program (DSP) satellites, the Global Burst Detection (GBD) payload for Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) platforms (GPS satellites), and the Space Atmospheric Burst Reporting System (SABRS) payload for Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO) platforms (classified GEO host). Together, these sensors and associated communications capability provided by the host satellites comprise the global NUDET space segment detection capability for the USNDS. Space sensors communicate NUDET indications to the fixed ground segment (the RADEC Data Processor (RDP) and the Integrated Correlation and Display System (ICADS)), the deployable mobile ground segment (survivable Ground NDS Terminals (GNTs)), and the survivable/endurable Universal Ground NDS Terminals (UGNTs), when fielded. These ground systems perform data analysis and provide a decision support tool to the Air Force controllers concerning probability of NUDET occurrence. The ground segment provides ground receiving analysis and reporting capabilities to national authorities, commands, and forward users as well as Department of State (DOS) for the Treaty Monitoring and Verification mission. The ground control segment is being modernized and continuously improved through an incremental, evolutionary acquisition approach.

The upgrade to the GNT is the survivable/endurable Universal Ground Nuclear Detonation (NUDET) Detection System (NDS) Terminal which is funded with AF RDT&amp;E in this PE. The UGNT provides NUDET Detection Reports to end users through survivable and endurable USNDS communications via Milstar/Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) circuits.  The GNT supports ITW/AA and NFM missions. The UGNT program modifies the baseline of the GNT program and deploys as an integral part of the Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) Survivable / Endurable Evolution (S2E2) Mobile Ground System (SMGS) units also in support of ITW/AA and NFM. The UGNT, when integrated with the SMGS, will perform NUDET event processing with fused NDS data from GPS and DSP. SMGS capability refers to the result of the S2E2 upgrade program for the MGS mission processing capability, including the integration of UGNT. The intended end state of UGNT integration is delivery of enhanced missile warning and NUDET detection capabilities that meet survivable/endurable ITW/AA requirements directed by the President, SECDEF, Joint Staff, and USSTRATCOM, delivering long-term, cost effective, multi-role, multi-mission space effects to the war fighter across the range of military operations.

This budget line includes systems engineering, research and development, on-orbit and field testing and end-to-end verification of USNDS space sensors, ground analysis and reporting systems in support of the five USNDS mission areas. Sensor integration for GPS IIF and GPS III are funded in their respective PEs.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Space Situational Awareness (SSA) is knowledge of all aspects of space related to operations. As the foundation for space control, SSA encompasses surveillance of all space objects and activities; detailed reconnaissance of specific space assets; monitoring space environmental conditions; monitoring cooperative space assets; gathering intelligence on adversary space operations; and conducting integrated command, control, communications, processing, analysis, dissemination, and archiving activities. This program element fields, upgrades, operationalizes, operates and maintains Air Force sensors and information integration capabilities within the SSA network while companion program element 0604425F, Space Situational Awareness Systems, develops new network sensors and improved information integration capabilities across the network. Activities funded in this program element (0305940F) focus on surveillance of objects in earth orbit to aid tasks including satellite tracking; space object identification; tracking and cataloging; satellite attack warning; notification of satellite flyovers to U.S. forces; space treaty monitoring; and technical intelligence gathering.  

The Sensor Life Extension Programs (SLEPs) project funds efforts to upgrade, operationalize and extend the life of operational Space Situational Awareness (SSA) sensors, as needed. These SLEPs include, but are not limited to, programs which extend the serviceable life of assets and maintain critical capability by replacing aging and increasingly unsustainable components with modern and sustainable equipment. SLEPs may incorporate equipment which inherently includes technological advances resulting in enhanced or increased capabilities. In addition, the SLEP itself may be designed to increase capabilities not currently realized.  The on-going Ground-based Electro Optics Deep Space Surveillance (GEODSS) Phase II is representative of sensor system upgrades in the SLEP project.  As the need arises in the execution year, funds in this project may be used to begin sensor life extension programs on additional efforts.  

The SSA Ops Demo creates a survivable architecture which provides overlapping, assured, and viable surveillance options for executing simultaneous safety of flight and event response.  The demonstration develops software modifications to exploit data from legacy systems. 

Beginning in FY17 this program element will begin fielding and sustaining the Joint Interagency Combined Space Operations Center (JICSpOC) infrastructure in response to US Strategic Command Joint Emergent Operational Need (ST-0006).  The JICSpOC seeks to improve unity of effort and information sharing across the national security space community to effectively respond to potential future space threat events and will have the capability to develop, test, and integrate new space system tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) in support of both DoD and Intelligence Community operations. 

Also in FY17 this program element will begin a series of Ground Radar Upgrades designed to improve the sensitivity, search capability and CONOPS of existing SSA sensors to better support fire control timelines.

These efforts are in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because they develop modifications for operational SSA sensors.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Joint Interagency Combined Space Operations Center (JICSpOC) seeks to improve unity of effort and information sharing across the national security space community to effectively respond to potential future space threat events. The JICSpOC requires effective battle management, command and control (BMC2) to integrate and synchronize space and cyber forces and the intelligence community with efforts across all domains and to execute unity of effort through the core command and control functions of:  situation monitoring, planning, decision making, space force management and space force direction.  The JICSpOC will have the capability to develop, test, and integrate new space system tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) in support of both DoD and Intelligence Community (IC) operations. Lessons learned from JICSpOC experimentation will inform requirements development for future BMC2 architectures.  This effort is a new start in FY17 in response to US Strategic Command Joint Emergent Operational Need (ST-0006).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>This program, BA 07 PE 0305940F, project 67A017, Ground Radar Upgrades, is a new start.

Project Eglin SLEP completed in FY15.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Sensor Life Extension Programs (SLEPs) project funds efforts to upgrade, operationalize and extend the life of operational Space Situational Awareness (SSA) sensors, as needed. These SLEPs include, but are not limited to, programs which extend the serviceable life of assets and maintain critical capability by replacing aging and increasingly unsustainable components with modern and sustainable equipment. SLEPs may incorporate equipment which inherently includes technological advances resulting in enhanced or increased capabilities. In addition, the SLEP itself may be designed to increase capabilities not currently realized.  The on-going Ground-based Electro Optical Deep Space Surveillance (GEODSS) Phase II is representative of sensor system upgrades in the SLEP project.  As the need arises in the execution year, funds in this project may be used to begin sensor life extension programs on additional efforts.  

The SSA Ops Demo creates a survivable architecture which provides overlapping, assured, and viable surveillance options for executing simultaneous safety of flight and event response.  The demonstration develops software modifications to exploit data from legacy systems and demonstrate real-time SSA search functionality, multiple level security processing of SSA data and automated cross-sensor tipping and cueing around the globe.

Ground Based Radar Upgrades improve the sensitivity, search capabilities and CONOPS of existing SSA sensors to better support custody and fire control timelines.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>US Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) plans, coordinates, integrates, synchronizes, and conducts activities to: direct the operations and defense of specified Department of Defense information networks; and prepare to, and when directed, conduct full-spectrum military cyberspace operations in order to enable actions in all domains, ensure US/Allied freedom of action in cyberspace and deny the same to our adversaries. Emphasis is on providing component and subsystem maturity prior to integration in major and complex systems and may involve risk reduction initiatives.

USCYBERCOM, in conjunction with the Services and National Agencies, will develop and expand infrastructure architectures to support Cyber Mission Forces.  

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity funds various development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>This program, BA 07 PE 0308699F, project 674838, North Warning System (NWS), is a new start.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Shared Early Warning System (SEWS) is the result of Presidential foreign policy initiatives which began in 1996. The SEWS continues to provide Theater Combatant Commanders and foreign nation customers direct operational benefit by improving the architectural design and equipment thereby providing enhanced mission capabilities (i.e., expanded coverage, emerging capability integration, etc). Foreign customer arrangements are negotiated with individual countries on a bilateral basis to provide selected region-specific missile warning information. SEWS Integration and Test facility is kept current by enhancing systems to improve analysis of real world events. To enhance mission capability the SEWS program tests message format updates, cross domain solution updates, mandatory crypto upgrades, SEWS integration with other warning systems, and the transition to "coalition-based" warning.

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.  

The North Warning System (NWS) is composed of 1970s era radar systems.  The existing radar technology is quickly approaching obsolescence with regards to future threats. 

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The acquisition strategy is to build on existing capabilities using evolutionary acquisition to modernize and sustain SEWS.  The program office serves as the SEW system integrator, relying on a Prime Contractor for Logistics, Operations, and Sustainment support.  The projects described will be accomplished on the existing SEWS Single-Award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (SA IDIQ) contract.  This contract was re-competed through full and open competition in 2012.  The current contract has a PoP through 30 Sep 2017.  Additionally, some SEWS requirements are satisfied through Military Interdepartmental Purchase Requests to external programs of record.

The analysis of alternatives for potential replacement of the NWS will be accomplished using a to be determined mix of organic, federally funded research and development center, and advisory and assistance support contractor, efforts.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>This program, BA 07 PE 0401115F, project 675250, C-130H Avionics Modernization Program (AMP) Increment 2, is a new start.

Project 675248 was renamed from "C-130H Viability and Airspace Access Program (VAAP) Increment 1" to "C-130H Avionics Modernization Program (AMP) Increment 1" starting in FY17.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The FY 2017 funding was reduced by $50.484M to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.

The C-130H is a medium sized tactical transport aircraft providing multi-purpose theater support throughout the globe.  The C-130H fleet supports several diverse Air Force roles, including but not limited to tactical and inter-theater airlift and airdrop support, Arctic resupply, special operations support, aeromedical evacuation, aerial spraying, firefighting duties, and natural disaster and humanitarian relief missions.

C-130H AMP Increment 1 addresses modifications to meet airspace compliance mandates and safety requirements. RDT&amp;E efforts will cover design, integration, developmental test, Type 1 training and C-130H aircrew and maintenance training systems and courseware development efforts.

C-130H AMP Increment 2 includes digital avionics upgrades (e.g. Flight Management System, improved navigation), cockpit modernization (e.g.
glass/engine flight displays) and resolves select obsolescence and Diminishing Manufacturing Source (DMS) issues. RDT&amp;E efforts will cover design, integration, developmental test, Type 1 training and C-130H aircrew and maintenance training systems and courseware development efforts.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full-rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The C-130H AMP Increment 1 program performs modifications to meet airspace compliance and safety mandates; the mod includes automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) Out, enhanced Mode S, 8.33 kHz radios, and cockpit voice recorder/digital flight data recorder (CVR/DFDR).

RDT&amp;E efforts will cover design, integration, developmental test, Type 1 training and C-130H aircrew and maintenance training systems and courseware development efforts (including MODE 5 effort for the trainers).

The C-130H AMP Increment 1 program modifies 172 aircraft (166x C-130Hs and 6x LC-130Hs) consisting of H3s, H2.5s, H2s and H1s; and includes 127 Air National Guard aircraft, and 45 Air Force Reserve aircraft. The modification effort will have up to 4 prototype aircraft representative of variations in the mission designs and required for accomplishment of the C-130H AMP Increment 1 Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase. The remaining aircraft will be modified in the production phase.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>C-130H AMP Increment 1 Procurement funding begins in FY18; however, the program also received a congressional add of $70M APAF in FY16.

Additionally, the original C-130 AMP (mod # 8517) received a congressional add of FY15 $35.8M APAF in FY15; based on the FY15 NDAA language, the AF is able to execute a portion of this funding for the C-130H AMP Increment 1 program.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>C-130H AMP Increment 1 acquisition strategy (30 Sept 2015) is to conduct a full and open competitive source selection for ADS-B Out and Enhanced Mode S followed by a Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15 contract award.  Current efforts are primarily defining the program requirements and pre-contract efforts in preparation for the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) source selection.  The current schedule reflects EMD contract to be awarded in 2nd quarter FY17. 

Based on congressional approval, the AF started C-130H AMP Increment 1 in FY15, with the following FY15 activities: Market research, acquisition strategy planning, and documentation development.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>This program, BA 07 PE 0401115F, project 675250, C-130H Avionics Modernization Program (AMP) Increment 2, is a new start.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The C-130H AMP Increment 2 upgrades the C-130H fleet with comprehensive avionics and cockpit modernization which replaces aging unreliable equipment and adds combat capability enhancements.  It also addresses select obsolescence and diminishing manufacturing sources (DMS) issues.

RDT&amp;E efforts include design, integration, developmental test, Type 1 training, and C-130H aircrew and maintenance training systems and courseware development efforts.

The C-130H AMP Increment 2 program modifies 172 aircraft (166x C-130Hs and 6x LC-130Hs) consisting of H3s, H2.5s, H2s and H1s; and includes 127 Air National Guard aircraft, and 45 Air Force Reserve aircraft. The modification effort will have 4 prototype aircraft required for accomplishment of the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase, with the remaining 168 being production aircraft. The prototype aircraft represent each type of C-130H configuration listed above.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

675358:  The C-5 core mission computer (CMC)/Weather Radar modification project is a comprehensive sustainment modification to mitigate the obsolescence of the current CMC and weather radar.  This effort centers on modifying the current mission computer by replacing core processing module (CPM) cards to obtain sufficient capacity to support integration of new system capabilities with margin for growth by upgrading module cards and correcting any mission essential deficiencies identified during development. Also, the effort includes replacement of the weather radar with a commercial off-the-shelf color weather radar. The modified mission computer will allow for current and future throughput growth of additional processing requirements to meet calendar year 2020 communication, navigation, surveillance/air traffic management mandates.    

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

675359:  The C-5 communication, navigation, surveillance/air traffic management (CNS/ATM) modification project is a comprehensive effort to ensure appropriate system design architectures are developed and equipment is installed on the C-5 to allow aircraft operation in accordance with civil airspace access mandates for both the US National Airspace System (NAS) and international civil airspace. Additionally, the program will add equipment to meet outstanding National Security Agency mandates for encryption of voice communications. The C-5 CNS/ATM program ensures systems standardization and interoperability with other DoD systems to the maximum extent possible and directly supports airworthiness certification of the C-5. CNS/ATM requirements include, but are not limited to, capabilities such as automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast out (ADS-B Out), identification friend or foe (IFF) Mode 5, satellite communication equipment replacement, and beyond line-of-sight voice radio replacement.  It is anticipated equipment will be predominately commercial off-the-shelf or non-developmental items.

ADS-B Out is a next generation surveillance technology that transitions key aspects of Air Traffic Control from terrestrial based technologies to satellite enabled technologies to provide controllers a more accurate picture of aircraft positioning.

Funding may be used to address the DMS issues.

                <r2:SummaryExplanation>The FY2015 funding was reduced by $7 million for higher AF priorities.

The FY2016 funding was reduced by $20 million due to a Congressionally directed reduction for forward financing.

The FY 2017 funding request was reduced by $10 million to account for availability of prior execution balances." The remaining $0.659M was reduced due to deflation.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The C-5 core mission computer (CMC)/weather radar (WxRdr) program is a comprehensive sustainment modification to mitigate the obsolescence of the current CMC and WxRdr. This effort centers around modifying the current mission computer to obtain sufficient capacity/capability to support integration of new system capabilities with margin for growth by upgrading module cards and correcting any mission essential deficiencies identified during development. Also, the effort includes replacement of the weather radar with a commercial off-the-shelf weather radar. Mission systems equipment includes, but is not limited to, a redesign of the C-5 lavatory system. Examples of other mission systems equipment include troop seats, crew entry door and ladder, and interior trim.  

The current C-5 CMC has reached maximum capacity and cannot integrate required aircraft systems and capabilities to include the weather radar; flight management system (FMS); and communication, navigation, surveillance (CNS)/air traffic management (ATM) requirements. These requirements include capabilities such as the automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast out (ADS-B Out), and identification, friend or foe (IFF) mode 5.  The new CMC will allow for current and future throughput growth of additional processing requirements to meet calendar year 2020 CNS/ATM mandates.

The modification helps to maintain aircraft availability as the new  weather radar replaces the current APS-133 weather radar system, which is experiencing severe diminishing manufacturing source (DMS) issues.  Failure to upgrade the CMC to support calendar year 2020 CNS/ATM mandates and a new weather radar will create a significant operational impact. DMS issues will be resolved to support continued production and installation of requirements for the C-5 fleet. Further, DMS issues will be resolved to support continued operations through studies, bridge buys, life-of-type buys, development, and redesign efforts.

The C-5 mission systems equipment (MSE) program updates the lavatory system. The current lavatory system suffers inoperability and leakage of liquid sodium hypochlorite causing severe corrosion and burnt wires in the landing gear control panels.  A redesign of the MSE will increase safety, mitigate risk, and reduce man-hours required to repair extensive damage.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The strategy is for the prime contractor, Lockheed Martin Aero (LMA), to procure the core mission computer cards and weather radar, integrate and test those components, and install on two (2) EMD aircraft. LMA was placed on contract in March 2014.  The sole-source contract is predominately CPIF (Cost Plus Incentive Fee) with some FFP (Firm Fixed Price) elements.

Mission Systems Equipment program: The mission systems equipment redesign requires RDT&amp;E funding for commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) proofing. Funds are required for validation and verification of the lavatory design and installation. The Mission Systems Equipment contract method was competitive through the Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC). Wyle Science, Technical, and Engineering Group was the selected source, and the contract type is Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

Also, the program will add equipment to meet outstanding National Security Agency mandates for encryption of voice communications. The C-5 CNS/ATM program ensures system standardization and interoperability with other DoD systems to the maximum extent possible and directly supports airworthiness certification of the C-5. CNS/ATM requirements include, but are not limited to, capabilities such as automatic dependence surveillance-broadcast out (ADS-B Out), identification friend or foe (IFF) mode 5, satellite communication equipment replacement, and beyond line-of-sight voice radio replacement. It is anticipated equipment will be predominately commercial off-the-shelf or non-developmental items.

The current ARC-210 radio for VHF voice communications is facing diminishing manufacturing source (DMS) supply issues and additionally will no longer be capable of providing secure voice communications due to the development of new crypto algorithms. Addition of next generation ARC-210 radios and associated cryptologic equipment will enable the C-5 to meet NSA mandates for secure communications and allow aircrews to continue to communicate securely over VHF, UHF, HF, or MILSATCOM.

The current generation of satellites that support services used on the C-5 to provide oceanic controller/pilot data link communications (CPDLCs) to air traffic control and aircraft communications addressing and reporting system (ACARS) beyond-line-of-sight command and control messages will no longer be functional after 2016. The next generation of satellites will accommodate legacy C-5 SATCOM equipment for an interim period of time to allow for integration of upgraded SATCOM equipment compatible with this satellite constellation. Without this modification, the C-5 will be unable to fly oceanic tracks and will not be able to meet aircraft separation distance requirements for civil airspace access.

ADS-B Out is a next generation surveillance technology that transitions key aspects of air traffic control from terrestrial based technologies to satellite enabled technologies to provide controllers a more accurate picture of aircraft positioning. ADS-B Out will allow aircraft to provide continuous broadcast of aircraft position to both controllers and other aircraft equipped with ADS-B In capable avionics. International mandates for ADS-B Out for civil airspace access call for equipage by 2020.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The acquisition strategy for this program will consider every opportunity to use commercial components to modernize the C-5 CNS/ATM equipment to meet mandates for global civil airspace access. The strategy is for the prime contractor, Lockheed Martin Aero (LMA), to procure CNS/ATM equipment, develop software, test and integrate those components, and install on two (2) EMD aircraft.  The equipment integration will require RDT&amp;E funding for commercial off-the-shelf and non-developmental item proofing.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The C-17 can perform the entire spectrum of airlift missions and is specifically designed to operate effectively and efficiently in both strategic and theater environments.  Airlift provides essential flexibility when responding to contingencies on short notice anywhere in the world.  It is a major element of America's national security strategy and constitutes the most responsive means of meeting mobility requirements.   Specific tasks associated with the airlift mission include deployment, employment, sustaining support, retrograde, and combat redeployment.  Not only can the C-17 deliver outsize cargo to austere tactical environments, but it also reduces ground time during airland operations.  The C-17 will perform its airlift mission well into this century.

C-17 RDT&amp;E funding efforts support, but are not limited to:  Aircraft performance improvements and airspace access mandates (i.e., Communications/Navigation Improvements); flight test activities and facilities; development of solutions for obsolescence and safety of flight issues; systems engineering/program management administration support; support for avionics laboratories; block development/change management; proposal preparation for new projects; cost estimating and engineering/acquisition studies not related to requirements generation.

In FY15 the major thrusts under "Accomplishments/Planned Programs" are:  Performance Improvement and Obsolescence, Systems Engineering/Program Management, Boeing Flight Test and Edwards Flight Test. In FY16 the major thrusts transition to:  Common Configuration (CC), Extended Range Onboard Inert Gas Generating System (ER/OBIGGS)II, and Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS);  which are Air Force Acquisition Master List Programs. 

CC includes several projects:  Modernized Replacement Core Integrated Processor (M-RCIP), Communication and Navigation Capability (Comm Nav), Replacement Heads Up Display (RHUD), and Software Improvements.

ER OBIGGS II includes OBIGGS Filter Fire Fix which is a redesign of the OBIGGS II shutoff valve.

BLOS includes, but is not limited to:  Narrowband tactical satellite communications Mobile User Objective System (MUOS); both Aero H/Aero I multi-channel voice and data upgrades delivered via an intermediate-gain antenna; next-generation Military GPS receiver (M-Code); and upgrades for Ka/Ku band satellite communications.
  
This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The C-130J is a medium-sized transport aircraft capable of performing a variety of combat delivery (tactical airlift) operations across a broad range of mission environments. The C-130J aircraft, with its extended (by 15 feet) fuselage, provides additional cargo carrying capacity for the USAF combat delivery mission compared with legacy C-130E/H and the C-130J (short). Special mission variants of the C-130J conduct airborne psychological operations (EC-130J), weather reconnaissance (WC-130J), search and rescue (HC-130J), and special operations (MC-130J and AC-130J). All aircraft variants must be capable of worldwide operations.

This program provides RDT&amp;E funding for required capabilities that are grouped as "Block" upgrades or "Capability" updates.  Currently, Block 7.0/8.1 and Capability Management Updates (CMUs) add capabilities to address Communication, Navigation, Surveillance, and Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) requirements. All are collaborative efforts between Seven Nations. Content/requirements for block modifications is documented in International Program Directives (IPDs) as determined in the Cooperative Systems and Software Upgrade Requirements Management (COSSURM) process.

The HC/MC Recap Program will integrate the common-core capabilities developed under this program into the HC-130J, MC-130J and AC-130J.  

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

The FY 2017 funding request was reduced by $9.614 million to account for availability of prior execution balances.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The C-130J is a medium-sized transport aircraft capable of performing a variety of combat delivery (tactical airlift) operations across a broad range of mission environments. The C-130J aircraft, with its extended (by 15 feet) fuselage, provides additional cargo carrying capacity for the USAF combat delivery mission compared with legacy C-130E/H and the C-130J (short). Special mission variants of the C-130J conduct airborne psychological operations (EC-130J), weather reconnaissance (WC-130J), search and rescue (HC-130J), and special operations (MC-130J and AC-130J). All aircraft variants must be capable of worldwide operations.

This project provides RDT&amp;E funding for required capabilities that are grouped as "Block" upgrades or "Capability" updates. Content/requirements for block modifications is documented in International Program Directives (IPDs) as determined in the Cooperative Systems and Software Upgrade Requirements Management (COSSURM) process. This project will integrate the common-core capabilities developed under this program into the HC-130J, MC-130J and AC-130J.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>The Mods above are linked to C-130J R&amp;D.  There are other C-130J modification projects without associated R&amp;D.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The C-130J aircraft will be modified using a "block upgrade" strategy. The CNS/ATM, navigation safety requirement will initially, be met in three block upgrades. Block 6.0 development was funded from FY03-07. Block 7.0 started in FY07, and Block 8.1 which began in FY12. Subsequently, C-130J modifications will be grouped into smaller CNS/ATM software only updates known as Capability Management Updates (CMU).  Other AMC initiatives are upgrades to hardware and software that have arisen after the formation of the block upgrades and CMUs.

In order to better manage the fleet and to avoid having to simultaneously support three separate aircraft configurations (Block 6, Block 7 and Block 8.1) the USAF has decided to combine the Block 7 and Block 8.1 mods.  This will allow the aircraft and trainers to only have to be modified one time.

The proportion of CNS/ATM and navigation safety requirements allocated to Blocks 6.0 through 8.1 was determined via a design trade study conducted by Lockheed Martin (the C-130J prime contractor) and verified by the C-130J system program office and AMC. The development costs are being shared via a global Project Arrangement (PA) by the United States (USAF, USMC, USCG), the United Kingdom, Italy, Australia, Denmark, Canada, and Norway. An international program office (IPO), with USAF lead (Wright Patterson AFB, OH), manages the block upgrades development effort. Retrofit of a Block on the aircraft is the responsibility of each nation.

The USAF is considering fielding the IFF Mode 5 and ADS-B Out portions of Block 8.1 ahead of the remaining 36 capabilities in order to comply with the 2020 mandates.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project will enhance aircrew simulator fidelity utilizing aircraft flight tests to gather data to accurately emulate ground effect, nose wheel and engine-out data points. Currently the simulator is approved to accomplish only 50% of annual assault landings. This added capability will allow more training to be accomplished in the simulator so the aircraft will be available for more real world missions.  The ability to accomplish more training in the simulator also reduces the annual aircraft O&amp;M requirement.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasures (LAIRCM) system is an evolutionary acquisition program that provides significantly improved defensive systems capability for DoD aircraft to counter the infrared (IR) man-portable air-defense systems (MANPADS) missile threat.  The current LAIRCM system configuration [AN/AAQ-24V] consists of missile warning sensors (MWS), a laser transmitter assembly, control interface unit (CIU) and processors to detect, track, jam and counter incoming IR missiles.  The number of sensors and transmitter assemblies per aircraft is determined by the size and signature of the aircraft.  The system is fully automatic following system power-up.  LAIRCM requirements are documented in the multi-command Operational Requirements Document (ORD) LAIRCM ORD 314-92, validated on 03 Aug 98.  The system was first fielded on the C-17 aircraft.

The baseline program development is complete and consists of the small laser transmitter assembly (SLTA), ultra-violet MWS, processor, CIU and a repeater (on some aircraft) to meet the need for advanced IR countermeasures.  The Guardian Laser Transmitter Assembly (GLTA) is an upgrade to the baseline transmitter equipment to improve reliability, enhance performance, address obsolescence issues, reduce mass and improve overall functionality.  First production GLTA delivery occurred in June 08.

Development of the Next Generation Missile Warning System (NexGen MWS) is complete and includes new hardware that improves capability.  Baseline equipment (ultra-violet MWS) will be retrofitted with the NexGen MWS as it becomes available.  Developmental test/operational test (DT/OT) was conducted in FY10 with initial operational test and evaluation (IOT&amp;E) in FY11.  

LAIRCM upgrades include, but are not limited to hardware and software upgrades and testing of the LAIRCM system to maintain defensive capability against new and emerging threats.  

Current and future efforts include Threat Analysis; Modeling, Simulation and Emulation Test; Hardware, Software and Firmware Upgrades; Virtual System Integration Lab (SIL) Development; and Studies and Analysis.

Threat Analysis:  Threat analysis encompasses the activities to support threat exploitation analysis of a variety of threats (both known and emerging) against the current LAIRCM jam code with the intent of determining if jam code updates are required.  Typical threat analysis activities include:  Threat seeker characterization; model development for advanced threat IR seekers; development and testing of new infrared countermeasures concepts, techniques, and hardware; new technology assessment for potential incorporation into the LAIRCM system, and the evaluation/exploitation of new threats and threat characteristics relative to IRCM.  

Modeling, Simulation, and Emulation Testing:  Modeling, simulation, and emulation activities verify and validate the information obtained from the threat analysis activities.  These activities include:  Evaluation of infrared countermeasures (IRCM) techniques used in defeating real threat hardware; developing and evaluating jam code; validating and verifying integration of LAIRCM system components to newly developed jam codes, software or hardware; evaluating system effectiveness; performing platform integration support tests; and conducting predictive risk reduction tests prior to Live Missile Fire Test (LMFT) or on aircraft flight testing.  

Hardware, Software, and Firmware Upgrades:  Includes changes of any kind to any LAIRCM hardware components/support equipment with the purpose of adding capability, features, and enhancements which do not presently exist to ensure the LAIRCM system remains viable against current and emerging threats.  
    -----Hardware upgrade activities include engineering tasks required to design, develop, test and produce new capabilities, features, and enhancements, and changes of any kind to any portion of LAIRCM hardware with the purpose of adding capability, features and enhancements which do not presently exist.  
    -----Software upgrade activities include engineering tasks required to design, develop, and test the new or modified code that result in new capabilities, features, and enhancements and changes of any kind to any portion of LAIRCM software with the purpose of adding capability, features and enhancements which do not presently exist.  Software upgrades can occur in any of the Line Replaceable Unit (LRU) Operation Flight Programs as well as any of the software residing in other LAIRCM-associated components including those systems which support development and test or the LAIRCM support equipment.  
    -----Firmware upgrade activities include engineering tasks required to design, develop, and test the upgrades and those changes resulting from hardware and software updates/modifications as well as firmware upgrades which add new features.

Virtual SIL Development:  Incrementally design, develop, integrate, and test software code and purchase associated infrastructure (i.e., computers, servers, commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) software, etc.) necessary to develop and implement a virtual SIL providing a critical capability for testing the LAIRCM system to ensure continued effectiveness against current and emerging threats.       

Studies and Analysis:  Includes logistics, programmatic, and engineering studies and analysis activities to ensure continued system viability and sustainability and compliance with acquisition directives.  These activities may include the evaluation of low cost/high payback opportunities to reduce software development/implementation cost, enhance production efficiency, and improve life cycle costs through increased reliability and reduced repair and return cost.

Program management and administration efforts consist of, but are not limited to, contract services and government costs.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The KC-10A Extender is an aerial refueling asset built on the commercial DC-10 airframe.  The aircraft creates an air bridge enabling rapid global mobility and global strike missions.  There are 59 KC-10A aircraft in the USAF tanker fleet.    

The Mode 5 modification is a DoD-mandated (JROCOM 047-07, 5 Mar 07 directs KC-10 IOC by 2014, FOC by 2020) upgrade to the KC-10's Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) system (the primary means of aircraft identification, used for command and control, during Air Defense operations).  The Mode 5 upgrade increases anti-spoofing capabilities and lowers the possibility of aircraft/aircrew loss due to misidentification of friendly aircraft.  The modification includes a  APX-119 Mode 5 capable transponder, new KIV-77 Mode 5 crypto applique replacing the KIV-119, integration into the CNS/ATM avionics with control via the Central Display Unit, removal of the existing IFF control panel, and minor wiring changes. 

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>VC-25A Avionics Modernization Program (AMP) assures unrestricted global access to civilian and military airspace to support the President of the United States as Head of State, Chief Executive, and Commander in Chief.  AMP upgrades use a systems approach to aid pilot awareness and alleviate task saturation enhancing safety in a high technology concentrated airspace environment.  VC-25A AMP is a required modification to ensure the viability of the Presidential support airlift fleet until the Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization (PAR) program is fielded.  

AMP complies with mandates for civil Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) Out and Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) Mode 5 and provides an improved Advisory Vertical Navigation (VNAV) capability.  It will incorporate multiple subsystems, to include, but not limited to, maneuver camera system, large cockpit displays, and navigation radios to increase the utility and safety of the VC-25A.  Provisions for the military ADS-B Out will also be provided. Installations are aligned with the aircraft heavy maintenance schedule.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>VC-25A AMP is accomplished by developmental integration of commercial off-the-shelf systems, hardware procurement and installation is accomplished to align with heavy maintenance depot schedules.  An Undefinitized Contract Action (UCA) was issued in Jun 12.  The UCA was definitized with a Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF) type contract April 2014.  The CPIF contract covers the engineering RDT&amp;E effort through Critical Design Review in FY15.  The remaining RDT&amp;E effort including the first kit, install and flight test was awarded in FY15 and concludes in FY18 with delivery of the first aircraft.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The CV-22 is the Air Force Special Operations Forces (SOF) variant of the joint multi-mission V-22 tilt-rotor aircraft.  The aircraft provides long-range infiltration, exfiltration, and re-supply of SOF in politically sensitive and hostile/denied areas.  The Navy is the lead service for the joint V-22 program and has overall responsibility for managing all V-22 variants, including the Air Force CV-22 variant.  CV-22 RDT&amp;E funding provides for the development, integration, and testing of mission critical aircraft modifications to improve operational effectiveness, platform survivability, and aircraft availability.  

Block 20:  RDT&amp;E funding provides for improved long-range communications, situational awareness capabilities, and aircraft software upgrades needed to address operational requirements specified in the V-22 Block C/20 Capabilities Production Document (CPD).  

Enhanced Self-Deployment:  RDT&amp;E funding provides for the design, development, and testing of aircraft modifications to improve aircraft self-deployment capabilities (e.g., operating range, global response time), to evaluate emerging threats to the aircraft and mission accomplishment, and to identify and assess emerging air vehicle, propulsion system, avionics, electronic warfare, and weapon system capability requirements and potential solutions to satisfy these requirements.  

Improved Inlet Solution (IIS):  RDT&amp;E funding provides for design, development, and testing of modifications to the CV-22 propulsion system to reduce ingestion of sand/dust and other particulate matter in austere operating environments.  These upgrades will significantly improve Engine Time on Wing (ETOW) and overall aircraft readiness/availability, and reduce platform operating/life cycle costs.  

Communications, Navigation, Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM):  RDT&amp;E funding provides for upgrades and enhancements to the CV-22 navigation, flight management, and aircraft Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) systems that will bring the aircraft into compliance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and international mandates and other technical guidance for access to, and operations within worldwide airspace.

Other/Future Capabilities:  The V-22 Joint Program Office continually assesses user-specified requirements for improved operational safety, suitability, and mission effectiveness.  Funding also provides for future modification planning, and for aircraft engineering changes/upgrades to address diminishing manufacturing source (DMS) and component obsolescence issues that adversely affect aircraft readiness and operational availability rates. 
 
Unites States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) and the Air Force (AF) jointly fund many CV-22 development projects.  USSOCOM funds the development, integration, and testing of SOF-unique mission equipment and capabilities, while the AF funds service-common/basic air vehicle enhancements, CV-22 implementation, and testing of MV-22 configuration changes, the integration of Air Force and Navy maintenance and information systems used with the CV-22, and support for aircraft qualification and operational testing.  USSOCOM and AF jointly fund corrective measures for identified aircraft deficiencies, and for Block 20 development.  Block 20 Increments 1 and 3 were developed with AF funds, and Increment 2 was developed with USSOCOM funds. 

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational Systems Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

The FY2017 funding request was reduced by $0.667 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The V-22 Joint Program Office (Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIRSYSCOM), PMA-275) is developing new capabilities for the V-22 in block increments.  Block 0 and Block 10 have been developed &amp; fielded, and Block 20 development is scheduled to complete 31 Dec 2016.  
--Improved Inlet Solution:  NAVAIRSYSCOM awarded a cost plus fixed fee contract for IIS development and test in June 2014 with BA05 funds.  After FY14, BA07 funds continue this effort.  The FY2017 plan is to add incremental funding to the established contract.
--CNS/ATM:  Development will be contracted with Raytheon and Bell-Boeing.  The Raytheon effort will be contracted sole source on a delivery order to an existing Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract.  The Bell-Boeing effort will be contracted sole source on a delivery order to an existing basic ordering agreement (BOA). 
--Enhanced Self-Deployment Capabilities: The FY2017 plan is to order studies and analyses sole source from Bell-Boeing on an established BOA.

Development activities for the V-22 program are performed primarily by the prime contractor, Bell-Boeing, selected on a sole-source basis.  Bell-Boeing is a strategic partnership between Bell Helicopter and Boeing Integrated Defense Systems.  Efforts are underway to increase competition where feasible, depending primarily on the level of platform integration required.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                <r2:Remarks>Block 20 Development Target Value of Contract differs from total cost because most of the Block 20 development cost was funded in PE 0401318F, BA05.  In addition, the SOF peculiar development efforts were funded by USSOCOM MFP-11 funding.

IIS Development Target Value of Contract differs from total cost because this is a joint development funded by Navy and Air Force.  Navy funding for IIS is shown in RDT&amp;E,N PE 0604262N budget exhibit.

Prior Years funding ($322.656M) was executed in PE 0401318F, BA05.</r2:Remarks>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Special Tactics (ST) System Development project focuses on modernization development for the Battlefield Air Operations (BAO) Kit. The project is a program within the overarching Battlefield Airmen Modernization (BA-Mod) Program. BAO Kit will develop, test, train and modernize the existing and future System of Systems (SoS) that provide a state-of-the-art Command, Control, Communications, Computer, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR)capability. It also provides a suite of systems for all Air Force Specialty Codes supporting the ST community within the Air Force Special Operations Command's (AFSOC's) Battlefield Airmen. Efforts in the ST System Development project focus on reducing the risk of fratricide and substantially reducing size and weight of the equipment carried through three core capabilities: Human Machine Interface (HMI), Line of Sight (LOS) targeting, and Machine to Machine (M2M) C4ISR System and all other ST capability needs.

This program will develop and enhance technologies for Battlefield Airmen ST operators to recognize, identify, range, nominate, and designate targets during both day and night operations. BAO Kit will also significantly reduce the time required to find, track, fix targets, and engage the enemy by providing highly accurate target grid coordinates in three dimensions, generating target imagery both pre and post-strike, and transmitting target data to Command and Control centers. All BAO Kit systems are light, compact, and portable for use by dismounted Battlefield Airmen. FY17 BAO Kit funding will provide significant improvements in operational capability, situational awareness, and precision lethality in the battle space and while continuing to build and enhance the BAO Kit system of systems. This may be conducted through industry technology demonstrations, prototypes, and associated engineering support to posture the BAO Kit for technology insertion.  These efforts will deliver enhanced capability for the dismounted soldier in terms of dramatic weight reduction and increased mission effectiveness across the conflict spectrum. BAO also supports AFSOC TAC C2 programs to develop and enhance communication systems and equipment essential for ST combat controllers, pararescue, combat weather operators, and tactical air control parties within AFSOC to perform their mission. The ST operators use this equipment to gather and transmit assault zone suitability and weather data and to perform tactical airfield/assault landing/drop zone operations.

The Special Tactics (ST) System Development activities also include studies and analysis to support both current and future program planning and execution.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program develops, tests, and evaluates national and Air Force measurement standards (hardware) and calibration equipment in support of all Air Force programs and activities, including Precision Measurement Equipment Laboratories (PMELs) worldwide.  Metrology research and development provides technology to support systems in all phases of development and acquisition, as well as Air Force R&amp;D laboratories, test ranges, ground test facilities, and operational weapons systems support. Rapidly changing technology requires continuing research and development of measurement standards and calibration equipment to ensure modern weapon systems meet Air Force readiness objectives. This program addresses all metrology disciplines and includes the technology areas of laser, infrared, microwave, millimeter wave, optical, physical, mechanical, electrical, electronic, and ionizing radiation measurements. Metrology is a technical discipline devoted to the science of measurements and to the study and improvement of measurement technology.  Measurements are the foundation of military system development, quality assurance, hardware conformance testing and system readiness tests.  The integrity of these tests is assured through calibration and traceability assurance schemes.  The capability to measure and calibrate must parallel the emergence of new technology, new ranges, and new capabilities of military systems.  Lack of new measurement capability impedes or blocks the successful exploitation of new technologies, especially in the movement from development laboratory to production to deployment.  R&amp;D efforts are essential within the DoD to pace these requirements, otherwise, these same new systems will suffer time delays, excessive cost, and increased risk due to unreliable test results in all phases of development, production, deployment and operation.    

Program is managed by Air Force Materiel Command, Agile Combat Support Directorate, Air Force Metrology Division (WNM).

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Air Force (AF) requires an integrated logistics capability that provides timely, accurate and reliable information to decision makers at all levels of command and across the full range of military operations.  

Financial Improvement Audit Readiness (FIAR) and Software Upgrades:

The remediation and modification of core logistics systems is necessary for the AF to meet statutory FIAR and align with the Joint Chiefs of Staff J-4 Concept for Logistics and the AF Logistics Board's approved Enterprise Logistics Strategy (ELS).  The AF must sustain and modernize these systems through both FIAR Remediation, to address the most immediate gaps in meeting FIAR by the statutory deadline, and Software Upgrades, to reduce high operating costs, implement statutory compliance requirements and improve near term system performance. 

Systems contained in these business areas include, but are not limited to, the Combat Ammunitions System (CAS), Integrated Logistics System-Supply (ILS-S), Purchase Request Process System (PRPS), AF Equipment Management System (AFEMS), Enhanced Technical Information Management System (ETIMS), Enhanced Maintenance Operations Center (EMOC),  Integrated Maintenance Data System (IMDS), Reliability and Maintainability Information System (REMIS), Stock Control System (SCS), Aircraft Structural Integrity Management Information System (ASIMIS), and Weapon System Management Information System (WSMIS).

Transformation:

The AF must transform its logistics business processes and transition away from using numerous stovepipe systems and process flows that execute the same tasks.  Eliminating process redundancies across the logistics enterprise will enable the AF to execute more efficient, cost-effective and integrated logistics in the long term.  The objective of transformation is to conduct Business Process Re-engineering (BPR) to identify and eliminate overlaps in our current processes and where appropriate, implement the use of new IT systems.
  
The AF Service Development and Delivery Process (SDDP) is being applied as part of this BPR effort to apply discipline and focus to the task of process reengineering and requirements development in order to reduce risk and successfully transform logistics IT systems.  In the SDDP, the requirements definition, architecture and design for an IT capability is a government-owned process.  The SDDP ensures the AF end user and Sponsor consider all possible doctrine, organization, training, material, leadership, personnel and facility solutions to the end user's need/problem before a materiel solution is sought.  The SDDP is a six-step process, each step with its own specific product outcomes that serve as the basis for downstream activities in the SDDP and facilitating enterprise-level analysis to maximize reuse of existing capabilities.  Maximizing reuse will eliminate duplicate implementation actions across the AF and assure individual user problems or needs are not solved at the cost of overall enterprise benefits.  The outcome of using the SDDP is a well-described requirement which may include a materiel solution, in which case the SDDP details the acquisition and implementation activities to support delivery of the capability.  Alternatively, success may be demonstrated by the resolution of the user's problem without a materiel solution.  

The AF logistics enterprise is comprised of multiple overarching functional areas, to include maintenance, repair and overhaul, end-to-end supply chain support, base supply inventories, and predictive analysis and forecasting.  The AF will standardize its business processes within each major logistics functional area through Transformation Capability Initiatives (CI).  Transformation CIs include, but are not limited to: Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul Initiatives (MROi), Supply Chain Management (SCM), and Product Lifecycle Management (PLM).

-MROi will create an integrated capability that plans, schedules, and executes organic depot maintenance support functions critical to agile planning, optimized workload assignment, resource allocation and throughput, thereby increasing depot maintenance support to the warfighter. 
 
-SCM includes Supply, Item Master, and Government Furnished Materiel (GFM) initiatives.

--SCM Supply encompasses centralized planning and management of items and equipment such as: repairable, consumables, Nuclear Weapons-Related Materiel (NWRM) and cryptographic items and comprises business operations and inventory for the AF Base Supply community.
 
--SCM Item Master provides the capability to manage comprehensive, accurate, reliable item master data (e.g., accurate identification and authorization of owners and users of items).

--SCM GFM Accountability will provide AF accountability for contractor managed government material and reporting of logistics and financial data.  AF will be able to track end-to-end logistics and financial transactions, provide Total Asset Visibility (TAV) and report equipment and material inventory values.  

-PLM enables AF engineering/logistics communities to define, track, protect and manage product data for AF weapon systems and equipment.  The AF requires the ability to control configuration of the product throughout the life of the asset.  Standardized configuration control will ensure validity, accuracy, reliability, currency, and security of the product information which will increase weapon system readiness by decreasing costs to manage, protect, store and deliver product information.

                                <r2:Description>SW Modification Development:  The ILS-S Software Modification - Re-Platform effort is to migrate the Standard Base Supply System (SBSS) source code and data from the current UNISYS mainframe Common Business-Oriented Language (COBOL) based SBSS environment to a mid-tier Java environment. This SW development effort also has a second component to it that is critical and essential to the full capability of Re-Platform.  The Legacy Adapter portion of the Enterprise Solution Supply (ES-S) front end requires modification to communicate with the newly modified SBSS system.  These modifications are integral for the Re-Platform effort to be successful.</r2:Description>

AF will be able to track end-to-end logistics and financial transactions, provide TAV and report equipment and material inventory values. 

Note: This is not a new start. In the FY15 PB submission, all SCM efforts were under a single initiative, which included SCM Supply, SCM Item Master, and SCM GFM. In the FY16 PB, the AF divided SCM into three sub-initiatives to provide additional visibility into the specific mission process areas.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element contains two active projects [project 673318, Product Data System Modernization (PDSM), and project 675042, Logistics Application Logistics Integration (LALI)].

Project 673318: PDSM funds modifications to the Enhanced Technical Information System (ETIMS) Enterprise, which supports Air Force Technical Order management, storage and distribution critical to depot maintenance activities. ETIMS activities include studies and analysis to support both current and future program planning and program execution to include Nuclear Weapons Related Material (NWRM) technical data requirements.
Note: In FY 2016, PE 0708611 Support Systems Development, Project 673318, Product Data Systems Modernization efforts transferred to PE 0708610F, Logistics Information Technology (Log IT), Project 675207 to align with the Enhanced Technical Information Management System (ETIMS) modification efforts funded within the Log IT PE.

Project 675042: LALI includes funding for Logistics, Installations and Mission Support - Enterprise View (LIMS-EV) and F-35 User IT Data Exchange Service (UIDES).

Logistic, Installations and Mission Support - Enterprise View (LIMS-EV) implements Business Intelligence(BI) and Decision Support(DS) solutions and includes transitioning to a common Information Technology(IT) hosting environment and development of mobile infrastructure.  The AF must transform its logistics business processes and transition away from using numerous stovepipe systems and process flows that execute the same analysis and decision support tasks.  Eliminating process redundancies across the logistics enterprise will enable the AF to execute more efficient, cost-effective and integrated logistics in the long term. Leveraging emerging technology to enhance existing capabilities and developing a mobile solution satisfies current and future needs of the enterprise. LIMS-EV funding supports Business Intelligence (BI) and decision support development capability used by senior leaders and war fighters to access integrated information from multiple logistics and operational source systems. LIMS-EV funding will extend current BI capabilities to provide configurable alerting, predictive/what-if analysis, mobile applications and further integration of support equipment, vehicle, supply, commodities and components (engines, landing gears, fuel, etc.) to increase weapons systems availability and Total Asset Visibility (TAV) and migrates the LIMS-EV functionality from the retiring Global Combat Support System-Air Force (GCSS-AF) infrastructure to a an approved Joint Information Environment/Common Computing Environment.


FY2016 Plan 

1) LIMS-EV Vehicle View 5.2 - migrate the legacy data sources from the Online Vehicle Information Management System to Defense Property Accountability System (DPAS).   The applications, reports and capabilities will be modified/migrated to using data sourced from DPAS. Included in the data migration is the ability to expose the DPAS data in Business Objects (BOBJ).   This release also includes the development new functionality; the Transaction Request Tool which includes the ability for fleet managers to update, load, and move assets, as well as complete resale requests.  

2) LIMS-EV Equipment View 4.6 - Implement the remaining metrics not included in release 4.4 (less the Command Equipment Management Office (CEMO) metrics) – primarily associated with the new Redistribution and Mass Additive functionality.  This release also corrects discrepancy reports from Release 4.0 (Redistribution and Mass Additive functionality) Metrics include:  
-- Provides the ability to report CEMO, 404 Supply Chain Management Office (SCMS), and Fill Rate Metrics
-- Applies data from Mal-Positioned Assets, Repair Execution, Retention Additives &amp; Disposals and Replacement Additives actions as well as user-entered input to calculate / present the defined metrics

3) LIMS-EV Repair Network View (RNV) 4.0 - provides leadership view of Repair Network Integration (RNI) Metrics.  This release will provide a permanent Capability and Capacity (CAP2) Information Technology (IT) Tool and simulation capability to assist Repair Network managers in making resource allocation decisions.  Some examples include: 
-- Support equipment prices for each equipment asset  pulled from Air Force Equipment Management System (AFEMS) 
-- Quality Deficiency Report (QDR) data pulled from each node from Joint Deficiency Reporting System (JDRS)  
-- Depot level production 
-- Contract data reporting National Stock Numbers (NSNs) repaired at contractors from Contracting Information Database System (CIDS/J018) or CAV-AF

4) LIMS-EV Enterprise Mobile Viewer - focused on supporting the use of mobile device technology, with the first phase focusing on integrating four LIMS-EV Vehicle View widgets.   The release also enhances some of the existing capability, such as modifying the Prioritization Buy capability to support Item Manager functionality.

5) LIMS-EV Weapons System Enterprise Review (WSER) - automate the AF Chief of Staff briefing (CSAF) (9 charts per WSER weapon system) that is delivered quarterly by Air Force Life Cycle Management Center Commander (AFLCMC/CC) to Air Force Materiel Command Commander (AFMC/CC), Major Commands (MAJCOMs), and other key stakeholders.   WSER content includes Performance Execution (availability, engines, and aircraft delivery quality); Modernization Overall (cost, schedule, performance, and funding); Product Support (Logistics Health Assessment (LHA) and Leading Health Indicator (LHI) (engines)); Predictive Health (safety, service life, mission effectiveness, and weapon system sustainment (WSS) risk); and Operating Cost


FY 2017 Plan

1) LIMS-EV Engine Health Management and Data Repository Center (EHM-DRC) - migrate an EHM-DRC to GCSS-AF infrastructure and leverage GCSS-AF Enterprise Data Warehouse for data storage and interfaces as well as decision support capabilities to expose and analyze expanded engine health data to improve the reliability and performance.

2) LIMS-EV Repair Network View (RNV) 5.0 - address deficiencies in the RNV capability.  Updates include correcting an existing reference table, creating additional repair nodes, adding a frequency column to the “data source” area of view, mapping to different reference tables, and correcting issues with the Extract, Transform, and Load procedures.  

3) LIMS-EV Supply Chain Management View 7.0 - provide enhanced reports, queries, and views.  Specifics includes reporting/ability to distinguish United States Air Force (USAF) backorders, production number (PDN) Search in Edit box , Ability to add Incremental/auto fill PDN Drop Down In Default Analysis or Create PDN Analysis Report, NSN Entry Conversion, adds "PMS" to Default "Role" Selector &amp; Select Single or Multiple, repairs the "ADD" Function - Manual Ability To Input The Repair Data For An Item That is Contract Repair or public/private partnership (PPP), and allows user to  identify mission capable (MICAP) requisitions likely to have hours that should be stopped or backed out are identified throughout the month using the automated report identified in this requirements document.

4) LIMS-EV Support Equipment Enterprise View - provide real time fleet summary of support equipment (SE) assets (ex. fully mission capable, partially mission capable, not mission capable).  Emulates the same metrics that are used for LIMS-EV Fleet Asset Status and Weapon System View.  SE community will be able to track status and location of SE assets by mission designator (MD), mission designator series (MDS), and Equipment ID.  Capability also Enables a priority buy capability –similar to LIMS-EV Vehicle View - better calculations for predicting asset service cliffs.  

5) LIMS-EV Cost of Logistics (COL) 2.0 - address change request and deficiency reports in the COL Capability, integrate variance tool, and update the existing dashboard.  Updates include providing the user the ability to export reports from the view (instead of having to export from BOBJ), Corrects the existing issue with the export feature, fixes the tool tips, modifies the “Data Source” area on the screen to include a “frequency column”, renames some views, corrects the “Base” filter.

6) LIMS-EV Vehicle View 6.0 - enable Vehicle Support Chain Operations Squadron (VSCOS) Installation Support Centralization (ISC) Initiative.  ISC is a CSAF directed action to centralize management of the Air Forces' vehicle fleet at Air Force Element (AFELM) VSCOS.  The ISC initiative centralizes 55 processes from the MAJCOM’s to one central source within VSCOS.  Some of the enhancements include; Alerts and Event Management (AEM) Integration, enables same look and feel for verification/validation  that exists in latest LIMS-EV capabilities, applies hover overs on fields across the application, enables query tracking, enhances Item Manager functions, and provides a Depot Maintenance planning model.  

7) LIMS-EV Enterprise Propulsion Business Intelligence (BI) Tool - provide engine managers with the ability to  forecast engine and component removals, identify business process gaps, consolidate existing applications/tools, and provide metrics and analysis for existing or new engines based on Thrust, Weight, Fuel, Cost, etc.  Migrate manual products generated by the actuary's office.

F-35 UIDES provides for Air Force development of a F-35 Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS) - User IT Data Exchange Service that supports current and future Information Exchange Requirement (IER) data transfer capability from the F-35 ALIS into data reports and configurable tables to receive, store and integrate F-35 operations, maintenance, training and financial data within existing Air Force enterprise views to support the growing fleet of AF F-35 aircraft.  Funding supports modification of an enhanced data sharing capability (ability to consume increased volume and variety of ALIS IER data) to support depot data configuration and integration requirements.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program/project planning and execution and future program/project planning.

Note: In FY 2016, PE 0708611 Support Systems Development, Project Number 675042, Logistics Application Logistics Integration (LALI), the F-35 User Identification Data Exchange System (UIDES) effort was transferred to PE 0604800F, F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter, in order to align the activity under the F-35 RDT&amp;E Program Element.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Logistic, Installations and Mission Support - Enterprise View (LIMS-EV) implements Business Intelligence(BI) and Decision Support(DS) solutions and includes transitioning to a common Information Technology(IT) hosting environment and development of mobile infrastructure.  The AF must transform its logistics business processes and transition away from using numerous stovepipe systems and process flows that execute the same analysis and decision support tasks.  Eliminating process redundancies across the logistics enterprise will enable the AF to execute more efficient, cost-effective and integrated logistics in the long term. Leveraging emerging technology to enhance existing capabilities and developing a mobile solution satisfies current and future needs of the enterprise. LIMS-EV funding supports Business Intelligence (BI) and decision support development capability used by senior leaders and war fighters to access integrated information from multiple logistics and operational source systems. LIMS-EV funding will extend current BI capabilities to provide configurable alerting, predictive/what-if analysis, mobile applications and further integration of support equipment, vehicle, supply, commodities and components (engines, landing gears, fuel, etc.) to increase weapons systems availability and Total Asset Visibility (TAV) and migrates the LIMS-EV functionality from the retiring Global Combat Support System-Air Force (GCSS-AF) infrastructure to a an approved Joint Information Environment/Common Computing Environment.

F-35 UIDES provides for Air Force development of a F-35 Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS) - User IT Data Exchange Service that supports current and future Information Exchange Requirement (IER) data transfer capability from the F-35 ALIS into data reports and configurable tables to receive, store and integrate
F-35 operations, maintenance, training and financial data within existing Air Force enterprise views to support the growing fleet of AF F-35 aircraft. Funding supports
modification of an enhanced data sharing capability (ability to consume increased volume and variety of ALIS IER data) to support depot data configuration and

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Aviation Resource Management System (ARMS) is the authoritative data source for recording and managing aircrew training information, aircrew/parachutist management, flying hour tracking, flight pay management, and flying gate tracking for 70,000 Air Force members. The Air Force uses this information to enhance safety-of-flight operations and to determine eligibility to perform aviation related events. New development work is required to provide additional flying operations information, which will aid in better portraying Air Force readiness, and to feed this data into Defense Readiness Reporting System Strategic (DRRS-S). These enhanced capabilities, to be developed incrementally, include the following:  electronic flight record, enhanced flying hour management/execution, simulator and remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) management/utilization, full career logbook, training look-back, aircrew member man-month allocation, enhanced resource and jump module management, and interface with DRRS-S.  ARMS data will also be used to support Headquarters Air Force/Major Command (HAF/MAJCOM) level readiness decision reports/analytics.  New development work in support of ARMS needs to be accomplished with RDT&amp;E versus O&amp;M funds. 

This program is Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year. 

The FY2017 funding request was reduced by 0.387 Million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Aviation Resource Management System (ARMS) is the authoritative data source for recording and managing aircrew training information, aircrew/parachutist management, flying hour tracking, flight pay management, and flying gate tracking for 70,000 Air Force members. The Air Force uses this information to enhance safety-of-flight operations and to determine eligibility to perform aviation related events. ARMS interfaces with the Military Personnel Data System (MilPDS) and multiple operations and flight scheduling systems such as Patriot Excalibur (PEX), Graduate Training Integration Management System (GTIMS), Center Operations On-Line (COOL), Global Decision Support System (GDSS), and Automated Aircrew Management System (AAMS) and is used to determine whom to select for flying operations, assignment actions, and promotion of aircrew members.
 
New development work is required to provide additional flying operations information, which will aid in better portraying Air Force readiness, and to feed this data into Defense Readiness Reporting System Strategic (DRRS-S). These enhanced capabilities, to be developed incrementally, include the following:  electronic flight record, enhanced flying hour management/execution, simulator and RPA management/utilization, full career logbook, training look-back, aircrew member man-month allocation, enhanced resource and jump module management, and interface with DRRS-S.  Additional development work on the existing ARMS, such as database flattening and Business Process Reengineering (BPR) actions, is required prior to incorporating these enhanced capabilities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Defense Equal Opportunity Management Institute (DEOMI) provides grants to the civilian academic community to conduct research on military and civilian equal opportunity issues using standard social science methodology and engineering analysis.  The research methodology and analysis includes developing a literature review proposing hypotheses and methods of research.  The grantee will then gather appropriate data, draw conclusions and present discussions, recommendations and reports based on their funding.  

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The FY17 funding request was reduced by $.269M to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.

Funding supports Personnel Recovery development efforts to upgrade Isolated Personnel reporting devices &amp; locating systems in support of Combatant Commanders and Services. Joint Personnel Recovery Agency (JPRA) developmental efforts address Personnel Recovery capability shortfalls &amp; gaps identified in the Personnel Recovery Initial Capabilities Document approved by Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memorandum 120-12 on 8 Aug 2012. Activties include funding for research and development, support equipment, contract services and all associated costs specifically identified to support the JPRA headquarters at Ft. Belvoir, VA and other JPRA operating locations.

In FY16, the Common Distress Reporting System (CDRS) began development.  CDRS will integrate all personnel locating devices into the existing reporting device architecture &amp; Combat Survivor Evader Locater base stations to provide one common operating picture for timely and efficient recovery operations of isolated personnel.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program element provides for payment of civilian compensation benefits for disability due to personal injury sustained while in the performance of duty or due to employment-related disease according to the Federal Employees Compensation Act (FECA) under Title 5 U.S.C., Chapter 81.  The Department of Labor (DOL) administers this program and charges the Department of the Air Force for its employee costs; therefore, this is a MUST PAY bill for Air Force.  The PE excludes manpower authorizations and costs. This Program Element (PE) is in Budget Activity 7 in support of payment of civilian compensation benefits for disability due to personal injury sustained while in the performance of duty or due to employment-related disease according to the Federal Employees Compensation Act (FECA) under Title 5 U.S.C., Chapter 81.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>Defense Forensic Material Exchange (DFME), is a new start in FY15.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Personnel Services Delivery (PSD), under the Personnel Administration program, funds operational developments necessary to acquire, field, and modify business processes to transform the delivery of Human Resources (HR) capabilities through the structured redesign of the Total Force Personnel Community's people (Active Duty, Reserve, Guard, and Civilians), processes, and technologies. PSD Transformation fundamentally shifts the way personnel services are provided, transitioning from primarily face-to-face interactions with a personnelist to a tiered model with services delivered through online self-service, contact centers, and fewer in-person interactions.  PSD supports the migration of legacy applications and other information technologies to a more sustainable and flexible, services-based architecture.  PSD also supports transition from the legacy Military Personnel Data System (MilPDS) to the Air Force Integrated Personnel and Pay System (AFIPPS) to improve financial auditability and track military personnel data.  To this end, PSD executes the development of several legacy personnel systems through the deployment and transitioning of applications to Department of Defense (DoD) and commercial cloud services as part of the Federal Data Center Consolidation effort, as well as future HR application requirements which are beyond the scope of AFIPPS.

The FY17 funding request was reduced by $1.328 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances. 

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The FY17 funding was reduced by $.086M to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.

Provides for development and enhancement of modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) tools for strategic planning, operational requirements, modernization and recapitalization of systems and programs, as well as the Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution (PPBE) processes for the AF Analytic Community and Secretary of the Air Force Standard Analysis Toolkit in support of AF Senior Leadership. As new technologies are introduced to the battlefield (Digital Electronic Jammers, maneuvering Surface-to-Surface Missiles, Directed Energy Weapons, etc.) along with evolving warfighting techniques and support operations, the range of capabilities that needs to be covered by  analytic tools needs to expand as well. M&amp;S creation and enhancement can require extensive research in how to properly implement the emerging weapons capabilities as well as demand development of software techniques to implement the changes. Additionally, emerging and continuing focus areas such as Space, Irregular Warfare, Information Operations, Cyber warfare and ISR demand specific tools of their own for new exploration and development. These focus areas require examination in isolation as well as cross-domain making the problem more complex and increasing the R&amp;D challenges to field new decision support tools.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development as this budget activity includes development efforts to provide new and evolving systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>In FY 2015, Project 671017, CE IT Transformation, was completed.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>NexGen IT is a key USAF effort to comply with statutory and regulatory policy and guidance associated with Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) efforts. 

NexGen IT will transform Civil Engineering (CE) business processes to improve operations and support AF priorities.  The plan is to leverage industry best practices, optimize core business processes, and replace existing outdated IT capabilities with a set of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software solutions and secure a service provider to deploy and maintain the system.  This COTS solution will provide a robust, enterprise-wide CE capability that will consist of an integrated set of embedded / configurable best business practices and capabilities to support the following CE missions:  Real Property Management (RPM), Work &amp; Supply Management (WSM), Project Management (PM), and Energy Management (EnM).  Capabilities are to be configured, tested, and deployed as Capability Groups.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element develops upgrades to existing financial management information systems. These upgrades are required to comply with auditability and transparency requirements as well as enable efficiencies in processing financial transactions. This program element also supports studies and analysis to improve future program planning and execution.

There are three projects within this program element: the Program and Budget Enterprise Service (PBES), the Cost Estimating Modeling (CEM), the Defense Enterprise Accounting and Management System (DEAMS) Increment 1 (Inc 1).  A previous project, DEAMS Inc 2, was incorporated into DEAMS Inc 1 and requested FY 2015 funding was removed by Congressional action.  

PBES is a software development effort that will utilize a service oriented architecture (SOA) to deliver budgeting and programming capability for the Air Force. PBES will replace legacy systems such as the Automated Budget Interactive Data Environment System (ABIDES) and the Resource Allocation Programming Information Decision System (RAPIDS) and will support the budget formulation and force programming process. 

CEM is a knowledge-based study effort to improve Air Force-wide cost estimating by analyzing cost data and recommending changes to estimating models, methods, and tools.

DEAMS Inc 1 is a financial software effort to provide the Air Force with a modern accounting and finance system.  It will allow the Air Force to comply with and fulfill statutory requirements for auditability by 2017, as required in the FY2010 NDAA, and will be Standard Financial Information Structure (SFIS) and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) compliant.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Program and Budget Enterprise Service (PBES) is a single solution software development effort that will utilize a service oriented architecture (SOA) to deliver budgeting and programming capability for the United States Air Force. PBES will replace legacy systems such as the Automated Budget Interactive Data Environment System (ABIDES) and the Resource Allocation Programming Information Decision System (RAPIDS, and will support the budget formulation and force programming process. Upon full deployment of PBES, the system will be compliant with the Standard Financial Information Structure (SFIS) and Standard Line of Accounting (SLOA) conventions, which will enable standardization of data across the Department of Defense (DoD).

Utilizing Business Process Re-engineering (BPR), the Air Force has designated PBES as the solution to deliver traceability of financial data in support of the programming and budgeting processes.  Through the use of BPR, PBES will address excessive overhead, outdated business practices and other time-consuming support activities. PBES will make the budget formulation process more efficient by incorporating business best practices, organizing programming and budgeting personnel, as well as utilizing current technology. PBES will also eliminate checks and balances required of older technology, taking advantage of automated reconciliation services. In addition, the solution will allow the use of Authoritative Data Sources (ADS) for data exposure, resulting in more timely and accurate budget submissions to Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), Congress, and other internal and external customers. 

PBES was originally conceived to be a multiple-release program.  In FY2016, based on streamlining efforts to maximize efficiencies and synergies between the three Releases, PBES will be consolidated into a single delivery effort.  Under the revised single effort, PBES will deliver the following capabilities: baseline extension, allocation of budgetary resources, development of budgetary options for the President's Budget submission, and the integration Congressional marks into the appropriated budget.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Cost Estimating Modeling (CEM) provides and enhances Air Force-wide cost estimating capabilities by developing current cost data and estimating methods and tools. In collaboration with the OSD Cost Assessment Data Enterprise (CADE) project, these products will improve the quality, timeliness, and effectiveness of the acquisition program cost estimates required by statute (e.g., 10 USC 2366, 2433, 2434) and regulation (e.g., DoDI 5000.02) in support of Air Force and Department of Defense acquisition decisions, programming and execution decisions, and Congressional mandates.   

The Air Force works to continuously improve cost estimating capabilities for each weapon system type (aircraft; ballistic missiles; electronics and aircraft modifications; ground stations and automated information systems; cross cutting databases; satellites and launch vehicles; tactical missiles; and munitions).  Changing acquisition laws, regulations, initiatives, and technologies drive the need to revise cost estimating tools. For example, current shortfalls in capability reflect efforts needed to fill gaps in response to the laws and regulations such as the FY06 NDAA report {PL 109-163--Provisions relating to Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAPs)}, Weapon System Acquisition Reform Act (WSARA) {provisions related to improving cost estimating quality, especially earlier in the program life-cycle and affordability analysis}, Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF) Acquisition Excellence Plan {priorities to improve cost estimating capability and affordability analysis and improved cost estimating support to requirements process}, and new Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) policy {better buying power initiatives on enhanced trade-off analysis, affordability analysis, and will versus should cost analysis}.   

This project will perform knowledge-based studies (KBS) analyzing historical data to produce cost estimating relationships (CERs) or statistical data to develop cost estimating databases, methods and tools across hundreds of product work breakdown structure (WBS) elements and functional cost elements within each weapon system type. The different weapon system types are: Aircraft, Ballistic Missiles, Electronics and Aircraft Modifications, Ground Stations and Automated Information Systems (AIS), Cross-Cutting Studies, Satellites and Launch Vehicles (Space Systems), and Tactical Missiles and Munitions. Some areas of cost modeling efforts that are cross-cutting within all weapon system types are: cost risk metrics, methods development, statistical model enhancements; software cost database, metrics, statistical model development; contract or engineering change order analysis models; other government cost elements (e.g., depot standup and government test); nuclear hardening; time phasing; reliability and maintainability; disposal; and commodity area price escalation analysis and models.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Defense Enterprise Accounting and Management System (DEAMS) is a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS), Oracle-based software implementation effort that will provide an auditable, modern accounting and finance system. DEAMS is a Joint United States Air Force (USAF) and United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Program that will replace many existing accounting and finance legacy systems and will provide core funds execution management functions consistent with financial management laws, regulations and policy, general ledger, funds management, payments, receivables, cost and revenues, and fiduciary reporting. DEAMS is compliant with the Clinger-Cohen Act, Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA), and integrates into Global Combat Support System-Air Force (GCSS-AF). When fully deployed, DEAMS will bring the Air Force in compliance with the Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) requirement in the 2010 NDAA.

DEAMS Inc 1 is planned as an eight-release program:

Release 1 - Air Mobility Command (AMC) without Transportation Working Capital Funds (TWCF)
Release 2 - AMC with TWCF, Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) Rome
Release 3 - Air Combat Command (ACC), Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC), Air Education and Training Command (AETC)
Release 4 - Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC), and Air National Guard (ANG) Geographically Separated Units (GSUs) to include DFAS Limestone, Air Force District of Washington (AFDW), Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), U.S. Air Force Academy (USAFA), Pacific Air Forces (PACAF), and DFAS Japan
Release 5 - U. S. Air Forces in Europe (USAFE), and DFAS Europe
Release 6 - Air Force Space Command (AFSPC), Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC), and DFAS Columbus
Release 7 - Conversion programs 
Release 8 - Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC), funded with U.S. Transportation Command Working Capital Funds

DEAMS Inc 1 is transitioning to the Operations and Support (O&amp;S) phase post Milestone C to support deployed locations. 

As reported in the November 30, 2015 Defense Acquisition Executive Summary Report and November 2015 significant change notification letters to the congressional defense committees, the DEAMS program did not meet the original estimate schedule threshold for Full Deployment Decision (FDD) in August 2015.  A September 30, 2015 Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) directed the Air Force to return in February 2016 for an FDD review.  This additional time is required to accommodate a verification of the ongoing mitigation actions to address the findings of the July 1, 2015 Initial Operational Test and Evaluation Report, as outlined in the September 30, 2015 ADM.  Postponing FDD from August 2015 to February 2016 does not impact DEAMS pre-deployment activities, funding or schedule.  DEAMS Inc 1 capability will continue to be deployed in FY2016-2017 as approved by the Milestone Decision Authority.

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>
