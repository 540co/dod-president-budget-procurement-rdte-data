                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project designs, investigates, evaluates and characterizes advanced sensor components, signal processing, and information fusion algorithms that will provide the future Soldier decisive new capabilities to locate, identify, decide and make decisions about and engage battlefield targets in tactical environments.  The ultimate impact and utility of this work will be to greatly increase the lethality, range, and speed of engagement of the Soldier.  Emphasis is on solving critical Army-specific battlefield sensing and information management problems such as false targets, complex terrain (including urban applications), movement of sensors on military vehicles, and exploitation of multimodal sensors.  Significant areas of research include: low cost sensors designed to be employed in large numbers as networked sensors for force protection, hostile fire defeat, homeland defense, counter terrorism operations, and munitions; fusion of disparate sensors such as non-imaging acoustic, seismic, electric-field (E-field), magnetic field, radar; imaging infrared (IR), forward looking IR (FLIR), laser detection and ranging (LADAR), visible imagers; low cost acoustic, seismic, and magnetic sensors that can passively detect, classify, and track battlefield targets such as personnel, heavy/light vehicles, and helicopters.  Other areas of research include sensing technologies for tagging, tracking, and locating (TTL) non-traditional targets as well as the location of direct and indirect fires and other hostile threats.  Further areas of research include ultraviolet (UV) optoelectronics for battlefield sensors, networked compact radar for vehicle and dismount identification and tracking; ultra wideband radar for buried and concealed threat detection, enhanced robotic mobility, stand-off characterization of infrastructure; and the detection, classification, and tracking of humans in urban terrain.  Additional areas of research are aided/automatic target recognition (ATR) allowing sensors to autonomously locate and identify targets; advanced battlefield sensor and information processing to conduct a dynamic and real time situational assessment to present a common picture of the battlespace focused on low echelon commanders; protection of sensors (including Soldier's eyes) from battlefield laser threats; and advanced information processing methods to provide automatic information technologies that utilize widely dispersed sensor and legacy information sources.

This project supports Army science and technology efforts in the Command Control and Communications, Ground, and Soldier portfolios.  The work in this project complements efforts funded in PE 0601104A (University and Industry Research Centers), Program Element (PE) 0602709A (Night Vision Technology), PE 0603710A (Night Vision Advanced Technologies), and PE 0603001A (Warfighter Advanced Technology).

                                <r2:Description>This research supports the current and future technical challenges associated with air defense radar technology. In particular, this effort will analyze current and emerging RF spoofing, RF jamming, and RF signature management technologies to determine their impact on the performance of air defense radars. Electromagnetic modeling, RF measurements, and experiments will be used to identify mitigation techniques for spoofing and jamming, and to identify useful signature management technologies. This will also include research in electronic devices, sub-assembly design, and laboratory experiments to advance the state-of-the-art of air defense radars operating in contested electronic environments.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project designs, evaluates, and investigates autonomous technologies to enable robotics to assist military missions.  Technical efforts are focused on advancing perception for autonomous ground and air mobility, intelligent vehicle control and behaviors, human-robot interaction, robotic manipulation, and improved mobility for unmanned vehicles of scales from micro-systems through tactical combat vehicles. The project provides the underpinning research of the Robotics Collaborative Technology Alliance (CTA), a cooperative arrangement with industry and academia to conduct a concerted, collaborative effort advancing key enabling robotic technologies required for future unmanned systems.  The Robotics CTA research is funded in Program Element (PE) 0601104A/Project H09.  

This project sustains Army science and technology efforts supporting the Air and Ground Maneuver portfolios.

This project leverages basic research conducted under PE 0601102A/Project T63 (Robotics Autonomy, Manipulation and Portability) and PE 0601104A/Project H09 (Robotics CTA) and transitions knowledge and emerging technologies to PE 0603005A (Combat Vehicle and Automotive Advanced Technology) for maturation and demonstration.

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology focus areas, and the Army Modernization Strategy.

Work in this project is performed by the Army Research Laboratory (ARL) at the Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD, and the Robotics Collaborative Technology Alliance consisting of Carnegie Mellon University, Florida State University, General Dynamics Robotics Systems, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, QinetiQ North America, University of Central Florida, and University of Pennsylvania.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) designs and validates electronic warfare (EW) components that deny, disrupt, or degrade the enemy's use of the electromagnetic spectrum for offensive or defensive operations. This is accomplished through the investigation of electronic support measures (ESM); countermeasures against communications systems and networks; the design and fabrication of sensors used to identify and locate threat forces in an asymmetric environment; and threat warning and electronic countermeasures (ECM) against munitions sensors, missile guidance systems, targeting systems, and explosive hazards. Project 906 supports protection of high-value ground platforms, aircraft and the Soldier from threat surveillance and tracking systems, imaging systems, and advanced radio frequency (RF)/electro-optical (EO)/infrared (IR) missiles, artillery, and smart munitions. Information fusion research addresses sensor correlation and fusion, relationship discovery, and management services through use of automated processing, as well as software that applies higher level reasoning techniques to support automated combat assessment. Project 906 also supports research and application of key EW sensors, direction finders and jammers to intercept, locate, and disrupt current and emerging communications and non-communications threat emitters to provide vital quality combat information directly to users in a timely and actionable manner. Specifically, it focuses on detection of threat sensors and emitters associated with weapon systems, targeting systems and command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence systems and networks. 

Work in this PE is complementary of PE 0602120A (Sensors and Electronic Survivability), PE 0602782A (Command, Control, Communications Technology), PE 0603270A (Electronic Warfare Technology), and PE 0603772A (Advanced Tactical Computer Science and Sensor Technology); and fully coordinated with PE 0603008A (Command, Control, Communications Advanced Technology), PE 0603710A (Night Vision Advanced Technology) and PE 0603794A (Command, Control and Communications Advanced Technology).

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project designs, fabricates, evaluates, and applies key electronic warfare (EW)/information operations technologies to enhance platform survivability (to include ground combat vehicles, aircraft, and the dismounted Soldier) and to intercept, track and locate current and emerging threat munitions, communications and non-communications threat emitters. This project applies recent advances in radio frequency (RF), infrared (IR), and electro-optical (EO) sensors and jamming sources to detect, locate, deceive, and jam threats (to include radar directed target acquisition systems, target-tracking sensors, surface-to-air missiles (SAMs), air-to-air missiles (AAMs), top attack weapons, and electronically fuzed munitions). This project also pursues the ability to neutralize improvised explosive devices. This project designs information systems to provide vital, quality combat information directly to users in a timely, actionable manner in accordance with concepts for future force intelligence operations. This project investigates RF collection and mapping technologies to offer real time emitter detection, location, and identification. In addition, this project enables a remote capability to disrupt, deny, or destroy threat communication signals and enables fusion (automated assimilation and synthesis) of battlefield intelligence data to enable interpretation of current threats and future enemy activities. This allows commanders to develop operational courses of action in time to act decisively and in a pre-emptive manner.

This project supports Army science and technology efforts in the Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence, Ground Maneuver, Soldier/Squad and Air portfolios.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project investigates and develops advanced technologies for High Energy Laser (HEL) weapon systems to enable more efficient laser systems with greater power output. This includes technologies to support development of alternate laser sources, precision optical pointing and tracking components, adaptive optics to overcome laser degradation due to atmospheric effects, and thermal management systems to remove excess heat.  In addition, this effort validates laser lethality performance and conducts analyses against a variety of targets and investigates the impact of low-cost laser countermeasures.  This project includes laboratory efforts for HEL applied research as well as concepts analysis for United States Army Space and Missile Defense Command/Army Forces Strategic Command (USASMDC/ARSTRAT) Technical Center competencies in directed energy, missile defense, and space technical areas.

Technology selection was influenced by highest priority/highest potential payoff technologies taking in to account intelligence research, such as that performed at the National Ground Intelligence Center (e.g., high priority threat/capabilities, threat horizon, characterization of contested environment, etc.); and designed assessments with environments and factors that were used to demonstrate vulnerabilities (electronic warfare, cyber security, survivability, lethality and system of systems). Candidates and technologies included Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) and Network Modernization, Active Protection Systems, unmanned ground vehicle/unmanned aerial vehicle technologies, hostile fire detection technologies, digital radio frequency memory (DRFM) for countermeasures/counter-countermeasures, or optics technologies that benefited from reduction of optical augmentation.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides for the research, development, and evaluation of high-power electronic components, materials, and related technologies. These technologies have application in compact and efficient power conversion, conditioning, and management sub-systems; energy storage and conversion devices; radio frequency (RF)/microwave and solid-state laser directed energy weapons (DEW); traditional and non-traditional RF and laser electronic attack; and RF photonics. All project elements are coordinated with and, as appropriate, leveraged by DEW and power/energy programs in the Air Force, Navy, High Energy Laser Joint Technology Office, Defense Threat Reduction Agency, national labs, university consortia, and relevant industry and foreign partners. The products of this research are required by developers of Army and Department of Defense (DoD) systems to evolve traditional (mechanical-based) sub-systems such as geared transmissions, plate armor, and kinetic projectiles to electrically-based ones. These products will provide the Soldier enhanced survivability and lethality through increased power management and energy savings as well as new fighting capabilities offered only by electrical power.

This project sustains Army science and technology efforts supporting the Ground Maneuver, Lethality and Soldier portfolios.

The work in this project is coordinated with the Army Tank and Automotive Research, Development, and Engineering Center (TARDEC); Armaments Research, Development, and Engineering Center (ARDEC); the Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center (AMRDEC); and the Army Communications-Electronics Research, Development, and Engineering Center (CERDEC).  

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

Work on this project is performed by the Army Research Laboratory (ARL), Adelphi, MD.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The objective is to improve the underlying energy efficiency of supply and demand for soldier-portable and unattended sensor electronics to enable the dismounted Soldier to maintain communications, freedom of movement, and increase mission duration.  The majority of the electronics power used by the dismounted soldier and by unattended sensors is attributable to RF communications.  In addition, freedom of movement and action during sustained and high tempo operations requires seamless battery recharging.  To address these challenges, efficient electronics research includes RF circuits, devices, materials and wireless power distribution.  Energy efficiency improvements will be developed and investigated in support of four key sensor and electronic areas: RF component devices, passively powered components, low-power, long-lived sources, and wireless power transfer.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project conducts applied research and develops component technologies that enable improved Reconnaissance, Surveillance, Target Acquisition (RSTA) and situational awareness (SA) at an affordable price. Technologies include novel focal plane arrays (FPAs), processing, and electronics.   It also includes modeling and simulation to predict performance and to determine operational effectiveness of these technologies. Research focuses on dual band infrared (IR) FPAs necessary to search, identify and track mobile targets in all day/night visibility and battlefield conditions and to improve standoff detection in ground-to-ground and air-to-ground operations. This project designs, fabricates and validates large format IR FPAs for sensors to simultaneously provide wide area viewing and the high resolution imagery for situational awareness, persistent surveillance and plume/gun flash detection. This project also investigates and improves III-V materials, semiconductor materials formed by a combination of elements from Groups III and V of the periodic table. In addition, this project develops algorithms for multispectral and hyperspectral functionality, which provide the ability to perform detection and identification at extended ranges, as well as the ability to detect deeply buried targets.  The reduction of size, weight and power (SWaP) is a key research objective for all efforts. In Fiscal Year (FY) 2015 and 2016 the Army investment in advanced IR FPA technologies is augmented to ensure a world-wide technological advantage in IR sensors for the United States. 

This project supports Army science and technology efforts in the Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence, Soldier, Ground and Air portfolios.

                                <r2:Description>This effort investigates and develops a new detector structure for the development of sensors with increased sensitivity.  In "nBn" technology an electron-barrier (“B”) layer is placed between two negatively charged (n-type or “n”) conductive layers, to reduce flow of charge through the material.  The reduction in charge flow reduces the noise intrinsic to the material, thus, increasing the material’s sensitivity.  The objective of the effort is to make MWIR FPAs easier and more affordable to manufacture and to enable operation at higher temperatures, resulting in more affordable sensor systems with significant reductions in SWaP of system optics, housings and cryogenic coolers. In addition, the barrier detector approach allows for very small pixel pitch (8 micron) enabling FPAs of very large format, 5000x5000 pixel, for persistent surveillance applications that were not possible prior to emergence of this barrier FPA technology.</r2:Description>

When demands cannot be remediated by human systems integration, training may enable the demands to be met.  This effort will identify human operator tasks in complex, intelligent, and emerging systems critical to mission employment of new technologies.  The aspects (particularly knowledge and skill) of those tasks will be determined through experimentation and analysis to inform development of training and simulation technologies, fundamental research on the effectiveness of training regimes, and simultaneous task combinations that must be trained.

                                <r2:Description>Soldier performance is affected by mission demands, environment, human characteristics, equipment, and technology.  System development requires considering tradeoffs among these factors and sufficient data about them on which to base analyses.  This effort will identify and develop human performance measures of effectiveness and performance (MOEs and MOPs) critical to performing individual and team tasks in a mission text.  Tools and techniques for analysis of these tradeoffs will also be developed.  Empirical data will be mined from existing sources or collected where gaps exist to inform the interaction among factors affecting Soldier mission performance for emerging technologies.  This research supports the development of the SSEA and is coordinated with PE 0602786A/ H98, 0603015A/S28, PE 0603710A/Project K70, PE 0602308A/ C90, PE 0602787A/869, and 0603004A/232.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) investigates and evaluates enabling tools and methodologies that support the long-term sustainment of Army training and testing activities. Specific focus is on maintaining regulatory compliance while limiting future Army liability in operations and training, and maintaining resilient and adaptive ranges. Project 048 improves the Army's ability to comply with requirements mandated by federal, state and local environmental/health laws and to reduce the cost of this compliance. Project 835 develops enabling technologies for advanced life cycle analysis, advanced sensing, and advanced remediation of Army-unique hazardous and toxic wastes at sites containing waste ammunition, explosives, heavy metals, propellants, smokes, chemical munitions, and other organic contaminants. Project 895 focuses on reducing hazardous waste generation through process modification and control, materials recycling and substitution, and developing technologies to predict and mitigate range and maneuver constraints associated with current and emerging weapon systems, doctrine, and regulations. Project 896 investigates technologies for ecosystem vulnerability assessment, and ecosystem analysis, monitoring, modeling, and mitigation to support sustainable use of Army lands and airspace to reduce or eliminate environmental constraints to military missions.   

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy and supports the Army Strategy for the Environment.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project designs and develops tools and methods to enable the Army to reduce or eliminate environmental impacts both in the United States and abroad. These new and innovative technologies are essential for the effective control and reduction of military unique hazardous and non-hazardous wastes on military installations and associated with contingency operations bases worldwide. To develop the required technologies, this project possesses a focus on developing sustainable environmental protection technologies that help the Army maintain environmental compliance for sources of pollution such as production facilities, facility contamination, and other waste streams; a focus on Army-unique ecosystem vulnerability assessment, and ecosystem analysis, modeling, adaptation, and mitigation technologies for installations associated with air quality and endangered species management and their impacts on training and testing missions; a focus on designing and developing technologies for deployed forces with environmentally safe, operationally enhanced, and cost effective technologies or processes to achieve maximum diversion, minimization, or volume reduction of base camp and field waste; and a focus on the impacts of new materiel that will enter the Army inventory within the next decade and beyond. The resultant technologies reduce the impact of legal and regulatory environmental restrictions on installation facilities, training and testing lands and ranges, as well as provide a means to avoid fines and facility shutdowns within the United States and reduce environmental impacts to the Warfighter abroad.

The work in this project supports the Army Science and technology (S&amp;T) Innovation Enablers (formerly Enduring Technologies) Portfolio.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project investigates a quantitative means to determine the environmental effects resulting from exposure to Army-unique explosives, propellants, smokes, and products containing nanomaterials and new and emerging compounds and materials across Army training and operations. This research provides the basis for tools and methods to respond to regulatory constraints, and to protect the health of the Soldier and the extended Army community. Results of this research will be integrated into the life cycle analysis of all new Army materials and chemicals. The specific results of this research include: determination of acceptable contaminant concentration levels for residual Army-unique chemicals and materials of concern to minimize adverse effects on the environment and human health. This includes development of methods that guide the design of nanomaterials and other new and emerging materials such that adverse effects on the environment are minimized in their designed state and when they enter the environment where they may break down. Example areas of research include genomics analysis, cutting edge nanomaterial analysis, and computational/molecular modeling. Interim projects are used by Program Executive Office (PEO) Ammo and PEO Intelligence, Electronic Warfare &amp; Sensors (IEW&amp;S) for use in life cycle analysis, risk assessment, and cleanup. Interim products are also US Environmental Protection Agency approved criteria documents to be used in risk assessment procedures and establishing regulatory limits. The Army uses these criteria during negotiations with regulatory officials to set scientifically and economically appropriate cleanup and discharge limits on Army lands.

This project researches and develops revolutionary technologies to eliminate or significantly reduce the environmental impacts that threaten the sustainment of production and maintenance facilities, training ranges and operational areas. The project supports the transformation of the Army by ensuring that advanced energetic materials required for high-performance munitions (gun, rocket, missile propulsion systems, and warhead explosives) are devised to meet weapons lethality/survivability stretch goals in parallel with, and in compliance to, foreseeable sustainment requirements. Specific technology thrusts include environmentally-benign explosives developed with computer modeling using Department of Defense high-performance computing resources; novel energetics that capitalize on the unique behavior of nano-scale structures; chemically engineered explosive and propellant formulations produced with minimal environmental waste, long-storage lifetime, rapid/benign environmental degradation properties, and efficient extraction and reuse; and fuses, pyrotechnics, and initiators that are free from toxic chemicals. Other focus areas include toxic metal reductions from surface finishing processes, sustainable military paints and coatings to meet evolving environmental requirements and low global warming potential alternatives for refrigerants, fire suppressants and solvents.

This project focuses development in wireless transport (e.g. mobile radio based communications systems) to develop new techniques for improving communications in high radio frequency (RF) interference environments such as in the presence of electronic warfare (EW) and to increase the communications capacity of terrestrial and satellite communications (SATCOM) systems. This project also investigates enabling antenna components, materials, designs and configurations to reduce the visual signature of antennas on Soldier, vehicular and airborne platforms and reduce co-site interference on platforms with multiple transceivers such as radios and jammers. Additionally this project investigates cyber security devices, software and techniques to harden wireless communications networks against cyber attacks; and new mobile networking protocols to make wireless, on-the-move (OTM) communications networks more responsive to user needs. This project also investigates network operations software and techniques that improve the ability of the Soldier to manage and maintain complex, dynamic networks; and improved spectrum management software tools to make more efficient use of over-subscribed RF spectrum. This project also provides new technology capabilities to lower the size, weight, power (SWaP) and cost of networking systems deployed on Army platforms through rapid technology improvements in hardware and software convergence.

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) investigates and advances technologies, techniques, and tools for representation of the physical and human environment for use in military planning and operations; for characterizing geospatial, atmospheric, and weather conditions and impacts on systems and military missions; for conducting mobility, counter-mobility, survivability, and force protection planning and operations; and for enabling secure, sustainable, energy efficient facilities. Research focuses on special requirements for battlefield visualization, tactical decision aids, weather intelligence products, and capabilities to exploit space assets. Project 855 conducts geospatial research and development supporting a standard sharable geospatial foundation enabling a common operating environment across mission and command systems. Project H71 supports the materiel development, testing, and operations communities in evaluating the impacts of weather and atmospheric obscurants on military materiel and operations. Project T40 advances technologies for adaptive and expedient force protection across the range of military operations. This project also designs and evaluates software and hardware to identify and mitigate positive and negative ground obstacles; characterizes austere navigation environments and designs/evaluates materiel solutions including rapidly emplacable bridging, ground stabilization, and breakwater structures; and builds and uses modeling and simulation tools to advance understanding of the interactions of weapons/munitions and novel defeat methodologies with buildings, shelters, bunkers, berms and bridges. Project T41 investigates application of technologies to enable garrison/post commanders to plan, monitor, and operate facilities more efficiently, cost-effectively, securely, and sustainably; and creates tools (including advanced models and simulation) that provide a framework for making trades and decisions, and also supports research to evaluate non-combat population characteristics and status from social and cultural perspectives to achieve mission objectives. Project T42 develops and validates models and simulations to understand the impacts of the physical environment on the performance of forces, ground and air vehicles, and sensors; as well as the impact of natural and man-made changes in the environment on military operations. Project T45 investigates and evaluates materials, components, and systems that have potential to reduce energy losses in buildings and shelters; and potential to detect and mitigate consequences of contaminants such as bacteria and molds in air handling equipment and building materials.

Efforts include high-resolution, local assessments and forecasts of meteorological conditions in near real time including effects of urban and mountainous terrain; analytical tools to assess the impact of the atmosphere to optimize system performance and operations planning and advanced atmospheric sensing applications to characterize and mitigate wind and turbulence in complex terrain. It provides detailed model applications for various effects of the atmosphere on electro-optical and acoustic target detection, location, and identification. This project develops both physics-based decision aids and rule-based decision support systems for assessing the impacts of weather/atmosphere across a spectrum of friendly and threat weapons systems, sensors, platforms, and operations. Information can be applied to mission planning and execution, battlefield visualization, reconnaissance surveillance and target acquisition, route planning to maximize stealth and efficiency, web enabled tactical decision aids, and also modeling of environmental impacts for combat simulations and war games.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project investigates, evaluates, and develops technologies for adaptive and expedient force protection across the range of military operations. Focus areas include: force projection and maneuver, including austere port and airfield entry and overcoming battlespace gaps (such as cliffs, ravines, mudflats, shallow rivers, and other natural obstacles); prediction, definition, avoidance, or defeat of the gaps; scalable weapons effects; and high-resolution representation of near-surface terrain and environment for use with sensor models for target detection and unmanned ground systems (UGS) navigation. This research further provides physics-based representations of ground vehicle mobility, obstacle and barrier placement, survivability, and weapons effects in complex and urban terrain modeling and simulation. Work in this project increases the survivability of critical assets from conventional, unconventional, and emerging threats and enables maneuver support of deployed forces, while reducing their logistical footprint. This project supports efforts for overcoming critical capability gaps for protecting troops operating at smaller bases that are remote or integrated with local communities.      

Work in this project supports the Army Science and Technology Ground Maneuver, and Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence (C3I), and Soldier Portfolios.

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project investigates and evaluates technologies and techniques to ensure sustainable, cost efficient and effective facilities and to achieve resilient and sustainable installation and base operations. The project focuses on facilities and operations technologies directly supporting training, readiness, force projection, force protection, homeland security, and forward base operations. Facility enhancement technologies contribute to cost reductions in the Army facility life cycle process (infrastructure planning, assessment, design, construction, revitalization, sustainment, and disposal), and the supporting installation operations. This work improves the ability of installations to support forces to meet transformation goals, improves designs for close battle training facilities, and enhances security of Soldiers, families, and civilians. Technologies evolving from this work include integrated planning and design tools for US facilities and forward bases, models predicting water dispersed contaminant effects on facilities and occupants; sustainable facility and base management; collaborative decision support tools; and advanced materials. In addition, technologies from this work will support analysis of socio-cultural and facility issues in forward base operations, including urban environments.  

Work in this project supports the Army Science and Technology Innovation Enablers (formerly Enduring Technologies) and Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence (C3I) Portfolios.

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) conducts applied behavioral and social science research to enhance the Soldier Lifecycle (e.g., selection, assignment, training, leader development) and human relations (e.g., culture of dignity, respect, and inclusion). These technologies provide advanced personnel measures that more fully assess potential and predict performance, behavior, attitudes, and resilience. These technologies also provide innovative and effective training and mentoring methods to ensure Soldiers, leaders, and units have the knowledge, skills, and abilities to sustain positive unit climates and meet mission requirements in uncertain and complex environments. This PE evaluates new selection measures, refines performance metrics, assesses innovative training methods, and conducts scientific assessments to inform Human Capital policy and programs.  Research in this PE will result in effective non-materiel solutions to help the Army adjust to changes in force size and structure, a variety of mission demands and contexts, challenges in human relations, and budgetary constraints.

Efforts in this program element support the Army Science and Technology Soldier portfolio.

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>In Fiscal Year (FY) 2015 and 2016 Project 874 funds both Combat Casualty Care and Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine efforts. In FY17 the Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine efforts will be funded in Project ET4. Starting in FY17 the FH2 funding and research will be merged into Project 869. Additionally, starting in FY17 the toxic substances research efforts will move from Project VB4 to Project 869.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) supports application of knowledge gained through basic research to refine drugs, vaccines, medical devices, diagnostics, medical practices/procedures, and other preventive measures essential to the protection and sustainment of Warfighter health. Research is conducted in five principal areas: Combat Casualty Care; Military Operational Medicine; Military Relevant Infectious Diseases Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine; and Systems Biology/Network Sciences. Research is funded in six projects.  

Project 869 refines knowledge and technologies on screening tools and preventive measures for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and mild traumatic brain injuries, physiological monitors, and interventions to protect Warfighter's from injuries resulting from operational stress, and exposure to hazardous environments and materials.  Also conducts research on medically valid testing devices (i.e. the test mannequins that are true to the human form and physiologically and anatomically accurate) and predictive models used for the refinement of Warfighter protective equipment. This project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Program. Starting in FY17 the FH2 funding and research will be consolidated into this project. Additionally, starting in FY17 the toxic substances research efforts will move from project VB4 to project 869.

Project 870 designs and refines drugs, vaccines, medical diagnostic assays/tests devices, other preventive measures for protection and treatment against naturally occurring infectious diseases and wound infections of military importance, as identified by worldwide medical surveillance and military threat analysis. This project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Program.  

Project 874 identifies and evaluates drugs, biologics (products derived from living organisms), medical devices, and diagnostics for field trauma care systems, resuscitation, and life support, and post-evacuation restorative and rehabilitative care. Focus is identifying more effective critical care technologies and protocols to treat severe bleeding, traumatic brain injury, burns and other combat related traumatic injuries, and treatments for ocular (eye) injury and visual system dysfunction.  Additional focus areas are laboratory and animal studies of regenerating skin, muscle, nerves, and bone tissue for the care and treatment of combat trauma casualties. This project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Program. In FY15 and 16 this project funds both Combat Casualty Care and Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine efforts. In FY17 the Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine efforts will be funded in project ET4.

Project ET4, which is a restructure of efforts funded elsewhere in this Program Element, starts in FY17 and the funding for the Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine Research Program moves from project 874 to project ET4. Project ET4 identifies and evaluates drugs, biologics, medical devices, treatments and diagnostics for post-evacuation restorative, regenerative and rehabilitative care, as well as systems for use by field medics and surgeons for ocular trauma. Research focus is on identifying more effective technologies and protocols to treat ocular injury and visual system dysfunction, as well as laboratory and animal studies for regenerating skin, muscle, nerves, vascular and bone tissues for the care and treatment of battle-injured casualties. This project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Program. 

Project FH2 conducts applied research focused on sustainment of a healthy Warfighters throughout the entire deployment life cycle. Starting in FY17 the FH2 funding and research will be consolidated into project 869.

Project VB4 includes applied research in systems biology to provide a highly effective mechanism to integrate biological tests and computer simulations in clinical trials and in animal studies. The PTSD and Coagulopathy exemplars have demonstrated the power of an iterative systems biology approach and are moving projects related to objective diagnostics and improved and personalized therapeutic strategies. Development of the SysBioCube (a data analysis, management and integration system) has provided an ability for complex collaborative efforts to share, process and evaluate data using innovative technologies. These concerted refinement efforts using systems biology are showing reduction of time and funding for solutions to intractable problems of critical military importance. Starting in FY17 the toxic substances efforts will move from project VB4 to project 869. 

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology, focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

All medical applied research is conducted in compliance with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations. The FDA requires thorough testing in animals (preclinical testing) to ensure safety and, where possible, effectiveness prior to evaluation in controlled human clinical trials (upon transition to 6.3 Advanced Technology Development). This PE focuses on research and refinement of technologies such as product formulation and purification and laboratory test refinement with the aim of identifying candidate solutions. This work often involves testing in animal models. The EPA also requires thorough testing of products, such as sterilants, disinfectants, repellents, and insecticides to ensure the environment is adequately protected before these products are licensed for use.

Program refinement and execution is externally peer-reviewed and fully coordinated with all Services as well as other agencies through the Joint Technology Coordinating Groups of the Armed Services Biomedical Research Evaluation and Management (ASBREM) Community of Interest (COI). The ASBREM COI, formed under the authority of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, serves to facilitate coordination and prevent unnecessary duplication of effort within the Department of Defenses (DoD) biomedical research and refinement community, as well as their associated enabling research areas.

Work funded in this project PE is fully coordinated with efforts undertaken in PE 0603002A and the Defense Health Program.

Work in this PE is performed by the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR), Silver Spring, MD and its overseas laboratories; Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) and the Armed Forces Institute of Regenerative Medicine (AFIRM), Fort Detrick, MD; Army Center for Environmental Health Research (USACEHR), Fort Detrick, MD; Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine (USARIEM), Natick, MA; the Army Dental Trauma Research Detachment and the Army Institute of Surgical Research (USAISR), Joint Base San Antonio, TX; Army Aeromedical Research Laboratory (USAARL), Fort Rucker, AL; and the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC), Silver Spring, MD.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project conducts research to prevent and protect Warfighters from training and operational injuries, refine mechanisms for detection of physiological (human physical and biochemical function) and psychological (mental) health problems, evaluate hazards to head, neck, spine, eyes, and ears, set the standards for rapid return-to-duty, and determine new methods to sustain and enhance performance across the operational spectrum. This research provides medical information important to the design and operational use of military systems, and this work forms the basis for behavioral, training, pharmacological (drug actions), and nutritional interventions. 

The four main areas of study are: 
(1) Environmental Health and Protection 
(2) Physiological Health
(3) Injury Prevention and Reduction
(4) Psychological Health and Resilience

Additionally the Warfighter Systems Engineering Architecture task advances medical Science and Technology (S&amp;T) in the areas of injury prevention and performance sustainment in the context of human interaction with new Soldier systems and provide greater insight into informing new research in development of Warfighter systems and the interactions between Warfighters and the systems they employ.  

Promising efforts identified in this project are further matured under Program Element (PE) 0603002A, project MM3.

                        <r2:ProjectNote>In Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 the Drugs to Prevent/Treat Parasitic Diseases and Vaccines for Prevention of Malaria research areas are merged into Applied Research on drugs and vaccines against parasitic diseases.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project conducts applied research for medical countermeasures to naturally occurring infectious diseases that pose a significant threat to the operational effectiveness of forces deployed outside the United States. Effective preventive countermeasures (protective/therapeutic drugs and vaccines and insect repellents and traps) protect the Force from disease and sustain operations by avoiding the need for evacuations from the theater of operations. Diseases of military importance are malaria, bacterial diarrhea, and viral diseases (e.g., dengue fever and hantavirus). In addition to countermeasures, this project funds refinement of improved diagnostic tools to facilitate early identification of infectious disease threats in an operational environment, informing Commanders of the need to institute preventive actions and improve medical care. Major goals are to integrate genomics (DNA-based) and proteomics (protein-based) as well as other new biotechnologies into the refinement of new concepts for new vaccine, drug, and diagnostics candidates.

Research conducted in this project focuses on the following four areas:

(1) Prevention/Treatment of Parasitic (organisms living in or on another organisms) Diseases
(2) Bacterial Disease Threats (diseases caused by bacteria)
(3) Viral Disease Threats (diseases caused by viruses)
(4) Diagnostic Systems and Vector Identification and Control
 
For the refinement of drugs and biological products, studies in the laboratory and in animal models provide a proof-of-concept for these candidate products, including safety, toxicity (degree to which a substance can damage an organism), and effectiveness, and are necessary to provide evidence to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to justify approval for a product to enter into future human subject testing. Additional non-clinical studies are often needed in applied research even after candidate products enter into human testing during advanced technology development, usually at the direction of the FDA, to assess potential safety issues. Drug and vaccine refinement bears high technical risk. Of those candidates identified as promising in initial screens, the vast majority are eliminated after additional safety, toxicity, and/or effectiveness testing. Similarly, vaccine candidates have a high failure rate, because animal testing may not be a good predictor of human response, and therefore candidate technologies/products are often eliminated after going into human trials. Because of this high failure rate, a continuing effort to identify other potential candidates to sustain a working pipeline of countermeasures is critical for replacing those products that fail in testing.  

Work is managed by the United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) in coordination with the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC). The Army is responsible for programming and funding all Department of Defense (DoD) naturally occurring infectious disease research requirements, thereby precluding duplication of effort within the Military Departments.   

Promising medical countermeasures identified in this project are further matured under PE 0603002A, project 810.
 
The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology, focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.   
 
Work in this project is performed by the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR), Silver Spring, MD, and its overseas laboratories; the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Disease (USAMRIID), Fort Detrick, MD; and the NMRC, Silver Spring, MD, and its overseas laboratories.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project refines and assesses concepts, techniques, and materiel that improve survivability and ensure better medical treatment outcomes for Warfighters wounded in combat and other military operations. Combat casualty care research addresses control of severe bleeding, resuscitation and stabilization, predictive indicators and decision aids for life support systems , treatment of burns, and traumatic injuries to hard and soft tissues of the face, mouth, and extremities and traumatic brain injury (TBI). Clinical and rehabilitative medicine research addresses tissue repair and functional restoration including transplant technologies, orthopedic injuries, eye injuries, genitourinary (reproductive and excretory organs) injury, and face trauma. 

Research involves extensive collaboration with multiple academic institutions to refine treatments for combat wounds through Armed Forces Institute of Regenerative Medicine (AFIRM). This project is coordinated with the Military Departments and other government organizations to avoid duplication.

Research conducted in this project focuses on the following five areas: 
(1) Damage Control Resuscitation 
(2) Combat Trauma Therapies 
(3) Combat Critical Care Engineering 
(4) Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine (moves to ET4 in FY17) 
(5) Traumatic Brain Injury

All drugs, biological products, and medical devices are refined in accordance with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations, which govern testing in animals to assess safety, toxicity, and effectiveness and subsequent human subject clinical trials.  

Promising efforts identified in this project are further matured under Program Element (PE) 0603002A, Project 840.

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology, focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

Work on this project is performed by United States Army Institute of Surgical Research (USAISR), the United States Army Dental Trauma Research Detachment (USADTRD), Joint Base San Antonio, TX; the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR), Silver Spring, MD; and the AFIRM, at Multiple Institutions across the US. 

Efforts in this project support the Soldier Portfolio and the principal areas of Combat Casualty Care and Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This research focuses on enhanced protection of Warfighters against health threats in military operations and training. Stressors that adversely affect individual Warfighter health readiness are identified and studied to refine interventions that will protect Warfighters and improve their health and performance in stressful environments. This is follow-on research that extends and applies findings from over a decade of research on Gulf War Illnesses and other chronic multi-symptom illnesses that have suspected nerve and behavioral alterations caused by environmental contaminants and deployment stressors. Key databases include the Millennium Cohort Study and the Total Army Injury and Health Outcomes Database. These databases allow us to evaluate interactions of psychological stress and other deployment and occupational stressors that affect Warfighter health behaviors.

Force Health Protection applied research is conducted in close coordination with the Department of Veterans Affairs. This project contains no duplication with any effort within the Military Departments and includes direct participation by other Services working on Army projects.

Research conducted in this project focuses on the following three areas:
(1) Millennium Cohort Research
(2) Biomarkers of Exposure and Environmental Biomonitoring
(3) Physiological Response and Blast and Blunt Trauma Models of Thoracic (Chest) and Pulmonary (Lung) Injuries

                        <r2:ProjectNote>Starting in Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 the toxic substances research efforts and funding will move from Project VB4 (System Biology And Network Science Technology) into Project 869.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This projects efforts support biological and clinical applied research using the data analysis and integration grid (SysBioCube) as an overarching means of complex data usage to solve critical health problems. The primary capability of systems biology (field of study that focuses on complex interactions within biological systems, using a holistic approach) is the integration and analysis of complex human and animal study data and development of computational disease models, using global multi-omic methods to identify and discriminate unique combinations of biological molecules corresponding to clinical conditions (physiologic, immunologic, endocrine, etc.), supporting transition of research to clinical applications. This capability applies a systematic integrated approach to trace progression of illnesses and diseases and has already shown that the approach significantly reduces time, funds and effort invested in medical product development and refinement. An application of systems biology is to characterize physiological pathways altered by toxic substances enabling identification of the causative toxic substances as well as to understand the injury mechanisms. The detection/identification of physiological markers of exposure to toxic substances can then be used to support medical countermeasure decisions or development of targeted therapeutic drugs. 

These examples of more complex, yet integrated approaches to projects studying biological systems (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Project) have been shown to reduce both the time and expense of medical product development for the Army

                                <r2:Description>The core capability for multidisciplinary applied research in systems biology  enables integration and analysis of complex data from human and animal studies and development of computational network models, allowing researchers to differentiate among molecular signatures (unique combinations of biological molecules corresponding to clinical conditions) of disease, and supports transition of research to clinical applications. Conduct applied research to identify and characterize (the substance itself and how it causes harm) toxic substances, e.g. toxic industrial chemicals. The molecular and physiological markers of intoxication are then applied to support diagnostic tools development of medical countermeasures. Current studies are addressing exposures to industrial chemicals, toxicogenomics (study of what genes are involved with responding to a toxic substance and those genes associated with susceptibility to the toxic substance) of metals, health surveillance with assessment of micro-biome, metabolomics of heat injury, and modeling toxicity pathways. The task funding for the toxic substances research effort moves to project 869 in FY17.</r2:Description>

Evaluated and integrated computer modeling with high-content global molecular data sets from PTSD clinical studies and utilized PTSD animal models to further therapeutic studies / Followed the successful pattern of combining clinical trials with animal models, applied this to study coagulopathy and mechanisms of chronic pain. Developed and enhanced capabilities to support transition of research to advanced development by incorporating newly emerging digital Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved approaches. Evaluated high-content data sets from environmental exposures using computational platforms to identify biomarkers altered in physiological pathways and developed a panel of biomarkers to evaluate adverse reactions from exposure to environmental health hazards with a focus on toxicity markers of a specific organ system. Verified the pathway(s) (through tissues/cells) that a toxic substance exerts its effects and validated biomarkers of that effect in the rodent model.</r2:Text>

                                        <r2:Text>Will continue to expand Systems Biology (SB) scientific efforts and to facilitate collaborative partnerships with Army, Department of Defense (DoD) and extramural laboratories. Will continue overseeing data sharing and data integration activities and continue to expand the SysBioCube capabilities to accommodate usage growth and integration of large, complex data sets. For coagulopathy, will complete the collection of time-course samples from trauma patients and proceed to determine the molecular effects of various clinical treatments to improve (or not) the clinical status. Will conduct data analyses of findings with chronic pain, suicidality, infection and effects of microgravity (functions as a stressor) to integrate with clinical results. Will evaluate nutritional supplements in the mouse model simulating features of PTSD in order to assess improved resolution or recovery. Will integrate clinical and multi-molecular studies of PTSD in humans to confirm a candidate panel(s) to diagnose chronic PTSD for advancement to a LDT which will be confirmed by a commercial lab; will identify three to four DoD clinical sites which will have the facilities to evaluate the LDT as a precursor for moving forward with an FDA product. Will evaluate clinical trials using standard PTSD therapy regimens to determine which aspects of PTSD are improved (or not) and to begin to associate initial status of the patients in order to inform therapeutic strategies ‘personalized’ for the individual’s condition.</r2:Text>
