                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The mission of USSTRATCOM is to establish and provide full-spectrum, global strike, coordinated space and information operations capabilities to meet both deterrent and decisive national security objectives, and to provide operational space support, integrated missile defense, Global Command Control Communications and Computers Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR), and specialized planning expertise to the joint warfighter.  This mission has been defined by the 2002 Unified Command Plan (UCP) changes 1 and 2, the CJCS Plan ORD and the USSTRATCOM Plan ORD.  GSIN nets together selected systems and sensors, from tactical to strategic, including the Nation's most modern and capable assets, taking advantage of their larger numbers, improved algorithms, mobility and forward deployment to provide earlier cross-cueing and expanded decision space when every second counts.  GSIN will enable a User Defined Operating Picture (UDOP) to provide a single, unambiguous missile event picture allowing real-time senior collaboration for nuclear C2, improved senior leader situational awareness (SA), and decision-making.

The Nation's strategic C2, sensors and mission planning programs cannot rapidly exchange information across multiple missions, creating ambiguity that delays time critical national C2 decision making processes.  GSIN establishes a unified schema integrating disparate Missile Warning/Missile Defense (MW/MD) data into a single exposed data set providing redundant and unambiguous MW/MD data to national leadership.  GSIN enables existing sensors to provide data in net-centric formats consumable by other authorized systems and mission areas, thus reducing the need to acquire more sensors.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning, execution, and future program planning.  

The program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate prodcution and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Provides Electronic Support (ES) for key find, fix, track, target, engage and assess (F2T2EA) requirements supporting Space Superiority activities.  Additionally, funding provides for developmental intelligence collection to support new capability acquisition and development.  This program element funds transportable intelligence collection and analysis capabilities that are modular (plug-and-play), and can keep pace with technological advances and emerging threats.  It provides intelligence support systems for Space Situational Awareness activities that provide the requisite current and predictive knowledge of space events and threat conditions and intelligence support to Space Protection Programs by providing architectural survivability analyses of critical mission assets for mission assurance.  Additionally, funding supports phased threat system analysis and studies (A&amp;S), test support, lab equipment, and Material Acquisition and Exploitation (MAE) for system development and vulnerability/susceptibility assessments to support tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP) development. Also funded are future threat technology studies necessary for mission area success and achievement of space superiority, helping preserve the US space advantage across all domains.   This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because it includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the curent or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Provides Electronic Support (ES) for key find, fix, track, target, engage and assess (F2T2EA) requirements supporting Space Superiority activities.  Funds developmental intelligence collection to support new capability acquisition and development.  This project also funds transportable intelligence collection and analysis capabilities that are modular (plug-and-play), and can keep pace with technological advances and emerging threats.  It provides intelligence support systems for Space Situational Awareness activities that provide the requisite current and predictive knowledge of space events and threat conditions and intelligence support to Space Protection Programs by providing architectural survivability analysis of critical mission assets for mission assurance.  It also supports phased threat system analysis and studies (A&amp;S), test support, lab equipment, and Material Acquisition and Exploitation (MAE) for system development and vulnerability/susceptibility assessments to support tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP) development and future threat technology studies necessary for mission area success and achievement of space superiority, and to preserve the US space advantage across all domains.   This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because it includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The four (4) aircraft E-4B National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC) fleet satisfies the military need for an airborne operations center with communications capabilities permitting military and civilian leadership to monitor and control military and civil national assets during all phases of conflict (nuclear and non-nuclear) or natural disaster. The E-4B NAOC fleet also satisfies the military requirement to provide a highly survivable node of the National Military Command System (NMCS). 

This Program Element's (PE's) developmental modifications include, but are not limited to, upgrades and enhancements to aircraft structures, propulsion system, fuel system, environmental control system, electrical generation and distribution systems, flight safety and navigation systems (with their associated communications equipment), and the related aircraft operations center facilities, equipment, and communications necessary for the E-4B fleet to execute its mission. Additionally, funds may be used to explore modifications, upgrades, and future systems required to meet evolving mission requirements. Developmental modifications and studies/projects currently underway or planned for accomplishment under this program include:

- The Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) Compatible Terminal/ Presidential National Voice Conferencing (PNVC) Program integrates externally provided  AEHF Compatible Command Post Terminals and PNVC capability onto the E-4B NAOC platform. This integration is necessary to replace the legacy Military Strategic, Tactical and Relay (MILSTAR) terminal, and provide access to protected wideband AEHF satellite networks. PNVC replaces the Survivable Emergency Conferencing Network (SECN), which will not be supported once the AEHF satellite network is in place.

- The Low Frequency Transmit System (LFTS) program will replace the Very Low Frequency/Low Frequency (VLF/LF) Transmit system currently installed on the E-4B. The current system is no longer sustainable after over 35 years of operation on the E-4B. In order to meet existing National Security Presidential Directive (NSPD)-28 requirements and ensure there is constant and consistent connectivity to civilian and military leadership and military forces during real world situations, this system must be replaced. The transmit system consists of three primary equipment groups: a Control/Monitor group, a Power Amplifier/Coupler (PA/C) group, and a Trailing Wire Antenna (TWA) group.

- E-4B Recapitalization efforts include the assessment of aircraft alternatives to meet the required need date and ability to support the Nuclear Command, Control and Communications (NC3), Secretary of Defense travel, Continuity of Operations/Continuity of Government (COOP/COG), and other missions as identified in associated requirements documentation. Funds will be used for technology development strategy, test and evaluation strategy, systems engineering plan development, lifecycle management plan development, capabilities development, and other required documents leading up to a Milestone A decision. This program, E-4B Recapitalization, is a new start.

Activities will include studies and analysis to support current program planning and execution, and planning for future programs.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

The FY2016 funding request was reduced by $1.241 million to account for the availability of prior execution balances.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Acquisition Strategy: The acquisition strategy for each specific modification differs based on the urgency of the requirement, definition of the capability, and technology readiness level of the components.  Acquisition strategy for an eventual E-4 replacement will be determined after requirements have been finalized.

Management Strategy:  Program management for all aircraft modifications is conducted from the existing E-4B program office at Tinker AFB.  The Program Executive Officer (PEO) for mobility provides management oversight.

Contracting Strategy:  Contracting strategy differs for each individual modification, but normally includes a initial risk reduction study contract followed by a development under Tinker AFB's Engineering Support Services (ESS) contract with Boeing - San Antonio.  Production installations and sustainment are accomplished with a separate contract.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

In FY2016,  PE 0303001F Family of Advanced BLoS Terminals (FAB-T), Project 672490, Family of Advanced BLoS Terminals (FAB-T) efforts were transferred to PE 0303601F, MILSATCOM Terminals, Project 672490, Family of Advanced BLoS Terminals (FAB-T) in order to provide improved visibility.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Family of Advanced Beyond Line-of-Sight Terminals (FAB-T) program replaces legacy Milstar terminals and will provide Extremely High Frequency (EHF), protected high data rate communication for nuclear and conventional forces to include Presidential National Voice Conferencing (PNVC).  FAB-T will provide this new, highly secure, state-of-the-art capability for DoD platforms to include strategic platforms and airborne/ground command posts via Milstar, AEHF, and Enhanced Polar System (EPS) satellites. FAB-T terminals will also support the critical command and control (C2) of the Milstar, AEHF and EPS satellite constellations. In FY16, the Air Force continued development of the FAB-T terminal.

The FY2016 funding request was reduced by $.333 million to account for the availability of prior execution balances

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>In FY12, the government restructured the FAB-T development program to introduce competition into the acquisition strategy in order to reduce risk in delivering this capability as well as to drive down production costs. To ensure the best value to the government, the Air Force awarded production contracts in September 2013 to both contractors (Boeing and Raytheon). The production contracts began with production planning for both contractors. In June 2014, the Air Force down-selected to Raytheon. Development will continue with Raytheon and production of FAB-T Command Post Terminals. Production contract options to produce CPT terminals will be exercised after a successful Milestone C decision.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY16, Project 676029, Global ASNT, includes a new start effort for Global ASNT Increment 2.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Nuclear Deterrence Operations (NDO) is an Air Force Core Function.  Within this core function, Nuclear Command and Control (NC2) is the exercise of authority and direction by the President, as Commander in Chief, through established command lines, over nuclear weapon operations of military forces.  The President's authority and direction are exercised through the Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS).  The NCCS is the designated combination of flexible and enduring elements including facilities, equipment, communications, procedures, personnel, and the structure in which these elements are integrated, all of which are essential for planning, directing, and controlling nuclear weapon operations.

The Minimum Essential Emergency Communications Network (MEECN) portfolio modernizes the systems necessary to effectively provide assured communications connectivity between the President and the strategic deterrence forces in stressed environments. 

MEECN System Improvements (MSI) is a long-range planning process with users (Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC), Air Combat Command (ACC), Air Force Space Command (AFSPC), Air Mobility Command (AMC), US Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM), and the Navy) to develop recommendations for current and future requirements/issues based on available technology. MSI is used to conduct technology testing, analyze technology strategies and build technology roadmaps as pro-active support to the Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3) community. 

Global Aircrew Strategic Network Terminal (Global ASNT) replaces inadequate, unsustainable strategic communications equipment at bomber, tanker and reconnaissance Wing Command Posts (WCPs), Nuclear Task Forces, Munitions Support Squadrons (MUNSS), and for Mobile Support Teams (MSTs).  Global ASNT is a ground-based system that will provide survivable, secure communication paths to receive Emergency Action Messages (EAMs) and Force Management messages from NC3 nodes and disseminate them to bomber, tanker, and reconnaissance aircrews.
  
Global ASNT is being fielded in separate capability increments.  

Global ASNT Increment 1 fields required Extremely High Frequency/Advanced Extremely High Frequency (EHF/AEHF) capabilities and replaces inadequate, unsustainable strategic mobile and fixed-site Single Channel Anti-jam Man-Portable (SCAMP) terminals.  The FY16 funding request was reduced by $1.140 million to account for the availability of prior execution balances in Global ASNT Inc 1.  

Global ASNT Increment 2 is a new start.  Increment 2 delivers an Aircrew Alerting System (AAS) consisting of pagers and klaxons, and High Frequency (HF) and Ultra High Frequency (UHF) capabilities.  Increment 2 replaces Electromagnetic Pulse Hardened Dispersal Communication (EHDC) systems and Aircrew Alerting Communications Electromagnetic Pulse (AACE) systems.     

Global ASNT Increment 3 is planned to deliver a Very Low Frequency (VLF)/Low Frequency (LF) receive capability.  

Global ASNT will provide solutions to existing capability shortfalls for NC3 and is the last line of operational communications when all other peacetime links fail.  

This program is in Budget Activity 07, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal years.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>MEECN System Improvements (MSI) is a long-range planning process with users (Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC), Air Combat Command (ACC), Air Force Space Command (AFSPC), Air Mobility Command (AMC), US Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM), and the Navy) to develop recommendations for current and future requirements/issues based on available technology.  MSI will perform risk reduction, and analyze requirements and prepare technologies for future replacement or acquisition efforts.  MSI is used to conduct technology testing, analyze technology strategies, and build technology roadmaps as pro-active support to the Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3) community. 

Very Low Frequency/Low Frequency (VLF/LF) receivers are currently used as one of the means for secure/survivable connectivity from the President to strategic forces. Over the years, the Air Force and Navy have pursued their own VLF products, which meet the unique application and environmental situations for each platform.  MSI is investigating the technical feasibility of a future common core of processing hardware and software that supports all VLF receiver platforms and associated waveforms.

                            <r2:ProjectNote>In FY16, Project 676029, Global ASNT, includes a new start effort for Global ASNT Increment 2.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Global ASNT replaces inadequate, unsustainable strategic communications equipment at bomber, tanker and reconnaissance Wing Command Posts (WCPs), Nuclear Task Forces, Munitions Support Squadrons (MUNSS), and for Mobile Support Teams (MSTs).  Global ASNT is a ground-based system that will provide survivable, secure communication paths to receive Emergency Action Messages (EAMs) and Force Management messages from NC3 nodes and disseminate them to bomber, tanker, and reconnaissance aircrews.  
Global ASNT is being fielded in separate capability increments.  

Increment 1 fields required Extremely High Frequency/Advanced Extremely High Frequency (EHF/AEHF) capabilities and replaces inadequate, unsustainable strategic mobile and fixed-site Single Channel Anti-jam Man-Portable (SCAMP) terminals.  

Increment 2 delivers an Aircrew Alerting System (AAS) consisting of pagers and klaxons, and High Frequency (HF) and Ultra High Frequency (UHF) capabilities. Increment 2 replaces Electromagnetic Pulse Hardened Dispersal Communication (EHDC) systems and Aircrew Alerting Communications Electromagnetic Pulse (AACE) systems.   

Increment 3 is planned to deliver a Very Low Frequency (VLF)/Low Frequency (LF) receive capability.  


Global ASNT will provide solutions to existing capability shortfalls for NC3 and is the last line of operational communications when all other peacetime links fail.  


 
This program is in Budget Activity 07, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal years.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Information Systems Security Program (ISSP) Element provides cradle-to-grave research, development, acquisitions, supply, sustainment, depot maintenance, and demilitarization of the Air Force (AF) cryptographic and key distribution/management systems.  Additionally, ISSP funds the AF operation of one of two Department of Defense (DoD) Tier 1 key distribution centers.  The AF and the DoD require the capability to secure, collect, process, store, and disseminate an uninterrupted flow of information, while denying an adversary the ability to intercept, collect, destroy, interpret, or manipulate our information flows. Secure communication allows the DoD to achieve and maintain decision superiority; the key to successful application of the military instrument of national power. AF COMSEC equipment protects information such as, warfighter positions, mission planning, target strikes, commanders' orders, intelligence, force strength, and force readiness. This COMSEC program ensures adversaries cannot interpret, manipulate, or destroy information. When an adversary is capable of interpretation, manipulation, or destruction of the information used by the warfighter, DoD military forces will suffer significant and/or devastating mission degradation that can result in loss of life and resources and/or cede information that could be used against the United States in a public forum.

The overall focus of the Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) efforts within this program is to transform electronic key delivery and cryptographic devices to meet the next generation warfighting requirements. These efforts are driven by the National Security Agency's (NSA) tenets calling for (1) a totally "man-out-of-the-loop" electronic crypto key distribution system from the actual generation of the key in the key processor all the way into the using End Crypto Unit (ECU) (eliminates the current key vulnerability to compromise/interruption by individuals transporting or loading the key); and (2) an inventory of cryptographic devices that are more robust, modular, scalable, capable, net-centric, and durable (allows more effective and efficient performance including reduced inventory, expanded data rates, simplified upgrades, and ensured global information grid-compatibility).  

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, as these budget activities include development efforts to upgrade systems currently fielded or have approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Air Force Electronic Key Management System (AFEKMS) consists of multiple developments supporting the Air Force requirements portion of the DoD EKMS Program. The National Security Agency (NSA) acts as the Executive Agency for the DoD EKMS Program. AFEKMS, in concert with the overarching DoD EKMS program, provides a secure and flexible capability for the electronic generation, distribution, accounting, and management of key material, with users across DoD Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) and all current AF weapon systems. Bases  and units, in garrison and deployed DoD EKMS replaced the previous manual distribution and management system providing cryptographic keying material for U.S. DoD Information Assurance. Information Assurance emphasizes confidentiality, access control, multi-level secure databases, trusted computing, and information integrity. DoD EKMS has a three-tier hierarchical structure. This tiered structure provides capability to distribute, manage, and account for COMSEC keying material. Tier 1 installations comprise the key material generation and control capability. Tier 2 installations comprise the local distribution network (COMSEC accounts) and Tier 3 is where keying material is transferred from the EKMS infrastructure to the consumers End Cryptographic Units (ECUs). Additionally, AFEKMS resources provide maintenance/distribution of AF Communications Security (COMSEC) publications for all AF users. 

EKMS improved protection of national security-related information by substantially enhancing confidentiality, integrity, and non-repudiation characteristics over the legacy manual key management systems. EKMS has and continues to greatly accelerate availability of crypto key materials through electronic transmission through Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) versus the manual handling and shipping of materials. While the current EKMS level-of-effort is directed at enhancing current and developing systems, the ultimate goal is for it to seamlessly transition to the net-centric DoD Key Management Infrastructure (KMI). The AFEKMS Program continues to provide software development to support emerging requirements during the KMI transition period. Activities include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution as well as development activities to extend life of the Simple Key Loader to bridge the gap between EKMS and the KMI implementation.

NOTE:  Software development (e.g., Data Management Device - DMD, Common User Application Software - CUAS, and Simple Key Loader - SKL) is rolled up into Tier 2/Tier 3 Development. Software upgrades can be bundled and tracked as a unit, thereby allowing less management overhead and more focus on configuration management and control.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The AF Cryptographic Modernization Effort modernizes cryptographic devices protecting critical national security information across cyber domain operations. In September 2000, the Defense Review Board (DRB) tasked National Security Agency (NSA) to evaluate the security posture of the cryptographic inventory. Systems with aging algorithms, those approaching non-sustainability, and those generally incompatible with modern key management systems were also identified and have been replaced or are being fielded. Priority systems that required immediate replacement were also identified. In addition, NSA documented the need to modernize the cryptographic inventory with capabilities designed to enable network-centric operations. Replacements/Modernization of the near term vulnerable systems must occur within the timeframe specified by device and algorithm in Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Notice (CJCSN) 6510. The DoD Cryptographic Modernization Program was established to develop a modern cryptographic base that provides this assured security robustness, interoperability, advanced algorithms, releasability, programmability, and compatibility with the future Key Management Infrastructure (KMI-See PE 0303140F, BPAC 67523, AF KMI for a full description).  This AF effort supports an integrated effort across the cyber domain to transform  to next generation cryptographic capabilities providing U.S. forces and multinational and interagency partners the security needed to protect the flow and exchange of operational decision making information in accordance with national and international policy/standards, the validated operational requirements of the warfighters, and the intelligence communities.  

The AF Cryptographic Modernization Effort is a collection of projects accomplished in three phases: replacement, modernization, and transformation. The replacement phase of the program focused on updating and/or replacing out-of-date algorithms along with unsustainable cryptographic products. The modernization phase provides crypto devices with common solutions that are more robust, modular, scalable, and provide the durability to existing cryptographic end items, as well as updating mid-term aging/unsupportable crypto equipment. Manpower and logistics requirements will be reduced and manpower efficiencies gained, while incremental capability enhancements and footprint reduction are provided. The third phase of the Cryptographic Modernization Program, transformation, provides common joint solutions which enable secure transparent network-centric capabilities across the cyber domain. Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.  FY14 funding increased to address pending crypto key/algorithm decertifications due to increased threats identified by NSA.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Air Force Key Management Infrastructure (AF KMI) Program consists of multiple developments supporting the AF requirements/portion of the DoD Key Management Infrastructure (KMI). The National Security Agency([NSA) acts as the Executive Agency for the DoD KMI Program. AF KMI, in concert with this overarching DoD KMI Program, will provide a secure and flexible capability for the electronic generation, distribution, accounting, and management of key material and other communications security (COMSEC) materials for all DoD Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) and for the Services' weapon systems. KMI represents a broad-scale replacement of the current Electronic Key Management System (EKMS). KMI will provide capabilities that will allow networked operation in consonance with the Global Information Grid (GIG) and other DoD, fellow Service, and AF enterprise objectives. It thereby will assure a viable support infrastructure for future weapons and C4I programs to incorporate key management into their system designs.

The DoD KMI will greatly improve protection of national, security-related information by substantially enhancing confidentiality, integrity, and non-repudiation characteristics over the legacy EKMS. KMI will greatly accelerate the availability of crypto key materials through electronic transmission versus shipping of materials, will enhance mission responsiveness and flexibility, and will eventually take the man "out-of-the-loop" in the distribution of crypto key materials.

The AF KMI Program in concert with the DoD KMI Program is transitioning the Air Force from the legacy EKMS to modern DoD KMI and building the AF KMI Last Mile architecture. This R&amp;D effort includes system engineering, development and testing to successfully implement the AF KMI Last Mile architecture. The AF KMI Last Mile program is a holistic solution integrating the legacy and new and evolving cryptographic programs, materials, products, sources and consumers. The AF KMI Last Mile capabilities include distribution, management, and load of cryptographic materials from the KMI (COMSEC account) to the End Crypto Units (ECUs). It builds the linkage interfaces that will allow KMI systems to communicate and integrates other related developments to meet operational needs. AF KMI Last Mile is currently in the Development Phase. Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.

In parallel with AF KMI, DoD and the Services are developing a new generation of End Crypto Units (ECUs) under the Joint Crypto Modernization Initiative that will be capable of direct interaction with the DoD KMI. (PE0303140F, BPAC 675100, Cryptographic Modernization, supports this initiative). In some cases these new ECUs, although needing to be supported by KMI, will not be KMI network-connected. "Last mile" transport of black (aka benign, or encrypted) and red (unencrypted) keying
material from a KMI client to a new generation ECU or current legacy ECU will need to be handled in the early years by one of two data transfer devices. Initial early systems engineering must also be addressed to accommodate future connectivity between the DoD KMI and future KMI Aware/Enabled ECUs.  This enabling form factor functionally defined as a common ECU KMI aware/enabled key load module.  This is targeted to be a standardized module to be provided to ECU developers and, as such, it must precede any future ECU developments.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY2016, components of project number 675046, Systems Engineering &amp; Integration, efforts were transferred from PE 0303141F, Global Combat Support Systems (GCSS) to Program B02000 Global Force Management, PE 0303142F, Global Force Management - Data Initiative (GFM-DI) in order to provide better visibility of costs associated with GFM-DI.

In FY2015, project number 675046 Systems Engineering &amp; Integration, efforts were transferred from PE 0303141F, Global Combat Support Systems (GCSS) to project number 66ACSI, Acquisition and Command Support (ACSI), PE 0308602F, Enterprise Information Services (EIS), in order to provide better visibility of costs associated with evolution to a Cloud Computing Environment (CCE) now called Common Computing Environment (CCE).

In FY2015 efforts in project 675046, Systems Engineering and Integration, will complete.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Global Combat Support System-Air Force (GCSS-AF) provides the warfighter and supporting elements with timely, accurate, and trusted Agile Combat Support (ACS) information.  This information will have the appropriate level of security needed for the Air Expeditionary Forces (AEF) to execute the Air Force mission throughout the full spectrum of military operations.  The GCSS-AF program modernizes, consolidates, develops, and integrates Air Force and Department of Defense combat support information systems. 

The infrastructure and provided Air Force enterprise common services are a critical basis for the target common computing environment (CCE) effort which Air Force Guidance Memorandum has directed for all new and modernizing IT applications.  This effort is the Air Force evolution to DoD Joint Information Environment (JIE) leveraging Core Data Centers (CDCs) and DISA-brokered cloud capabilities in compliance with the Air Force Information Technology (AF IT) baselines.  This framework is a set of baseline-driven platform and infrastructure services in both physical and virtual hosting environments.  It is comprised of development tools, an initial set of enterprise services, and governance processes critical to JIE management.   

This system is implemented and sustained worldwide and supports both wartime and peacetime requirements using hardware, software, and communications capabilities available from standard open systems government contracts and communications infrastructure programs. In this manner, GCSS-AF avoids added costs, removes business processing inefficiencies, reduces deployment footprint, and improves the speed with which information flows.  

Activities also include capability development of an automated risk management framework to assess and mitigate cyber and other threats to Air Force information technology and mission assets. This capability eliminates stove pipes and provides commanders with better situational awareness of vulnerabilities. Additionally, this capability promotes efficiency and sound resource allocation by enabling commanders to make better decisions when selecting risk reduction counter measures. 

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>In FY2016, components of project number 675046, Systems Engineering &amp; Integration, efforts were transferred from PE 0303141F, Global Combat Support Systems (GCSS) to Program B02000 Global Force Management, PE 0303142F, Global Force Management - Data Initiative (GFM-DI) in order to provide better visibility of costs associated with GFM-DI.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Global Force Management Data Initiative (GFM DI) is a Joint Staff and OSD initiative designed to standardize component force structure representations, making them visible, accessible, and understandable across the Department of Defense (DoD). Unique identifiers associate billets, crews, equipment, and chain of command links, enabling electronic manipulation and operational planning across multiple systems. 
Through establishment of an information exchange data standard, GFM DI enables DoD systems to exchange force structure data in a common format while exploiting the net-centric data environment. 

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:Text>FY16 GFM-DI AFOS development efforts will implement the requirements set forth in the Air Force Implementation Plan for the Global Force Management Data Initiative Manpower &amp; Personnel Capability Description Document. The primary goal of this effort is to link authorized manpower authorizations
(identified by their GFM DI OUIDs) to on-hand personnel (identified by their DoD ID Numbers (formerly known as EDIPIs). This will be accomplished
through development of interfaces to feeder systems.</r2:Text>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY2016, PE 0303601F, MILSATCOM Terminals, Project 672490, Family of Advanced Beyond Line-of-Sight Terminals (FAB-T) was transferred to PE 0303001F, FAB-T, Project 672490 FAB-T for improved visibility of ACAT I programs.

FAB-T was funded FY13 and prior in PE 0303601F, Project Number 672487 and Project Number 672489.  In FY14 it was transferred to Project Number 672490 in the same PE.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM) terminals program develops and fields equipment enabling users to communicate via legacy and future systems to include Milstar, Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF), Ultra High Frequency (UHF) Follow-On (UFO), Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS), Defense Satellite Communication System (DSCS), Enhanced Polar Systems (EPS), and other military and commercial satellites, to support tactical Air and Space Expeditionary Force requirements and maintain essential connectivity for strategic forces.  Program RDT&amp;E currently includes the following efforts:      

1) Development work to identify commercial/military technology solutions to improve MILSATCOM terminal capabilities for the warfighters.  Focus includes, but is not limited to, increasing throughput, facilitating sustainability, reducing footprint on existing user platforms and future concept terminals to provide more resilient and/or higher data rate satellite communications to warfighters.   

2) The Family of Advanced Beyond Line-of-Sight Terminals (FAB-T) program replaces legacy Milstar Command Post Terminals (CPT) and will provide Extremely High Frequency (EHF), protected high data rate communication for nuclear and conventional forces to include Presidential National Voice Conferencing (PNVC).  FAB-T will provide this new, highly secure, state-of-the-art capability for DoD platforms to include strategic platforms and airborne/ground command posts via Milstar, AEHF, and Enhanced Polar System (EPS) satellites. FAB-T terminals will also support the critical command and control (C2) of the Milstar, AEHF, and EPS satellite constellations. In FY15, the Air Force continued development of the FAB-T terminal.  

3) The Joint Terminal Engineering Office (JTEO) provides tri-service coordination of terminal development, acquisition and fielding activities.   

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>In September 2002 the program office awarded Boeing the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) Cost Plus Award Fee (CPAF) contract; in April 2012 the contract was converted to a Firm Fixed Price (FFP).  In 2012 the government introduced competition into the acquisition strategy to reduce risk in delivering this capability as well as to drive down production costs. In September 2012 the program office awarded a System Development and Demonstration (SDD) contract to Raytheon, Firm Fixed Price (FFP). To ensure best value to the government, the Air Force awarded production contracts in September 2013 to both contractors (Boeing and Raytheon).  The production contracts began with production planning for both contractors. In June 2014, the Air Force down-selected to Raytheon for development and production of FAB-T Command Post Terminals.  Production contract options to produce CPT terminals will be exercised after a successful Milestone C.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>(U) This PE provides signals intelligence (SIGINT) development efforts for all USAF airborne platforms.  The funds in this PE are distributed among all Airborne SIGINT Enterprise (ASE) projects based on the development priorities established by the USAF SIGINT Capabilities Working Group (SCWG) in order to build a total SIGINT capability.  As a result, the USAF will move funds between projects periodically to develop the highest priority projects in response to urgent warfighter needs.  This PE will participate in the development, integration, testing, and implementation of international and Air Force standards (to include NATO standardization agreements) to ensure joint, allied, and coalition interoperability.  Modernization efforts include sensors for the platforms and where appropriate, their interfaces with the Air Force Distributed Common Ground System (AF DCGS).  This approach supports a synergistic development effort providing a true Air Force-wide capability.  

(U) This enterprise will use the Air Force SIGINT Architecture (AFSA) for planning and decision-making and, in turn, employ open architecture standards whenever possible to allow maximum ease of future upgrades and system interoperability.  The primary goal of the ASE is to produce an architecture-based, capability-focused SIGINT investment strategy for the USAF.  Funds in any project may be used to fund initiatives in other projects within this PE at the discretion of the SCWG.  Funds in any project can also cover activities to include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning. 

(U) This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>(U) This project supports design studies, engineering analysis, non-recurring engineering, and other efforts associated with the integration and modification of the RC-135 SIGINT sensors and their associated air and ground components. Through extensive utilization of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) based solutions to field needed capabilities, it also incurs a need for continuous identification of suitable replacements for components affected by Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and integration efforts consistent with the COTS technology cycle.  These efforts provide  required engineering for preliminary assessments of technical feasibility, operability, or military utility as well as specific engineering implementations integrated into the various baseline modifications.  These funds will be split between the RC-135V/W RIVET JOINT, the RC-135U COMBAT SENT, and the RC-135S COBRA BALL programs.  Funding  reflects the SIGINT Capabilities Working Group (SCWG) priorities and the accomplishment of other Airborne SIGINT Enterprise (ASE) initiatives.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>(U) This project covers the costs of SIGINT integration for high altitude intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) platforms.

(U) This project supports sensor integration and test, flight test, design studies, engineering analysis, non-recurring engineering and other efforts associated with the insertion of new capabilities integrated into the Airborne Signals Intelligence Payload (ASIP) or other SIGINT sensors and their associated air and ground components for the High Altitude SIGINT platforms. The project also identifies suitable replacements for components affected by Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS).  This project provides the warfighter with a near-term, increased combat capability. Enhancements are implemented as soon as technology and risk achieve satisfactory levels. Capability improvements will be inserted into the sensors through individual development efforts that exploit signals of interest identified as service priorities by the Air Force SIGINT Capabilities Working Group (SCWG). Funding includes completion of developmental logistics tasks associated with the design, development, and integration of ASIP.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>(U) In FY 2016, PE 0304260F, Airborne SIGINT Enterprise, Project 675182, Medium Altitude SIGINT Development - Medium Altitude, was terminated.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>(U) This project supports design studies, engineering analysis, non-recurring engineering, program management administration, and other efforts associated with the integration and modification of medium altitude platforms as required with SIGINT sensors and their associated air and ground components.  This RDT&amp;E effort integrates SIGINT capability on medium altitude platforms as required. The sensors will be capable of collecting technical data and geolocating signals of interest and providing sensor data to a workstation.    

(U) Design efforts specific to medium altitude systems may include, but not be limited to, antennas, electromagnetic interference reduction, encryption techniques, and changes to the aircraft, ground station, data link, and simulator necessary to accommodate a SIGINT payload and its data throughput.  Funding will support efforts to develop antennas, receivers, processors, software development, aircraft integration and ground station upgrades to allow a persistent reconnaissance, surveillance, targeting, and acquisition capability against mission specific threats.  Development of a networked capability for medium altitude systems will also be initiated.   These upgrades are designed to exploit signals of interest identified as service priorities by the Air Force SIGINT Capabilities Working Group (SCWG). These development activities will continue through future years, to include but not be limited to, integrating capabilities developed under separate efforts.  Applicable design efforts for the ASIP Processor Upgrade Chassis (APUC) are planned to be migrated to the baseline ASIP sensor to provide new signals capabilities and enhancements to counter specific threats.  FY15 funding is planned to mature technology developed under APUC for application on the ASIP sensor. 
  

(U) This project provides the warfighter with near term increased combat capability.  Enhancements are implemented as soon as technology and risk achieve satisfactory levels and exploit signals of interest identified as Service priorities by the AF SCWG.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>(U) In FY 2016, PE 0304260F, Airborne SIGINT Enterprise, Project 675181, High Altitude SIGINT Development - High Altitude efforts are transferred to PE 0304260F, Airborne SIGINT Enterprise, Project 675183, Common Development (Airborne SIGINT Development - Common Development) in order to simplify contracts as there will be only one High Altitude platform going forward.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>(U) This project supports design studies, engineering analysis, non-recurring engineering, program management administration and other efforts associated with the insertion of new capabilities integrated into ASIP and other sensors and their associated air and ground components that will be used on/by more than one platform.  The common development SIGINT project also supports development of new sensors capabilities, normalization of quick reaction capabilities, and identifies suitable replacements for components affected by diminishing manufacturing sources.  New capabilities are developed by separate projects. This project also supports the development of projects common to the Airborne SIGINT Enterprise (ASE) Program Element (PE) overall to include, but not limited to: the Air Force SIGINT Architecture (AFSA) maintenance, modeling and simulation efforts, and NATO SIGINT efforts.

(U) Sensors development supports Airborne Signals Intelligence Payloads (ASIPs) high altitude payload upgrades.  The systems' open architecture and Joint Airborne SIGINT Architecture (JASA)/ Unified Cryptologic System Technical View 1 (UCS StdY-1) compliant design supports streamlined integration of ASIP onto additional ISR platforms.  The ASIP sensor is designed to be a common SIGINT system that will allow for for maximum coverage of the electromagnetic spectrum through the use of an integrated high and low band system.

(U) Capability improvements will be inserted into the ASIP sensor through individual development efforts that exploit signals of interest identified as service priorities by the Air Force SIGINT Capabilities Working Group (SCWG).  This project provides the warfighter near term increased combat capability. Enhancements are implemented as soon as technology and risk achieve satisfactory levels.  Compatability improvements will be inserted into the ASIP through individual development efforts that exploit signals of interest identified as Service priorities by the USAF SCWG. Sensors will be integrated and tested on the various platforms as funding permits.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>(U) The COMPASS BRIGHT program develops, demonstrates, and rapidly transitions advanced Air Force specific Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) capabilities against emerging and future target signals. The COMPASS BRIGHT program includes the newer Operational Reconnaissance (Ops Recce). This program pursues SIGINT and Ops Recce technologies for program transition, to include Communications Intelligence (COMINT), Electronic Intelligence (ELINT), Audio, Analytics, Special Signals of Interest, and Radio Frequency (RF) Measurement and Signature Intelligence (MASINT). The COMPASS BRIGHT program objective is to develop technologies for application in SIGINT and MASINT systems or subsystems. Acquisition and production of these developed technologies will occur within the appropriate platform programs. COMPASS BRIGHT projects are selected through a data call process, whereby the USAF evaluates proposals from the laboratories and industry partners, to select those projects that are most promising. This program includes total government and contractor costs for these projects.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>(U) This project supports special Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) studies as well as the development and integration of advanced SIGINT capabilities for special programs including, but not limited to:  Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) sensors, the Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (PED) associated with these systems, and other efforts approved by the USAF SIGINT Capabilities Working Group (SCWG).  Development efforts will include, but are not limited to: new signal sets, antenna improvements, sensitivity upgrades, and data distribution upgrades.  This project provides the warfighter with near term combat capabilities with increased capability improvements accomplished as technologies and risks achieve satisfactory levels.  Sensors will be integrated and tested on various platforms including the MQ-1B/MQ-9A Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) as funding permits.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program element funds the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) Aerospace Management System Division (AMSD), the designated Air Force (AF) Communications, Navigation, Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) and Navigation Safety Center of Excellence (COE).  The COE provides expertise to Headquarters Air Force, AF major commands (MAJCOM), and weapon system program offices regarding CNS/ATM system technical functions and performance standards for operation in the US National Airspace System (NAS) and international civil airspace.  This centralized capability supplements the MAJCOMs and over 50 AF weapon system program offices with resident CNS/ATM technical expertise.

This funding enables the AMSD to monitor and participate in government and industry technical forums responsible for the development and assessment of international civil aviation standards for operations in worldwide airspace.  Division personnel analyze civil standards as they are being developed and work to influence them to support Department of Defense (DOD) interests.  CNS/ATM experts identify specific technical and engineering criteria and document them in generic performance matrices (GPMs).  The COE works with MAJCOM and program office personnel to develop strategies for implementing CNS/ATM requirements on AF weapon systems.  Specifically, CNS/ATM experts work with program office systems engineers to tailor the GPMs to apply civil standards to each platform's unique avionics architecture.  Once CNS/ATM component integration and testing is completed, COE personnel validate platform CNS/ATM performance against the standards necessary to operate in civil airspace.  

This program also funds the management of Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts that enable centralized procurement of CNS/ATM and navigation safety avionics equipment.  These contracts are used by aircraft program offices across the DOD, among other federal agencies, and in support of foreign military sales.  

This program also funds periodic audits required by civil aviation assurance standards on processes used to develop and distribute the Digital Aeronautical Flight Information File (DAFIF) to DOD users.  This electronic navigation database, developed and maintained by the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA), contains critical safety of flight information used by DOD flight crews to fly instrument flight rules procedures worldwide.  

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The DoD Cyber Crime Center (DC3) was created as a DoD Center of Excellence to efficiently organize, equip, train, and employ scarce resources to more effectively address the proliferation of computer crimes affecting the DoD.  DC3 has a digital forensics laboratory, training program, institute, and National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force Analytical Group.  To enable its operations, through the Defense Cyber Crime Institute (DCCI), DC3 will remain on the leading edge of computer technologies and techniques through research, development, testing and evaluation applied to digital evidence processing and computer forensic analysis; and by conducting liaison and by partnering with governmental, university, and private industry computer security officials.  DC3 will develop imaging tools, steganalysis and stegextraction tools, and password over-ride tools.  These software tools will enable DC3 to increase the probability of data recovery that would otherwise remain undetected.  The Intrusions/Intruders Signature Program (IISP) provides for the R&amp;D of products and technologies that detect trace and profile hostile cyber adversaries.  This capability provides network monitoring and the framework for sharing and automating reverse engineering techniques.   Computer Incident Batch Oriented Recursive Examination (CIBORE) is used to aid the counterintelligence and law enforcement communities to respond to computer intrusions.  It is also a data reduction tool that takes a large volume of data, identifies the known good and bad files and eliminates them from consideration, leaving several GBs of files as candidate malicious code files.    

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, these budget activities includes development efforts to upgrade systems currently fielded or has received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Tools are uniquely suited for consideration of both civilian generics and military specific purposes.  These software tools enable the LE/CI community to increase the probability of data recovery that would otherwise remain undetected.  The On-Scene Triage Tool (OTT) provides special agents with the ability to obtain information immediately from a live computer at a crime scene in order to determine media relevancy to an investigation.  The TrueCrypt Detect tool  is a special purpose tool for 1st responders to rapidly search thousands of files from suspected media embedded in MP4 or MOV videos using the program TCSteg.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Defense Cyber Crime Institute (DCCI) continues RDT&amp;E collaboration efforts with law enforcement/counterintelligence and cyber communities to identify digital forensic technology gaps, research potential solutions and develop tools based on those solutions to address the gaps.  DCCI leverage research into cutting edge investigative challenges within the digital forensics discipline to advance efforts aimed at securing networks, to include deep dive research into metamorphic and polymorphic techniques embedded in malicious code.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>Tools are developed after specific consultation with law enforcement and counterintelligence agencies after analysis of domestic and foreign intrusion attempts.  Automated Malware Processor (AMP) 2.0 file processing includes extraction, carving and analysis operations which improves the efficiency of forensics examiners by automating tasks that do not require the application of human intelligence.   3GPCarver provides rapid carving of video taken from cell phones and MP4 files.  The tool is also effective at reconstructing video files which are mildly fragmented.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN) is a satellite ground terminal network comprised of two communication nodes and 15 antenna systems. The antennas are distributed around the globe at seven locations to ensure global coverage for 170 satellites in various orbits. The AFSCN conducts an average of 450 satellite contacts per day supporting Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT); Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR); Missile Warning; Communications; Weather; Launch Vehicle Support; Research and Development (R&amp;D) in support of Department of Defense (DoD), Intelligence Community (IC), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) operations. While most of the 450 satellite contacts/day are routine command and control activities, the AFSCN is also used for satellite emergencies (e.g. tumbling satellite) because its high power antennas are often the only earthbound assets that can contact a non-responsive satellite to re-establish command &amp; control. In FY14 alone, the AFSCN supported 17 space vehicle emergencies resulting in the preservation of $6B worth of satellites. In addition to routine and emergency satellite operations C2, the AFSCN provides support to launch vehicle and early orbit operations, ensuring worldwide antennas receive telemetry as the rocket travels through the atmosphere and transmit commands to a newly orbiting satellite to initiate early orbit checkout. Finally, the AFSCN provides Factory Compatibility Testing (FCT) to ensure satellites and rockets can communicate via the AFSCN before the satellite is launched. These funds are used to develop next-generation tools to improve the AFSCN and ensure the capability is available to support DoD, Intelligence, and civil users.

MISSION PLANNING UPGRADE: The Air Force will complete the Electronic Scheduling and Dissemination (ESD) 3.0 program, modernizing worldwide antenna system scheduling to support all 170 satellites. Satellite operators will be able to request contact time with their satellites via the shared AFSCN antennas and ESD 3.0 will deconflict overlapping requests, create a schedule, and publish real-time to all users. FY16 funds support ESD follow-on capability along with deferred network cyber security requirements.

SATELLITE ANOMALY RECOVERY AND SUPPORT UPGRADE: The Air Force will complete development testing of the enhanced High Power Amplifier (EHPA) first article. The AFSCN is in jeopardy of losing the emergency high power satellite contact capability due to obsolete parts used in the legacy AFSCN system. The EHPA program will develop a new high power amplifier that resolves the obsolescence issue well into the 2020's. FY16 funds support the transition and operational turn-over of the first EHPA.

UNIFIED S-BAND UPGRADE: The Air Force is adjusting the AFSCN for spectrum-sharing with industry and demonstrating the ability to migrate away from the current L-Band uplink / S-Band downlink spectrum to the Unified S-Band (USB) spectrum. RDT&amp;E funds support a first article integration of USB into the AFSCN baseline to begin supporting factory compatibility testing.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

The FY2016 funding request was reduced by $6.206 million to account for the availability of prior execution balances.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This budget activity funds operational development necessary to acquire, sustain, and enhance segments of the Air Force Weather Weapon System (AFWWS).  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning. Program Management Administration costs include Federally Funded Research and Development Centers and Advisory and Assistance Service.  AFWWS provides timely, accurate, consistent and relevant space and atmospheric (a.k.a. terrestrial) weather information for global battlespace situational awareness. AFWWS supports worldwide operations of Air Force and Army warfighters, Special Operation Forces, and other government agencies with weather observing and forecasting capabilities at in-garrison, and deployed locations as well as centralized, reach-back capabilities.  AFWWS activities align under four capability areas:  Weather Data Collection, Weather Data Analysis and Dissemination, Weather Forecasting, and Product Tailoring/Warfighter Applications.  This alignment ensures an integrated and systems-oriented approach to program management decisions.  

Weather Data Collection provides automated atmospheric and space environmental sensing capabilities at fixed and deployed locations worldwide. Projects include Next Generation Radar (WSR-88D) and Upper Air Observing Follow-On.  FY16 funding will enhance system technical performance based upon state-of-the-art signal processor technology for enhanced discrimination of precipitation types, severe weather detection, and rainfall amount estimations and will continue operationalizing new upper air sounding capability that uses laser technology.  

Weather Data Analysis and Dissemination provides a net-centric infrastructure that assimilates worldwide sources of atmospheric and space weather data and produces decision-quality information for warfighters.  Improved analysis of real-time weather information supports DoD's Warfighting and Enterprise Information Environment Mission Areas as well as DoD's role in transformation of the National Airspace System through the Next Generation Air Transportation System and enhances Air Force energy security plans. In FY16 Air Force Weather-Web Services (AFW-WEBS) moved into this capability area from Weather Forecasting to better align its function of integration of net-centric capabilities. FY16 funding will continue development of incremental software enhancements and integration of (1) improved analysis capabilities, including processing of data from new environmental sensing satellite sources and (2) Open Geospatial Consortium services, comprised of Web Map Services (WMS), Web Coverage Services (WCS), and Web Feature Services (WFS); which provide more impact-based information and are tailored towards specific missions/use cases.  

Weather Forecasting provides advanced scientific numerical weather prediction capabilities for automated, high resolution forecast products for mission execution, rehearsal, and planning. Weather Forecasting includes projects for Numerical Weather Modeling; Weather Services - Live, Virtual, Constructive (WS-LVC, formerly Environmental Data Cube System Support), and the Space Weather Analysis and Forecast System.  FY16 funding will continue development of software to integrate advanced atmospheric and space weather forecast capabilities to improve models for warfighter operations.  Additionally, Weather Forecasting capabilities will be expanded to both integrate and exploit data from new environmental sensing satellite sources and expanded weather products/services for Live, Virtual, and Constructive events for DoD Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) users within Data Center 14866.  

Product Tailoring/Warfighter Applications provide timely, local, and regional target-scale weather information to operational commanders for a given Area of Responsibility and at tactical levels they provide front-line weather information to warfighters, including weather forces, conducting combat operations.  This supports the 'train as you fight' concept by assuring fixed and deployable systems have an equivalent operator look and feel. No FY16 funding is requested.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>The overall program objective for SWAFS is to enhance and sustain a single integrated space weather software baseline operating in a net-centric environment at all security levels within the AFWA enterprise architecture. 

SWAFS is now in Spiral 2 development and focuses on new or improved capabilities identified through user feedback on SWAFS's operational capability, existing or planned near-term additional satellite and ground station space weather data sources, and existing and planned near-term models and science-based algorithms that have reached appropriate levels of technical validation. 

Spiral 3 is currently planned to begin in FY 14 and will focus on advanced capabilities, such as the Full Physics-Global Assimilation of Ionospheric Measurements (FP-GAIM) model, to satisfy future requirements, including the development of other new models and science algorithms that do not currently exist and processing space weather data that is not currently available.


Capabilities provided:

Return to service; corrective, adaptive, and capability improvement maintenance for the operational software baseline

SWAFS accepts space weather data and uses models and/or algorithms to create and disseminate specified space weather analysis and forecast products

- For the SWAFS Spiral 2 software release, the SWAFS program will further develop the Net-Centric capability with enhance the storing capability of all data needed to support current and anticipated SWAFS data processing. In addition, this will help SWAFS to distribute net-centric data to AFWA Web Service.  Also, SWAFS will make updates to the software to ensure it can ingest new data such as RDATA and Deep Space Climate Observatory data. Finally SWAFS will investigate the feasibility of ingesting ionosphere parameter values into GAIM-FP.</r2:Text>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>To support the Air Force worldwide flying mission, this program element funds research, development and management of new air traffic control communications, surveillance, positioning, and precision approach and landing systems.  When applicable, this includes joint efforts with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and coordination with the International Civil Aviation Organization and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).  ATCALS development funding currently focuses on the Deployable Radar Approach Control (D-RAPCON) and Next Generation (NextGen) Air Transportation System (ATS) programs as described below.

Deployable Radar Approach Control (D-RAPCON). D-RAPCON will replace the 40 year old AN/MPN-14K and AN/TPN-19 Airport Surveillance Radar (ASR) and Operations Shelter (OPS) subsystems with state of the art digital systems. Modification and overhaul of the existing systems has proven to be ineffective due to diminishing manufacturing sources. On average, no more than three of the existing 17 systems are deployable at any given time.   D-RAPCON will provide aircraft surveillance/sequencing, air traffic control communications, and automation capabilities for terminal area air traffic control operations.  D-RAPCON will also be deployed with a fixed base or deployable Instrument Landing System and a fixed or mobile control tower to provide a complete air traffic control capability. The D-RAPCON will support tactical military and worldwide humanitarian operations and also provide a capability to support domestic disaster relief. The primary surveillance radar coverage (non-cooperative targets) is out to 60 nautical miles (nm) and the secondary surveillance radar coverage (cooperative targets) is out to 120 nm. The D-RAPCON CDD was approved by the Air Force Requirements Oversight Council on 8 Feb 11. FY16 funds will complete contractor test and developmental testing (DT) and perform any deficiency review work necessary. In FY16, the program office will also be preparing for the MS C decision which must be approved to enter Full Rate Production (FRP). Six certifications are required prior to FRP; Air Traffic Control Radar Beacon System, Identification Friend or Foe, Mark XII/Mark XIIA Systems Certification, National Air Space Certification, Shelter/Transportability Certification, Electro-Magnetic Spectrum certification and frequency allocation and authority to radiate approvals, Information Assurance Certification, and Accreditation and Interoperability and Supportability Certification. Related OPAF funds are in the PE 0305114F Weapon System Code 833010. 

Next Generation (NextGen) Air Transportation System (NextGen ATS). This is an interagency effort designed to enable the transition from a ground infrastructure dominated Air Traffic Management capability for the U.S. National Airspace System (NAS) to a capability that leverages advances in Performance Based Navigation (PBN), non-radar based surveillance services, and transition from solid-state analogue voice communications to networked digital voice and data exchange. Per Deputy Secretary of Defense direction (28 Dec 07 Memo), the Air Force is the DoD lead Service for NextGen ATS implementation and architecture development. NextGen ATS will be built on key elements from existing programs and technologies and on new systems under development. As these technologies and architectures mature, ground system upgrades will be coordinated and fielded concurrently with aircraft avionics capabilities that are acquired and integrated into Air Force aircraft (manned and unmanned). These efforts are a subset of the Communication, Navigation and Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) program in PE 0305099F and will involve aircraft avionics as well as fixed based and deployable air traffic control and landing systems.  FY16 efforts will continue to use the newly developed Lead Service Office (LSO) Enterprise Architecture process to develop a NextGen DoD Strategic Roadmap, Integrated Master Schedule and Command and Control Core Function Support Plan, outlining DoD and Air Force equities and required requirements documentation, via in-depth analysis of FAA Next programs and timelines.  Portfolio analysis will be captured in DoD NextGen ATS charters to guide Services through a broad and complex NextGen ATS environment. To minimize integration costs, the LSO and Joint Program Offices will also assist aircraft depots, program offices, and major commands in combining military (Mode-5 Identification Friend or Foe (IFF), Global Positioning System (GPS) Military (M)-Code) and civil avionics upgrades, including Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B), Electronic Flight Bags, DataComm and Navigation.  To support program office NextGen ATS decision making, the LSO will also develop supporting infrastructure tools, such as a CNS/ATM Global Mandates Database (GAIMS) and a DoD Avionics Equipage Repository (F-WAR).  The LSO is also developing a Decision Support Tool to serve as a one-stop website for DoD NextGen ATS, containing all plans and material.  Further proof of concept demonstrations and analysis will also be undertaken to explore transportable and fixed-base Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) Ground Based Sense and Avoid (GBSAA) capability, development/test of new Instrument Procedures Development System (IPDS) software (joint effort with FAA and Services).  In total, these efforts will focus on enabling DoD aircraft to take advantage of NextGen envisioned NAS efficiencies, developing policies/procedures to avoid adverse costs while ensuring airspace access, seamlessly integrating RPAs into the NAS and other non-NAS/international airspaces, improving the display of aircraft position to air traffic controllers, determining future requirements for digital communications with manned and unmanned aircraft, and enhancing flight safety.  

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning. 

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, these budget activities include development efforts to upgrade systems currently fielded or has approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Full-scale and subscale targets assure warfighter's weapon systems will perform effectively against real-world enemy fighters and cruise missiles.  Aerial Targets provide adherence to Public Law Title 10, Section 2366 "Live Fire/Lethality" developmental/operational test requirements.  Target drones are used to validate operational missile/weapon system effectiveness and fighter Operational Flight Program (OFP) updates.  Target drones are essential for development testing/operational testing for all air-to-air and surface-to-air missiles, and for the F-22A, F-35, F-18, F-16, F-15, etc., aircraft.  The objective is to provide realistic targets for missile testing to enable the development of offensive counter-air systems (air-to-air and surface-to-air) capable of defeating changing enemy airborne threats.  This program element funds development, improvements, and updates of full-scale/subscale aerial targets and target control systems to ensure aerial targets represent enemy threat airborne systems.  Specialized target payload subsystems are developed for requirements to include but not limited to missile scoring, electronic attack, electronic countermeasures and infrared (IR) countermeasures, radar and IR signature augmentation, and chaff and flare dispensing systems.  

This program is in budget activity 7 - Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.  

The FY2016 funding request was reduced by $2.350 million to account for the availability of prior execution balances.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Full-scale aerial targets, subscale aerial targets, and companion Target Control Systems (TCS) assure the effectiveness and currency of warfighter weapon systems to combat real-world enemy fighters and cruise missiles.  The BQM-167A Air Force Subscale Aerial Target (AFSAT) is a jet-powered drone aircraft measuring approximately 20 feet long with a mission to simulate threat aircraft for testing and evaluation of surface-to-air, ship-to-air, or air-to-air missiles.  The target accomplishes this mission through the use of optional payloads including chaff and flare, electronic attack, and infrared devices.  Funding supports continued improvement of launch phase performance and overall performance enhancement efforts.  Funding supports development, improvements, and updates of target control systems and specialized target payload subsystems for requirements to include but not limited to missile scoring, electronic attack and infrared (IR) countermeasures, radar and IR signature augmentation, and chaff and flare dispensing systems. Electronic Attack (EA) pod upgrade provides new techniques and capabilities critical to subscales to realistically emulate foreign threat systems.  TCS provides a myriad of sub-systems that together delivers the capability to control and track mission aerial targets (full scale and subscale) and to track a mix of other critical mission participants (to include relay platforms, shooters, and the missile system under test).  In this role, TCS ensures an optimum integrated aerial target environment that enhances both weapon system assessments and companion aircrew skills, all the while assuring the full safety of mission participants throughout the conduct and fulfillment of T&amp;E objectives.  Funding supports continued improvement (modernization) of TCS capabilities to effectively meet the multi-service T&amp;E demands of current and future warfighter weapon systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Full-scale targets assure warfighters weapon systems perform effectively against real-world enemy fighters and cruise missiles.  Aerial Targets support adherence to Public Law Title 10, Section 2366, which requires major systems and munitions programs to conduct survivability and lethality testing before full-rate production.  The Aerial Targets program provides drones to satisfy "Live Fire/Lethality" developmental/operational test requirements.  Target drones are used to validate operational missile/weapon system effectiveness and fighter operational flight program (OFP) updates.  Target drones are required for developmental/operational testing for all air-to-air and surface-to-air missiles, and for the F-22A, F-35, F-18, F-16, F-15, etc., aircraft.   The United States Air Force's (USAF) Air Superiority Modernization/Mission Area Plan has identified aerial targets as a capability shortfall; the QF-16 program will fulfill this requirement.  Funding supports continued development of the follow-on full-scale aerial target (QF-16) and simulators, development, improvements, and updates of target control systems and specialized target payload subsystems for requirements such as: missile scoring, electronic attack and infrared (IR) countermeasures, radar and IR signature augmentation, and chaff and flare dispensing systems.  Electronic Attack (EA) pod upgrade provides new techniques and capabilities critical to QF-16s to realistically emulate foreign threat systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

AFOSI's mission includes investigating criminal  matters affecting AF personnel, contract fraud and economic crimes involving AF weapons systems and spare parts, the investigation of environmental crime, counterdrugs, computer intrusion detection and forensic media analysis of computer crimes. This element supports Technical Surveillance Countermeasures (TSCM), Computer Crime Investigations (CCI), and technical support to criminal and counterintelligence investigations and operations conducted by AFOSI. AFOSI's TSCM mission conducts counterintelligence investigations for both AF and DoD facilities and programs in order to deter and detect technical surveillance operations conducted by Foreign Intelligence Services to compromise classified or sensitive information.   The purpose of CCI research is to improve AF and DoD Information Operations capability by enhancing AFOSI's ability to deter or prevent spies, hackers, or saboteurs from manipulating, damaging, or stealing sensitive war fighting data or systems.  Failing that, to investigate, identify, and prosecute those who do.  While most research to meet operational requirements is Operational System Development, there is also research in the category of Engineering and Manufacturing Development due to a need for modifications to present technology.  The equipment required to provide technical support to investigations is unique and complex. This equipment must be continually updated to provide state-of-the-art capabilities to detect and neutralize criminal activities targeted against the AF and DoD. In an era of advancing technology, reduced manning, and increasingly high level fraud, environmental crime and computer crime investigations, technical investigative equipment must be continuously updated to enable AFOSI special agents to have the most cost effective and best possible means of thwarting criminal acts. The evolution of a new wave of computer crimes has made AFOSI responsible for the collection, investigative analysis, national level law enforcement coordination, and dissemination of hacker activity and intrusion incidents for the Air Force. AFOSI's computer crime equipment must stay on the leading edge of technology to collect criminal information as well as pursue and apprehend criminals through a global medium. AFOSI must continually update its existing high tech computer surveillance equipment to support ongoing and future investigative operations to identify hackers and hacker groups, as well as potential hostile government activities targeting Air Force communication and control systems.    Critical Infrastructure Protection identifies weaknesses in the Air Force Critical infrastructure, highlights critical countermeasures and acquires and deploys cost-effective solutions.  The intent is to provide an Air Force-wide review of current infrastructure vulnerabilities; prioritize AF protection planning and integrate with existing programs; identify gaps based on AF needs; direct studies to refine AF requirements.     

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Market Research is accomplished jointly within the DoD, Counterintelligence, and Law Enforcement communities with the various government laboratories and major defense contractors to identify locations with the ability to develop investigative tools unique to our mission needs.  These technologies, capabilities, and limitations of current and future investigative tools is sometimes highly sensitive or classified.  Market Research also allows inter-agency coordination and deconfliction to occur, reducing or eliminating duplicitous development efforts. Annually, stakeholders meet to discuss initiatives, challenges and organizational goals to coordinate or consolidate requirements to increase efficiency.  Once Market Research and any applicable coordination/deconfliction is completed, acquisition channels are analyzed and selected based on the ability to meet operational and technical security requirements.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This budget line funds the Strategic Stability and CWMD Policy Division (AF/A10-S) Mission which develops future national security strategy concepts including those involving space systems, nuclear weapons and other strategic and high consequence capabilities. Directs, integrates and synchronizes advances in USAF capability to counter Weapons of Mass Destruction. Focal point for USAF arms control policy, implementation and compliance with international treaties and agreements, diplomatic clearances and airspace/aircraft sovereignty issues. Defines and defends the USAF role in ballistic missile defense. Represents USAF in international, interagency, DoD, Joint, inter-Service, COCOM and MAJCOM forums and implementation groups on matters involving national security policy and strategy.

Open Skies Sensors - This budget line funds upgrades to the sensors aboard the OC-135B Open Skies aircraft used for the Treaty on Open Skies observation flights.  The Open Skies Treaty allows signatories to conduct observation flights over each other's territory using fixed-wing, unarmed observation aircraft. Mission equipment on the OC-135B includes wet film optical framing and panoramic cameras. Open Skies Sensors program addresses the requirements in the Presidential Policy Directive-15 (PPD-15), which states," The United States shall begin budgeting no later than FY14 to upgrade the sensors on the current aircraft by replacing film-based cameras with available electro-optical sensors. (U)" Additionally, current cameras are nearly obsolete, unreliable, hard and increasingly expensive to maintain, and repair parts must be individually manufactured.  In addition, the web film manufacturers are discontinuing production of the film stock.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The OC-135B aircraft supports the implementation of the United States Government (USG) Open Skies Treaty. This program addresses the requirements in the Presidential Policy Directive-15 (PPD-15).  The Open Skies Treaty allows signatories to conduct observation flights over each other's territory using fixed-wing, unarmed observation aircraft. The aircraft can use optical cameras, video cameras, sideways-looking synthetic aperture radar, and infrared line scanning devices.  There are 34 participating states to the Open Skies Treaty.  The Air Force is required to allow over flight of USAF bases per multilateral request; to acquire, operate, and maintain the aircraft and equipment utilized during over flights of partner countries; to provide required sensor media and initial media processing; and to provide airfield servicing, logistics, and maintenance for foreign over flights of the US.

Open Skies Sensors - Mission equipment on the OC-135B includes wet film optical framing and panoramic cameras.  Open Skies Sensors program addresses the requirements in the Presidential Policy Directive-15 (PPD-15), which states," The United States shall begin budgeting no later than FY14 to upgrade the sensors on the current aircraft by replacing film-based cameras with available electro-optical sensors. (U)" Additionally, current cameras are nearly obsolete, unreliable, hard and increasingly expensive to maintain, and repair parts must be individually manufactured.  In addition, the web film manufacturers are discontinuing production of the film stock. Furthermore, the ultimate imagery product customer desires digital format products. This camera replacement program will replace the wet film cameras with modern, digital cameras. Modern, digital cameras will be more reliable, maintainable and cost effective. The customer will be able to more readily use the imagery products. Equipment service life will be extended significantly.

Test articles will be procured for the purpose of developmental testing and to support Treaty certification of the sensors.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Research and Development Space and Missile Operations (RDSMO) program, executed by the Advanced Systems and Development Directorate at Kirtland AFB, NM, conducts space and missile Research and Developmental Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) and Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) in support of experimental, demonstration, and operational satellites.  The program develops, acquires, and operates satellite command and control (C2) and fixed/deployable telemetry, tracking, and commanding (TT&amp;C) antenna systems in support of AF and DoD missions.  The RDSMO program is responsible for the design, development, integration, testing, sustainment, and operations of the Multi-Mission Satellite Operations Center (MMSOC) C2 systems installed in the RDT&amp;E Support Complex (RSC) at Kirtland AFB, NM and at the Satellite Operations Center 11 (SOC 11) located at Schriever AFB, CO.  

FY16 funds include incremental development and establishment of new capabilities for the MMSOC, systems engineering, special studies, integration and test efforts in support of demonstrations and operational architectures designed to increase operations and maintenance affordability, efficiency and resiliency for global satellite command and control through military and commercial capabilities.  

The main objective of MMSOC is to develop the capability to rapidly support R&amp;D and operational systems and to transition R&amp;D space vehicle technology with residual military utility to operational status for immediate warfighter support. MMSOC is a multiple mission operation system that uses standard software to (1) perform satellite command and control (C2) in support of launch requirements; (2) develop and test tactics, techniques, procedures and concepts to conduct satellite operations; (3) provide a satellite C2 incremental block evolution resource for RDT&amp;E of new systems and concepts; and (4) deliver operational flexibility for new and currently flying assigned satellites.    

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

The FY2016 funding request was reduced by $0.524 million to account for the availability of prior execution balances.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Located at Peterson AFB, Colorado, the Space Innovation, Integration and Rapid Technology Development program develops and modifies modeling and simulation tools that Air Force Space Command's Space Analysis Center uses for operations research, military utility analyses, tradeoff studies, and other evaluations of space mission areas to guide planning, programming, requirements generation, analyses of alternatives, and other activities.  Development activities incorporate changes in fielded and projected space operational capabilities, as well as technical improvements, into the group's software tools to ensure their data and technology remain current.  Its innovation, education, and training activities foster solutions to operational deficiencies and enhance the integration of space systems into Air Force operations, thereby enabling service and joint warfighters to realize the full potential of existing and planned space capabilities.  

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

The FY2016 funding request was reduced by -$.917M to account for the availability of prior execution balances.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Integrated Broadcast Service (IBS) fulfills the warfighter's requirements for worldwide threat warning and situational awareness information with timely production and simultaneous dissemination of Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) derived combat information. It also provides target tracking data to support threat avoidance, targeting, force protection, and situational awareness. This information is continually refined in near real time by strategic, operational and tactical sensors.

IBS is comprised of the following:
- A Common Interactive Broadcast (CIB) on UHF satellite channel using a Common Message Format (CMF) and a MIL-STD Demand Assigned Multiple Access (DAMA) compliant waveform and Line of Sight (LOS) using the Wideband Networking Waveform (WNW) and Joint Tactical Terminal (JTT). 
- IBS-Network Services (IBS-NS) includes two Global IBS Network Servers (GINS) and four Theater Interface Nodes (TINs) to support the geographic Combatant Commanders, all built to validated warfighter requirements.
-- Two GINS receive data from each theater and integrate this data into a worldwide picture available to all network/broadcast users. 
-- Four regional TINs allow local and out-of-theater users (not directly receiving IBS broadcast) to receive the CIB information broadcast.  Additionally, the TIN will receive and inject data into the CIB for producers without access to the theater CIB. 

This PE funds:
- Completion of Advanced Development for IBS-NS, providing increased throughput capabilities
- Modernization of IBS (IBS-NS, CIB, and CMF) 

This project will identify and implement an open, scalable system architecture that will accommodate growth as the virtual world grows and cyber operations change.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

The FY2016 funding request was reduced by $0.643M to account for the availability of prior execution balances.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Eastern Range at Patrick AFB/Cape Canaveral AFS, FL and the Western Range at Vandenberg AFB, CA make up the Spacelift Range System (SLRS), also known as the Launch and Test Range System (LTRS). The SLRS provides the capability to track and destroy an errant rocket in flight to protect the public, which enables national security, civil, and commercial spacelift operations to be conducted safely. SLRS is also a test range, supporting intercontinental and sea-launched ballistic missile test launches, national missile defense tests, and aeronautical tests.

SLRS is comprised of twelve subsystems (2000 assets) that together provide this capability to the ranges. The Range Safety and Command Destruct subsystems provide the capability to destroy an errant rocket, if necessary. These subsystems rely on the Telemetry, Radar, and Optics subsystems to provide tracking data to the Mission Flight Control Officer (MFCO), who is certified to determine if a rocket in flight is on course. The Weather and Surveillance subsystems provide the MFCO information about the surroundings to determine if conditions are safe for launch. The Communications, Data Handling, and Timing &amp; Sequencing subsystems ensure critical data is expeditiously routed from remote sensors (e.g. radars, optics, etc.) to the MFCO. Finally, the Planning and Scheduling subsystem ensures all assets are available when needed for a launch or test operation. Because aging range systems are exhibiting decreasing reliability, leading to higher operations and maintenance costs and increasing the risk of launch delays, the Air Force requires RDT&amp;E funds to conduct architecture analyses to optimize investment planning.

BA 7 - This program activity is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production fudning in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

The FY2016 funding request was reduced by $2.164 million to account for the availability of prior execution balances.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Due to the fielded LTRS age and obsolescence issues, many systems need to be replaced (e.g. communications systems at ER &amp; WR). These major modifications will be competed, typically among small business contractors, and selected through best value source selections. The competitively-selected SE&amp;I contractor will manage government-controlled requirements and processes as well as provide support to the "government as the integrator" between LISC and separately competed modernization projects. FFRDC provides mission assurance oversight to ensure capabilities meet operational need.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>In the 2013 PB, the Air Force decided to retain the U-2 weapon system instead of retiring it.  At that time sustainment efforts and capability upgrades to the platform and sensors were pursued to support National and Combatant Commander requirements.
 
In the 2015 PB, the Air Force decided to retire the U-2 in 2016.  In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2244a, the U-2 weapon system is identified as Equipment Scheduled For Retirement Or Disposal: Limitation On Expenditures For Modifications, stating that modification to any aircraft (i.e., a given tail number, weapon, or item of equipment that the SECAF plans to retire or otherwise dispose of within 5 years after the date on which the modification would be completed) are prohibited.
  
In the 2016 PB, the Air Force re-phases U-2 divestiture to begin in FY2019 and to complete no later than FY2020.  In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2244a, the Secretary of the Air Force may waive the prohibition on modifications if the Secretary determines that carrying out the modification is in the national security interest of the United States. Therefore, modifications required to address sustainment issues (diminishing manufacturing sources, vanishing vendor items) or operational utility may be submitted to the Secretary for approval to ensure operational effectiveness and to comply with guidance received in previous and current NDAAs for the timeframe of phased divestiture.
  
The U-2 Program will continue to address reliability, maintainability, sustainability, and safety issues and support U-2 integration of payloads and capabilities by taking prudent acquisition actions to meet operational requirements, comply with previous NDAA guidance, and IAW 10 U.S.C.  Prudent acquisition activities also include trade studies, analyses, preliminary systems engineering, system and subsystem level testing in accordance with DoD and military standards, and specification development in support of both current program planning and execution as well as studies supporting analysis and investment in future U-2 program planning.
This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY 2015, 675372, Integrated Sensor IS Structure, was completed.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This PE focuses USAF efforts on long endurance platforms that provide days or months of endurance and their associated sensors and communications suites.  Efforts include, but are not limited to, optionally piloted airships, Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPAs), or more standard aircraft platforms flown as manned or unmanned. 

The Integrated Sensor Is Structure (ISIS) project intended to develop a radar that is fully integrated into a station-keeping, stratospheric airship. ISIS intended to support the nation's need for persistent wide-area surveillance, tracking, and engagement of time-critical air and ground targets. Automated surveillance and tracking included air targets to the radar horizon of 600 km and all ground targets to a range of 300 km. The radar aperture intended to provide track data directly to users in-theater.  After program restructure, the effort was reduced to radar and airship material risk reductions.   The program efforts complete in FY 2015. 

The Medium Altitude Global ISR and Communications (MAGIC) project is developing a multiple-day, medium altitude ISR unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to provide long endurance surveillance with a multiple sensor payload.  This concept was initiated by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) as a Joint Capabilities Technology Demonstration (JCTD) in the 3rd Quarter FY 2010 with a competition between five defense industry partners.  Aurora Flight Sciences' Orion Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) concept was chosen as the JCTD candidate by OSD/Director of Defense, Research and Engineering (DDR&amp;E) per the recommendation of the Combatant Commands (COCOMs).  The MAGIC/Orion RPA initiative was subsequently released from the JCTD process and transitioned to the Air Force as the sponsor of this developmental initiative in the 3rd Quarter FY 2011.  Aurora completed the first flight test series from 24 August to 16 November 2013 (5 sorties, 10.4 hours) and the second flight test series from 1 June to 7 August 2014 (8 sorties, 35.9 hours).  A third flight test series is underway and has accomplished a maximum sortie duration of 80.0 hours.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The radar aperture also intended to provide track data directly to users in-theater.  The objective system was planned to launch from CONUS locations with a multi-year operational life.  

DARPA funded development of the prototype in FY09-12. Air Force contributed funding from FY10-FY14 to this joint DARPA/Air Force project. This project included completion of the designs for the radar, propulsion, power systems, and the airframe, but was focused on demonstrating the ability to manufacture and demonstrate performance objectives of the radar and material objectives of the airship. The radar element and airship materials demonstrations will be completed in FY2015, using prior year funding.

Funds also covered studies and analysis to support current program planning and execution and future program planning.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Medium Altitude Global ISR and Communications (MAGIC) project is an Air Force led technology and concept development to demonstrate the ability for a Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) to stay aloft in the medium altitude structure for a multiple day duration mission with a minimum of 1,000 pounds payload capacity of intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance sensor systems.  The MAGIC concept was initiated by OSD/DDR&amp;E in FY 2010 in response to the COCOMs ranking this type of initiative as the highest priority for a Joint Concept and Technology Demonstration (JCTD).   In FY 2011, the Air Force accepted this initiative as the sponsor and MAGIC was subsequently removed from consideration as a JCTD and transitioned into the Air Force as a developmental project.  

Persistent ISR supports both regular and irregular warfare.  The MAGIC project will provide the USAF with critically needed data regarding sensor and aircraft performance parameters at a multiple day duration at medium altitude flight.  The objectives laid out in the JCTD competition and selection of Aurora Flight Sciences' Orion RPA is being honored by the Air Force.  

In FY 2010, OSD/DDR&amp;E (now ASD/R&amp;E) provided $5M of initial funding to AFRL to initiate the MAGIC project.  In FY 2011, ASD/R&amp;E provided an additional $5M to keep the MAGIC project development moving forward.  The Air Force followed suit and provided $10M of FY 2011 Below Threshold Reprogramming (BTR) to allow the Aurora Flight Sciences' Orion RPA development team to set up an operational endurance engine bench test and software integrations lab in preparation for a future long duration flight demonstration of the Orion RPA.  Congressional Adds of $19M in FY 2012 and $50M in FY 2013 provided the Endurance UAV program manager with the funding needed for the continuation of the Orion RPA development and initiation of the three phase flight testing series.     

In January 2012, Aurora Flight Sciences (AFS) at their Manassas, VA headquarters facility initiated their testing profile by performing a 123 hour duration endurance engine bench test.  Flight Test Series #1 (FT1, Basic  Performance) was accomplished with five flights totaling 10.4 flight hours between 24 August and 16 November 2013.  Basic automated take-off and landing procedures plus basic flight maneuvers were the test objectives for FT1.  FT2, Envelope Expansion, was accomplished with eight flights totaling 35.9 flight hours between 1 June and 7 August 2014.  Operating at increasingly highter altitudes and varying airspeeds to collect fuel flow data in determining best endurance airspeed, increasingly heavier take-off gross weights and landing energies plus continuing inflight maneuvers were the test objectives of FT2.  FT3, Payload Integration, began in November 2014 and is projected to complete in March 2015.  The objective of FT3 operates increasingly longer durations with nominal payloads representative of operational requirements and will prove the concept of multiple day endurance.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The MAGIC project is being executed by the 645 AESG (BIG SAFARI SPO) to develop a COCOM requested long endurance remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) to address urgent and emerging operational needs for long dwell, persistent ISR requirements.  The acquisition strategy for the Air Force to develop a long endurance, persistent ISR capability for the COCOMs was an outgrowth of a Joint Capabilities Technology Demonstration (JCTD) started in FY 2010.  Efforts concerning this initiative, contracted with Aurora Flight Sciences and their Orion RPA, include:  completion of studies analysis, development of a prototype air vehicle, bench testing of engines and other aircraft components, ground continuity testing of select avionics, flight controls, and engine components, slow and high speed ground taxiing and a full flight series testing of the Orion RPA capabilities with a culmination of a long duration flight demonstration.  Concurrent efforts will continue in FY 2015 between the Aurora Flight Sciences production and management teams and the BIG SAFARI SPO to identify best of breed sensor systems and the availability of government furnished equipment (GFE) to fulfill the proposed payload configurations and continue hardware and software development and integration to meet operational airworthiness standards and mission requirements.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY 2016, PE 0305220F, RQ-4, Project 675148, Common Airborne Sense and Avoid (C-ABSAA), efforts transferred to PE 0305206F, Airborne Reconnaissance Systems, Project 675148, Common Airborne Sense and Avoid (C-ABSAA), in order to provide greater visibility into this capability and prepare for expanded applications.

In FY 2016, PE 0305208F, Distributed Common Ground Station (DCGS), Project 676025, Data Compression, efforts transferred to PE 0305206F, Airborne Reconnaissance Systems, Project 676025, Data Compression, in order to provide greater visibility into this capability.

In FY 2015, Project 676031, the Dismount Detection Radar effort, was completed.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Airborne Reconnaissance Systems (ARS) program coordinates the development of advanced technologies (sensors, data links, targeting networks and products, and quick reaction capabilities) in support of multiple airborne reconnaissance platforms, both manned and unmanned.  Its objectives are to develop, demonstrate, and rapidly transition advanced, interoperable, multi-platform solutions to reduce the find, fix, target, and track kill chain timeline, and to provide safe separation and collision avoidance for Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPAs).  It provides for modeling/simulation, training and systems engineering.  This program also coordinates the development of common collection, processing, and dissemination solutions for near-real time Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR). 

Funds in any project can also cover activities to include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

The FY2016 funding request was reduced by $0.983 million to account for the availability of prior execution balances.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The purpose of the Imaging and Targeting Support (I&amp;TS) program is to develop and demonstrate next-generation, persistent, wide area surveillance, aircraft avoidance, and common imagery reconnaissance sensor capabilities (radar and electro-optical systems), including sensor data processing, for multiple airborne platforms, as well as sensor products to aid in rapid targeting (geolocation models, sensor-based exploitation tools, sensor networking capabilities).

Developmental efforts pursued are: improved sensor capabilities such as hyperspectral imagery (HSI), measurement and signature intelligence (MASINT), polarimetric imaging, ground moving target indication(GMTI), foliage penetration (FOPEN), and additional radar, electro-optical, and other modalities; increased geolocation accuracy; increased dismount detection capability; advanced sensor data correlation; automated target detection; network centric warfare; and other Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) and associated Tasking, Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (TPED) capabilities. These efforts are intended to reduce both target search and kill chain timelines as well as supporting traditional intelligence activities. This project will also increase interoperability among developed systems by developing common standards and tools.

The funds in this project, less Congressional adds and Quick Reaction Capabilities (QRCs), are distributed in priority order for the goal of building a comprehensive Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) capability for the USAF. On an annual basis, developmental technologies are reviewed against warfighter capabilities and requirements based on strategic roadmaps. Projects advancing the technological maturity of promising sensors and processing capabilities are reviewed and prioritized into a recommended list for senior executive direction to implement in the coming year.

Traditional focus areas include, but are not limited to: development and demonstration of common radar and electro-optical sensors (Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), Low Frequency SAR, and antenna, Electo-Optical(EO), Infrared (IR), HSI, Low Light, Laser Radar (LADAR), Light Detection And Ranging (LIDAR) and their operational modes (High Resolution Imagery, Ground and Dismount Moving Target Indication(GMTI/DMTI), Persistent Surveillance, Wide Area Motion Imagery (WAMI), Spectral Identification) for multiple airborne platforms, including medium and high altitude platforms; development and demonstration of advanced tactical sensor and associated TPED processing algorithms and tools (automatic registration, automatic and assisted target detection, network centric warfare). Development of integrated multi-sensor capabilities to detect and identify obscured targets (OT); development and implementation of imagery standards (Common Ground/Dismount Moving Target Indicator (GMTI/DMTI), National Imagery Transmission Format (NITF); and monitoring and enhancement of Imagery Intelligence (IMINT) product quality (radar and EO/IR imagery, GMTI data, and spectral information) and timeliness throughout the image chain (from sensor to user). These efforts focus on reducing the find, fix and track elements of the time critical targeting kill-chain timeline while improving operator and decision-maker efficiency and effectiveness.

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Joint Technology Center/Systems Integration Laboratory (JTC/SIL) is a center of technical excellence to support Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) and Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) programs within the services.  The mission includes Service-specific and Joint Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) programs throughout DoD. The JTC/SIL provides a Government testbed for interoperability, rapid prototyping, technology insertion and transition, systems engineering, modeling/simulation, training and C4ISR optimization. The cornerstone of JTC/SIL's diverse tool set is the Multiple Unified Simulation Environment (MUSE), which is the DoD simulation/training system of choice for many UAS, RPA and ISR systems. The MUSE is also known as the Air Force Synthetic Environment for Reconnaissance and Surveillance (AFSERS) in its Air Force application.  The MUSE/AFSERS simulates Air Vehicles, Sensors, Datalinks, Takeoff and Landing Systems, and to some degree, surrogate UAS and RPA ground stations, when actual ground stations are unavailable. 

The Services and combatant commanders have a requirement for the capability to train with a system that provides a real-time simulation environment containing multiple intelligence systems that can be integrated with larger force-on-force simulations. The MUSE creates a realistic operational environment which supports the ability to assess military utility, architecture and concept of employment development, and Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP) refinement, conduct emerging concepts experimentation, and optimize C4ISR within warfighting exercises and experiments. It is the preferred simulation system used by the combatant commanders and Joint Services to support command and battle staff C4ISR training.

The MUSE/AFSERS also creates a realistic operational environment that supports: an embedded training capability for multiple Program Managers; tools to minimize acquisition and life cycle cost and schedule impacts; ability to conduct emerging concepts experimentation, future systems exploration, systems integration, and technology insertion; applications for Joint and Service-specific warfighting exercises; and C4ISR optimization.

MUSE/AFSERS is currently in use within all Services and most unified commands simulating MQ-1, MQ-9, RQ-4, MQ-1C, M/RQ-5, RQ-7, national and commercial satellite collectors, P-3, E-8, and the U-2. During warfighting exercises, the JTC/SIL integrates imagery simulations with associated C4ISR systems to support the execution of critical imagery processes. For those assets normally not available for training, the JTC/SIL provides surrogate systems and interfaces. Distributed training environments, virtually linking participants from various locations worldwide, are routinely supported within the MUSE architecture. The MUSE/AFSERS is also used as a mission rehearsal tool for current, on-going military combat operations.

The JTC/SIL supports the OSD UAS Task Force staff and the Standards and Interoperability Integrated Product Team, as well as the joint team working the Ground Segment Interface. The JTC/SIL is the primary custodian of this interface and in that role performs various supporting tasks including development of tools for helping the definition and execution of open architecture for joint service ground control systems, developing and maintaining standardization agreement (STANAG) 45 joint interoperability tasks to be defined on an annual basis.  

Activities also include studies and analysis supporting current and future program planning and project execution.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>C-ABSAA is an analysis and developmental effort in the pre-Material Development Decision phase of the acquisition lifecycle which supports emerging warfighter requirements to fully integrate Group 4-5 RPA into the National Airspace System (NAS), international airspace, other nations' sovereign airspace, and operational combat airspace to conduct the entire range of military operations across all mission environments.  C-ABSAA also supports the "Worldwide Operations" Key Performance Parameter (KPP) in larger Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) requirement documents, and Public Law 112-239 directing DoD collaboration with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the National Air and Space Administration (NASA) to safely integrate RPA in the NAS.  Funding in this project supports the development of a Sense and Avoid (SAA) capability set for Group 4-5 RPA and covers analysis, research, and developmental activities as well as infrastructure and other government costs.  Ongoing activities include support to the development of warfighter requirements and analysis of possible solution alternatives, the collaboration with the FAA, NASA, and Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) to develop national policy and standards, and SAA related studies, analysis, modeling and simulation, program planning and project execution.  RPA platform specific integration and testing is not included.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>C-ABSAA will integrate Better Buying Power 3.0 initiatives throughout its acquisition lifecycle and rely upon acquisition of government data rights to maximize contractor competition from Technology Development through Production. The program uses an incremental acquisition strategy to provide the warfighter with SAA capability for Group 4-5 RPA with increased, time-phased capability improvements as technology and risks achieve satisfactory levels. Group 4-5 RPA platforms will be expected to integrate the C-ABSAA provided capability into their unique systems via retrofit or in production.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Gorgon Stare provides city-sized wide area airborne surveillance for Combatant Commanders and is managed by the 645th Aeronautical Systems Group, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance and Special Operations Forces (ISR&amp;SOF) Directorate.  The Gorgon Stare system provides a podded wide area airborne sensor suite integrated on specially-modified MQ-9 Reaper Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA).  The Air Force Requirements Oversight Council (AFROC) approved Air Combat Command's recommendation to transition Gorgon Stare from a Quick Reaction Capability to an Air Force Enduring Capability in November 2014. Gorgon Stare's requirements are documented in the Gorgon Stare Wide Area Airborne Sensor Capabilities Production Document (draft).  The acquisition strategy for this Air Force podded sensor suite solution is sustainment of the currently fielded capabilities with any upgrades implemented via validated -1067s or Urgent Operational Needs.  Provisions to consider pre-planned product improvements (P3I) and/or multi-INT enhanced capabilities to address evolving and emerging technology advancements are within the scope of the acquisition strategy.

Development efforts conducted with FY14 Congressionally added RDT&amp;E funds include software integration lab testing of Near Vertical Direction Finding (NVDF) with Gorgon Stare Inc 2 Wide Area Motion Imagery (WAMI) sensors.  Funds spent on NVDF will provide a ramp for future airborne integration efforts as required.  RDT&amp;E efforts conducted with FY15 Congressionally added funds include development efforts focused on adaptive compression and processing to enable more efficient and timely reachback.

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution as well as future program planning.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Hyperspectral Sensors project develops Hyperspectral Imagery (HSI) sensors and capabilities for MQ-1 Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) and other manned or unmanned aircraft.  Within this project, the Airborne Cueing &amp; Exploitation System-Hyperspectral (ACES HY) program helps to fulfill a portion of the sponsoring combatant command and Central Command's current HSI requirements. The ACES HY program developed sensors for the MQ-1B Predator Block 15 and included development of the required training, maintenance and fielding plans to support a working architecture. 

Activities within this project also include studies and analysis supporting current and future program planning and tech development for advanced HSI sensors and capabilities, including high altitude HSI sensor developments per the HSI strategic roadmap.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Dismount Detection Radar (DDR) project designed, developed, integrated, and tested Ground Moving Target Indicator/Dismount Moving Target Indicator (GMTI/DMTI) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) capability for improved dismount and moving target detection, identification, tracking, and classification. DDR advanced Open Systems Architecture (OSA) in the area of sensors and mission systems.   The DDR program also studied, developed, tested, and implemented new concepts, hardware and software capabilities that can be leveraged by the OSA design in the radar and associated TPED for GMTI, and various technical analysis/studies to support future advanced radar development. 

Activities also included studies, analysis, and technology development, maturation, and demonstration to support current and future program planning and execution.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The acquisition strategy for Dismount Detection Radar (DDR) included a competitive source selection that began in 1QFY12 and was awarded in February 2012.  After a ~100 day protest, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) denied all protest allegations allowing the Prime Contractor, Raytheon, to begin the design and development of the radar system in June 2012.  The radar design included an OSA approach, which will be demonstrated when MIT/LL develops and integrates an advanced mode into the radar system.  Program completed demonstration activities in FY14, and completed remaining closeout activities in FY15.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The RC-135 operational systems development and enhancement activities support the design studies, engineering analysis, non-recurring engineering, and other efforts associated with the integration and modification of the RC-135 programs and their specialized mission systems, both air and ground.  Extensive utilization of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) based solutions allows rapid fielding of needed capabilities through continuous technology refresh cycles and Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS)/Vanishing Vendor Items (VVI) logistics mitigation efforts.  The results of these efforts provide for preliminary assessments of technical feasibility, operability, or military utility as well as specific engineering implementations for integration into the various systems baseline configurations.  

These activities are managed by the Air Force through the 645th Aeronautical System Group (645 AESG).  The SPO manages engineering, ground and support systems modifications, integration, flight testing, product assurance, acceptance testing, logistics, and training activities.  

Aircraft, sensor systems, and associated ground support system engineering planned for FY 2016 include support for the RC-135V/W RIVET JOINT Baseline 12 and 13, the RC-135U COMBAT SENT Baseline 5, and the RC-135S COBRA BALL Baseline 5 configurations.  The world-wide challenge of keeping pace against technologically agile targets used by both nation and non-nation-state adversaries and the rapid evolution of COTS technologies demands a responsive and adaptive acquisition strategy for fielding baseline capabilities that are logistically supportable at all locations.  BIG SAFARI uses an incremental baseline strategy to mitigate risk, find affordable solutions and field needed capabilities on the aircraft and ground support and training systems.  Obsolescence and DMS/VVI logistical concerns are addressed with each baseline upgrade strategy and annually as part of the fleet sustainment responsibilities.  

RIVET JOINT Baseline 12 upgrades consist of, but are not limited to, increased digital signal exploitation, increased digital signal recorder bandwidth, enhanced spatial processing/exploitation, enhanced weather radar, digitally enhanced electronic flight instrument system (EFIS), AF-DCGS interoperability, operator work station 3-D map projection, enhanced operator reporting management tools, modernized communications security (COMSEC) protocols, and a new steerable beam antenna.  RIVET JOINT Baseline 13 upgrades consist of, but are not limited to, providing a continuous recording capability, Super Wideband Compressive Receiver (SWCR) and Nyquist Folding Receiver (NYFR), global air traffic management (GATM) avionics upgrades (e.g. new autopilot), Mode 5 identify friendly or foe (IFF) system, and family of beyond-line-of-sight terminals (FAB-T) advanced extremely high frequency (AEHF) communications suite. 

COMBAT SENT Baseline 5 upgrades consist of, but are not limited to, continued Communications, Navigation and Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) and Required Navigational Performance (RNP) compliant cockpit avionics enhancements, active ranging and theater networked geo-location (TNG) capability, Proforma search and classification tools, cooling duct and lighting improvements, CORVUS related precision electronic intelligence (ELINT) SWCR enhancements, RJ Baseline 13 communications intelligence (COMINT), upgraded computer architecture, primary sensor measurement system (PRISMS), wideband global satellite (WGS) communications enhanced integration, development of an airborne tracking system, and communications upgrade to include Multifunctional Information Distribution System Joint Tactical Radio System (MIDS-J).

COBRA BALL Baseline 5 upgrades consist of, but are not limited to, RJ Baseline 11 COMINT, Medium-Wave Infra-Red Acquisition (MIRA) sensor/processor upgrade, measurements and signature intelligence (MASINT) Collection System (MCS) optical upgrade, WGS communications enhanced integration, communications upgrades to include MIDS-J and an intercom system (FORCE), U-Band antenna, continued CNS/ATM and RNP compliant cockpit avionics enhancements and foreign instrumentation intelligence (FISINT) system refresh.         

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.  

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational Systems Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production fielding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The RC-135 RIVET JOINT, COBRA BALL, and COMBAT SENT configured aircraft are maintained and kept technologically relevant through a baseline or incremental upgrade acquisition strategy.  Technology refresh and quick reaction capability (QRC) developments are acquired through the 645th AESG in accordance with the BIG SAFARI Program Management Directive (PMD) and Class Justification and Approval (J&amp;A) document for acquisition of supplies and services using an "other than full and open competition" criteria.  The supplies and services procured by 645 AESG satisfy National Security requirements (FAR 6.302-6) through the use of their standing J&amp;A or address Unusual and Compelling Urgency requirements (FAR 6.302-2) through an individually prepared J&amp;A supported by the BIG SAFARI Life Cycle Management Plan (LCMP) across the full spectrum of system life cycle management from developmental engineering to system retirement ("cradle to grave") support.  Due to the rapidly changing threat environment encountered during our prolonged commitment to Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO), the acquisition program manager has the authority to redirect funding as necessary to meet current stated and emerging Combatant Commander (COCOM) and/or Intelligence Community (IC) requirements.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY 2016,PE 0305208F, Project 676025, Data Compression, will be transferred to PE 0305206F,the Airborne Reconnaissance System Program to better align the program with like RDT&amp;E efforts.

The FY2016 funding request was reduced by $1.918 million to account for the availability of prior execution balances.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>AF Distributed Common Ground Systems (DCGS) is a network-centric weapon system capable of tasking Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) sensors and receiving, and providing the Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (PED) capability for data, information and intelligence from airborne, national, and commercial platforms and sensors. The weapon system consists of numerous active duty, Air National Guard, and mission partner sites interconnected by a robust communications infrastructure that allows collaborative reach-back operations.  Operators correlate collected Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT), Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), and Measurement and Signature Intelligence (MASINT) data to provide decision-quality information to the Joint Task Force (JTF) and below, including significant support to time-critical targeting. AF DCGS is the primary PED capability for the U-2, Global Hawk, Predator, Reaper and Project Liberty (through 2015).

AF DCGS is modernizing through sustainment by integrating the necessary technologies and tools to provide increased capabilities and meet emerging and urgent operational needs.  These efforts will also integrate commercial and government furnished equipment upgrades to provide current technologies and achieve necessary application services.  The next series of upgrades will meet the operational need to integrate new and/or improved sensor capabilities.  They will also enhance interoperability by migrating to a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)and improving data sharing ability per DoD direction.

The DCGS Data Compression effort provides the warfighter a capability to efficiently compress and decompress airborne ISR sensor data and transmit near real-time to tactical users through current and future bandwidth limited commercial satellite communications (SATCOM) or military SATCOM.  The effort will develop, test and implement new sensor data compression and decompression algorithms for current and emerging airborne ISR sensors.  Additionally, the program develops compression and decompression capabilities for manned and unmanned airborne platforms, associated ground stations, and DCGS.   Outputs will meet standard certification for use within the DoD GEOINT and MASINT architectures.

Activities include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>AF Distributed Common Ground Systems (DCGS) is a network-centric weapon system capable of tasking Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) sensors and receiving and providing the Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (PED) capability for data, information and intelligence from airborne, national, and commercial platforms and sensors. The weapon system consists of numerous active duty, Air National Guard, and mission partner sites interconnected by a robust communications infrastructure that allows collaborative reach-back operations.  Operators correlate collected Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT), Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), and Measurement and Signature Intelligence (MASINT) data to provide decision-quality information to the Joint Task Force (JTF) and below, including significant support to time-critical targeting. AF DCGS is the primary PED capability for the U-2, Global Hawk, Predator, Reaper and Project Liberty (through 2015).

AF DCGS is modernizing through sustainment by integrating the necessary technologies and tools to provide increased capabilities and meet emerging and urgent operational needs.  These efforts will also integrate commercial and government furnished equipment upgrades to provide current technologies and achieve necessary application services.  The next series of upgrades will meet the operational need to integrate new and/or improved sensor capabilities.  They will also enhance interoperability by migrating to a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and improving data sharing ability per DoD direction.

Program actions are categorized by four distinct efforts. The GEOINT effort provides the capability for Planning, Collecting, Processing, Analysis and Dissemination (PCPAD) of imagery intelligence.  The Systems Release effort provides this capability for SIGINT. The Data Links effort provides Line-of-Site (LOS) and Satellite Communications (SATCOM) capabilities that allow AF DCGS to send and receive information between airborne Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) assets and the AF DCGS weapon system. The Network Communications effort involves modernizing AF DCGS infrastructure to improve data ingest, transfer, and storage capabilities while migrating the network toward a cloud architecture.
 
AF DCGS also participates in the development, testing, and implementation of international standards (to include NATO standardization agreements) to ensure joint, allied, and coalition interoperability.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>In FY 2016, PE 0305208F, Project 676025, Data Compression, will be transferred to PE 0305206F,the Airborne Reconnaissance System Program to better align the program with like RDT&amp;E efforts.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This initiative will provide the warfighter a capability to efficiently compress and decompress airborne ISR sensor data and transmit near real-time to tactical users through current and future bandwidth limited commercial SATCOM or military SATCOM.  The effort will develop, test and implement new sensor data compression and decompression algorithms for current and emerging airborne ISR sensors.  Additionally, the program develops compression and decompression for manned and unmanned airborne platforms, associated ground stations, data storage and the DCGS.  The effort includes life-cycle sustainment of airborne hardware &amp; software including updates and integration support.  Algorithms will be suitable for service-wide use within the DoD GEOINT and MASINT architectures as part of ISR enterprise standards.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Title>Data Compression</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The program began developing and testing compression and decompression algorithms for airborne ISR sensor data.  The program will eventually build, integrate and test sensor specific hardware (with the algorithms embedded) for onboard data compression.  The effort initially focused on compression and decompression of complex and detected Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data followed by applications of compression technologies to other DoD IMINT/MASINT sensor data (Spectral, Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR), Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR), Phase History SAR) and ground architecture.  Algorithms will be suitable for service-wide use as part of ISR enterprise standards.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The basic MQ-1 system consists of the aircraft, a control station, communications equipment, support equipment, simulator and training devices, Readiness Spares Packages (RSP), technical data/training, and personnel required to operate, maintain, and sustain the system.  This funding supports development and enhancements to the Predator weapon system to include:  aircraft and Ground Control Stations (GCS) and associated software, sensors, communication equipment, training systems and support elements.  The system is designed to be modular and open-ended.  Mission-specific equipment is employed in a 'plug-and-play' mission kit concept allowing specific aircraft and control station configurations to be tailored to fit mission needs.    

The MQ-1 aircraft is a single-engine, propeller-driven, remotely piloted aircraft (formerly called Unmanned Aircraft Vehicle, UAV) designed to operate over-the-horizon for long endurance sorties.  The aircraft is designed to provide real-time Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, and Target Acquisition (ISR TA), and attack capability to aggressively prosecute Time Sensitive Targets (TSTs).  The aircraft is configured to carry Hellfire laser-guided missiles.  The MQ-1 operates primarily at medium altitudes, integrating with joint aerospace, ground, and maritime forces as well as coalition and Allied forces, to execute combatant commander (COCOM) priority missions.  The aircraft carries a Multi-spectral Targeting System (MTS) (a sensor turret that incorporates Electro-Optical (EO), Infra-Red (IR), laser designator, and IR illuminator) capable of transmitting real-time Full Motion Video (FMV) imagery throughout the operational theater.  

The GCS, common with the MQ-9 Reaper, functions as the aircraft cockpit and can control the aircraft either within Line-of-Sight (LOS) or Beyond LOS (BLOS) via a combination of satellite relay and terrestrial communications.  The GCS is either mobile to support forward operating locations or fixed at a facility to support Remote Split Operations (RSO).  The GCS has the capability to perform mission planning; provide a means for manual control; allow control of multiple aircraft and payloads; allow personnel to launch, recover, and monitor aircraft, payloads, and system communications status; secure data links to receive payload sensor data and command links; monitor threats to the aircraft; display a common operational picture; and provide support functions.  Additionally, GCS allows for servicing, systems checks, maintaining, launching, and recovering aircraft under LOS control for hand-off to a mobile or fixed facility GCS. 

This program will address interoperability among developed systems through common standards and tools.  It will continue to address reliability and maintainability, safety of flight, and warfighter needs as they arise.

The FY2016 funding request was reduced by $0.198 million to account for the availability of prior execution balances.

In FY2016 0305219F Predator will be completed.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY 2016,  PE 0305220F, RQ-4, Project 675148, Common-Airborne Sense &amp; Avoid (C-ABSAA), transferred to PE 0305206F, Airborne Reconnaissance Systems, Project 675148. This transfer will provide greater visibility into this capability and prepares for expanded applications by making the capability program and platform agnostic.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element funds four (4) related Air Force projects sharing the RQ-4 platform in common: the RQ-4 Block 30 project, the RQ-4 Block 40 project, the RQ-4 Ground Segment/Communications System project, and MP-RTIP project in FY16 and forward.

Global Hawk:

The RQ-4 Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) provides a high altitude, deep look, long-endurance Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) capability that complements space and other airborne collectors during peacetime, crisis, and war-fighting scenarios.  This funding supports the development of RQ-4 aircraft, payloads, ground and support segments.  The Block 20/30/40 RQ-4B RPA is the successor to the Block 10 RQ-4A, and is designed to employ 3,000 pounds of payload and enable Multi-Intelligence (multi-INT) collecting.  

Block 30 (Project Number 675145) employs upgraded Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR) sensors known as the Enhanced Integrated Sensor Suite (EISS), and the Airborne Signals Intelligence Payload (ASIP) sensor. Activities include mission planning development and testing, enhanced weather capability development and testing, airspace and interoperability enhancements and updates, airframe upgrades, sensor upgrades, risk reduction and integration, ice protection system development and testing, and resolution of issues with Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS).   

The Block 40 (Project Number 675146) employs the MP-RTIP radar sensor. In FY15 and beyond, this includes the Block 40 costs for the development of enhanced weather capability development and testing, maritime mode utilization, mission planning development and testing, airspace integration activities including Mode 5 Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B), ice protection system development and testing, airframe and sensor enhancements to the Block 40 fleet.

The Ground Segment Modernization (GSM)/Communication System Modernization (CSM) Project Number 675147 includes the GSM project, CSM project and the Next Generation Communication System. The ground segment currently includes the Mission Control Element (MCE), the Launch and Recovery Element (LRE), and the networking resources required to simultaneously disseminate intelligence while remaining compliant with Department of Defense (DoD) cybersecurity network requirements to operate on the Global Information Grid. As a result of the reinstatement of the Block 30s in the FY15 PB, the requirement for ground stations operations significantly increased which increased the need for efforts to address DMS issues.  The GSM project will initiate in FY16 in support of a 20 year operational lifecycle, and will comprise an approach that combines the functionality of legacy MCEs and LREs into a single building-based configuration.  The CSM project will provide enhancements across the RQ-4 communication network.

When judged feasible and affordable, this program will participate in the development, testing, and implementation of international standards to enhance joint, allied, and coalition interoperability. Studies and activities may be initiated to further explore the utility of incorporating the emerging architectural standards such as the USAF Unmanned Aeriel System (UAS) Command and Control Initiative (UCI) or the DoD's Unmanned Control Segment standards (UCS).  GSM and CSM will incorporate UCI and UCS standards. 

The RQ-4 program will maintain and upgrade interoperability for Blocks 20/30/40 with system of systems partners and continue to incorporate applicable synergies with other platforms such as  the U.S. Navy's Triton, other RPA weapon systems, and Processing, Exploitation &amp; Dissemination (PED) elements.  The networking capability for intelligence dissemination is required to provide the data transport interface between the Weapons System, Operations Centers, and external Intelligence Community customers.

C-ABSAA: 
C-ABSAA is an analysis and developmental effort in the pre-Material Development Decision phase of the acquisition lifecycle which supports emerging warfighter requirements to fully integrate Group 4-5 RPA into the National Airspace System (NAS), international airspace, other nations' sovereign airspace, and operational combat airspace to conduct the entire range of military operations across all mission environments.  C-ABSAA also supports the "Worldwide Operations" Key Performance Parameter (KPP) in larger RPA requirement documents, and Public Law 112-239 directing DoD collaboration with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the National Air and Space Administration (NASA) to safely integrate RPA in the NAS.  Funding in this project supports the development of a Sense and Avoid (SAA) capability set for Group 4-5 RPA and covers analysis, research, and developmental activities as well as infrastructure and other government costs.  Activities included support to the development of warfighter requirements and analysis of possible solution alternatives, the collaboration with the FAA, NASA, and Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) to develop national policy and standards, and SAA related studies, analysis, modeling and simulation, program planning and project execution.  RPA platform specific integration and testing is not included.

In FY16, Project 675148, C-ABSAA, transferred to PE 0305206F, Airborne Reconnaissance Systems, Project 675148, C-ABSAA, in order to provide greater visibility into this capability and prepare for expanded applications.

MP-RTIP:
The MP-RTIP sensor was designed as a family of modular, scalable sensors to provide next generation capabilities to support sustainable network centric operations with integrated Command and Control, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C2ISR) capability. MP-RTIP provides the RQ-4 Block 40 aircraft with advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Moving Target Indicator (MTI) sensor capabilities.

This project (67RTIP) includes all MP-RTIP design, development, test, and integration efforts for the RQ-4 Block 40 platform. Integration activities include platform integration of the MP-RTIP sensor and sustainment logistics planning support. MP-RTIP studies and development insertion include the implementation of Maritime Modes (MM), High Range Resolution (HRR) modes, electronic protection, technical refresh, product improvements and other advanced capabilities.  

Activities also include studies and analysis supporting current and future program planning and future modes development based on user requirements.

Per direction of USD(AT&amp;L), the RQ-4 program was restructured from the original project 675144 (Baseline) into multiple projects: (1) Block 30, (2) Block 40, (3) GroundSegment/Communications System, and (4) C-ABSAA. Prior year funds in the amount of $2031.377M were accounted for in project 675144.

In FY 2016 and beyond, the RQ-4 Block 30 project 675145 includes budget necessary for systems engineering/program management, test and evaluation, management services and fielding support for projects 675145, 675146 (Block 40) and 675147 (Ground Segment/Comm System). This reflects contracting/acquisition strategy for these common elements within the Global Hawk program. Projects 675148 (C-ABSAA) and 67RTIP (Multi-Platform Radar Technology Insertion Program (MP-RTIP)) reflect separate costs as they are separately managed/supported programs.

The Cost to Complete and Total Cost for Major Defense Acquistion Program (MDAP) projects in this program element are documented in the R3. Total Cost on the R2 is not reflective of the total cost for MDAP projects since the R2 does not account for prior years funding for in project 675144.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The RQ-4 program uses an evolutionary acquisition strategy to provide the warfighter with a near-term combat capability with increased time-phased capability improvements as technology and risk achieve satisfactory levels. Northrop Grumman Corporation is the prime contractor. A suite of contract vehicles is used for development efforts: primarily, an IDIQ contract covers development, modernization, production, retrofit, fielding, and sustainment efforts through FY 2020.

The next event is a Milestone (MS) C decision (date 2QFY15). Upon a successful MS C decision concluding the Nunn-McCurdy re-certification process, the RQ-4 program plans to transition from the Production and Deployment phase to the Operations and Support phase of the Defense Acquisition System. Future required capabilities beyond the core Acquisition Category I (ACAT) RQ-4 program are planned to be added over time as separate modification programs.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>1. The RQ-4 Block 40 Project was directed by an Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) signed 14 Jun 2011 by USD (AT&amp;L). At the time of the ADM signature, and subsequent designation of projects, budgets had already been finalized.  Prior budgets for all projects are captured under the RQ-4 Baseline project, as its related Project (675144) was the core project for the RQ-4 program prior to the directed restructure.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The RQ-4 Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) provides a high altitude, deep look, long-endurance Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) capability that complements space and other airborne collectors during peacetime, crisis, and war-fighting scenarios. 

RDT&amp;E funding in this project supports design, development, integration, and testing of items needed to meet validated requirements for Block 40 aircraft, including further development, integration and test of the Multi-Platform Radar Technology Insertion Program (MP-RTIP) sensor capabilities. The Block 40 program provides critical Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI) data to the warfighter. This funding also supports continued aircraft/communications systems modernization to include Mode 5/ADS-B, mission planning upgrade development and testing, program protection projects, enhanced weather capability, radar maritime modes, development and testing of ice protection system, and reliability and maintainability improvements. Funding continues RQ-4 unique development and integration of upgraded capabilities. 

In FY15 and beyond, the RQ-4 Block 40 project 675146 includes the delta costs only for the development of above common capabilities funded with the RQ-4 Block 30 project, 675145. The RQ-4 Block 30 project, 675145, contains the budget necessary for systems engineering/program management, sofware integration, test and evaluation, and fielding support for the fleet.

When judged feasible and affordable, this program will participate in the development, testing, and implementation of international standards to enhance joint, allied, and coalition interoperability.  Likewise, studies and activities may be initiated to further explore the utility of incorporating the emerging architectural standards such as the USAF Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) Command and Control Initiative (UCI) or the DoD's Unmanned Control Segment standards (UCS).

The RQ-4 program will maintain capability and interoperability for Block 40 including efforts with system of systems partners and continue to incorporate applicable synergies with other platforms, such as the U.S. Navy's Triton, other RPA weapon systems, and Processing, Exploitation &amp; Dissemination (PED) elements.

Activities also include studies and analysis supporting future system enhancements, current and future program planning, and project execution.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The RQ-4 program uses an evolutionary acquisition strategy to provide the warfighter with a near-term combat capability with increased time-phased capability improvements as technology and risk achieve satisfactory levels. Northrop Grumman Corporation is the prime contractor. A suite of contract vehicles is used for development efforts: a legacy EMD "C" contract is being phased out with the completion of current efforts; an  IDIQ contract covers development, modernization, production, retrofit, fielding, and sustainment efforts through FY 2020.

The next event is a Milestone (MS) C decision (date 2QFY15). Upon a successful MS C decision concluding the Nunn-McCurdy re-certification process, the RQ-4 program plans to transition from the Production and Deployment phase to the Operations and Support phase of the Defense Acquisition System. Future required capabilities beyond the core Acquisition Category I (ACAT) RQ-4 program are planned to be added over time as separate modification programs.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>1. The RQ-4 Ground Segment/Communications System Sub-Program was directed by an Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) signed 14 Jun 2011 by USD (AT&amp;L). At the time of the ADM signature, and subsequent designation of sub-program projects, budgets had already been finalized.  The budgets for all projects are captured under the RQ-4 baseline project, as its related Project (675144) was the core project for the RQ-4 program prior to the directed restructure.    

2. The FY15 PB reinstated the Block 30s. As a result, the operational need for ground stations and modern communications significantly increased. The GSM and CSM projects will resolve Diminishing Manufacturing Supply (DMS) and obsolescence issues in the ground and communication systems and support a 20 year planned operational lifecycle for the Block 20/30/40 fleet.  GSM and CSM will leverage previous design and development efforts to implement cost-effective solutions.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The RQ-4 Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) provides a high altitude, deep look, long-endurance intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capability that complements space and other airborne collectors during peacetime, crisis, and war-fighting scenarios.  

RDT&amp;E funding in this project supports design, development, integration and testing of the weapon system's ground elements and communications capabilities.  The ground segment currently includes the Mission Control Elements (MCE), the Launch and Recovery Elements (LRE), and the networking resources required to simultaneously disseminate intelligence information while remaining compliant with DoD cybersecurity network requirements to operate on the Global Information Grid.

The RDT&amp;E funding in this project also supports the GSM and CSM efforts, as well as next generation communications capabilities. GSM resolves fleet grounding DMS and obsolescence issues associated with ground segment equipment and provides critical warfighter capabilities such as building-based multi-aircraft control. CSM resolves critical DMS and obsolescence issues in the RQ-4 communication infrastructure and provides enhancements across the RQ-4 communication network. Both GSM and CSM will employ the USAF Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) Command and Control Initiative (UCI) and the DoD's Unmanned Control Segment standards (UCS), using a service-oriented, open architecture approach.

When judged feasible and affordable, this program will participate in the development, testing, and implementation of international standards to enhance joint, allied, and coalition interoperability.  Likewise, studies and activities may be initiated to explore the utility of next-generation communications technologies, as well as emerging architectural standards such as UCI and UCS.  

The RQ-4 program will maintain and upgrade interoperability for Blocks 20/30/40 with system of systems partners and continue to incorporate applicable synergies with other platforms such as  the U.S. Navy's Triton, other RPA weapon systems, and Processing, Exploitation &amp; Dissemination (PED) elements.  The networking capability for intelligence dissemination is required to provide the data transport interface between the Weapons System, Operations Centers, and external Intelligence Community customers.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The RQ-4 program uses an evolutionary acquisition strategy to provide the warfighter with a near-term combat capability with increased time-phased capability improvements as technology and risk achieve satisfactory levels. Northrop Grumman Corporation is the prime contractor. A suite of contract vehicles is used for development efforts: a legacy EMD "C" contract is being phased out with the completion of current efforts; and a 2015 follow-on IDIQ covers development, modernization, production, retrofit, fielding, and sustainment efforts through FY 2020.

The next event is a Milestone (MS) C decision (date 2QFY15). Upon a successful MS C decision concluding the Nunn-McCurdy re-certification process, the RQ-4 program plans to transition from the Production and Deployment phase to the Operations and Support phase of the Defense Acquisition System. Future required capabilities beyond the core Acquisition Category I (ACAT) RQ-4 program are planned to be added over time as separate ACAT modification programs.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Common-Airborne Sense and Avoid (C-ABSAA) is an analysis and developmental effort in the pre-Material Development Decision phase of the acquisition lifecycle which supports emerging warfighter requirements to fully integrate Group 4-5 RPA into the National Airspace System (NAS), international airspace, other nations' sovereign airspace, and operational combat airspace to conduct the entire range of military operations across all mission environments.  C-ABSAA also supports the "Worldwide Operations" Key Performance Parameter (KPP) in larger Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) requirement documents, and Public Law 112-239 directing DoD collaboration with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the National Air and Space Administration (NASA) to safely integrate RPA in the NAS.  Funding in this project supports the development of a Sense and Avoid (SAA) capability set for Group 4-5 RPA and covers analysis, research, and developmental activities as well as infrastructure and other government costs.  Ongoing activities include support to the development of warfighter requirements and analysis of possible solution alternatives, the collaboration with the FAA, NASA, and Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) to develop national policy and standards, and SAA related studies, analysis, modeling and simulation, program planning and project execution.  RPA platform specific integration and testing is not included.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>C-ABSAA will integrate Better Buying Power 3.0 initiatives throughout its acquisition lifecycle and rely upon acquisition of government data rights to maximize contractor competition from Technology Development through Production. The program uses an incremental acquisition strategy to provide the warfighter with SAA capability for Group 4-5 RPA with increased, time-phased capability improvements as technology and risks achieve satisfactory levels. Group 4-5 RPA platforms will be expected to integrate the C-ABSAA provided capability into their unique systems via retrofit or in production.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>Beginning in FY09, the Multi-Platform Radar Technology Insertion Program (MP-RTIP) funding was transferred to program 0305220F (RQ-4) Global Hawk (GH).  Therefore, the data in this package includes only FY09 and subsequent funding related to program 0305220F.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The MP-RTIP sensor was designed as a family of modular, scalable sensors to provide next generation capabilities to support sustainable network centric operations with integrated Command and Control, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C2ISR) capability. MP-RTIP provides the RQ-4 Block 40 aircraft with advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Moving Target Indicator (MTI) sensor capabilities.

This project (67RTIP) includes all MP-RTIP design, development, test, and integration efforts for the RQ-4 Block 40 Platform. Integration activities include platform integration of the MP-RTIP sensor and sustainment logistics planning support. MP-RTIP studies and development insertion include the implementation of Maritime Modes (MM), Maritime Inverse SAR (MISAR), technical refresh, product improvements and other advanced capabilities.

Activities also include studies and analysis supporting current and future program planning and future modes development based on user requirements. This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY 2016, PE 0305221, Network-Centric Collaborative Targteting, Project 675197 efforts for SUTER were transferred to PE 0305221, Network-Centric Collaborative Targteting, Project 675275, SUTER.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Network Centric Collaborative Targeting (NCCT) is the Air Force program of record responsible for developing core technologies and sub-nodal analysis tools to horizontally and/or vertically integrate network collaborative Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) sensor systems within and across intelligence disciplines.  Operational uses of core technologies can include, but are not limited to, Signals Intelligence to Signals Intelligence (SIGINT-SIGINT) correlation and Ground Moving Target Indicator to Signals Intelligence (GMTI-SIGINT) correlation.  Operational uses of sub-nodal analysis tools can include, but are not limited to, determining which nodes of the adversary's Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence (C4I) network to engage or protect to achieve desired effects, and modeling execution plans to determine the need to disrupt or monitor the required network aim-points in order to redirect activities based on changing battlefield conditions.  NCCT software applications employ Machine-to-Machine (M2M) interfaces and Internet Protocol (IP) connectivity to coordinate sensor cross-cues and collection activities.  NCCT correlation and fusion services ingest collection data to produce a single, composite track (geo-location and identification) for high-value targets.  NCCT research and development funding supports evolutionary development of the NCCT message set and network management systems for example Operations Interfaces, Network Controllers, Fusion Engines, Data Guards, Interface to Command &amp; Control, and Interface to Overhead Intelligence Operations (OIO), the migration of the NCCT technologies to emerging network centric technologies such as Service Oriented Architectures (SOA), global web-enabled services, and satisfying DoD standards and Information Assurance requirements.   

NCCT Core Technology develops the hardware and software to horizontally integrate dissimilar Joint and Coalition Battle Management, Command &amp; Control (BMC2), and ISR assets and systems into integrated target tracks shared across networked platforms.  NCCT Core Technology includes, but is not limited to, network management software, operator interfaces, standard network messages and formats, correlation software and data rules of interaction, NCCT multi-level security hardware and software items, and platform specific Platform Interface Modules (PIMs).  Current NCCT-enabled systems include, but are not limited to, the RC-135V/W/S/U RIVET JOINT, COBRA BALL, COMBAT SENT,  EC-130H COMPASS CALL, Distributive Common Ground System (DCGS) SIGINT components, Falconer Aerospace Operations Centers (AOC), Forward Processing/Exploitation/Dissemination (FPED), Gorgon Stare (GS), OIO, and multiple airborne coalition partner platforms.  Prospective Coalition, Joint or Service systems are required to fund their respective integration, unique core technology improvements/upgrades to support system integration.  

The SUTER Program System (SPS) develops concepts, Tactics/Techniques/Procedures (TTPs) and technologies for synchronizing the capabilities of ISR and non-kinetic capabilities in a coordinated fashion with traditional kinetic weapons to prosecute targets connected together or dependent upon some form of communications network.  SPS's planning, execution and assessment capability is implemented in a virtual architecture available to all AOCs, taking advantage of the military value added from the synergies of Joint composite ISR, non-kinetic, and/or kinetic strike packages operating against networked target sets.  This virtualized Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) utilizes software applications which employ machine-to-machine interfaces and Internet Protocol (IP) communications to impact these target sets by "attacking" or influencing/shaping links, nodes or end points in the network to include: RF and terrestrial links, switches, routers, hubs, servers, IP addresses, cell phones, antennas, radars, microwave relays, SATCOM receivers, transceivers, etc. The three main pieces of the SPS CONOPS include: first, the use of SPS's sub-nodal analysis software to determine which nodes of the adversary's C4I network to engage or protect to achieve desired effects; second, the SPS's distributed operations architecture to tie together relevant planning cells (e.g. AOCs, JIOWC, etc.) so they can collaborate in developing and modeling the execution plan(s) needed to disrupt or monitor the required network aim-points; and third, via SPS's combined network Graphical User Interface (GUI), all involved "players" monitor the plan's execution, provide Near-Real Time (NRT) updates to the status of on-going activities, provide continuous assessment/updates of the execution of the plan, and, within authorities (Rules of Engagement/ROEs), re-direct activities based on changing battlefield conditions.  SPS is the technology that assists COCOMs and Components to exercise synchronized dynamic Command and Control (C2) of ISR, kinetic and non-kinetic Joint operations against conventional and terrorist threat networks. SPS provides decision makers and operators supporting airborne, ship-borne, cyber and land-based C2ISR platforms and at supporting locations continuous Predictive Battle-space Awareness (PBA) of the information superiority fight. It also incorporates the machine-to-machine capabilities that rapidly synchronize the employment of kinetic weapons, non-kinetic weapons and ISR assets to target challenging threat systems responsively.  SPS depicts a dynamic, multi-security-level picture of current and predicted threat network status, capitalizing on data inputs from sources such as Modernized Intelligence Database (MIDB), Net-Centric Collaborative Targeting (NCCT), Joint Targeting Database (JTDB), Computer Network Operations Database (CNODB), NASIC Links and Nodes, and Integrated Broadcast Service (IBS).  SPS provides a GUI that can be tailored to support the integration of ISR, kinetic, and non-kinetic composite target packages supporting COCOM and Component specified information superiority effects and objectives.

FY 2016 funding is dedicated to upgrading the virtualized SOA for the operational SPS system delivered in FY15, consisting of improvements in core technology security/Information Assurance, and addition of additional systems and data types.


The NCCT program is categorized as Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The NCCT Core Technology capabilities are developed, maintained and sustained with baseline/incremental upgrades plus any Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) developments acquired through the 645th Aeronautical System Group (BIG SAFARI System Program Office) in accordance with the BIG SAFARI Program Management Directive (PMD) and the BIG SAFARI Class Justification and Authorization (J&amp;A) documents for acquisition of supplies and services.  The procured supplies and services are supported by the BIG SAFARI Life Cycle Management Plan (LCMP) across the full spectrum of system life cycle management -- developmental engineering to system retirement ("cradle to grave" support concept).  Due to the rapidly changing threat environment encountered during our prolonged commitment to Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO), the acquisition program manager has the authority to redirect funding as necessary to meet current stated and emerging/evolving Combatant Commander requirements.

645th AESG, Wright Patterson AFB OH, manages the Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contracts used to develop the NCCT Core Technology.  645th AESG will develop NCCT Core Technology software on common hardware for systems and platforms designated to field this ISR capability.  Individual program management offices may contract directly with their prime contractors or through the 645th AESG for integration of these ISR capabilities on their respective systems and platforms.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>In FY 2016, PE 0305221, Network-Centric Collaborative Targteting, Project 675197, Core Technology efforts providing funding assistance for SUTER Program System development starting in FY 2015 were transferred to PE 0305221, Network-Centric Collaborative Targteting, Project 675275, SUTER Program System to establish a dedicated funding line.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The SUTER Program System (SPS)is a project within the Air force program of record responsible for developing sub-nodal analysis tools to horizontally and/or vertically integrate network collaborative Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) sensor systems within and across intelligence disciplines.  Operational uses of sub-nodal analysis tools would include, but are not limited to, determing which nodes of the adversary's Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence (C4I) network are engaged or protected to achieve desired effects, and modeling execution plans to determine the need to disrupt or monitor the required network aim-points in order to redirect activities based on changing battlefield conditions.

The SUTER Program System (SPS) develops concepts, Tactics/Techniques/Procedures (TTPs) and technologies for synchronizing the capabilities of ISR and non-kinetic capabilities in a coordinated fashion with traditional kinetic weapons to prosecute targets connected together or dependent upon some form of communications network.  SPS's planning, execution and assessment capability is implemented in a virtual architecture available to all AOCs, taking advantage of the military value added from the synergies of Joint composite ISR, non-kinetic, and/or kinetic strike packages operating against networked target sets.  This virtualized Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) utilizes software applications which employ machine-to-machine interfaces and Internet Protocol (IP) communications to impact these target sets by "attacking" or influencing/shaping links, nodes or end points in the network to include: RF and terrestrial links, switches, routers, hubs, servers, IP addresses, cell phones, antennas, radars, microwave relays, SATCOM receivers, transceivers, etc. The three main pieces of the SPS CONOPS include: first, the use of SPS's sub-nodal analysis software to determine which nodes of the adversary's C4I network to engage or protect to achieve desired effects; second, the SPS's distributed operations architecture to tie together relevant planning cells (e.g. AOCs, JIOWC, etc.) so they can collaborate in developing and modeling the execution plan(s) needed to disrupt or monitor the required network aim-points; and third, via SPS's combined network Graphical User Interface (GUI), all involved "players" monitor the plan's execution, provide Near-Real Time (NRT) updates to the status of on-going activities, provide continuous assessment/updates of the execution of the plan, and, within authorities (Rules of Engagement/ROEs), re-direct activities based on changing battlefield conditions.  SPS is the technology that assists COCOMs and Components to exercise synchronized dynamic Command and Control (C2) of ISR, kinetic and non-kinetic Joint operations against conventional and terrorist threat networks. SPS provides decision makers and operators supporting airborne, ship-borne, cyber and land-based C2ISR platforms and at supporting locations continuous Predictive Battle-space Awareness (PBA) of the information superiority fight. It also incorporates the machine-to-machine capabilities that rapidly synchronize the employment of kinetic weapons, non-kinetic weapons and ISR assets to target challenging threat systems responsively.  SPS depicts a dynamic, multi-security-level picture of current and predicted threat network status, capitalizing on data inputs from sources such as Modernized Intelligence Database (MIDB), Net-Centric Collaborative Targeting (NCCT), Joint Targeting Database (JTDB), Computer Network Operations Database (CNODB), NASIC Links and Nodes, and Integrated Broadcast Service (IBS).  SPS provides a GUI that can be tailored to support the integration of ISR, kinetic, and non-kinetic composite target packages supporting COCOM and Component specified information superiority effects and objectives across the full spectrum of conflict from tactical operations to an Anti-Access Area Denial (A2AD) strategy.

FY 2016 funding is dedicated to upgrading the virtualized SOA for the operational SPS system delivered in FY 2015, improvements in core technology security/Information Assurance, and addition of additional systems and data types.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The SPS capabilities are developed, maintained and sustained with baseline/incremental upgrades plus any Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) developments acquired through the 645th Aeronautical System Group (BIG SAFARI System Program Office) in accordance with the BIG SAFARI Program Management Directive (PMD) and the BIG SAFARI Class Justification and Authorization (J&amp;A) documents for acquisition of supplies and services. The procured supplies and services are supported by the BIG SAFARI Life Cycle Management Plan (LCMP) across the full spectrum of system life cycle management -- developmental engineering to system retirement ("cradle to grave" support concept).  Due to the rapidly changing threat environment encountered during our prolonged commitment to Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO), the acquisition program manager has the authority to redirect funding as necessary to meet current stated and emerging/evolving Combatant Commander (COCOM) requirements.  645th AESG, Wright Patterson AFB OH, manages the Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contracts used to develop SPS.  645th AESG will develop SPS software on common hardware for systems and platforms designated to field this ISR capability.  Individual program management offices may contract directly with their prime contractors or through the 645th AESG for integration of these ISR capabilities on their respective systems and platforms.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Common Data Link Executive Agent (CDL EA) provides the DoD standard for interoperable, multi-service, multi-agency, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) datalinks for 10,000+ DoD manned/unmanned airborne and ground platforms.  As the DoD CDL EA, the Air Force is responsible for cross-service application of CDL RDT&amp;E Military Intelligence Program (MIP) funds facilitating compliance to Congressional and DoD mandates.  The EA develops, modifies, distributes, and maintains specifications for the CDL waveform family; ensuring design configuration control, commonality, and interoperability among ISR platforms.  Additionally, funds support managing resources allocated for development, maturation, and migration of CDL technologies. 

CDL EA enables compliance with OSD and Congressional mandates to effectively utilize spectrum, use approved cryptographic equipment, and provide direct support to current operations.  CDL is a vital link in DoD's existing and emerging communication architectures, providing flexibility to accommodate Command and Control (C2) data and myriad types of Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT), and Full-Motion Video (FMV) data.  The CDL specifications permit current and future ISR asset operations worldwide by providing sensor data directly via point-to-point broadcast to ground sites, airborne platforms and dismounted users.  Also, CDL provides the capability to relay data via air-to-air or compatible satellite links when the asset and ground site are not in line-of-sight. 

CDL EA's research and development activities support a broad swath of tactical, operational, and strategic ISR users and include achieving higher data rates, multi-access and multi-node network management, crypto modernization, advancements needed to operate in contested environments, terminal and antenna design enhancements, operations in other spectral bands, and improving spectrum efficiency.  Further, CDL development improves large area surveillance missions while supporting continuous improvements and implementation of line-of-sight platform and CDL terminal Command and Control (C2), plus increased ISR (C2ISR) capabilities.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support current and future requirements documentation, program planning and execution. CDL prototype terminal designs provide for future technology insertion and reduce non-recurring engineering and life-cycle costs to the user. 

In addition, the Gigabit Encryption thrust enables CDL to develop a miniaturized gigabit rate Communication Security (COMSEC) device capable of managing CDL data.  The miniaturized COMSEC device will allow faster throughput while reducing Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) requirements.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>U.S. participation in NATO AGS was ratified by Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) signature/approval of the NATO AGS Program Memorandum of Understanding (PMOU) in June 2009. The PMOU went into effect in Sept 2009 when 15 nations, including the United States, financially committed to support procurement and delivery of the NATO Commander's number one priority to the warfighter.  Canada withdrew in 2011 and Poland joined in 2014 keeping the participating nations at 15.  

In FY 2012, OSD transferred the NATO AGS program to the U.S. Air Force (USAF) for management and execution. The NATO AGS project funds the U.S. share of the cost for NATO to acquire an air-to-ground ground surveillance capability, improvements to the radar, and U.S. support of NATO AGS-related activities. Operations and continuing support will be funded through a future NATO Military Commanders' Capability Package funded within the NATO Security Investment Program (NSIP). 

The AGS system will be a NATO-owned and operated airborne ground surveillance capability that provides continuous, wide area surveillance information in all weather conditions for use at the strategic, operational and tactical levels of command. Interoperable with other national assets, AGS will provide NATO decision makers with near real time, continuous information and situational awareness concerning friendly, neutral, and opposing ground and maritime forces to support mission planning and execution, including force protection and targeting. 

The NATO AGS Program includes:  an air segment consisting of five (5) NATO-developed air vehicles, incorporating elements of the United States Navy (USN)Triton (previously Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS)) command and control architecture and the U.S. Multi-Platform Radar Technology Insertion Program (MP-RTIP) radar; a unique exportable configuration; a ground segment for air vehicle command and control and data exploitation and distribution that consists of fixed-based site and transportable/mobile ground stations; operation of an international management organization; development of operations and support concepts; and definition and establishment of an initial support capability.  As part of the U.S. government agreement with NATO AGS Management Agency (NAGSMA), the U.S. will integrate Maritime Moving Target and Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar capability into the MP-RTIP radar for NATO AGS. This design and development includes correcting deficiencies, flight testing on the modes and system level performance validation. 

System level configuration changes include a unique configuration to allow for export of the system.

Support to NATO to maintain International Agreements allows for continuation of development.

NATO Alliance Ground Surveillance (AGS) is an Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD)special interest program.  

Deliveries are planned for 2016-2017. Follow-on sustainment and operations will be supported by all 28 NATO nations through their contributions of funding to the program. Mission elements will support two orbits. The Main Operating Base (MOB) air vehicles and mission Command and Control (C2) will be located at Sigonella Air Base, Italy. Exploitation at the MOB will be developed by Selex. EADS and Selex will develop the transportable and mobile general ground stations. 
 
The program, managed by NAGSMA, is composed of design, development, demonstration, and production, as well as Initial In-Service Support (IISS). While the current program includes IISS, the current Direct Commercial Sale (DCS) contract with Northrop Grumman does not include these tasks.

The DCS contract between Northrop Grumman and NAGSMA was signed on 20 May 2012. This PE funds the U.S. cost share for the acquisition of the NATO airborne ground surveillance capability as well as the cost share associated with the IISS. IISS and In-Service Support (ISS) will be contracted under separate action. It is anticipated that ISS costs will be commonly funded through a future NATO Military Commanders' Capability Package, using the NATO Security Investment Program (NSIP). This funding also includes developmental activity for MP-RTIP to include additional functionality and configuration requirements, studies and analysis related to mission security and exportability, and current and future program planning, project execution, engineering, and program management support to NATO.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element contains Distributed Common Ground/Surface System (DCGS) Family of Systems interoperability efforts for which the AF is lead service. The DCGS Family of Systems, including AF DCGS, was directed to migrate to a net-centric DoD Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) enterprise enabling the Services to operate and share intelligence products more effectively in a joint environment.  All Services must pursue a common path based on a set of common enterprise services consistent with the Department's net-centric vision while maintaining flexibility to support the full range of warfighter missions.  Specifically, DoD charged the Air Force to lead the development, upgrade, integration, and test of common DCGS Integration Backbone (DIB) enterprise services.  The DIB is a set of enterprise standards and services that enable interoperability and component reuse.  All the military services are mandated to incorporate DIB interoperability standards and commit to DIB architecture as the migration path to common DCGS enterprise services. 

The Distributed Common Ground Systems-Imagery (DCGS-I) Testbed is an integration and test environment, used by the Services and Agency DCGS program offices to conduct integration of DCGS components and test interoperability interfaces with new sensors, applications, and net-centric operations. This testbed also supports the integration and testing of DoD DCGS components prior to introduction into the operational environment.  Periodic upgrades ensure the Testbed stays current with DCGS standards and architecture.

Support to OUSD(I), AF DCGS, and NATO interoperability efforts is also provided through this program element. This includes development, testing, and implementation of international standards (to include NATO standardization agreements) to ensure joint, allied, and coalition interoperability. 

The Common Imagery Processor effort develops a common imagery sensor processing capability within the DCGS architecture.  The imagery processor accepts airborne imagery data, processes it into an exploitable format, and provides it to other elements within the weapon system and the DCGS Enterprise. Current efforts are transitioning the legacy imagery processor from a hardware/software capability to a virtual software capability, thereby improving enterprise processing capabilities.   Efforts continue to keep the capability on track to handle the current sensors. Activities also include testing, development, and demonstrations integrating updated and new/emerging sensors into DCGS.

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>DoD charged the AF with developing, upgrading and managing the Distributed Common Ground/Surface System (DCGS) Integration Backbone (DIB) for all the Services to provide common DCGS enterprise services and interoperability at the data level.  The DIB is a set of enterprise standards and services that enable interoperability and component reuse. Using the DIB, the Air Force Distributed Common Ground System (AF DCGS) modernization will transform AF DCGS from its existing proprietary system to a net-centric service oriented architecture.

The DCGS Family of Systems, including AF DCGS, was directed to migrate to a net-centric DoD Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) enterprise enabling the Services to operate and share intelligence products more effectively in a joint environment.  All Services must pursue a common path based on common enterprise services consistent with the Department's net-centric vision, while maintaining flexibility to support the full range of warfighter missions.  Also, all Services are mandated to incorporate DIB interoperability standards and commit to DIB architecture as the migration path to common DCGS enterprise services. 

The Distributed Common Ground Systems-Imagery (DCGS-I) Testbed is an integration and test environment, used by the Services and Agency DCGS program offices to conduct integration of DCGS components and test interoperability interfaces with new sensors, applications, and net centric operations.  This testbed also supports the integration and testing of DoD DCGS components prior to introduction into the operational environment.  Periodic upgrades ensure the Testbed stays current with DCGS standards and architecture.
 
The AF-sponsored DIB System Program Office also participates in the development, testing, and implementation of international standards (to include NATO standardization agreements) to ensure joint, allied, and coalition interoperability.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Imagery Processing effort develops imagery sensor processing capability within the DCGS architecture.  The imagery processor accepts airborne imagery data, processes it into an exploitable format, and provides it to other elements within the weapon system and/or the DCGS Enterprise. Current efforts are transitioning the legacy imagery processor from a hardware/software capability to a virtual software capability, thereby improving enterprise processing capabilities.   Efforts continue to keep the capability on track to handle the current sensors. Activities also include testing, development, and demonstrations integrating updated and new/emerging sensors into DCGS.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a space based navigation system that fills validated Joint Service requirements for worldwide, accurate, common grid three dimensional positioning/navigation for military aircraft, ships, and ground personnel. The consistent accuracy, unaffected by location or weather and available in real  time, significantly improves effectiveness of reconnaissance, weapons delivery, mine countermeasures and rapid deployment for all services. GPS must comply with Title 10 United States Code (USC) 2281 which requires that the Secretary of Defense ensures that continued sustainment and operations of GPS for military and civilian purposes and 51 USC sec 50112 which requires that GPS complies with certain standards and facilitates international cooperation.

The system is composed of three segments: user equipment (funded under PE 0305164F), space (funded under this PE and PE 0305165F) and a control network (funded under PE 0305165F and PE 0603423F). The satellites broadcast high accuracy data using precisely synchronized signals which are received and processed by user equipment installed in military platforms. This equipment computes the platform position and velocity and provides steering vectors to target locations or navigation waypoints. The control segment provides daily updates to the navigation messages broadcast from the satellites to maintain system precision in three dimensions to 16 meters spherical error probable worldwide. Additionally, GPS supports the United States Nuclear Detonation (NUDET) Detection System (NDS) mission and provides strategic and tactical support to the following Department of Defense (DoD) missions: Joint Operations by providing capabilities for Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT); Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence; Special Operations; Military Operations in Urban Terrain; Defense-Wide Mission Support; Air Mobility; and Space Launch Orbital Support.

GPS III is the next generation Space Vehicle (SV) to join the GPS constellation. GPS III SVs will deliver significant enhancements, including a new civil (L1C) Galileo- compatible signal, and enhanced anti-jam power. Two auxiliary payloads, Search and Rescue/GPS (SAR/GPS) and Laser Retroreflector Array (LRA) will be added no earlier than SV11. The SAR/GPS payload provided by Canada will fill a validated National Search and Rescue Committee requirement to provide enduring, space-based distress alerting capability to detect, locate, and relay distress alerts to fulfill its responsibilities under international agreements for Search and Rescue. SAR integration costs are  funded by the Coast Guard. LRA, built by the Naval Research Lab (NRL), is a passive reflector that will improve accuracy and provide better ephemeris data. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) funds the integration costs of LRA.

This program funds GPS III and supports research, development, test and evaluation of GPS III SV01-02, and risk-reducing simulators through a systems engineering approach that matures and delivers SVs for launch.

Additionally, the program includes SV01-02 engineering studies and analyses, trade studies, system development, test and evaluation efforts, integrated logistics support products, on-orbit support, and mission operations support for civil and military applications that protect U.S. military and allied use of GPS.  Starting in FY14, all Space Modernization Initiatives (SMI) funding is re-allocated to cover SV01-02 development overruns.  

Options for an alternate production source competition continue to be explored by USD(AT&amp;L) for SVs no earlier than SV11.  The Air Force's notional plan includes FY15-16 funding to mature up to three contractors' GPS production designs to facilitate a full and open competition in FY17 for up to 22 GPS III SVs with an expected contract award in FY17-FY18. 

This program is a Budget Activity 7,Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full-rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Search and Rescue GPS (SAR/GPS) is an approved auxiliary payload on GPS III beginning no earlier than SV11. SAR/GPS fills validated National Search and Rescue Committee requirements to provide enduring, space-based distress alerting capability to detect, locate, and relay distress alerts to fulfill its responsibilities under international agreements for Search and Rescue.

In addition, the USAF has on-going requirements to rescue US Military personnel in harm's way per Air Force Doctrine Document 2-1.6. The implementation of a US Mid Earth Orbiting (MEO) Search and Rescue Space Segment is via a Canadian-Provided 406 MHz SAR repeater on GPS III SVs. This system presents a cost effective, low- risk opportunity that accommodates existing and planned 406 MHz beacons across the globe. Per NSPD-39, USAF and USCG, the US operators of the civil COSPAS/ SARSAT system and the international search and rescue system, share costs (50/50) associated with integrating the Canadian provided SAR repeater to GPS III beginning no earlier than SV11. Costs presented in this document represent the USAF 50% Share.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>GPS III is the next generation Space Vehicle (SV) supporting the GPS constellation. GPS III SVs will deliver significant enhancements, including a new civil (L1C) Galileo-compatible signal, enhanced anti-jam power, and a growth path to full warfighter capabilities. GPS III SV03-08 is in the Production &amp; Deployment Phase.

RDT&amp;E, AF PE 0305265F funds GPS III and supports research, development, test and evaluation of GPS III SV01-02, and risk-reducing simulators through a systems engineering approach that matures and delivers SVs for launch. Space Modernization Initiative (SMI) funding ended in FY13. All future SMI funding has been re- allocated to cover GPS III SV01-02 development cost overrun. Any future SMI will be suspended until GPS III future SV acquisition options finalize.

In an effort to implement Better Buying Power 3.0 to control production costs the Air Force intends to create a competitive environment. Options for the GPS III Production Readiness competition continue to be explored by USD(AT&amp;L) for SVs no earlier than SV11. The Air Force's notional plan is for a two-phased competition process. Phase one is a Production Readiness competition for up to three firm-fixed price contracts to gain insight into competitors' production designs for a GPS III SV competition in Phase two. Phase two will be a full and open competition for up to 22 GPS III Production SVs with an expected award in FY18. 

This PE includes SV01-02 engineering studies and analyses, trade studies, system development, test and evaluation efforts, integrated logistics support products, on-orbit support, and mission operations support for civil and military applications that protect U.S. military and allied use of GPS.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The GPS III next generation space segment rapidly and affordably responds to warfighter capability requirements. The acquisition approach utilizes a disciplined systems engineering approach which focuses on mitigating cost and schedule risk through a lower risk incremental delivery of mature technologies. This approach focuses on mission success and on time delivery. The GPS III SVs will have GPS IIF capabilities plus up to a 3x-8x increase in anti-jam signal power, 3x improved accuracy, 3+ year increased design life, a new civil (L1C) signal compatible with the European Galileo system and a satellite bus capable of supporting future SV
capability additions.

In an effort to implement Better Buying Power 3.0 to control production costs the Air Force intends to create a competitive environment. Options for the GPS III Production Readiness competition starting no earlier than SV11 continue to be explored by USD(AT&amp;L). The Air Force's notional plan is for a two-phased competition process. Phase one is a Production Readiness competition for up to three firm-fixed price contracts to mature competitors' production designs for a GPS III SV competition in Phase two. Phase two will be a full and open competition for up to 22 GPS III Production SVs with an expected award in FY17-FY18.

The GPS directorate received USD(AT&amp;L) approval to purchase GPS III SV09-10 at the December 2014 Defense Acquisition Board in order to sustain the constellation while competitive options are pursued. The GPS III SV09-10 purchase will be on the current Lockheed Martin contract as technical equivalents of SV01-08.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY 2016, Project 65A035, (Increment 3), includes new start efforts to include pre-Milestone A requirements development, systems engineering and program planning for JMS Increment 3.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC) Mission System (JMS) Program is a Space Command and Control (C2) capability for the Commander,  Joint Functional Component Commander for Space (JFCC SPACE).  The JMS program is predominately a software effort that will produce an integrated, net-centric Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and the necessary software applications to accomplish required missions.  The program will provide a collaborative environment that will enhance and modernize space situational awareness (SSA) capabilities; create decision-relevant views of the space environment; rapidly detect, track and characterize objects of interest; identify / exploit traditional and non-traditional sources; perform space threat analysis; and enable efficient distribution of data across the Space Surveillance Network (SSN).  Furthermore, it provides a viable migration path from the legacy Space Defense Operations Center (SPADOC) system, which has 75% of its components beyond end of life or end of service, and the majority of its software no longer vendor-supported.  JMS will also integrate data from SSA sensors which is exposed via the Net-Centric Sensors and Data Sources effort (project 65A012) in the SSA Systems program (0604425F) through FY15. JMS is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>Due to the planned delivery of Increment 2 in FY16, a new BPAC was created for Increment 3 (67A035).   Funding has been realigned from 67A031 to 67A035 for Increment 3.  $12.4M was realigned in FY16 and all remaining funds in FY17 through FY20.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Mission applications will provide space services to enhance the accuracy, sustainability, and responsiveness of space surveillance capabilities by providing the knowledge environment necessary to enable the Commander JFCC Space to make rapid, responsive decisions for the protection of space assets from proliferating threats (adversary as well as orbiting debris).  The system will provide a high accuracy space catalog (knowledge of space objects), increased observation verification and capabilities, and improved event processing.  Research, design, and development will provide SSA space catalog applications, services, space surveillance observation processing, and sensor tasking.  Funding includes technical studies, development, and integration.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Rapid Cyber Acquisition (RCA) provides combatant commanders  with the ability to rapidly respond to emerging cyber needs. RCA provides rapid fielding of capabilities in three areas: defend the Air Force portion of the DoD Global Information Grid (GIG) in response to new and emerging threats; network attack and cyber exploit capabilities through all phases of warfare; and new cyber operations capabilities that address gaps to support evolving missions.

Rapid Cyber Acquisition delivers cyber capabilities to 24th Air Force (24 AF) warfighters in mission-relevant timeframes. RCA provides capabilities in support of US national security interests, to counter current and future cyber threats, and to enhance the nation's ability to operate in cyberspace. It expedites cyber development and modifications of USAF and DoD cyber capabilities. RCA provides solution sets for cyberspace operations: attack, defense, command and control/situational awareness, exploitation, critical infrastructure support, and combat support. RCA provides integration, and technical support to other Service and Government Agency activities to leverage select Air Force-developed technologies and/or operational capabilities. RCA will develop materiel or non-materiel cyber solutions, conduct rapid prototyping, integration and transition activities for cyber systems. Primary activities include, but are not limited to: development of software/hardware cyber systems; integration and transition of DoD lab-developed cyber capabilities to the warfighter; testing and evaluation; program management administration. Secondary activities include, but are not limited to: studies, analysis, pilots, demonstrations, and risk reduction to emerging technologies for USAF cyber systems. Congress will be notified when all projects have been approved by the end of the fiscal year via Congressional Notification Letters.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

The FY2016 funding request was reduced by $.881 million to account for the availability of prior execution balances.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Rapid Cyber Acquisition will utilize Concept, Development, Risk Management, or Production and Deployment Plans as a phased approach to acquisition planning. These plans are intended to meet the written acquisition planning requirements and guidance. All plans will contain sufficient information for the Milestone Decision Authority to determine readiness to enter into the applicable phase of the acquisition process. Rapid Cyber Acquisition will consider existing contracting vehicles, including but not limited to: Network Centric Solutions (NETCENTS), NETCENTS 2, Information Technology Enterprise Solutions-2 (ITES-2), Government-Wide Acquisition Contract vehicles (Alliant, Encore II, Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement IV (SEWP IV)), General Services Administration Federal Supply Schedules, National Security Agency vehicles and Cyber Warfare Systems Branch Class Justification and Approval document. Multiple award contractual vehicles, such as National Aeronautics and Space Administration's SEWP IV, provide a wide range of commercially-available products and services that should be able to meet many requirements related to Rapid Cyber Acquisition. These multiple-award vehicles have already met the statutory requirements of the Competition in Contracting Act and only require that Rapid Cyber Acquisition provide a fair opportunity to all contract holders, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 16.505, unless an exception to fair opportunity applies.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The United States Nuclear Detonation (NUDET) Detection System (USNDS) provides a near real-time worldwide, highly survivable/endurable capability to detect, locate, and report any nuclear detonations in the earth's atmosphere or in near space.  USNDS supports NUDET detection requirements across five mission areas: Integrated Tactical Warning and Attack Assessment (ITW/AA), Nuclear Force Management (NFM), Space Control (SC), Treaty Monitoring (TM), and a classified mission.

The USNDS program is jointly sponsored and funded by the Department of Defense (DoD), through the US Air Force (AF), and the Department of Energy (DOE), through the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) and its Nuclear Detonation Detection (NA-22) office, respectively.  NNSA/NA-22 supplies, at no cost to DoD, USNDS space sensors as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) to the AF's USNDS Program Office, which is responsible for all acquisition and systems engineering, integration and test (SEIT) activities on space vehicles (SVs), to include Global Positioning System (GPS) and additional hosts, and their supporting ground control segments.  The AF directly funds the development of the USNDS ground segment (described below).

DoD funds their contribution to the NDS program in Program Element (PE) 0305913F with RDT&amp;E, OPAF and O&amp;M dollars.  

USNDS consists of space sensors and complex ground segments. The space segment sensors, funded by DOE, consists of three nuclear detection sensor payloads: the Radiation Detection Capability (RADEC) payload for Defense Support Program (DSP) satellites, the Global Burst Detection (GBD) payload for Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) platforms (GPS satellites), and the Space Atmospheric Burst Reporting System (SABRS) payload for Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO) platforms (classified GEO host).  Together, these sensors and associated communications capability provided by the host satellites comprise the global NUDET space segment detection capability for the USNDS.  Space sensors communicate NUDET indications to the fixed ground segment (the RADEC Data Processor (RDP) and the Integrated Correlation and Display System (ICADS)), the deployable mobile ground segment (survivable Ground NDS Terminals (GNTs)), and the survivable/endurable Universal Ground NDS Terminals (UGNTs), when fielded.  These ground systems perform data analysis and provide a decision support tool to the Air Force controllers concerning probability of NUDET occurrence.  The ground segment provides ground receiving analysis and reporting capabilities to national authorities, commands, and forward users as well as Department of State (DOS) for Treaty Monitoring and Verification mission.  The ground control segment is being modernized and continuously improved through an incremental evolution acquisition approach.

The upgrade to the GNT is the survivable/endurable Universal Ground Nuclear Detonation (NUDET) Detection System (NDS) Terminal (UGNT) which is funded with AF RDT&amp;E in this PE.  The UGNT provides NUDET Detection Reports to end users through survivable and endurable USNDS communications via Milstar/Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) circuits.   The GNT supports ITW/AA and NFM missions.  The UGNT program modifies the baseline of the GNT program and deploys as an integral part of the Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) Survivable / Endurable Evolution (S2E2) Mobile Ground System (SMGS) units also in support of ITW/AA and NFM.  The UGNT, when integrated with the SMGS, will perform NUDET event processing with fused NDS data from GPS and DSP.  SMGS capability refers to the result of the S2E2 upgrade program for the MGS mission processing capability, including the integration of UGNT.  The intended end state of UGNT integration is delivery of enhanced missile warning and NUDET detection capabilities that meet survivable/endurable ITW/AA requirements directed by the President, SECDEF, Joint Staff, and USSTRATCOM, delivering long-term, cost effective, multi-role, multi-mission space effects to the war fighter across the range of military operations.

This budget line includes systems engineering, research and development, on-orbit and field testing and end-to-end verification of USNDS space sensors, ground analysis and reporting systems in support of the five USNDS mission areas.  Sensor integration for GPS IIF and GPS III are funded in their respective PEs.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>In FY 2016, Project 67A017, Sensor Service Life Extension Program, includes a new start effort for Space Situational Awareness (SSA) Ops Demo.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Space Situational Awareness (SSA) is knowledge of all aspects of space related to operations. As the foundation for space control, SSA encompasses surveillance of all space objects and activities; detailed reconnaissance of specific space assets; monitoring space environmental conditions; monitoring cooperative space assets; intelligence on adversary space operations; and conducting integrated command, control, communications, processing, analysis, dissemination, and archiving activities. Program Element 0305940F, Space Situational Awareness Operations, fields, upgrades, operates and maintains Air Force sensors and information integration capabilities within the SSA network while companion program element 0604425F, Space Situational Awareness Systems, develops new network sensors and improved information integration capabilities across the network. Activities funded in the SSA Operations program element focus on surveillance of objects in earth orbit to aid tasks including satellite tracking; space object identification; tracking and cataloging; satellite attack warning; notification of satellite flyovers to U.S. forces; space treaty monitoring; and technical intelligence gathering. 

The Sensor Service Life Extension Programs (SLEP) in this program element fund efforts to upgrade and extend the life of operational SSA sensors, as needed. These SLEPs include, but are not limited to, programs that extend the serviceable life of assets and maintain critical capability by replacing aging and increasingly unsustainable components with modern and sustainable equipment. SLEPs may incorporate equipment which inherently includes technological advances resulting in enhanced or increased capabilities. In addition, the SLEP itself may be designed to increase certain capabilities.  The Eglin SLEP, and Ground-based Electro Optical Deep Space Surveillance (GEODSS) are representative of sensor systems in the SLEP project.  As the need arises in the execution year, funds in this project may be used to begin sensor life extension programs on additional efforts.  

In FY 2016, Project 67A017, Sensor Service Life Extension Program, includes a new start effort for SSA Ops Demo.  The SSA Ops Demo creates a survivable architecture which provides overlapping, assured, and viable surveillance options for executing simultaneous safety of flight and event response. The demonstration develops software modifications to exploit data from legacy systems and demonstrates automated cross-sensor tipping and cueing around the globe.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

The FY2016 funding request was reduced by $0.651 million to account for the availability of prior execution balances.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Eglin SLEP effort is replacing key radar items via an option on the Systems Engineering and Sustainment Integrator (SENSOR) contract, competitively awarded to ITT Corporation (now Exelis) in 2002.  The Air Force uses the SENSOR contract for sustaining and upgrading various Air Force systems, including the Eglin radar. The radar continues to be operational during the SLEP.

The Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Lincoln Laboratory (MIT/LL), a non-profit Federally-Funded Research &amp; Development Center, performed the HUSIR effort under a master contract with the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, in conjunction with support from other agencies as required.  This effort was considered applied research under that contract.  MIT/LL transferred ownership of the radar to the Air Force but continues to operate it as part of its Lincoln Space Surveillance Complex per contract with the Air Force.  MIT/LL is responsible for operations and sustainment of the upgraded Haystack radar. The upgrade effort was completed on 28 Feb 2014.

The GEODSS SLEP was awarded as an Engineering Change Proposal on the SENSOR contract.  The GEODSS SLEP uses a phased development and deployment strategy to reduce risk. The system is in operation during the SLEP and is considered post-Milestone C.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Shared Early Warning System (SEWS) is the result of Presidential foreign policy initiatives which began in 1996.  The SEWS continues to provide Theater Combatant Commanders and foreign nation customers direct operational benefit by improving the architectural design and equipment thereby providing enhanced mission capabilities (i.e., expanded coverage, integration with active defense systems, and radar integration). Foreign customer arrangements are negotiated with individual countries on a bilateral basis to provide selected region-specific missile warning information. SEWS Integration and Test facility is kept current by enhancing systems to improve analysis of real world events. To enhance mission capability the SEWS program tests the Integrated Broadcast Service (IBS) migration to Common Interactive Broadcast (CIB), mandatory crypto upgrades, SEWS integration with various radar systems, and the transition to "coalition-based" warning.  

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.  

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

The FY2016 funding request was reduced by $0.362 million to account for the availability of prior execution balances.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Reflect funding for the C-130 Avionics Modernization Program (AMP); the FY15PB C-130 Communication, Navigation, Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) program; and the FY16 PB C-130H Viability and Airspace Access Program (VAAP) Increment 1 modification.

Note, in the FY16 PB, the FY15 PB C-130 CNS/ATM program has been updated and renamed C-130H VAAP Increment 1.

All of PE 41115F FY14 RDT&amp;E funds ($47.7M--of which $47.3M is AMP and $0.4M is CNS/ATM) are loaded under the C-130 CNS/ATM program, and will be used to the execute the C-130H VAAP Increment 1 mod.

The C-130 AMP RDT&amp;E funding has been deleted as a result of proposed program cancellation in the FY13 PB.  However, Congress added $47.3M RDT&amp;E in FY14 to continue C-130 AMP.

FY13 PB "Optimize" and FY14 PB "Minimize" C-130 CNS/ATM programs were proposed new start in-lieu-of C-130 AMP, and provided CNS/ATM solution for the legacy C-130H combat delivery fleet, addressed select obsolescence issues, and retained the navigator position. However, these new start programs did not receive congressional approval.

FY15 NDAA and Appropiation Bill allow AF to use prior and current-year AMP funds (RDT&amp;E and APAF) for safety and airspace compliance modification programs (i.e., the FY15 PB C-130 CNS/ATM program and FY16 PB C-130 VAAP Increment 1 mod).  

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full-rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The C-130 Avionics Modernization Program (AMP) RDT&amp;E funding has been deleted as a result of proposed program cancellation in the FY13 PB; however, Congress has not approved C-130 AMP's cancellation.  

The FY15 PB C-130 Communication, Navigation, Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) programs was a proposed new start in-lieu-of C-130 AMP, provided safety and airspace compliance solution for the legacy C-130H combat delivery fleet, and retained the navigator position. 

FY15 NDAA prevented C-130 AMP cancellation, but allowed the Air Force to proceed with an alternate safety and airspace compliance modification program; i.e., the FY15 PB C-130 CNS/ATM program.

In the FY16 PB, the FY15 PB C-130 CNS/ATM program has been updated and renamed C-130H Viability and Airspace Access Program (VAAP) Increment 1.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

ADS-B Out: Once integrated, early years primarily involved with defining the program requirements and pre-contract efforts in preparation for the EMD source selection phase.  Current schedule reflects the ADS-B Out EMD contract to be awarded, following a competitive source selection, by 2nd quarter FY17.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>In the FY16 PB, the FY15 PB New Start "Minimize C-130 Communication, Navigation, Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM)" program has been updated and renamed "C-130H Viability and Airspace Access Program (VAAP) Increment 1".

With the FY13 PB's proposed cancellation of the C-130 Avionics Modernization Program (AMP), the C-130H VAAP Increment 1 program addresses Federal Aviation Administration/International Civil Aviation Organization (FAA/ICAO) CNS/ATM mandates and provides a minimal airspace compliance focused program to modify 172 C-130H aircraft with Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) Out equipment, 8.33 kHz radios, updated cockpit voice recorder/digital flight data recorders (CVR/DFDR), and Enhanced Mode S.

Note, the Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS II) is listed in the VAAP Capability Development Document (CDD) as a requirement since it's required for flight operations  in airspace controlled by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and airspace controlled by foreign countries; the legacy C-130H fleet currently has TCAS II 7.0 installed.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full-rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>In the FY16 PB, the C-130 VAAP Increment 1 acquisition strategy changed to perform all upgrades (ADS-B Out, enhanced Mode S, 8.33 kHz radios, and CVR/DVR) as a single umbrella modification, instead of the FY15 PB's three-phase upgrade strategy.

The updated/renamed 172 aircraft (166x C-130Hs and 6x LC-130Hs) C-130H VAAP Increment 1 program is comprised of H3s, H2.5s, H2s and H1s; and includes 127 Air National Guard, and 45 Air Force Reserve aircraft. The modification effort will have 4 prototype aircraft required for accomplishment of the C-130H VAAP Incr 1 Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase, with the remaining 168 being production aircraft. The prototype aircraft represent each type of C-130H configuration listed above.

The majority of the RDT&amp;E funds are for ADS-B Out:   Once integrated, early years primarily involved with defining the program requirements and pre-contract efforts in preparation for the EMD source selection phase.  Current schedule reflects the ADS-B Out EMD contract to be awarded, following a competitive source selection, by 1st quarter FY17.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY2016, Project 675359, C-5 Communication, Navigation, Surveillance / Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM), is a new start effort.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>675358:  C-5 Core Mission Computer (CMC)/Weather Radar modification project:  Mission computer and weather radar replacement is a comprehensive sustainment modification to mitigate the obsolescence of the current CMC and weather radar.  This effort centers on modifying the current mission computer by replacing the Core Processing Module (CPM) cards to obtain sufficient capacity to support integration of new system capabilities with margin for growth by upgrading module cards and correcting any mission essential deficiencies identified during development.  Also, the effort includes replacement of the weather radar with a commercial off-the-shelf color weather radar.  The modified mission computer will allow for current and future throughput growth of additional processing requirements to meet CY2020 communication, navigation, surveillance/air traffic management mandates.    

675359:  C-5 Communication, Navigation, Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) modification project:  Program is a comprehensive effort to ensure appropriate system design architectures are developed and equipment is installed on the C-5 to allow aircraft operation in accordance with civil airspace access mandates for both the US National Airspace System (NAS) and international civil airspace.  Additionally, the program will add equipment to meet outstanding National Security Agency mandates for encryption of voice communications.  The C-5 CNS/ATM program ensures systems standardization and interoperability with other DoD systems to the maximum extent possible and directly supports airworthiness certification of the C-5.  CNS/ATM requirements include, but are not limited to, capabilities such as automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast out (ADS-B Out), Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) Mode 5, satellite communication equipment replacement, and beyond line-of-sight voice radio replacement.  It is anticipated equipment will be predominately commercial off-the-shelf or non-developmental items.

ADS-B Out is a next generation surveillance technology that transitions key aspects of Air Traffic Control from terrestrial based technologies to satellite enabled technologies to provide controllers a more accurate picture of aircraft positioning.

The current ARC-210 radio for VHF voice communications is facing diminishing manufacturing source (DMS) issues and additionally will no longer be capable of providing secure voice communications due to the development of new crypto algorithms.  Addition of next generation ARC-210 radios and associated cryptologic equipment will enable the C-5 to meet NSA mandates for secure communications and allow aircrews to continue to communicate securely over VHF, UHF, HF or MILSATCOM.

This program is a Budget Activity 7, Operations Systems Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current and subsequent fiscal years.

The FY2016 funding request ws reduced by $15.726 million to account for the availability of prior execution balances.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The C-5 Core Mission Computer (CMC)/Weather Radar program is a comprehensive sustainment modification to mitigate the obsolescence of the current CMC and weather radar.  This effort centers around modifying the current mission computer to obtain sufficient capacity/capability to support integration of new system capabilities with margin for growth by upgrading module cards and correcting any mission essential deficiencies identified during development.  Also, the effort includes replacement of the weather radar with a commercial off-the-shelf color weather radar.  Mission systems equipment includes, but is not limited to, a redesign of the C-5 lavatory system. Examples of other mission systems equipment include troop seats, crew entry door and ladder, and interior trim.  

The current C-5 CMC has reached maximum capacity and cannot integrate required aircraft systems and capabilities to include the weather radar; flight management system (FMS); and communication, navigation, surveillance (CNS)/air traffic management (ATM) requirements.  These requirements include capabilities such as the automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast out (ADS-B Out), and identification, friend or foe (IFF) mode 5.  The new CMC will allow for current and future throughput growth of additional processing requirements to meet CY 2020 CNS/ATM mandates.

The modification helps to maintain aircraft availability as the new color weather radar replaces the current APS-133 weather radar system, which is experiencing severe diminishing manufacturing source (DMS) issues.  Failure to upgrade the CMC to support the 2020 CNS/ATM mandates and a new weather radar will create a significant operational impact.  Equipment DMS issues will be resolved to support continued production and installation of requirements for the C-5 fleet.  Further, DMS issues will be resolved to support continued operations through studies, bridge buys, life-of-type buys, development, and redesign efforts.

The C-5 Mission Systems Equipment program updates the lavatory system.  The current lavatory system suffers inoperability and leakage of liquid sodium hypochlorite causing severe corrosion and burnt wires in the landing gear control panels.  A redesign of the Mission Systems Equipment program will increase safety, mitigate risk, and reduce man-hours required to repair extensive damage. 

BA7 - This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Core Mission Computer/Weather Radar program: Engineering, manufacturing, development (EMD) for the core mission computer and weather radar began in FY13. The acquisition strategy for this project considered every opportunity to use commercial components to modernize the C-5 core mission computer and weather radar and maintain aircraft availability in support of mobility missions worldwide. The strategy is for the prime contractor, Lockheed Martin Aero (LMA), to procure the core mission computer cards and weather radar, integrate and test those components, and install on two (2) EMD aircraft. The LMA negotations were completed 4 Feb 14 and were placed on contract in March 2014. The contract method is sole source. The contract type is predominately CPIF (Cost Plus Incentive Fee) with some FFP (Firm Fixed Price) elements. 

Mission Systems Equipment program:  The mission systems equipment redesign requires RDT&amp;E funding for commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) proofing. Funds are required for validation and verification of the lavatory design and installation. The Mission Systems Equipment contract method was competitive through the Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC).  Wyle Science, Technical, and Engineering Group was the selected source, and the contract type is Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>In FY2016, Project 675359, CNS/ATM Mode 5 Swift Broadband BLOS/LOS Radio, includes new start efforts.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>C-5 Communication, Navigation, Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) program:  Program is a comprehensive effort to ensure appropriate CNS/ATM system design architectures are developed and equipment is installed on the C-5 to allow aircraft operation in accordance with civil airspace access mandates for both the US National Airspace System (NAS) and international civil airspace.  Additionally, the program will add equipment to meet outstanding National Security Agency mandates for encryption of voice communications.  The C-5 CNS/ATM program ensures systems standardization and interoperability with other DoD systems to the maximum extent possible and directly supports airworthiness certification of the C-5.  CNS/ATM requirements include, but are not limited to, capabilities such as automatic dependence surveillance-broadcast out (ADS-B Out), Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) Mode 5, satellite communication equipment replacement, and beyond line-of-sight voice radio replacement.  It is anticipated equipment will be predominately commercial off-the-shelf or non-developmental items.

The current ARC-210 radio for VHF voice communications is facing diminishing manufacturing source (DMS) supply issues and additionally will no longer be capable of providing secure voice communications due to the development of new crypto algorithms.  Addition of next generation ARC-210 radios and associated cryptologic equipment will enable the C-5 to meet NSA mandates for secure communications and allow aircrews to continue to communicate securely over VHF, UHF, HF or MILSATCOM.

The current generation of satellites, which support services used on the C-5 to provide oceanic Controller/Pilot Data Link Communications (CPDLC) to Air Traffic Control and Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) beyond-line-of-sight command and control messages will no longer be functional after 2016.  The next generation of satellites will accommodate legacy C-5 SATCOM equipment for an interim period of time to allow for integration of upgraded SATCOM equipment compatible with this satellite constellation.  Without this modification, the C-5 will be unable to fly oceanic tracks and would be unable to meet aircraft separation distance requirements for civil airspace access.

ADS-B Out is a next generation surveillance technology that transitions key aspects of Air Traffic Control from terrestrial based technologies to satellite enabled technologies to provide controllers a more accurate picture of aircraft positioning.  ADS-B Out will allow aircraft to provide continuous broadcast of aircraft position to both controllers and other aircraft equipped with ADS-B In capable avionics.  International mandates for ADS-B Out for civil airspace access call for equipage by 2019 with mandates in 2020 for access to the US NAS.

This program is a Budget Activity 7, Operations Systems Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current and subsequent fiscal years.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>CNS/ATM program:  Engineering, manufacturing, development (EMD) for incorporation of the ARC-210 Gen V radio, SATCOM replacement equipment, ADS-B Out, and IFF Mode 5 into the C-5 begins in FY16.  The acquisition strategy for this program will consider every opportunity to use commercial components to modernize the C-5 CNS/ATM equipment to meet mandates for global civil airspace access.  The strategy is for the prime contractor, Lockheed Martin Aero (LMA) to procure CNS/ATM equipment, develop software, test and integrate those components, and install on two (2) EMD aircraft.  The equipment integration will require RDT&amp;E funding for commercial off-the-shelf and non-developmental item proofing.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The C-17 can perform the entire spectrum of airlift missions and is specifically designed to operate effectively and efficiently in both strategic and theater environments.  Airlift provides essential flexibility when responding to contingencies on short notice anywhere in the world.  It is a major element of America's national security strategy and constitutes the most responsive means of meeting mobility requirements.   Specific tasks associated with the airlift mission include deployment, employment, sustaining support, retrograde, and combat redeployment.  Not only can the C-17 deliver outsize cargo to austere tactical environments, but it also reduces ground time during airland operations.  The C-17 will perform its airlift mission well into this century.

C-17 RDT&amp;E funding efforts support, but are not limited to: aircraft performance improvements and airspace access mandates (i.e., Communications/Navigation Improvements); flight test activities and facilities; development of solutions for obsolescence and safety of flight issues; systems engineering/program management administration support; support for avionics laboratories; block development/change management; proposal preparation for new projects; cost estimating and engineering/acquisition studies not related to requirements generation.

In FY16, the Efforts in the C-17 R2 part C, "Accomplishments/Planned Programs", transition from Performance Improvement and Obsolescence, Systems Engineering, and Test in FY14 &amp; 15 to link RDT&amp;E funding directly to Programs on the Air Force Acquisition Master List (AML). 

As a result, funding on lines that appear as unfunded in FY16 have transitioned to the following Programs: Common Configuration (CC), Communications/Navigation and Capability Mandates(CN/CM), Extended Range Onboard Inert Gas Generating System (ER/OBIGGS)II and Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS).  

CC includes several projects: Modernized Replacement Core Integrated Processor (M-RCIP), Communication and Navigation Capability (Comm Nav), Replacement Heads Up Display (RHUD), Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) &amp; Global Air Traffic Management (GATM) updates, and Airdrop Improvements.

CN/CM includes Communication, Navigation, Surveillance &amp; Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) which is Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast Out (ADS-B out).  

ER OBIGGS II includes Onboard Inert Gas Generating System (OBIGGS) Filter Fire Fix which is a redesign of the OBIGGS II shutoff valve.

BLOS modernization includes satellite communications  and increased broadband capabilities. AERO I modernization is multi-channel voice and data delivered via an intermediate-gain antenna.
  
This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The C-130J is a medium-sized transport aircraft capable of performing a variety of combat delivery (tactical airlift) operations across a broad range of mission environments. The C-130J aircraft, with its extended (by 15 feet) fuselage, provides additional cargo carrying capacity for the USAF combat delivery mission compared with legacy C-130E/H and the C-130J (short). Special mission variants of the C-130J conduct airborne psychological operations (EC-130J), weather reconnaissance (WC-130J), search and rescue (HC-130J), and special operations (MC-130J and AC-130J). All aircraft variants must be capable of worldwide operations.

This program provides RDT&amp;E funding for required capabilities that are grouped as "Block" upgrades or "Capability" updates.  Currently, Block 7.0/8.1 and Capability Management Updates (CMUs) add capabilities to address Communication, Navigation, Surveillance, and Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) requirements. All are collaborative efforts between Seven Nations. Content/requirements for block modifications is documented in International Program Directives (IPDs) as determined in the Cooperative Systems and Software Upgrade Requirements Management (COSSURM) process.

The HC/MC Recap Program will integrate the common-core capabilities developed under this program into the HC-130J, MC-130J and AC-130J.  

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The C-130J aircraft will be modified using a "block upgrade" strategy. The CNS/ATM, navigation safety requirement will initially, be met in three block upgrades. Block 6.0 development was funded from FY03-07. Block 7.0 started in FY07, and Block 8.1 which began in FY12. Subsequently, C-130J modifications will be grouped into smaller CNS/ATM software only updates known as Capability Management Updates (CMU).  CMU development is planned to commence upon contract award Q3/2015. Other AMC initiatives include Mission Planning (Mission Computer) upgrades due to Flight Management System (FMS) Software updates.

In order to better manage the fleet and to avoid having to simultaneously support three separate aircraft configurations (Block 6, Block 7 and Block 8.1) the USAF has decided to combine the Block 7 and Block 8.1 mods.  This will allow the aircraft and trainers to only have to be modified one time.

The proportion of CNS/ATM and navigation safety requirements allocated to Blocks 6.0 through 8.1 was determined via a design trade study conducted by Lockheed Martin (the C-130J prime contractor) and verified by the C-130J system program office and AMC. The development costs are being shared via a global Project Arrangement (PA) by the United States (USAF, USMC, USCG), the United Kingdom, Italy, Australia, Denmark, Canada, and Norway. An international program office (IPO), with USAF lead (Wright Patterson AFB, OH), manages the block upgrades development effort. Retrofit of a Block on the aircraft is the responsibility of each nation.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project will enhance aircrew simulator fidelity utilizing aircraft flight tests to gather data to accurately emulate ground effect, nose wheel and engine-out data points. Currently the simulator is approved to accomplish only 50% of annual assault landings. This added capability will allow more training to be accomplished in the simulator so the aircraft will be available for more real world missions.  The ability to accomplish more training in the simulator also reduces the annual aircraft O&amp;M requirement.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>One C-130J will be instrumented to collect data during takeoff, approach and landing phases of flight.  This data will be used to enable the C-130J Weapon System Trainers to more accurately emulate ground effect, nose wheel, and engine out data points so the simulator will land more like the aircraft.  The ability to accomplish more training in the simulator also reduces the annual aircraft O&amp;M requirement.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasures (LAIRCM) system is an evolutionary acquisition program that provides significantly improved defensive systems capability for DoD aircraft to counter the infrared (IR) man-portable air-defense systems (MANPADS) missile threat.  The current LAIRCM system configuration [AN/AAQ-24V] consists of an ultra-violet missile warning sensor (MWS), a laser transmitter assembly, control interface unit (CIU) and processors to detect, track, jam and counter incoming IR missiles.  The number of sensors and turrets per aircraft is determined by the size and signature of the aircraft.  The system is fully automatic following system power-up.  LAIRCM requirements are documented in the multi-command Operational Requirements Document (ORD) LAIRCM ORD 314-92, validated on 03 Aug 98.  The system was first fielded on the C-17 aircraft.

The baseline program development is complete and consists of the small laser transmitter assembly (SLTA), ultra-violet MWS, processor, control interface unit (CIU) and a repeater (on some aircraft) to meet the need for advanced IR countermeasures.  The Guardian Laser Transmitter Assembly (GLTA) is an upgrade to the baseline transmitter equipment to improve reliability, enhance performance, address obsolescence issues, reduce mass and improve overall functionality.  First production GLTA delivery occurred in June 08.

Development of the Next Generation Missile Warning System (NexGen MWS) is complete and includes new hardware that improves capability.  Baseline equipment (ultra-violet MWS) will be retrofitted with the NexGen MWS as it becomes available.  Developmental test/operational test (DT/OT) was conducted in FY10 with initial operational test and evaluation (IOT&amp;E) in FY11.  

Per DoD direction, LAIRCM program will accomplish aircraft integration and testing and provide integration support/Hardware buys to incorporate LAIRCM on new platforms, upon request of AMC, AFSOC, multiple potential tanker aircraft variants, and other federal agencies.  The last integration effort will be completed in FY14.

LAIRCM upgrades include, but are not limited to hardware and software upgrades and testing of the LAIRCM system to maintain defensive capability against new and emerging threats.  Capabilities include engagement reporting (ER), Closed Loop Infrared Countermeasures (CLIRCM) and other emerging capabilities to upgrade/update system threat defeating ability. 

Current and future efforts include Threat Analysis; Modeling, Simulation and Emulation Test; Hardware, Software and Firmware Upgrades; Virtual System Integration Lab (SIL) Development; and Studies and Analysis.

Threat Analysis:  Threat analysis encompasses the activities to support threat exploitation analysis of a variety of threats (both known and emerging) against the current LAIRCM jam code with the intent of determining if jam code updates are required.  Typical threat analysis activities include:  Threat seeker characterization; model development for advanced threat IR seekers; development and testing of new infrared countermeasures concepts, techniques, and hardware; new technology assessment for potential incorporation into the LAIRCM system, and the evaluation/exploitation of new threats and threat characteristics relative to IRCM.  

Modeling, Simulation, and Emulation Testing:  Modeling, simulation, and emulation activities verify and validate the information obtained from the threat analysis activities.  These activities include:  Evaluation of infrared countermeasures (IRCM) techniques used in defeating real threat hardware; developing and evaluating jam code; validating and verifying integration of LAIRCM system components to newly developed jam codes, software or hardware; evaluating system effectiveness; performing platform integration support tests; and conducting predictive risk reduction tests prior to Live Missile Fire Test (LMFT) or on aircraft flight testing.  

Hardware, Software, and Firmware Upgrades:  Includes changes of any kind to any LAIRCM hardware components/support equipment with the purpose of adding capability, features, and enhancements which do not presently exist to ensure the LAIRCM system remains viable against current and emerging threats.  
    -----Hardware upgrade activities include engineering tasks required to design, develop, test and produce new capabilities, features, and enhancements, and changes of any kind to any portion of LAIRCM hardware with the purpose of adding capability, features and enhancements which do not presently exist.  
    -----Software upgrade activities include engineering tasks required to design, develop, and test the new or modified code that result in new capabilities, features, and enhancements and changes of any kind to any portion of LAIRCM software with the purpose of adding capability, features and enhancements which do not presently exist.  Software upgrades can occur in any of the Line Replaceable Unit (LRU) Operation Flight Programs as well as any of the software residing in other LAIRCM-associated components including those systems which support development and test or the LAIRCM support equipment.  
    -----Firmware upgrade activities include engineering tasks required to design, develop, and test the upgrades and those changes resulting from hardware and software updates/modifications as well as firmware upgrades which add new features.

Virtual SIL Development:  Incrementally design, develop, integrate, and test software code and purchase associated infrastructure (i.e., computers, servers, commercial-of-the-self (COTS) software, etc.) necessary to develop and implement a virtual SIL providing a critical capability for testing the LAIRCM system to ensure continued effectiveness against current and emerging threats.       

Studies and Analysis:  Includes logistics, programmatic, and engineering studies and analysis activities to ensure continued system viability and sustainability and compliance with acquisition directives.  These activities may include the evaluation of low cost/high payback opportunities to reduce software development/implementation cost, enhance production efficiency, and improve life cycle costs through increased reliability and reduced repair and return cost.

Program management and administration efforts consist of, but are not limited to contract services and Government costs.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The KC-10A Extender is an aerial refueling asset built on the commercial DC-10 airframe.  The aircraft creates an air bridge enabling rapid global mobility and global strike missions.  There are 59 KC-10A aircraft in the USAF tanker fleet.  RDT&amp;E funds throughout the FYDP will be used to support the Mode 5 modification effort.  

The Mode 5 modification is a DoD-mandated (JROCOM 047-07, 5 Mar 07 directs KC-10 IOC by 2014, FOC by 2020) upgrade to the KC-10's Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) system (the primary means of aircraft identification, used for command and control, during Air Defense operations).  The Mode 5 upgrade increases anti-spoofing capabilities and lowers the possibility of aircraft/aircrew loss due to misidentification of friendly aircraft.  The modification includes a  APX-119 Mode 5 capable transponder, new KIV-77 Mode 5 crypto applique replacing the KIV-119, integration into the CNS/ATM avionics with control via the Central Display Unit, removal of the existing IFF control panel, and minor wiring changes. 

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This line item previously supported two Presidential support airlift modernization efforts:  Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization (PAR) and VC-25A Avionics Modernization Program (AMP).  FY15 and beyond, Project 675355 Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization efforts will be executed in PE0401319F, Project 655250, Presidential Aircraft Recap in order to improve transparency for ACAT I acquisition programs; this line item is dedicated soley to VC-25A AMP.

VC-25A AMP assures unrestricted global access to civilian and military airspace to support the President of the United States as Head of State, Chief Executive, and Commander in Chief.  AMP upgrades use a systems approach to aid pilot awareness and alleviate task saturation enhancing safety in a high technology concentrated airspace environment.  VC-25A AMP is a required modification to address safety of flight and to ensure the viability of the Presidential support airlift fleet until PAR is fielded.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>In FY 2015, PE 0401314 Presidential Aircraft Replacement, Project 675355 Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization, was transferred to PE 0401319 Presidential Aircraft Replacement, Project 655250 Presidential Aircraft Recap (PAR), BA07 to improve transparency for ACAT I program.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The PAR program plans to replace the current VC-25A fleet with a new fleet of aircraft to meet the requirements for the President of the United States to execute the three roles of Head of State, Chief Executive, and Commander in Chief. The PAR aircraft will be a four engine commercial derivative wide-body aircraft, uniquely missionized to provide the President of the United States, staff, and guests with safe and reliable air transportation with the equivalent level of communications capability and security available in the White House.  Modifications will include: electrical upgrades to include dual Auxiliary Power Units (APUs); mission communications system; passenger communications; work and rest environment; executive interiors; military avionics; self-defense systems; autonomous enplaning and deplaning; and autonomous baggage loading. There will be no significant change in the Concept of Operations (CONOPS) or Concept of Employment (CONEMP) from the existing VC-25A platform. 

On 28 August 2012, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (USD (AT&amp;L)) approved the PAR Materiel Development Decision (MDD) and tasked the Air Force to conduct a Requirements and Sustainment Trade Analysis (RASTA).  RASTA analysis identified the non-tradable requirements and revalidated the need for a four-engine wide-body aircraft.  The RASTA results were presented to the Defense Acquisition Board in August 2013 and were incorporated into the Capability Development Document (CDD).  The CDD was validated by the Air Force Requirements Oversight Council (AFROC) in May 2014 and by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) in November 2014. 

This budget supports acquisition planning efforts and studies as well as pre-Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract studies for PAR.  Acquisition planning, program documentation and risk reduction studies include systems engineering strategy and analysis; risk analysis and management; concept definition and trade studies; test and evaluation strategy; life cycle cost estimates; sustainment and logistics analysis; information support and network analysis; technology and manufacturing maturity analysis and other government costs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>VC-25A Avionics Modernization Program (AMP) assures unrestricted global access to civilian and military airspace to support the President of the United States as Head of State, Chief Executive, and Commander in Chief.  AMP upgrades use a systems approach to aid pilot awareness and alleviate task saturation enhancing safety in a high technology concentrated airspace environment.  VC-25A AMP is a required modification to ensure the viability of the Presidential support airlift fleet until the Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization (PAR) program is fielded.  

AMP complies with mandates for civil Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) Out and Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) Mode 5 and provides an improved Advisory Vertical Navigation (VNAV) capability.  It will incorporate multiple subsystems, to include, but not limited to, maneuver camera system, large cockpit displays, and navigation radios to increase the utility and safety of the VC-25A.  Provisions for the military ADS-B Out will also be provided. Installations are aligned with the aircraft heavy maintenance schedule.  

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>VC-25A AMP is accomplished by developmental integration of commercial off-the-shelf systems, hardware procurement and installation is accomplished to align with heavy maintenance depot schedules.  An Undefinitized Contract Action (UCA) was issued in Jun 12.  The UCA will be definitized with a Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF) type contract.  The CPIF contract covers the engineering RDT&amp;E effort through CDR in FY15.  The remaining RDT&amp;E effort including the first kit, install and flight test will be awarded in FY15 and conclude in FY18 with delivery of the first aircraft.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>In FY2015, PE 0401318F (BA05), CV-22, Project 654103 CV-22, efforts were transferred to PE 0401318F (BA07), CV-22, Project 676033 CV-22 RDT&amp;E Post Production in order to align efforts in Budget Activity 07, Operational System Development, since CV-22 has been fielded.

In FY2016, Project 676033 includes new start effort for Aircraft Electrical Power upgrade.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The CV-22 is a Special Operations Forces (SOF) variant of the 1st generation V-22 tilt-rotor, multi-mission aircraft.  CV-22 RDT&amp;E funding provides for development, integration, testing, and enhancement of mission critical capabilities to insert, extract, and re-supply SOF in politically and/or militarily denied areas.  

Block 20:  RDT&amp;E funding provides for improved long-range communications, situational awareness capabilities, and additional aircraft software upgrades needed to address operational requirements specified in the V-22 Block C/20 Capabilities Production Document.  

Enhanced Self-Deployment:  RDT&amp;E funding provides for the design, development, and testing of aircraft modifications to improve aircraft self-deployment capabilities (e.g., operating range, global response time).  

Improved Inlet Solution (IIS):  RDT&amp;E funding provides for design, development, and testing of modifications to the CV-22 propulsion system to reduce ingestion of sand/dust and other particulate matter in austere operating environments.  These upgrades will signficantly improve engine Time on Wing (TOW) and overall aircraft readiness/availability, and reduce platform operating/life cycle costs.  

Communications, Navigation, Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM):  RDT&amp;E funding provides for upgrades and enhancements to the CV-22 navigation, flight management, and aircraft Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) systems that will bring the aircraft into compliance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and international mandates and other technical guidance for access to, and operations within worldwide airspace.

Aircraft Electrical Power:  RDT&amp;E funding provides for upgrades to the CV-22 electrical power distribution system to meet the power demands of on-going and planned avionics system improvements.  This modification also addresses single-point failure modes in the aircraft Variable Frequency Generator (VFG) system that put aircraft and flight crew at risk from disabled ice protection, avionics cooling, and fuel management systems.  Additionally, components in the VFG have experienced poor reliability, high failure rates, and long repair turnaround times.  This upgrade will provide more of the needed electrical power than the current system is capable of supplying.  

Other/Future Capabilities:  The V-22 Joint Program Office continually assesses user-specified requirements for improved operational safety, suitability, and mission effectiveness.  Funding also provides for future modification planning, and for aircraft engineering changes/upgrades to address diminishing manufacturing source (DMS) and component obsolescence issues that adversely effect aircraft readiness and operational availability rates. 
 
USSOCOM and USAF jointly fund many CV-22 development projects.  USSOCOM funds the development, integration and testing of SOF-unique mission equipment/capabilities, while the USAF funds service-common/basic air vehicle enhancements, CV-22 implementation and testing of MV-22 configuration changes, integration of Air Force and Navy maintenance and information systems used with the CV-22, and support for aircraft qualification and operational testing.  USSOCOM and USAF jointly fund corrective measures for identified aircraft deficiencies, and for Block 20 development.  Block 20 Increments 1 and 3 were developed with USAF funds, and Increment 2 was developed with USSOCOM funds. 

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational Systems Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current year.

In FY2016, Project 676033 includes new start effort for Aircraft Electrical Power upgrade.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The V-22 Joint Program Office NAVAIRSYSCOM PMA-275 is developing new capabilities for the V-22 in block increments.  Block 0 and Block 10 have been developed &amp; fielded, and Block 20 development is scheduled to complete 31 Dec 2015.  NAVAIRSYSCOM awarded a cost plus fixed fee contract for IIS development and test in June 2014 with BA05 funds.  After FY14, BA07 funds continue this effort.  CNS/ATM development will be contracted with Raytheon and Bell-Boeing.  The FY15 effort will be purchased sole source on a delivery order to an existing IDIQ (Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity) contract with Raytheon.  The FY16 effort will be purchased sole source on a delivery order to an existing BOA (Basic Ordering Agreement) with Bell-Boeing.  

Development activities for the V-22 program are performed primarily by the prime contractor, Bell-Boeing, selected on a sole-source basis.  Bell-Boeing is a strategic partnership between Bell Helicopter and Boeing Integrated Defense Systems.  Efforts are underway to increase competition where feasible, depending primarily on the level of platform integration required.  

OSD re-designated the V-22 program from ACAT ID to ACAT IC on 24 Jul 2012.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

In addition, the Special Operations Forces (SOF) peculiar development efforts were funded by USSOCOM MFP-11 funding.

IIS Development Target Value of Contract differs from total cost because this is a Joint development funded by Navy and Air Force.  Navy funding for IIS is shown in RDT&amp;E,N PE 0604262N budget exhibit.</r2:Remarks>

In FY 2016, PE 0401319F, Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization, Project 655250 Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization is transferred to BA 05 PE 0401319F, Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization, Project 655250 Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization to align BA with stage of development.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The PAR program plans to replace the current VC-25A fleet with a new fleet of aircraft to meet the requirements for the President of the United States to execute the three roles of Head of State, Chief Executive, and Commander in Chief. The PAR aircraft will be a four engine commercial derivative wide-body aircraft, uniquely missionized to provide the President of the United States, staff, and guests with safe and reliable air transportation with the equivalent level of communications capability and security available in the White House.  Specialized mission equipment will include: electrical upgrades to include dual Auxiliary Power Units (APUs); mission communications system; passenger communications; work and rest environment; executive interiors; military avionics; self-defense systems; autonomous enplaning and deplaning; and autonomous baggage loading. There will be no significant change in the Concept of Operations (CONOPS) or Concept of Employment (CONEMP) from the existing VC-25A platform. 

On 28 August 2012, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (USD (AT&amp;L)) approved the PAR Materiel Development Decision (MDD) and tasked the Air Force to conduct a Requirements and Sustainment Trade Analysis (RASTA).  RASTA analysis identified the non-tradable requirements and revalidated the need for a four-engine wide-body aircraft.  The RASTA results were presented to the Defense Acquisition Board in August 2013 and were incorporated into the Capability Development Document (CDD).  The CDD was validated by the Air Force Requirements Oversight Council (AFROC) in May 2014 and by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) in November 2014. 

This budget supports acquisition planning efforts and studies as well as pre-Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract studies for PAR.  Acquisition planning, program documentation and risk reduction studies include systems engineering strategy and analysis; risk analysis and management; concept definition and trade studies; test and evaluation strategy; life cycle cost estimates; sustainment and logistics analysis; information support and network analysis; technology and manufacturing maturity analysis and other government costs. PAR pre-EMD studies support requirements decomposition, improve affordability and reduce program execution risk.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Special Tactics/Combat Control, Special Tactics (ST) System Development project focuses on modernization developments for the Battlefield Airmen Operations (BAO) Kit. The project is a program within the overarching Battlefield Airmen Modernization (BA-Mod) Program. BAO Kit will develop, test, train and modernize the existing and future Family of Systems (FoS) that provides a state-of-the-art Command, Control, Communications, Computer, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) suite for Air Force Special Operations Command's (AFSOC's) Battlefield Airmen. Efforts in the Special Tactics System Development project focus on reducing the risk of fratricide and substantially reducing size and weight of the equipment carried through three core capabilities: Human Machine Interface (HMI), Line of Sight (LOS) targeting, and Machine to Machine (M2M) C4ISR System.

This program will develop and enhance technologies for Battlefield Airmen Special Tactics Operators (STO)/Combat Controllers (CCT) to recognize, identify, range, nominate and designate targets during both day and night operations. BAO Kit will also significantly reduce the time required to find, fix, track, target and engage the enemy by providing highly accurate target grid coordinates in three dimensions, generating target imagery both pre and post-strike, and transmitting target data to Command and Control centers. All BAO Kit systems are light, compact and portable for use by dismounted Battlefield Airmen. FY16 BAO Kit funding will provide significant improvements in operational capability, situational awareness and precision lethality in the battle space and continue to build and enhance the BAO Kit system of systems. These efforts will deliver enhanced capability for the dismounted soldier in terms of dramatic weight reduction and increased mission effectiveness across the conflict spectrum.

The Special Tactics (ST) System Development activities also include studies and analysis to support both current and future program planning and execution.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

The FY2016 funding request was reduced by $0.260 million to account for the availability of prior execution balances.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program develops, tests, and evaluates national and Air Force measurement standards (hardware) and calibration equipment in support of all Air Force programs and activities, including Precision Measurement Equipment Laboratories (PMELs) worldwide.  Metrology research and development provides technology to support systems in all phases of development and acquisition, as well as Air Force R&amp;D laboratories, test ranges, ground test facilities, and operational weapons systems support. Rapidly changing technology requires continuing research and development of measurement standards and calibration equipment to ensure modern weapon systems meet Air Force readiness objectives. This program addresses all metrology disciplines and includes the technology areas of laser, infrared, microwave, millimeter wave, optical, physical, mechanical, electrical, electronic, and ionizing radiation measurements. Metrology is a technical discipline devoted to the science of measurements and to the study and improvement of measurement technology.  Measurements are the foundation of military system development, quality assurance, hardware conformance testing and system readiness tests.  The integrity of these tests is assured through calibration and traceability assurance schemes.  The capability to measure and calibrate must parallel the emergence of new technology, new ranges, and new capabilities of military systems.  Lack of new measurement capability impedes or blocks the successful exploitation of new technologies, especially in the movement from development laboratory to production to deployment.  R&amp;D efforts are essential within the DoD to pace these requirements, otherwise, these same new systems will suffer time delays, excessive cost, and increased risk due to unreliable test results in all phases of development, production, deployment and operation.    

Program is managed by Air Force Material Command, Agile Combat Support Directorate, Air Force Metrology Division (WNM).

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Air Force requires an integrated logistics capability that provides timely, accurate and reliable information to decision makers at all levels of command and across the full range of military operations.  

The Air Force is applying the lessons learned from the Expeditionary Combat Support System (ECSS) Acquisition Incident Review (AIR) in development of a hybrid approach of core logistics system remediation / modification and transformation, to include transitioning to a common IT hosting environment.

Financial Improvement Audit Readiness (FIAR) and Software Upgrades

The remediation and modification of core logistics systems is necessary for the Air Force to meet statutory Financial Improvement Audit Readiness (FIAR) by 2017 and align with the Joint Chiefs of Staff J-4 Concept for Logistics and the Air Force Logistics Board's approved Enterprise Logistics Strategy (ELS).  The Air Force planned for ECSS to subsume most of the Service's core logistics systems upon fielding and therefore placed them in barebones reduced maintenance status during the ECSS program.  Due to the cancellation of ECSS, the Air Force must sustain and modernize these systems through both FIAR Remediation, to address the most immediate gaps in meeting FIAR by the 2017 statutory deadline, and Software Upgrades, to reduce high operating costs, implement previously deferred statutory compliance requirements and improve near term system performance. 
 
Systems contained in these business areas include, but are not limited to, the Air Force Equipment Management System (AFEMS), Integrated Maintenance Data System (IMDS), Reliability and Maintainability Information System (REMIS), Combat Ammunitions System (CAS), Enhanced Maintenance Operations Center (EMOC), Aircraft Structural Integrity Management Information System (ASIMIS), Integrated Logistics System-Supply (ILS-S), Cargo Movement Operations System (CMOS), Stock Control System (SCS), Purchase Request Process System (PRPS), Automated Logistics Management Support System (ALMSS), Depot Maintenance Accounting and Production System (DMAPS), Enhanced Technical Information Management System (ETIMS), and Weapon System Management Information System (WSMIS).

Transformation 

The Air Force must transform its logistics business processes and transition away from using numerous stovepipe systems and process flows that execute the same tasks.  Eliminating process redundancies across the logistics enterprise will enable the Air Force to execute more efficient, cost-effective and integrated logistics in the long term.  The objective of Transformation is to conduct business process reengineering (BPR) to identify and eliminate overlaps in our current processes and where appropriate, implement the use of new information technology systems.  

The Air Force Service Development and Delivery Process (SDDP) is being applied as part of this BPR effort to apply discipline and focus to the task of process reengineering and requirements development in order to reduce risk and successfully transform logistics IT systems.  In the SDDP, the requirements definition, architecture and design for an IT capability is a government-owned process.  The SDDP ensures the AF end user and Sponsor consider all possible doctrine, organization, training, material, leadership, personnel and facility (DOTMLPF) solutions to the end user's need/problem before a materiel solution is sought.  The SDDP is a six-step process, each step with its own specific product outcomes that serve as the basis for downstream activities in the SDDP and facilitating enterprise-level analysis to maximize reuse of existing capabilities.  Maximizing reuse will eliminate duplicate implementation actions across the Air Force and assure individual user problems or needs are not solved at the cost of overall enterprise benefits.  The outcome of using the SDDP is a well-described requirement which may include a materiel solution, in which case the SDDP details the acquisition and implementation activities to support delivery of the capability.  Alternatively, success may be demonstrated by the resolution of the user's problem without a materiel solution.  

The Air Force logistics enterprise is comprised of multiple overarching functional areas, to include maintenance, repair and overhaul, end-to-end supply chain support, base supply inventories, and predictive analysis and forecasting.  The Air Force will standardize its business processes within each major logistics functional area through Transformation Capability Initiatives (CI).  Transformation CIs include, but are not limited to: Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MROi), Supply Chain Management (SCM), and Product Lifecycle Management (PLM).

-MROi will create an integrated capability that plans, schedules, and executes organic depot maintenance support functions critical to agile planning, optimized workload assignment, resource allocation and throughput, thereby increasing depot maintenance support to the warfighter.  

-SCM includes Supply, Item Master, and Government Furnished Materiel (GFM) initiatives.

-SCM Supply encompasses centralized planning and management of items and equipment such as: repairables, consumables, Nuclear Weapons-Related Materiel (NWRM) and cryptographic items and comprises business operations and inventory for the Air Force Base Supply community. 

-SCM Item Master provides the capability to manage comprehensive, accurate, reliable item master data (e.g., accurate identification and authorization of owners and users of items).

-SCM GFM will provide AF accountability for contractor managed government material and reporting of logistics and financial data.  AF will be able to track end-to-end logistics and financial transactions, provide total asset visibility (TAV) and report equipment and material inventory values.  

-PLM enables Air Force engineering/logistics communities to define, track, protect and manage product data for Air Force weapon systems and equipment.  The Air Force requires the ability to control configuration of the product throughout the life of the asset. Standardized configuration control will ensure validity, accuracy and reliability, currency, and security of the product information which will increase weapon system readiness by decreasing costs to manage, protect, store and deliver product information.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Financial Improvement Audit Readiness (FIAR) and Software Upgrades

Systems contained in these business areas include, but are not limited to, the Air Force Equipment Management System (AFEMS), Integrated Maintenance Data System (IMDS), Reliability and Maintainability Information System (REMIS), Combat Ammunitions System (CAS), Enhanced Maintenance Operations Center (EMOC), Aircraft Structural Integrity Management Information System (ASIMIS), Integrated Logistics System-Supply (ILS-S), Cargo Movement Operations System (CMOS), Stock Control System (SCS), Purchase Request Process System (PRPS), Automated Logistics Management Support System (ALMSS), Depot Maintenance Accounting and Production System (DMAPS), Enhanced Technical Information Management System (ETIMS), and Weapon System Management Information System (WSMIS).

Transformation 

The Air Force logistics enterprise is comprised of multiple overarching functional areas, to include maintenance, repair and overhaul, end-to-end supply chain support, base supply inventories, and predictive analysis and forecasting.  The Air Force will standardize its business processes within each major logistics functional area through Transformation Capability Initiatives (CI).  Transformation CIs include but are not limited to:  Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MROi), Supply Chain Management (SCM), and Product Lifecycle Management (PLM).

-MROi will create an integrated capability that plans, schedules, and executes organic depot maintenance support functions critical to agile planning, optimized workload assignment, resource allocation and throughput, thereby increasing depot maintenance support to the warfighter.  

-SCM includes Supply, Item Master, and Government Furnished Materiel (GFM) Accountability initiatives.

-SCM Supply encompasses centralized planning and management of items and equipment such as: repairables, consumables, Nuclear Weapons-Related Materiel (NWRM) and cryptographic items and comprises business operations and inventory for the Air Force Base Supply community. 

-SCM Item Master provides the capability to manage comprehensive, accurate, reliable item master data (e.g., accurate identification and authorization of owners and users of items).

-SCM GFM Accountability will provide AF accountability for contractor managed government material and reporting of logistics and financial data.  AF will be able to track end-to-end logistics and financial transactions, provide total asset visibility (TAV) and report equipment and material inventory values.  

-PLM enables Air Force engineering/logistics communities to define, track, protect and manage product data for Air Force weapon systems and equipment.  The Air Force requires the ability to control configuration of the product throughout the life of the asset. Standardized configuration control will ensure validity, accuracy and reliability, currency, and security of the product information which will increase weapon system readiness by decreasing costs to manage, protect, store and deliver product information.  

-BA7 - This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>SCM GFM Accountability will provide AF accountability for contractor managed government material and reporting of logistics and financial data.  AF will be able to track end-to-end logistics and financial transactions, provide total asset visibility (TAV) and report equipment and material inventory values.  

Note: This is not a new start.  The FY15 PB submission included all Supply Chain Management efforts (SCM Supply, SCM Item Master, and SCM Government Furnished Materiel (GFM)) under a single initiative called Supply Chain Management (SCM).  In the FY16 PB, the AF divided SCM into three sub-initiatives to provide additional visibility into the specific mission process areas that will be addressed.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Implement changes to Sustainability Assessment Module (SAM) such as incorporation of the tools into SAM Operational Plans (OPLANS) that will allow it to access multiple OPLANS and multiple versions of an OPLAN.  The current SAM production software is designed to support the assessment of individual units to support Status of Resources and Training System (SORTS) assessments, etc.

This is not a new start; all post-ECSS FIAR remediation and modification efforts for AF IT logistics IT systems were documented in the FY13 and FY14 justification materials for PE 0708610F under the Mission Description and Budget Item justification sections.</r2:Description>

These projects will use Firm Fixed Price contracts to the maximum extent possible as the programs establish new contracts or task orders.  To improve the efficiency of the contracting process and reduce contract cycle time, the core logistics system program offices plan to use the existing NETCENTS-2 contract vehicle utilizing Best Value acquisition methodology where possible.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY 2016, PE 0708611 Support Systems Development, Project 673318, Product Data Systems Modernization efforts transferred to PE 0708610F, Logistics Information Technology (Log IT), Project 675207 to align with the Enhanced Technical Information Management System (ETIMS) modification efforts funded within the Log IT PE.

In FY 2016, PE 0708611 Support Systems Development, Project Number 675042, Logistics Application Logistics Integration (LALI), the F-35 User Identification Data Exchange System (UIDES) effort was transfered to PE 0604800F, F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter, in order to align the activity under the F-35 RDT&amp;E Program Element.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element contains two active projects [project 673318, Product Data System Modernization (PDSM), and project 675042, Logistics Application Logistics Integration (LALI)].

Project 673318: PDSM funds modifications to the Enhanced Technical Information System (ETIMS) Enterprise, which supports Air Force Technical Order management, storage and distribution critical to depot maintenance activities.  ETIMS activities include  studies and analysis to support both current and future program planning and program execution to include Nuclear Weapons Related Material (NWRM) technical data requirements.

Project 675042: LALI includes funding for Logistics, Installations and Mission Support - Enterprise View (LIMS-EV) and F-35 User IT Data Exchange Service (UIDES).  

LIMS-EV provides integrated, singular information from multiple source systems through the Global Combat Support System - Air Force (GCSS-AF) Integration Framework (IF) to Air Force decision makers.  Funding for LIMS-EV supports Business Intelligence (BI) development efforts that enhance the AF logistics community's ability to perform configurable alerting, predictive/what-if analysis and further integrate support equipment, vehicle, munitions, supply, commodities and components (e.g. engines, landing gears, fuel) to increase weapons system  and total asset visibility (TAV).    

Funding for F-35 UIDES will continue Air Force development of a F-35 Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS) - User IT Data Exchange Service that supports current and future Information Exchange Requirement (IER) data transfer capability from the F-35 ALIS into data reports and configurable tables to receive, store and integrate F-35 operations, maintenance, training and financial data within existing Air Force enterprise views to support the growing fleet of AF F-35 aircraft.  Funding supports development of an enhanced data sharing capability (ability to consume increased volume and variety of ALIS IER data) to support depot data configuration and integration requirements.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program/project planning and execution and future program/project planning.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

The FY2016 funding request was reduced by $2.224 million to account for the availability of prior execution balances.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Logistics, Installations and Mission Support - Enterprise View (LIMS-EV) funding supports Business Intelligence (BI) development of a dashboard capability used by senior leaders to access integrated, one-version-of-truth information from multiple source systems.  LIMS-EV funding will extend current BI capabilities to provide configurable alerting, predictive analysis, what-if analysis and further integration of support equipment, vehicle, munitions, supply, commodities and components (engines, landing gears, fuel, etc) to increase weapons systems availability and Total Asset Visibility (TAV).

Funding for F-35 UIDES will continue Air Force development of a F-35 Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS) - User IT Data Exchange Service that supports current and future Information Exchange Requirement (IER) data transfer capability from the F-35 ALIS into data reports and configurable tables to receive, store and integrate F-35 operations, maintenance, and training data within existing Air Force enterprise views to support the growing fleet of Air Force F-35 aircraft.  This funding also supports development of an enhanced data sharing capability (ability to consume increased volume and variety of ALIS IER data) to support depot data configuration and integration requirements, and studies and analysis to support both interoperability and capability maturity plans for current and future program/project planning and execution.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY2014, Project Number 675303, Air Education and Training Command (AETC) Decision Support System (ADSS) Development, was completed.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Program supports the Air Education and Training command (AETC) Decision Support System (ADSS) which is an automated information system that provides AETC leadership and staff with key management information about training production status, including monitoring and assessment of training.  The data and reports from ADSS provide the vital feedback mechanism essential to an effective programming and management process.  The hardware and software components of ADSS interact and communicate via the DOD standard communications infrastructure.  The system uses DOD information transfer assets that provide seamless communications within and across systems and media.  Full Operational Capability (FOC) occured in FY2014.  

The Aviation Resource Management System (ARMS) is the authoritative data source for recording and managing aircrew training information, aircrew/parachutist management, flying hour tracking, flight pay management, and flying gate tracking for 70,000 Air Force members. The Air Force uses this information to enhance safety-of-flight operations and to determine eligibility to perform aviation related events. New development work is required to provide additional flying operations information, which will aid in better portraying Air Force readiness, and to feed this data into Defense Readiness Reporting System Strategic (DRRS-S). These enhanced capabilities, to be developed incrementally, include the following:  electronic flight record, support enhanced flying hour management/execution, simulator and remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) management/utilization, full career logbook, training look-back, aircrew member man-month allocation, enhanced resource and jump module management, and interface with DRRS-S.  ARMS data will also be used to support Headquarters Air Force/Major Command (HAF/MAJCOM) level readiness decision reports/analytics.  New development work in support of ARMS needs to be accomplished with RDT&amp;E versus O&amp;M funds. 

This program is Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

The FY2016 funding request was reduced by $0.129 million to account for the availability of prior execution balances.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Program supports the Air Education and Training Command (AETC) Decision Support System (ADSS) which is an automated information system that provides AETC leadership and staff with key management information about training production status, including monitoring and assessment of training.  The data and reports from ADSS provide the vital feedback mechanism essential to an effective programming and management process.  The hardware and software components of ADSS interact and communicate via the DOD standard communications infrastructure.  The system uses DOD information transfer assets that provide seamless communications within and across systems and media.  Tasks to be performed are the development of the ADSS Enterprise Information Integration (ADSS-EII) and Training Pipeline Continuum (TPC) modernization modules.  Full Operational Capability (FOC) occured FY2014.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Aviation Resource Management System (ARMS) is the authoritative data source for recording and managing aircrew training information, aircrew/parachutist management, flying hour tracking, flight pay management, and flying gate tracking for 70,000 Air Force members. The Air Force uses this information to enhance safety-of-flight operations and to determine eligibility to perform aviation related events. ARMS interfaces with the Military Personnel Data System (MilPDS) and multiple operations and flight scheduling systems such as Patriot Excalibur (PEX), Graduate Training Integration Management System (GTIMS), Center Operations On-Line (COOL), Global Decision Support System (GDSS), and Automated Aircrew Management System (AAMS) and is used to determine whom to select for flying operations, assignment actions, and promotion of aircrew members.
 
New development work is required to provide additional flying operations information, which will aid in better portraying Air Force readiness, and to feed this data into Defense Readiness Reporting System Strategic (DRRS-S). These enhanced capabilities, to be developed incrementally, include the following:  electronic flight record, support enhanced flying hour management/execution, simulator and RPA management/utilization, full career logbook, training look-back, aircrew member man-month allocation, enhanced resource and jump module management, and interface with DRRS-S.  Additional development work on the existing ARMS, such as database flattening and Business Process Reengineering (BPR) actions, is required prior to incorporating these enhanced capabilities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Defense Equal Opportunity Management Institute (DEOMI) provides grants to the civilian academic community to conduct research on military and civilian equal opportunity issues using standard social science methodology and engineering analysis.  The research methodology and analysis includes developing a literature review proposing hypotheses and methods of research.  The grantee will then gather appropriate data, draw conclusions and present discussions, recommendations and reports based on their funding.  

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Funding provides capability to conduct Personnel Recovery development efforts to upgrade systems to provide Combatant Commander and Service Personnel Recovery capabilities identified in the Personnel Recovery Initial Capabilities Document approved by Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memorandum 120-12 on 8 Aug 2012.  Includes funding for research and development, support equipment, contract services and all associated costs specifically identified to support the Joint Personnel Recovery Agency (JPRA) headquarters at Ft. Belvoir, VA and other JPRA operating locations.

In FY16, the Common Distress Reporting System (CDRS) will begin development.  CDRS will integrate all personnel locator device reporting onto the existing five Combat Survivor Evader Locater base stations to provide one common operating picture for timely and efficient recovery operations of isolated personnel.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program element provides for payment of civilian compensation benefits for disability due to personal injury sustained while in the performance of duty or due to employment-related disease according to the Federal Employees Compensation Act (FECA) under Title 5 U.S.C., Chapter 81.  The Department of Labor (DOL) administers this program and charges the Department of the Air Force for its employee costs; therefore, this is a MUST PAY bill for Air Force.  The PE excludes manpower authorizations and costs. This Program Element (PE) is in Budget Activity 7 in support of payment of civilian compensation benefits for disability due to personal injury sustained while in the performance of duty or due to employment-related disease according to the Federal Employees Compensation Act (FECA) under Title 5 U.S.C., Chapter 81.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Personnel Services Delivery (PSD), under the Personnel Administration program, funds operational developments necessary to acquire, field, and modify business processes to transform the delivery of Human Resources (HR) capabilities through the structured redesign of the Total Force Personnel Community's people (Active Duty, Reserve, Guard, and Civilians), processes, and technologies. PSD Transformation fundamentally shifts the way personnel services are provided, transitioning from primarily face-to-face interactions with a personnelist to a tiered model with services delivered through online self-service, contact centers, and fewer in-person interactions.  PSD supports the migration of legacy applications and other information technologies to a more sustainable and flexible, services-based architecture.  PSD also supports transition from the legacy Military Personnel Data System (MILPDS) to the Air Force Integrated Personnel and Pay System (AFIPPS) to improve financial auditability and track military personnel data.  To this end, PSD executes the development of several legacy personnel systems through the deployment and transitioning of applications to Department of Defense (DoD) and Commercial cloud services as part of the Federal Data Center Consolidation effort, as well as future HR application requirements which are beyond the scope of AFIPPS.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Provides for development and enhancement of modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) tools for strategic planning, operational requirements, modernization and recapitalization of systems and programs, as well as the Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution (PPBE) processes for the AF Analytic Community and Secretary of the Air Force Standard Analysis Toolkit in support of AF Senior Leadership. As new technologies are introduced to the battlefield (Digital Electronic Jammers, maneuvering Surface-to-Surface Missiles, Directed Energy Weapons, etc.) along with evolving warfighting techniques and support operations, the range of capabilities that needs to be covered by  analytic tools needs to expand as well. M&amp;S creation and enhancement can require extensive research in how to properly implement the emerging weapons capabilities as well as demand development of software techniques to implement the changes. Additionally, emerging and continuing focus areas such as Space, Irregular Warfare, Information Operations, Cyber warfare and ISR demand specific tools of their own for new exploration and development. These focus areas require examination in isolation as well as cross-domain making the problem more complex and increasing the R&amp;D challenges to field new decision support tools.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development as this budget activity includes development efforts to provide new and evolving systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

The FY2016 funding request was reduced by $0.399M to account for the availability of prior execution balances.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>In FY 2015, Project 671017, CE IT Transformation, was completed.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>NexGen IT is a key USAF effort to comply with statutory and regulatory policy and guidance associated with Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) efforts. 

NexGen IT will transform Civil Engineering (CE) business processes to improve operations and support AF priorities.  The plan is to leverage industry best practices, optimize core business processes, and replace existing outdated IT capabilities with a set of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software solutions and secure a service provider to deploy and maintain the system.  This COTS solution will provide a robust, enterprise-wide CE capability that will consist of an integrated set of embedded / configurable best business practices and capabilities to support the following CE missions:  Real Property Management (RPM), Work &amp; Supply Management (WSM), Project Management (PM), and Energy Management (EnM).  Capabilities are to be configured, tested, and deployed as Capability Groups.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element develops upgrades to existing financial management information systems. These upgrades are required to comply with auditability and transparency requirements as well as enable efficiencies in processing financial transactions. This program element also supports studies and analysis to improve future program planning and execution.

There are three projects within this program element: the Program and Budget Enterprise System (PBES), the Cost Estimating Modeling (CEM), the Defense Enterprise Accounting and Management System (DEAMS) Increment 1 (Inc 1).  A previous project, DEAMS Inc 2, was incorporated into DEAMS Inc 1 and requested FY 2015 funding was removed by Congressional action.  

PBES is a software development effort to deliver enhanced and modernized budgeting and programming capability. 

CEM is a knowledge-based study effort to provide and enhance Air Force-wide cost estimating capabilities by developing and modernizing current cost data and estimating models, methods, and tools.

DEAMS Inc 1 is a financial software modernization effort to provide the Air Force with a modern accounting and finance system. It will allow the Air Force to comply with and fulfill statutory requirements for auditability by 2017, as required in the FY2010 NDAA, and will be Standard Financial Information Structure (SFIS) and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) compliant. Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Program and Budget Enterprise Service (PBES) is a software development effort that will utilize a service oriented architecture (SOA) to deliver budgeting and programming capability for the United States Air Force (USAF). PBES will replace legacy systems such as as the Automated Budget Interactive Data Environment System (ABIDES) and the Resource Allocation Programming Information Decision System (RAPIDS) and will support the budget formulation and force programming process.

Began Release 1 Proof of Concept effort with Department of the Treasury on 23 September 2013.

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.

Air Force Corporate Structure will address funding for FY17 and beyond.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Continued development and requirements definition activities.

Initiated Release 2/3 Requirements Definition activities using organic resources.  Modifications to the Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution (PPBE) Process led to a determination that the capabilities being delivered across Releases 2 and 3 were no longer severable; thus they were combined into a single Release referred to as Release 2/3.

Initiated Release 4 Requirements Definition activities for Air Force justification books capability using organic resources.  Addressed risk management, configuration management, document management, and other activities.</r2:Text>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Cost Estimating Modeling (CEM) provides and enhances Air Force-wide cost estimating capabilities by developing and modernizing current cost data and estimating methods and tools. In collaboration with the OSD Cost Assessment Data Enterprise (CADE) project, these products will improve the quality, timeliness, and effectiveness of the acquisition program cost estimates required by statute (e.g., 10 USC 2366, 2433, 2434) and regulation (e.g., DoDI 5000.02) in support of Air Force and Department of Defense acquisition decisions, programming and execution decisions, and Congressional mandates.   

The Air Force has several requirements for research and development of new and modernized cost estimating capabilities for each weapon system type (aircraft; ballistic missiles; electronics and aircraft modifications; ground stations and automated information systems; cross cutting databases; satellites and launch vehicles; tactical missiles; and munitions). In addition, unanticipated requirements often emerge due to changing acquisition laws, regulations, initiatives; changing technologies; and evolving warfighter requirements which drive the need for cost tool updates or expanded capability. For example, current shortfalls in capability reflect efforts needed to fill gaps in response to the laws and regulations such as the FY06 NDAA report {PL 109-163--Provisions relating to Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAPs)}, Weapon System Acquisition Reform Act (WSARA) {provisions related to improving cost estimating quality, especially earlier in the program life-cycle and affordability analysis}, Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF) Acquisition Excellence Plan {priorities to improve cost estimating capability and affordability analysis and improved cost estimating support to requirements process}, and new Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) policy {better buying power initiatives on enhanced trade-off analysis, affordability analysis, and will versus should cost analysis}.   

This project will perform knowledge-based studies (KBS) analyzing historical data to produce cost estimating relationships (CERs) or statistical data to develop cost estimating databases, methods and tools across hundreds of product work breakdown structure (WBS) elements and functional cost elements within each weapon system type. The different weapon system types are: Aircraft, Ballistic Missiles, Electronics and Aircraft Modifications, Ground Stations and Automated Information Systems (AIS), Cross-Cutting Studies, Satellites and Launch Vehicles (Space Systems), and Tactical Missiles and Munitions. Some areas of cost modeling efforts that are cross-cutting within all weapon system types are: cost risk metrics, methods development, statistical model enhancements; software cost database, metrics, statistical model development; contract or engineering change order analysis models; other government cost elements (e.g., depot standup and government test); nuclear hardening; and commodity area price escalation analysis and models.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Defense Enterprise Accounting and Management System (DEAMS) is a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS), Oracle-based software implementation effort that will provide an auditable, modern accounting and finance system. DEAMS is a Joint United States Air Force (USAF) and United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Program that will replace many existing accounting and finance legacy systems and will provide core funds execution management functions consistent with financial management laws, regulations and policy, general ledger, funds management, payments, receivables, cost and revenues, and fiduciary reporting. DEAMS is compliant with the Clinger-Cohen Act, Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA), and integrates into Global Combat Support System-Air Force (GCSS-AF). When fully deployed, DEAMS will bring the Air Force in compliance with the Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) requirement in the 2010 NDAA.

DEAMS Inc 1 is planned as an eight-release program:

Release 1 - Air Mobility Command (AMC) without Transportation Working Capital Funds (TWCF)
Release 2 - AMC with TWCF, Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) Rome
Release 3 - Air Combat Command (ACC), Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC), Air Education and Training Command (AETC), Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC), and Air National Guard (ANG) Geographically Separated Units (GSUs) to include DFAS Limestone 
Release 4 - Capabilities and interfaces to support AF deployments 
Release 5 - U. S. Air Forces in Europe (USAFE), Pacific Air Forces (PACAF), and DFAS Japan
Release 6 - Air Force District of Washington (AFDW), Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), U.S. Air Force Academy (USAFA), Air Force Space Command (AFSPC), Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC), and DFAS Columbus
Release 7 - Conversion programs (Legacy elimination)
Release 8 - Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC)

DEAMS Inc 1 capability will continue to be deployed in FY2016-2017 as approved by the Milestone Decision Authority.

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>
