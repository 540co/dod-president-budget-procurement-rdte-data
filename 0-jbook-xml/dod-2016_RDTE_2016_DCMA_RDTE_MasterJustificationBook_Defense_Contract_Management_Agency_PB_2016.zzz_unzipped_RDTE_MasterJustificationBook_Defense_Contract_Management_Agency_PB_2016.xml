                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>DCMA is positioned as a unique, independent enterprise that provides DoD with capabilities not found in the Component Services, or anywhere else within Government.  In accordance with the President’s Management Agenda (PMA), DoD’s Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) “Six Areas of Focus”, and the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), DCMA is seeking to adapt, reshape and rebalance to prepare for the strategic challenges and opportunities we face in the years ahead.  As the independent eyes and ears of the DoD, national and international partners, DCMA is continually delivering actionable acquisition insight.  Adherence to Better Buying Power (BBP) 2.0 initiatives, such as controlling costs throughout the product lifecycle, incentivizing productivity, and improving tradecraft in acquisition of services, are ensuring affordability and increasing productivity.  Application of improved supply chain management directives and superior price-costing strategies will eliminate requirements imposed on industry where costs outweigh benefits.  The intent is to work with industry to collect data that will enable the Department to identify requirements that can be reduced or eliminated to reduce cost without adversely affecting performance.  Better understanding of the commercial sector will allow the Agency to properly exploit its benefits while protecting government interests.  Furthermore, we are invigorating our efforts to adjust to the changing environment through achieving and sustaining audit readiness, creating an agile and flexible learning organization/culture to support future customer programs, initiating and strengthening acquisition processes and optimizing mission execution to support the acquisition enterprise through agile business practices. 
 
DCMA’s mission is to provide Contract Administration Services (CAS) to the Department of Defense (DoD) Acquisition Enterprise and its partners to ensure delivery of quality products and services to the warfighter; on time and on cost. DCMA has two primary objectives, 1) providing CAS to the military services and other authorized customers worldwide and 2) providing contingency contract support in theater.  The Agency has worldwide acquisition impact through three Field Directorates (Operations, International, and Special Programs). The Agency's Field Directorates are regionally based. The Agency's civilian and military personnel manages over 20,063 contractors and approximately 348,000 active contracts.  

DCMA is executing a strategy to modernize and consolidate all web-based applications in concert with a new Enterprise Architecture framework that adheres strictly to the Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA). Investing in newer modern technologies that utilize business process driven frameworks will greatly improve not only the quality of the DCMA contract information but allow DCMA to realize internal process efficiencies. The web-based capabilities support DCMA's unique mission and provide cross functional capabilities that support the full range of acquisition and contract management. These capabilities help DCMA acquisition workforce access real time data; thus, enabling them to make sound contract management and business decisions. The objective behind web-based capabilities is to provide mission-effective and efficient solutions to unique sets of problems that slow down or hinder performance based contract management for DCMA and other DoD support components. 

FY 2014 Actual:  In FY 2014 ($13.812)  DCMA reengineered some of DCMA’s Contract Administration and Line of Service business processes and the toolsets that provide these capabilities. We streamlinedd business processes and consolidated toolsets that enable those capabilities to reduce operations and sustainment costs for the Department and where applicable for DCMA.  

FY 2015-2016 Plan:  In FY 2015 ($12.530) and FY 2016 ($12.542) DCMA is planning to capitalize on Information Technology (IT) investment innovations that leverage technology to achieve an agile enterprise architecture that equips the Agency with enhanced IT solutions for mission support operations and gives Agency decision-makers better data to compare options, provide ready analytic solutions, allocate resources, and improve processes.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>DCMA is positioned as a unique, independent enterprise that provides DoD with capabilities not found in the Component Services, or anywhere else within Government.  In accordance with the President’s Management Agenda (PMA), DoD’s Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) “Six Areas of Focus”, and the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), DCMA is seeking to adapt, reshape and rebalance to prepare for the strategic challenges and opportunities we face in the years ahead.  As the independent eyes and ears of the DoD, national and international partners, DCMA is continually delivering actionable acquisition insight.  Adherence to Better Buying Power (BBP) 2.0 initiatives, such as controlling costs throughout the product lifecycle, incentivizing productivity, and improving tradecraft in acquisition of services, are ensuring affordability and increasing productivity.  Application of improved supply chain management directives and superior price-costing strategies will eliminate requirements imposed on industry where costs outweigh benefits.  The intent is to work with industry to collect data that will enable the Department to identify requirements that can be reduced or eliminated to reduce cost without adversely affecting performance.  Better understanding of the commercial sector will allow the Agency to properly exploit its benefits while protecting government interests.  Furthermore, we are invigorating our efforts to adjust to the changing environment through achieving and sustaining audit readiness, creating an agile and flexible learning organization/culture to support future customer programs, initiating and strengthening acquisition processes and optimizing mission execution to support the acquisition enterprise through agile business practices. 
 
DCMA’s mission is to provide Contract Administration Services (CAS) to the Department of Defense (DoD) Acquisition Enterprise and its partners to ensure delivery of quality products and services to the warfighter; on time and on cost. DCMA has two primary objectives, 1) providing CAS to the military services and other authorized customers worldwide and 2) providing contingency contract support in theater.  The Agency has worldwide acquisition impact through three Field Directorates (Operations, International, and Special Programs). The Agency's Field Directorates are regionally based. The Agency's civilian and military personnel manages over 20,063 contractors and approximately 348,000 active contracts.  

DCMA is executing a strategy to modernize and consolidate all web-based applications in concert with a new Enterprise Architecture framework that adheres strictly to the Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA). Investing in newer modern technologies that utilize business process driven frameworks will greatly improve not only the quality of the DCMA contract information but allow DCMA to realize internal process efficiencies. The web-based capabilities support DCMA's unique mission and provide cross functional capabilities that support the full range of acquisition and contract management. These capabilities help DCMA acquisition workforce access real time data; thus, enabling them to make sound contract management and business decisions. The objective behind web-based capabilities is to provide mission-effective and efficient solutions to unique sets of problems that slow down or hinder performance based contract management for DCMA and other DoD support components.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                        <r2:Description>We are engaging with our Service Acquisition Executives to collaborate earlier in the acquisition process to ensure requirements are defined with well written entry and exit criteria, testing requirements defined, technical data addressed and risk addressed.  DCMA participation earlier in the acquisition life cycle process provides clearer requirements for execution and sustainment, reduces life cycle costs and supports better buying power.

Software development continues to be one of the main cost drivers for cost overruns.  Our in plant presence allows us to perform oversight and analysis of existing software development to include emerging critical focus areas of agile software and technology processes and leaning forward to address cybersecurity and information assurance concerns.  Our independent in-plant insight into contractor processes provides a unique acquisition insight service to our DoD customers to ensure contractor compliance in program development.  We see DCMA as a key role in mission assurance surveillance and the surveillance of complex software and network systems to support DoD initiatives. This is integral to better buying power.</r2:Description>

                                                                <r2:Text>DCMA developed solutions for using enterprise actionable data in a mobile environment. Also, continued the migration of Integrated Workload Management System (IWMS) and DCMA 360, which provides an integrated suite of DCMA collaborative web-applications.  It will be a major focus in the future as well and the development of an Enterprise Surveillance Plan tool that will analyze technical requirements and contract risk, and determine surveillance requirement.   

Also, DCMA enhanced its modification and Delivery Order System and implemented the Procurement Data Standardization (PDS).  PDS is a system-agnostic data standard that is intended to be adopted and implemented DoD-wide for creation, translation, processing, and sharing of procurement actions. It defines the minimum requirements for contract writing system output to improve visibility and accuracy of contract-related data.  Also, it supports interoperability of DoD acquisition systems; and standardizes and streamlines the procure-to-pay business process.  Further, the PDS will improve visibility of contract-related data, enabling senior DoD leadership to make better informed business decisions.  And finally, this data standard will support future migration to enterprise and federal systems and processes where appropriate. 

DCMA worked in concert with the Defense Procurement Acquisition Policy (DPAP) contract on building a contract file structure within IWMS by improving: Storage Taxonomy and Standardization; Contract Administration Business Processes and efficiency; and filing of electronic contract documents.  DCMA has engaged DPAP and plans on utilizing the Distributed Virtual Electronic File structure as a basis for storing the electronic files.  The IWMS effort will help DPAP and the Department: avoid redundancy, establish master documentation sources; automate document processing, and clarify records retention.

DCMA was engaged in DPAP PDS XML to ANSI X12 Mapping. DPAP requested assistance from DCMA to test and validate a data translation capability that converts data exchanged between Contract Writing Systems (CWSs) and Mechanization Of Contract Administration Services (MOCAS) into the PDS format, further promoting the integration of contract data and interoperability of related CAS systems across the DoD enterprise. This capability will significantly reduce the number of data translation mappings DCMA currently sustains on behalf of our MOCAS trading partners, further streamlining Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) transmissions of awards and modifications into MOCAS, reducing the cost of manual processing invoices into MOCAS.

Additionally, DCMA supported SeaPort CWS (EDI) Development and Certification. DCMA provided technical support to the Navy to develop, test and deploy EDI translation maps for SeaPort, one of several Navy CWSs that award and administer contracts for the Department.  Prior to DCMAs involvement, the Seaport system was not capable or certified to transmit awards and modifications via EDI to MOCAS, causing the Navy to pay a much higher manual rate for payment of invoices. Development and certification was completed in early FY 2014, the Navy projects a savings of $800K annually.

Further, DCMA streamlined and improved communication processes and interfaces in the areas of Contract Administration Services improving data exchange across the DoD Acquisition Enterprise.</r2:Text>

Our goal is to streamline business processes and consolidate toolsets that enable those capabilities to reduce operations and sustainment costs for the Department and where applicable for DCMA.  In order to accomplish this goal DCMA will need to invest in the research, purchase, and development of the new capabilities.

In addition DCMA is capitalizing on Information Technology (IT) investment innovations that leverage technology to achieve an agile enterprise architecture that equips the Agency with enhanced IT solutions for mission support operations and gives Agency decision-makers better data to compare options, provide ready analytic solutions, allocate resources, and improve processes.  

Also, in conjunction with DPAP and Performance Assessments and Root Cause Analyses (PARCA) we plan to improve the quality of analytical and predictive information (and reduce direct impact to programs) by standardizing business processes and capabilities.  The Analytic Information Management System (AIMS) effort will: standardize compliance assessment methodologies, tools, processes, and technologies; establish a guideline assessment wizard to ensure these attributes are examined in a repeatable process and return consistent results; implement business intelligence, analytics, and a single data repository to improve insight into operations performance across the Acquisition enterprise; improve detection of Earned Value Management System (EVMS) non-compliance; and establish a consolidated view of all compliance and performance data, from the same source system.</r2:Text>

As a part of our strategy and business practices, DCMA directly supports Better Buying Power (BBP) 2.0 initiatives, such as controlling costs throughout the product lifecycle, incentivizing productivity, an improving tradecraft in acquisition of services.  Critical among BBP initiatives are should-cost and affordability.  DCMA’s expertise in these areas has enabled unprecedented savings and cost avoidance.  In an environment of declining resources, this pricing talent will be a valuable asset in ensuring the Government only pays its fair share of company costs.  

Additionally, in pursuing these business practices we are continuing to utilize contractors to perform specialized functions such as software development and testing.  A number of mini-competitions are held with Federal Supply Schedule, Government Wide Acquisition Contracts, and DCMA Basic Purchasing Agreement Vendors.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
