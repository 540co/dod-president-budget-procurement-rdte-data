                    <r2:SummaryExplanation>The FY 2014 program is in compliance with Section 638 of Title 15 USC-Small Business Innovation Research Program and the Small Business Technology Transfer Program.  The FY 2014 program has developed, tested, and deployed integrated business tools to enhance human resource management, acquisition, and executive services business processes supporting WHS/OSD.

The FY 2015 program will develop, test, pilot, and deploy new integrated business tools that will enhance human resource management, acquisition, and executive services business processes that support WHS/OSD.  Funds will also be used for developing and testing tools that will improve the delivery of IT services and capabilities for all WHS/OSD users.  

1.  Enterprise Information Technology Services Directorate (EITSD) IT FY14-$500K – FY15-$509K.
To develop, test, pilot, and deploy new integrated business tools that will enhance human resource management, acquisition, and executive services business processes that support WHS/OSD.  Funds will also be used for developing and testing tools that will improve the delivery of IT services and capabilities for all WHS/OSD users.  WHS/OSD continues to expand the Engineering, Test and Development networks for NIPR and SIPR.  The long term goal is to provide and maintain a centrally managed, "State-of-the-Art", Virtual Environment for developers throughout OSD, WHS and PFPA.
2.  Secure Mobile Computing FY14-$107K – FY15-$103K.
A continuation of the FY 2014 program of developing better mobile classified computing and communications platforms for all customers to have secured computing at residences and at temporary and mobile locations around the world.</r2:SummaryExplanation>
