1) The funding in FY 2011-12 is shown in PE 0603305A and 
2) The funding in FY 2013-17 is shown in PE 0604319A</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element funds missile defense systems integration efforts for both the US Army Space and Missile Defense Command/Army Forces Strategic Command (USASMDC/ARSTRAT) and the Program Executive Office for Missiles and Space (PEO-MS).

USASMDC/ARSTRAT:  Headquarters, Department of the Army General Order 37, dated 16 October 2006, designated USASMDC/ARSTRAT as the Army proponent for space and ground-based midcourse defense (GMD), the Army integrator for global missile defense, and the Army Service Component Command (ASCC) of the U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM).  Army Regulation (AR) 10-87 Army Commands, Army Service Component Commands, and Direct Reporting Units, dated 4 September 2007 and AR 5-22 The Army Force Modernization Proponent System dated 19 August 2009 designates USASMDC/ARSTRAT as the Army specified proponent for Global Missile Defense and Space/High Altitude capabilities.  As the Army proponent for space, high altitude and GMD, USASMDC/ARSTRAT is responsible to develop warfighting concepts, conduct warfighting experiments to validate those concepts, identify capabilities needed to implement the validated concepts, and develop Doctrine, Organizations, Training, Material, Leadership &amp; Education, Personnel and Facilities (DOTMLPF) solutions to realize the GMD capabilities.  As the Army integrator for global missile defense, USASMDC/ARSTRAT is responsible to review programs managed by the Army, other Services, Defense agencies and National agencies to ensure that they are correctly synchronized and will ultimately provide the capabilities required by USSTRATCOM to execute its global missile defense responsibilities. 

Project TR5 funds United States Army Space and Missile Defense Command/ Army Strategic Command (USASMDC/ARSTRAT) efforts to develop and the associated operational prototyping, experimentation, operational analysis, and modeling and simulation to support of current and future Forces.  

Project TR7 funds the Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment 2 - Intercept (IFPC Inc 2-I).  It is is a ground-based weapon system that will be designed to acquire, track, engage, and defeat Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), Cruise Missiles (CM), and Rockets, Artillery, and Mortars (RAM). The System will provide 360-degree protection and will simultaneously engage threats arriving from different azimuths. A block acquisition approach will be used to provide this capability. The Block 1 system will consist of an existing interceptor and sensor and development of technical fire control and a Multi-Mission Launcher (MML) to support the UAS and CM mission. The Block 2 system will develop interceptors, sensors, and technical fire control to support the counter RAM mission. The IFPC Inc 2-I System will be compatible with the Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) C2 architecture. The IFPC Inc 2-I System will be transportable by Army common mobile platforms.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:Text>: Take the lessons learned from the FY13 efforts to continue to evaluate new technologies in realistic operating environments.  This will be accomplished by supporting ongoing efforts that provide the most realistic operating environment available to perform technology gap and cost reduction analysis of space, missile defense, and high altitude systems.  Realistic operating environments will be available to determine the ability of the specific technologies to fill capability gaps in terms of utility to the Warfighter.  Support of technology demonstrations, Analysis and Demonstration Tools/Test Beds for evolving space superiority and operationally responsive space concepts will address emerging needs and continue to be expanded to ensure that advanced technology development can adequately enhance address space, missile defense and high altitude. The FWC will continue to provide program management for maintenance, sustainment, and development for EADSIM to provide the required high fidelity synthetic operating environment to provide the capability to perform system and cost benefit analysis.</r2:Text>

Previous PE/Project/Title: 0603305A/TR7 Army Missile Defense Systems Integration/TR7 Indirect Fire Protection Capability 2

Current PE/Project/Title: 0604319A/DU3 Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment 2/ DU3 IFPC2 

Please note the following:  
1) The funding in FY 2011-12 is shown in PE 0603305A and 
2) The funding in FY 2013-17 is shown in PE 0604319A</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program supports the overall Air and Missile Defense (AMD) architecture and provides a robust intercept capability against Cruise Missiles (CM), Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) and Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar (RAM) threats for deployed forces.  The Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment 2 - Intercept (IFPC Inc 2-I) is a ground-based weapon system that will be designed to acquire, track, engage, and defeat UAS, CM, and RAM. The System will provide 360-degree protection and will simultaneously engage threats arriving from different azimuths. A block acquisition approach will be used to provide this capability. The Block 1 system will consist of an existing interceptor and sensor and development of technical fire control and a Multi-Mission Launcher (MML) to support the UAS and CM mission. The Block 2 system will develop interceptors, sensors, and technical fire control to support the counter RAM mission. The IFPC Inc 2-I System will be compatible with the Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) C2 architecture. The IFPC Inc 2-I System will be transportable by Army common mobile platforms.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The program also funds development and integration of new data sources and data services into the Joint Friendly Force Tracking Mission Management Center.  The Mission Management Center (MMC) injects real-time Joint Friendly Force Tracking (J-FFT) information into the Common Operating Picture for Combatant Commands (COCOMs), Joint Task Forces (JTFs) and Coalition partners.  USASMDC/ARSTRAT is the proponent for space / high altitude capabilities and is responsible for determining and integrating Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership and Education, Personnel and Facilities (DOTMLPF) for the Army. 

USSTRATCOM, in accordance with CJCSI 3910.01 (reference V.4.) is designated one of three coordinating agencies for J-FFT within DOD.  CJCSI 3910.01 directs eight specified tasks to USSTRATCOM.  USSTRATCOM SI 534-5 (reference V.6.) and annually published USSTRATCOM operations orders have designated USASMDC/ARSTRAT as the lead USSTRATCOM component command for J-FFT.

In FY12 and FY13 funding for J-FFT was cut because of a RDTE contract being coded as a service contract, these funds were restored in FY14 and FY15 resulting in the perceived increase in funding for FY14 and FY15.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This project enables component development of new counter explosive hazard systems that focus on detecting, marking, and neutralizing mines and improvised explosive devices (IED).  These capabilities will enhance the effectiveness of the Route Clearance Platoon within the Engineer Company, the Brigade Combat Team as well as other related Army missions.  

Autonomous Mine Detection System (AMDS) provides mine and explosive hazards stand-off detection, marking and neutralization capability for the dismounted soldier.  AMDS consists of payload modules to be mounted on man-portable unmanned ground vehicles.  The payloads are for surface laid and buried threats to include mines and explosive hazards.  AMDS will transition from Technical Development to Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) in FY 2013.  

The Forward Reconnaissance and Explosive Hazard Detection (FREHD) system will provide a suite of vehicle-mounted capabilities that enable route clearance patrols to achieve higher rates of advance by accurately detecting and adjudicating potential explosive hazards with reduced hazard interrogation time.  The system will automatically nominate potential hazards on the move and at standoff distance, and then let route clearance teams decide whether to perform more detailed examinations and identification of those hazards using additional tools within the FREHD suite.   FREHD will also provide threat visualization and control capabilities that enable route clearance and allow Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) and related mission personnel to remotely view video feeds of the hazard and remotely control the apparatus.  The increased rate of advance will improve route clearance time, while the increased standoff improves force protection.   FREHD will begin transition of Advanced Technology Objective efforts from the Science and Technology community, and conduct program initiation activities via a Materiel Development Decision in FY 2013.   Subject to timely program initiation and confirmation of technology maturity, FREHD technology development efforts will continue in FY 2014.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Acquisition Strategy: Development of SOM systems to include design, construction, modeling and testing of prototypes. 

SOM acquisition strategy is to develop a small smoke generator that degrades the visual through near infrared portion of the Electro-Magnetic Spectrum. SOM program will focus on replacing current smoke pots to provide the Joint Land Forces with a medium area screening obscuration device.  The initial increment, Increment 1, will focus on developing a SOM system capable of obscuring the Visual through Near IR wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum.  Future SOM Increments 2 and 3 will incorporate bi-spectral and multi-spectral effects. The SOM has the capability to quickly produce (less than 15 seconds) medium duration (20 minutes), medium area (11 meters wide x 20 meters length x 5.25 meters height) screening obscuration effects, screening an area equivalent to three times the size of a large combat vehicle.  The individual Soldier or team will employ the SOM devices on open and complex terrain; excluding enclosed areas.  SOM will be deployed to accomplish the following mission types:  avoid observation, defense of a battle position, and assault position.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>FY 2014: $10.800M increase in Project 694 is for the Medium Caliber Target Practice Day/Night/Thermal (TP D/N/T) cartridge program.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Direct Fire Advanced Technology (DFAT) Program Element (PE) encompasses a comprehensive program to develop, rapidly transition to production, and field advanced tank, medium and small caliber munitions. These programs will ensure continued battlefield overmatch and lethality of U.S. maneuver forces despite worldwide development and proliferation of enhanced armored vehicle protection technologies. To achieve this, DFAT will identify and develop promising technologies through competitive development and streamlined acquisition procedures. All ammunition development funds within this PE are managed to facilitate transitions between phases, avoid administrative delays, and focus resources on the most promising areas. 

The M829E4 cartridge is an unguided, direct fire, Abrams delivered Line of Sight (LOS) munition that will provide fast response lethality to rapidly destroy threat targets with Explosive Reactive Armor (ERA) and Active Protection Systems (APS) in the close fight from 0-2km (T) and to 0-4km (O). The M829E4 will be compatible with the 120mm Current Force Abrams Main Battle Tank. FY 2011 M829E4 Cartridge funding supported the completion of Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase I and the initiation of Phase II. FY 2012 funding supported design finalization, design verification, testing and fabrication of Design, Test and Evaluation hardware and beginning of testing. FY 2013 features building of test hardware for final qualification testing. FY 2014 supports hardware and performance test, conducting mandated Live Fire Testing &amp; Evaluation (LFT&amp;E) and staffing of Milestone C.

In FY 2014 the Target Practice Day/ Night/ Thermal (TP D/N/T) cartridge is a 40mm grenade training cartridge. The Low Velocity variant is for training with the M203/ M320 grenade launchers and the High Velocity variant is for training with the Mk19 grenade machine gun. Both of these cartridges will provide the War Fighter with a non dud producing, environmentally friendly training cartridge which replicates the impact signature of respective tactical ammunition and can be seen day or night, by the unaided eye or through night vision and thermal weapon sights.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The M829E4 cartridge is an Abrams delivered Line of Sight (LOS) munition that will provide capability for the current force Armored Brigade Combat Team's (ABCT) commander to conduct decisive operations and destroy current and future enemy Main Battle Tanks (MBTs) equipped with Explosive Reactive Armor (ERA) and Active Protective System (APS) at ranges from 0-2km (T) and 0-4km (O). The M829E4 equips ABCT commanders with a unique capability which will increase the ABCT's lethality and ability to seize the initiative during unified land operations. After a Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase I competitive shoot off in FY 2011 ATK was awarded the option to continue with Phase II until its conclusion in FY 2014. FY 2012 supported the continuation of Phase II of the M829E4 cartridge. FY 2013 funding supports design finalization, design verification, fabrication and testing of Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&amp;E) hardware. The full performance of the M829E4 is obtained with an Abrams equipped Ammunition Data Link breech modification. FY 2014 supports conducting hardware and performance testing, mandated Live Fire Test &amp; Evaluation (LFT&amp;E) and completion of Milestone C.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The M829E4 cartridge is at Technology Readiness Level 6 (TRL6). The Milestone B Decision was obtained in 4Q FY 2009, and the program entered Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) in FY 2010. EMD consists of two phases; the Phase I contract was awarded in 2Q FY 2010 and the Phase II contract was awarded in 3Q FY 2011. During Phase I (15 months), the Government awarded two separate Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contracts culminating in a demonstration test and competitive source selection to down select to one contractor for the 31 month Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF) Phase II. The down select was based on the demonstrated performance of the cartridge design, proposed systems engineering and management approach for Phase II, and the total program cost estimate for each contractor at the time of the demonstration test. ATK was awarded the option to continue EMD Phase II until its conclusion in FY 2014. Upon successful completion of Milestone C, a Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) option will be awarded to ATK in 3Q FY 2014. The contract also contains options for two additional production years. All production options are Firm Fixed Price (FFP).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Advanced Multi Purpose (AMP) program is a direct fire line of sight 120mm large caliber munition to be developed for the Abrams Main Battle Tank. It has three modes of operation including point detonate, delay and airburst. AMP is the material solution for breaching reinforced concrete walls and defeating Anti Tank Guided Missile (ATGM) teams from 50m to 2000m (T) and 50m to 4500m (O), a validated gap that cannot currently be met with existing stockpiled ammunition. The funding in FY 2012 studied the integration implications with the Abrams Tank. Project no longer has funding.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Target Practice Day/ Night/ Thermal (TP D/N/T) cartridges are 40mm grenade training cartridges. The low velocity variant is for training with the M203/M320 grenade launchers and the high velocity variant is for training with the Mk19 grenade machine gun. Both of these cartridges will provide the War Fighter with a non dud producing, environmentally friendly training cartridge which replicates the impact signature of respective tactical ammunition and can be seen day or night, by the unaided eye or through night vision devices and thermal weapon sights. The program will carry competitive prototypes for each cartridge variant through the Engineering Manufacturing Development phase. In FY 2014 a competition will be held to select the EMD contractors. Afterwards a preliminary design review will be held. Advanced prototypes will be built and tested.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Target Practice Day/ Night/ Thermal cartridges will be developed through a competitive Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) program. The program will develop both High Velocity (HV) and Low Velocity (LV) variants concurrently to reduce overall acquisition costs. Both variants utilize the same critical technologies, making concurrent acquisitions a logical alternative. As part of the EMD source selection, a shoot-off will be conducted to evaluate potential designs. Within funding constraints multiple contractor designs for the HV cartridge and for the LV cartridge will be awarded EMD contracts in the 2QTR FY 2014 with Milestone C scheduled for 1QTR FY 2016. The contracts will contain options for LRIP and production. The strategy is flexible and prepared to award production options early if the contractor(s) complete the development early. The Army will attempt to negotiate for the data rights so long term production can be produced to a single design for the HV and LV variants.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) supports the development of the Stryker Family of vehicles (FOV) in two projects: 
 
The Interim Amored Vehicle Family Project (C03) supports the use of the common platform/common chassis design reducing requirements for repair parts and logistics support in the area of operations.  Funding in this project will continue to address Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO), survivability, Operational Needs Statement (ONS) issues. 

Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) (C51), will enable the Stryker FOV to host the future network without further degrading vehicle performance.  The upgrade will increase available electrical power while ensuring adequate mechanical power, weight margin, and cooling.  Combined with an in-vehicle network, this will ensure the FOV can host the future network while retaining its protection and mobility.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Interim Armored Vehicle (IAV) Family Project (C03) supports the development of the Stryker Family of Vehicles (FOV) consisting of 10 variants in the flat bottom configuration.  The National Military Strategy requires an Army that is rapidly deployable and strategically responsive across the full spectrum of operations. The Stryker Brigade Combat Team encompasses capabilities and characteristics that are needed but were not available until the first SBCT was declared operationally capable.  The Stryker enables the Army to respond immediately to urgent operational requirements.  Funding in this project will continue to address survivability enhancements and Operational Needs Statement (ONS) issues.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>The Phase III (Production) decision point associated with the Stryker ECP will be the first point at which WTCV funds will be required.  Currently, funding begins in FY17 for this effort.  Stryker MOD (GM0100) in FY17 consists of $55.000 million for modifications and $328.879 million for ECP retrofits, FY18 consists of $65.000 million for modifications and $412.000 million for ECP retrofits.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Stryker upgrade effort is to buy back the vehicle space, weight, and power margin lost due to the addition of numerous kits in response to nine years of war (15-combat rotations &amp; 27 million total miles), in order to allow integration of the future network (as directed by VCSA in August 2011) without further degrading the performance of the platform.  In May 2012, Phase I (Development) of the Stryker ECP program was approved, permitting preliminary design and integration efforts on both the Flat Bottom (FB) and Double-V Hull (DVH) variants.  The Phase II (Continued Engineering Design/Logistics Design/Prototype Build/Test) decision is scheduled for 14 March 2013.  This decision will select what technologies will go forward to Preliminary Design Review (PDR) and the variants to which the technologies will be applied (i.e., Flat Bottom and/or Double V Hull).  Based on the Phase II decision, development engineering will continue to support Preliminary Design Review (PDR), prototype build, and test and evaluation.  The Phase III (Production) decision point will determine the production requirements of the technologies selected in Phase II.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides for the advanced component development and prototyping of joint service food and combat feeding equipment designed to reduce the logistics burden and Operation and Support (O&amp;S) costs of subsistence support to service personnel.  Project supports development of rations and rapidly deployable field food service equipment.  Project conducts demonstration and validation of improved subsistence and subsistence support items used to enhance soldier effectiveness and quality of life in all four Services, as part of an integrated Department of Defense (DoD) Food Research, Development, Test, Evaluation and Engineering Program.  The Program is reviewed and validated twice annually by the DoD Combat Feeding Research and Engineering Board (CFREB) as part of the Joint Service Food Program.  This project develops critical enablers that support the Joint Future Force Capabilities and the Joint expeditionary mindset by maintaining readiness through fielding and integrating new equipment.  This equipment enhances the field soldier's well-being and provides the soldier with usable equipment, in addition to reducing sustainment requirements, related Combat Support/Combat Service Support (CS/CSS) demands on lift, combat zone footprint, and costs for logistical support.

This PE/Project supports Field Feeding Programs for all the services.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The United States Army Rapid Equipping Force (REF) harnesses current and emerging technologies to provide rapid solutions to the urgently required capabilities of US Army forces employed globally. The REF combines and integrates functions that cross several Army staff elements and Army Service Component Commands (ASCC) to accelerate materiel solutions and technology insertion to forces on a global scale.  The REF provides the Army's rapid response capability to develop, prototype, acquire and integrate Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and Government Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) solutions to meet urgent combat requirements for deployed forces.  It develops and inserts selected future force technologies, capabilities and surrogate material solutions into committed, deploying and transformational forces for operational evaluation, assessment and spiral development.  It plans and executes assessments and studies of Army practices and issues concerning operational needs, desired future force capabilities and relevant Army business practices to provide feedback to Senior Army Leaders. 
 
The REF bridges the gap between the lengthy acquisition process and immediate equipping needs.  We pursue tangible solutions that can be equipped within a goal of 90 days. The REF focuses on finding effective game-changing capabilities to increase Soldier effectiveness, protection and lethality in any operational environment. The REF process provides the mechanism to respond rapidly to an adaptive enemy who changes in days and months, not years. The REF Teams deployed in theater work with Army Service Component Commands of the Combatant Commands (COCOMs) to understand their urgent needs, for which the REF acquisition capability may identify, procure and deliver solutions to the deployed units. A key element of this process is fiscal flexibility, permitting the REF to allocate funds against emerging threats and requirements in the year of fiscal execution.  

The REF works directly with Operational Commanders at Brigade and below to find solutions to identified equipping requirements. These solutions may result in procurement of new or existing military/commercial materiel equipment, or accelerated development of a Future Force materiel solution for insertion into the current force now.  The REF key tasks are:
- Be responsive to tactical unit commanders engage Brigade Combat Team/Brigade Commanders (BCT/BDE CDRs) early and often
- Bridge specific Operational Needs Statement/Joint Urgent Operational Needs Statement (ONS/JUONS) Gaps to meet urgent needs
- In coordination with Asymmetric Warfare Group (AWG) develop materiel solutions to counter Asymmetric Threats
- Ensure adequate training and sustainment are provided with every capability
- Cultivate and rapidly insert emerging technologies into Soldiers hands
- Conduct operational assessments to provide useful operator feedback to the Army 
- Transition effective projects through Capability Development for Rapid Transition (CDRT) to support long-term sustainment
- Be aggressive and push the acquisition envelope, but operate within the law
- Integrate with existing Army organizations and systems to enable them to recognize and solve problems for tactical units
 
The REF Integrated Priority list (RIPL) consists of the REF top ten priorities based on requirements received from deployed units, and drives all REF efforts.  The priorities with associated metrics, as of 06 February 2013, are:

1. Dismounted Improvised Explosive Device (IED) Defeat  (46 Requirements/42 Projects)
2. Small Combat Outpost (COP)/Patrol Base (PB) Force Protection and Sustainment  (60 Requirements/52 Projects)
3. Dismounted Operations Support  (40 Requirements/34 Projects)
4. Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) Shortfalls in Environmentally Inhospitable Operating Environments (OEs)  (42 Requirements/42 Projects)
5. Dismounted Blue Force Tracking and Mission Command  (24 Requirements/16 Projects)
6. Counter Ambush (Precision against Small Arms Fire (SAF) and Rocket Propelled Grenade (RPG) (4 Requirements/6 Projects)
7. Advanced Escalation of Force and Non-Lethal Messaging (10 Requirements/7 Projects)
8. Entry Control Point (ECP) Operations and Vehicle Search Operations (10 Requirements/5 Projects)
9. Route Clearance Support (8 Requirements/5 Projects)
10. Other (61 Requirements/60 Projects)

Total:  305 Requirements/269 Projects


The REF FY14 RDT&amp;E Request of $1.515 million (Base) integrates, coordinates, deploys and provides urgent material capabilities to deployed and pre-deploying units in support of Joint and Army Forces Commanders to enhance the combat effectiveness of the operating force and enable the defeat of asymmetric threats. The emphasis for RDT&amp;E funding is on Testing and Evaluation that supports projects in the areas of Force Protection, Improvised Explosive Device (IED) Detection and Defeat, enhanced Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities, Tactical Command, Control and Communication tools. 

RDT&amp;E funding also provides the REF the flexibility to invest in near-term, innovative solutions. RDT&amp;E funds are necessary in the vast majority of all REF projects. REF uses RDT&amp;E funds to work with industry and Other Governmental Agencies (OGAs) in order to further develop high (>6) Technology Readiness Level (TRL) or advanced technologies that often only need small amounts of funding in order to help them achieve a maturity level that is suitable to solve deployed US Army Forces problems with low investments for high payoffs. REF requires RDT&amp;E funds to integrate several different Commercial-Off-The-Shelf/Government-Off-The-Shelf (COTS/GOTS) technologies into one capability that solves the tougher and more complex problems. REF uses RDT&amp;E funds to conduct demonstrations and tests to validate technology solutions.  REF requires RDT&amp;E funds in order to modify existing technologies that were developed for one purpose but now may be suitable to solve another problem. REF Expeditionary Labs use RDT&amp;E funds to develop and adapt technologies that meet immediate requirements forward in the theaters of operation with the active assistance of the Soldier in the solution development process. REF requires RDT&amp;E funds to test technologies in order to ensure suitability and safety before equipping the Soldier- any modified Commercial-Off-The-Shelf/Government-Off-The-Shelf (COTS/GOTS) item has to be tested.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

During the same period we expect to see an increase in requirements submitted by Army Special Operations Forces (SOF) in other areas of the world as well as from brigades employed in more global roles, such as the regionally aligned Brigade Combat Teams.  REF's Expeditionary Labs are deployed to provide engineer support directly to Battalion and Brigade Forward Operating Bases/Combat Outposts/Patrol Bases and work side-by-side with Soldiers as they execute their missions.  Engineers connect directly to Army, Department of Defense (DoD) and National Labs to conduct prototype design while including the users' immediate feedback. We also expect to play a much more deliberate role in providing support to the Army's Global Reaction Force (GRF) as they prepare for a wider range of response missions.</r2:Text>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The United States Army Rapid Equipping Force harnesses current and emerging technologies to provide rapid solutions to the urgently required capabilities of US Army Forces employed globally. The REF focus is on rapidly placing game-changing capabilities into Soldiers' hands. This mission is accomplished in one of two ways: rapidly adapting Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and Government-Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) equipment to meet operational needs and developing emerging deployable capability via interaction with research and development organizations and academia. All capabilities are safety tested prior to insertion into operational environments.  Training and sustainment is provided for every capability until it is transitioned to an approved program of record or terminated through the Capabilities Development for Rapid Transition (CDRT) process. Operational assessments are conducted to provide feedback in support of Army equipping and fielding decisions.  REF capabilities routinely serve to bridge specific Operational Needs Statement (ONS) and Joint Urgent Operational Needs Statement (JUONS) gaps to meet urgent requirements.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Tactical Exploitation of National Capabilities (TENCAP) program serves as the Army's centralized lead to perform National Intelligence cross-agency engineering to evaluate, enhance, prototype, and transition Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) technologies/capabilities developed by Science and Technology (S&amp;T) and other activities across the National Intelligence Community into Army systems and architectures.  TENCAP (1) ensures continued access to current National and Theater sensors and supporting tactical architectures; and (2) exploits new developments that focus on improving the tasking, analysis, processing, exploitation, and dissemination of the intelligence data collected.  This includes efforts to: (1) shorten targeting timelines down to Platoon level; (2) enhance target identification; (3) provide better target location (accuracy); (4) provide continued coverage of a target; and (5) develop in-theater analytic tools to enable data exploitation in near-real-time support to contingency operations.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>A portion of the FY14 funding was realigned from Program Element (PE) 0603766A - 'Tactical Electronic Surveillance System - Adv Dev' (BA 6.4) into PE 0605766A, 'National Integration To Tactical Systems (MIP) - System Development and Demonstration' (BA 6.5) to properly capture and fund the TENCAP advanced technologies through their integration into Army Programs of Record (PORs).</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Army Tactical Exploitation of National Capabilities (TENCAP) mission is a Congressionally mandated and chartered enduring requirement to leverage National intelligence capabilities useful to the tactical Army.  The Army TENCAP acquisition strategy is driven by an annual TENCAP General Officer Steering Group (TGOSG), co-chaired by the Army G2; Army G8; and the Military Deputy to the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology [ASA(ALT)]; and includes representatives from the Army G3; Army G6; Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC); and the Program Executive Office for Intelligence, Electronic Warfare and Sensors (PEO IEW&amp;S).  The TGOSG reviews, validates, prioritizes, and guides Army TENCAP efforts, according to Army and Defense strategy. Based on this TGOSG guidance, Army TENCAP invests BA 6.4 RDTE in Intelligence Community developments during the more cost-effective advanced development phase to ensure Army requirements are met with minimal redundancy.  Army TENCAP then uses BA 6.5 RDTE to manage the transition of these advanced development efforts through system development and integration into Army Programs of Record (PORs).  This strategy ensures these leveraged investments remain viable through multiple budget cycles, significantly increasing successful transition to recipient Army PORs.  With acquisition discipline and oversight provided by PEO IEW&amp;S, Army TENCAP executes the TGOSG approved efforts through use of multiple contracts and agreements with the military, National agencies, Labs, Industry Partners and Academia for the full duration required to complete development and transition these National capabilities into enduring Army programs.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element focuses on efforts to evaluate and integrate technologies and representative prototype systems that facilitate the development of Soldier-borne sensor devices transitioning from the laboratory to operational use. Efforts focus on proving out commonality across as broad a spectrum of users as possible to provide enhanced Soldier products, giving them superiority on the battlefield.

Project VT7 (Soldier Maneuver Sensors-Advanced Development)  Efforts focus on proving out commonality across as broader spectrum of users as possible to provide enhanced Soldier products, giving them superiority on the battlefield. Near term efforts include the integration of goggles with the weapon sights for Rapid Target Acquisition (RTA) in a realistic operating environment, thereby increasing Soldier lethality. This project also develops a Family of Weapon Sights (FWS) with fused electro-optical performance, including focal plane arrays and high resolution micro-displays.  FWS enabling technologies increase product resolution, range, and imaging performance. New technologies will improve Soldier lethality, survivability, reduce weight, and improve affordability, mobility and comfort to combat and training environments. In addtion this project will explore insertion of technology that improves the Soldier's ability to detect Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) Detection.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports the Army's transformation by developing payloads for brigade combat team, division, and corps Unmanned Aircraft Systems(UAS) and unmanned systems in accordance with Headquarters Department of the Army (HQDA) and Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) priorities.  

CSP Target Location Accuracy (TLA) is the final upgrade to CSP which will provide all of the CSP HD functionality but with significantly improved targeting accuracy.  CSP TLA provides the Battlefield Commander a vastly improved TLA allowing timely use of Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMs) and Coordinate Seeking Weapons (CSWs) across the battlespace.  CSP TLA is being procured as an upgraded capability for the Gray Eagle UAS program and can be integrated onto other manned and unmanned aerial platforms.  The funds associated with this funding line are for the technology maturity of the TLA Laser.  Once this laser technology has been matured to the appropriate Technology Readiness Level (TRL), it will be cut into the TLA development effort and eventual production to replace the CSP HD payloads on the Gray Eagle platform.
 
This program has no FY 2013 Base or OCO requirement.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Efforts focus on proving out commonality across as broad a spectrum of users as possible to provide enhanced products that give Soldiers superiority on the battlefield.  Near term efforts include the integration of Helmet Mounted Displays (HMDs) with weapon sights for a Rapid Target Acquisition (RTA) capability in a realistic environment, increasing Soldier situational awareness and lethality and integrates technology, which detects enemy snipers using precise target information to mitigate operational risk before sniper fire occurs.  This project also integrates high resolution thermal focal plane arrays, integrated ballistic solutions for auto-adjusting reticles, and wireless technology with weapon sights, increasing range, performance, and capability, while decreasing system size and weight.  These integration efforts improve Soldier situational awareness, lethality, survivability, mobility, and comfort to combat and training environments. Funds in this program are a realignment of funds from program Night Vision Systems Engineering Development , Program Element 0604710A; Project L67 for more efficient program management.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>FWS is a family of weapon sights that utilize advances in thermal and image intensified technologies to produce Individual (I), Crew-Served (CS), and Sniper (S) weapon sights operable in-line with a day optic or in stand-alone mode.  FWS-CS includes fused multi-band imagery and rapid target acquisition with ballistic equations, providing the Soldier with improved situational awareness and more rapid target detection and engagement during day and night operations.  This program integrates smaller pixel (12 micron) uncooled long-wave infrared focal plane arrays in multiple large format sizes to improve sensitivity, clarity, and range, while simultaneously reducing the size, weight and power consumption of the Crew-Served and Sniper variants.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>There is a broad application potential for environmental quality technology (EQT) to be applied to multiple Army weapon systems and installations.  However technology must be demonstrated and validated (total ownership cost and performance data identified) before potential users will consider exploiting it.  This program element includes projects focused on validating the general military utility or cost reduction potential of technology when applied to different types of infrastructure, military equipment or techniques.  It may include validations and proof-of-principle demonstrations in field exercises to evaluate upgrades or provide new operational capabilities.  The validation of technologies will be in as realistic an operating environment as possible to assess performance or cost reduction potential.  EQT demonstration/validation is systemic; i.e., applies to a class of systems (e.g., vehicles or aircraft) or to a Department of Army-wide, multiple site/installation problem (e.g., unexploded ordnance detection and discrimination).  This program will address, and eventually resource, programs in each of the Army environmental quality technology pillars (military materials in the environment, sustainable ranges and lands, compliance, and pollution prevention).  All work must be endorsed by potential users and supported by a state-of-the-art assessment (i.e., "technology is heading for user to implement").</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The National Defense Center for Environmental Excellence (NDCEE) was established by Congress in 1990 with a directive to "serve as a national leadership organization to address high priority environmental problems for the Department of Defense (DoD), other government organizations, and the industrial community."  The NDCEE Program is a national resource for developing and disseminating advanced environmental technologies.  The NDCEE is used to demonstrate environmentally acceptable technology to industry; validate new technology prior to transferring that technology; and assist in the training of potential users as part of that technology transfer process.  The NDCEE is a DoD resource for environmental quality management and technology validation.  This program is managed by the Army on behalf of the Office of the Assistant Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Environment.  In May 2008, the program name was redesignated from the National Defense for Environmental Excellence to the National Defense Center for Energy and Environment to ensure that the Center's mission recognizes and addresses the strategic interdependence of energy and environmental technology requirements within an overall sustainability framework in support of our installations, weapons systems and war fighters.  This name change also directly supports the DoD's proactive implementation of Executive Order 13423, "Strengthening Federal Environmental, Energy and Transportation Management."

Our broadly encompassing and growing mobile, personal and stationary advanced energy technology requirements include infrastructure, alternative and synthetic fuels, surety, renewables, storage, distribution, advanced power, micro-grids, transportation, systems integration and others.  Further, to train as we fight, validated energy and environmental technologies need to be available and implemented at our installations.  The NDCEE will continue to demonstrate, validate, and transfer these technologies supporting our integrated environment, safety, occupational health and energy objectives with full consideration of the triple bottom line of mission, environment and community.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The NDCEE is a national asset focused on DoD applications that include technology transfer to appropriate DoD organizations.  The NDCEE fosters an outreach program to describe its products and capabilities that include publication of results and participation in professional meetings, symposia, conferences, and appropriate coordination with industry.  The management strategy for the NDCEE centers on a DoD Executive Advisory Board (EAB) chaired by the DoD NDCEE Executive Agent on behalf of the Assistant Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Environment and composed of senior DoD leadership to oversee NDCEE operations.  The EAB is supported by an EAB Working Group (EABWG) that includes staff members from each of the offices represented on the EAB.  The EABWG coordinates all NDCEE activities and reports back to the EAB Principals.  The EABWG is, in turn, supported by a Technical Working Group that addresses the details of NDCEE program execution.  The Army's Environmental Quality Technology Program also assists in the formulation of suggested technology projects to be demonstrated within the NDCEE Program.  The contracting strategy of the NDCEE is based on using an NDCEE Contracting Officer's Representative to validate all the contractual portions of the NDCEE and by technical monitors (TM) to oversee the technical aspects of each contracted task.  A prime contractor operates NDCEE test facility to validate environmentally compatible technologies on a representative "shop floor".  The NDCEE accounts for and conducts work for: (1) direct funded Army tasks; (2) reimbursable tasks from within DoD and from other Government agencies; and (3) when applicable Congressionally directed and funded tasks.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Environmental Information Technology Management (EITM) Program is an Office of the Secretary of Defense sponsored program that was assigned to the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army for Environment, Safety and Occupational Health as the Department of Defense (DoD) Executive Agent by the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics in 2001.  The DoD Directive 4715.1E defined EITM mission is to ensure efficient use of enterprise environment, safety and occupational health (ESOH) corporate information management processes by providing and sustaining requirement-driven ESOH corporate data management, Congressional-reporting and public outreach tools to the DoD, and other DoD stakeholders.  Funding provided for this program will allow EITM to develop a Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Installations and Environment directed Chemical Management Enterprise Information Integration capability that will allow Army net-centric hazardous material and ESOH 2.0 NetCentric data management capabilities per the Secretary of the Army Directive 2009-03 "Army Data Management" and DoD Directive 8320.2 "Data Sharing in a Net-Centric Department of Defense."  Prior to funding being committed, Army and DoD environmental information technology stakeholders meet to determine which high priority EITM interface requirements need upgrades to incorporate new security and other information technology requirements.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

Inc 3 PB 2014 $271.284
Delta  $195.032
Funding for Inc 3 in FY 2014 increased to support the updated schedule of the Development Test (DT), New Equipment Training (NET) and Limited User Test (LUT). Inc 3 will provide production representative hardware for the DT/NET/LUT for the Inc 3 configuration items to include JC4ISR radio, antenna and WIN-T Communications Payload (WCP) for the air tier.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Acquisition Executive (DAE), through the Nunn-McCurdy certification process, certified a restructured WIN-T program on June 5, 2007.  The certification Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) stated that the Army will restructure the WIN-T Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP) to absorb the former Joint Network Node (JNN) Network program.  It further stated that the restructured program will consist of four Increments: Inc 1, Inc 2, Inc 3, and Inc 4.

WIN-T is key to the Army's Network Modernization program. The WIN-T program's focus is to design, develop, produce and field the Future Modular Force transport network, while leveraging mature technologies that can enhance the Current Modular Force to operate in an emerging noncontiguous environment. 

Inc 2 (PE 643782/367) FY 2014 funds will support the Follow-on Production Award.

Inc 3 (PE 643782/372) FY 2014 funds will continue the Engineering Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Warfighter Information Network Tactical (WIN-T) Increment 2 provides the Army with initial On-The-Move (OTM) networking capability.  The Increment 2 network retains capabilities delivered by WIN-T Increment 1 and by leveraging proven Government and Commercial technologies, adds greater network throughput and automated  Network Management to optimize  planning (to include spectrum use), initialization, monitoring and troubleshooting. WIN-T Increment 2 extends the network in maneuver Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs) to Company level for the first time.  Using equipment mounted on combat platforms, WIN-T Increment 2 delivers a mobile capability that reduces reliance on fixed infrastructure and allows key leaders to move on the battlefield while retaining Situational Awareness and Mission Command capabilities. Using the Highband Networking Radio, with the Highband Networking Waveform and high performance antennas, the WIN-T Increment 2 Line-of-Sight network offers an adaptive 30 Megabit per second (Mbps) aggregate throughput to key leaders in their Command Post or in their vehicle. The WIN-T Increment 2 network is self-forming, which means that it automatically creates transmission paths based on terrain and environmental conditions; and self-healing, meaning that the paths will automatically re-route traffic to complete network transactions and calls even if one or more nodes break down or loses connectivity.  This offers greater network reliability and better end-to-end connectivity than traditional point-to-point networks.   WIN-T Increment 2 introduces the network management capability needed to keep the mobile and dispersed forces networked together through automated planning, initialization, monitoring, and troubleshooting.  Finally, WIN-T adopts  "Colorless Core" technology that encrypts both classified and unclassified user information in the network and minimizes the number of users on the "core" of the network.  The Colorless Core allows commanders to utilize the tactical network without fear of the enemy intercepting information. Colorless Core is a technical insertion in the WIN-T Increment 1b network which enables information sharing between Increment 1b and Increment 2.

The WIN-T Increment 2 capabilities are identified for fielding to Armored, Infantry, and Stryker BCTs and Division Headquarters.  The Point of Presence and the Tactical Communications Node have both satellite and Line-of-Sight communication capability.  The Soldier Network Extension provides satellite communication only.  The Point of Presence and the Tactical Communications Node are deployed at Division, Brigade and Battalion echelons. The Soldier Network Extension serves as the S3 vehicle at Battalion level and is also deployed down to Company level.  

WIN-T Increment 3 mature technologies will be inserted into Increment 2 units.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Defense Acquisition Executive (DAE), through the Nunn-McCurdy certification process, certified a restructured WIN-T program on June 5, 2007.  The certification Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) stated that the Army will restructure the WIN-T Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP) to absorb the former Joint Network Node (JNN) Network program.  It further stated that the restructured program will consist of four Increments: Incs 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Inc 2 fields new capabilities to the current force.  Inc 2 accomplishes this with planned early fieldings of mature technologies from Inc 3.  Inc 2 will be upgraded with technology from Inc 3 in the form of technology inserts. A Follow-on Test and Evaluation (FOTE) will be conducted in FY2013 followed by a Full Rate Production (FRP) decision review.  There is no plan to rebuy and replace Inc 2 with Inc 3. These technical inserts will upgrade the Inc 2 architecture to include the following elements: Joint Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (JC4ISR) radio, Highband Radio Frequency Unit Multiband Terrestrial antenna (HRFU-MT) (Dual band C/Ku), and Network Operations (NetOps) Build 3.0.  The JC4ISR radio and antenna upgrades will be placed in the Tactical Communication Node (TCN) v1, Point of Presence (PoP) v1, and Tactical Relay Tower(TR-T) v1 and will upgrade those configuration items to TCN v1A, PoP v1A, and TR-T v1A.  The Inc 3 production program will also provide retrofits to Inc 2 fielded units.  Inc 3 will tech-insert the  Modular Communications Node Advanced Enclave (MCN-AE) to all the Inc 2 units.  Inc 3 will also provide the JC4ISR radio and antenna retrofits for the Inc 2 units procured before FY2016 and for TR-T inserts to ensure interoperability.  Increment 3 introduces the air tier through the use of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) and a Top Secret Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) Local Area Network (LAN) with a port for National Security Agency intranet (NSAnet).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Warfighter Information Network Tactical (WIN-T) Increment 3 (Inc 3) provides full network mobility and introduces an additional Line-of-Sight link using an airborne platform, building on the capabilities of previous WIN-T Increments. WIN-T Inc 3 connects all users to each other from theater down to the maneuver company level, to Joint and multinational elements, and to the Defense Information System Network (DISN).  WIN-T Inc 3 is key to the Army's Network Modernization program. It provides a leap forward in network capacity with improved system reliability and robustness, made possible by the new Highband Networking Waveform (HNW) version 3.0 embedded on the Joint Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance (JC4ISR) radios. The technology advances in the combination of the JC4ISR radios and HNW will provide a throughput capability four times greater than currently fielded networking radios.  The Air Tier implementation of the JC4ISR radios and HNW 3.0 will offload significant amounts of traffic from satellites with reduced operating cost to the Army, freeing satellite bandwidth and providing the Commander the ability to allocate bandwidth resources at the critical point on the battlefield. WIN-T Inc 3 Network Operations (NetOps) software provides the on the move capability to meet the Global Information Grid (GIG) NetCentric Vision including Information Assurance and Network Centric Enterprise Services with mature planning, monitoring, and controlling capabilities; additionally implementation of the WIN-T Inc 3 NetOps solution supports the Army's NetOps convergence goals. WIN-T Inc 3 mature technologies will be inserted into WIN-T Inc 2 units.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Defense Acquisition Executive (DAE), through the Nunn-McCurdy certification process, certified a restructured WIN-T program on June 5, 2007.  The certification Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) stated that the Army will restructure the WIN-T Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP) to absorb the former Joint Network Node (JNN) Network program.  It further stated that the restructured program will consist of four Increments: Incs 1, 2, 3, and 4.

An evolutionary acquisition strategy is being utilized to provide for the timely insertion of new technologies into Army communication systems by adhering to the basic principles of the DoD Modular Open Systems Approach (MOSA).  This allows the Army to keep pace with changing commercial technology and maintain required interoperability with other joint, strategic and commercial standards-based networks. Building on previous increments, Inc 3 provides better connectivity and greater network access via JC4ISR radio and antenna, Network Centric Waveform (NCW), Highband Networking Waveform (HNW) version 3.0, and integrated Network Operations. It manages, prioritizes, and protects information through NetOps while reducing organizational and operational support. It ensures communications interoperability with Joint, Allied, Coalition, Current Force, and Commercial voice and data networks. Inc 3 shall be interoperable with the other WIN-T increments while maintaining interoperability with the Army currently fielded transport systems. The technologies in Inc 3 have matured to a level that provide significant capability enhancement over the current network.  Inc 3 technology is being tested and released over time and, once proven; Inc 3 technology will be available for insertion into WIN-T Increment 1 and Increment 2.  

The ADM of May 18, 2009 approved an initial Acquisition Program Baseline (APB) for Inc 3. A follow-on Increment 3 ADM on July 31, 2009 permitted the obligation of remaining FY2009 Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) funds to resource EMD efforts including development of the Joint Command, Control, Communications, Computer, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance radio (JC4ISR) to support the air-tier capability. A revised ADM was approved on October 22, 2010. Inc 3 received approval for program restructure at the October 31, 2011 Army Configuration Steering Board (CSB). Efforts in accordance with the restructured program are performed under the current Engineering Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract. A Follow-on EMD contract is anticipated to be awarded in 3QFY13 followed by a Critical Design Review (CDR) in 4QFY13. A Production Readiness Review (PRR) is scheduled for 2QFY16 leading to a Milestone C decision in 3QFY16.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program implements the provisions of Title 10 U.S. Code, Section 2350a, Cooperative Research and Development (R&amp;D) Projects: Allied Countries.  The objective is to improve, through the application of emerging technologies, the conventional defense capabilities of the United States and our cooperative partners, including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), U.S. major non-NATO allies and Friendly Foreign countries. Through technology sharing and joint equipment development these projects help reduce U.S. acquisition costs and leverage important technologies for the Army Transformation and the development of the Future Combat system. Cooperative efforts also improve multinational force compatibility with potential coalition partners through the development and use of similar equipment and improved interfaces. The program focuses specifically on international cooperative technology demonstration, validation, and interoperability of Army weapon and command, control, communications and information (C3I) systems, including the NATO Defense Against Terrorism initiatives. Projects are implemented through international agreements with foreign partners that define scope, cost and work sharing arrangements, management, contracting, security, data protection and third party transfers.  Funds are used to pay for only the U.S. work share that occurs in the United States at U.S. Government and U.S. contractors facilities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:Text>The goal of this program will be to expand worldwide allied standardization and interoperability through cooperative research and development (R&amp;D) and technology sharing per SECDEF guidance and especially in support of the U.S. Army. This program will fund the travel costs and administrative support (studies, analysis, interpretation, equipment, etc.) required to participate in internationally, such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Army Armaments Group (NAAG), Defense Against Terrorism (DAT) and to pursue new cooperative R&amp;D initiatives and international cooperative agreements such as memoranda of understanding. This program will also include:  the United States' share of costs of the NATO Civil Budget, Chapter IX, which funds the NATO Industrial Advisory Group (NIAG) and the Special Fund for Cooperative Planning (U. S. Army is Executive Agent for this NATO bill); partially will fund the Five Power Senior National Representatives, Army [SNR (A)], the Technical Cooperative Program, Bilateral SNR(A)s, and Army armaments working groups with many nations.</r2:Text>

A single solution standard will include common doctrine, technical and procedural specifications to make better use of existing information, shared data, leverage national operating picture capabilities and enable the development of interoperability of data, databases, applications, security domains and national networks architectures. The MNNEC is more than interoperability of information systems; it is the complete networking of information systems with sensors and shooters focusing on building Net-Centric interoperability among coalition tactical land components operating in a Joint Environment, focused at the  Brigade and Below level, but not excluding using the services provided at higher echelons. The MNNEC has a future force focus, endeavoring to define migration strategies for Net-Centric capabilities in the 2010-2025 timeframe with part of the work to determine the time-phased implementations of a Multi-National Network Enabled Capability. The end results would be an integration of national C2/C4ISR systems into an NCES environment to include the NATO Network Enabled Capabilities (NNEC) and the 5 Powers Net Centric Project Agreement.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The FY14 dollars in the amount of $2.369 million supports project advanced component study and development, and prototype of equipment and sub-systems supporting the Army Watercraft mission to provide critical capabilities in support of full-spectrum land combat operations, by extending the Commander's available maneuver space into and throughout the littorals, inland waterways and near coastal regions.  Army watercraft equipment supports the conduct of riverine, Logistics Over The Shore (LOTS), Joint Logistics Over The Shore (JLOTS), inter and intratheater transport, movement and maneuver, mission command and sustainment, as identified in DODD 5100-01 (Functions of the Department of Defense and its Major Components). Army Watercraft exploit the inland waterway and littoral regions as waterborne maneuver and supply routes, conduct operations through littoral entry points, developed, undeveloped, and austere access points, and in non-permissive, and/or denied access scenarios. The Army uses a spectrum of lighterage and floating craft, from heavy sustainment ocean going landing craft capable of intratheater and ship to shore transport and undeveloped beach or harbor access, to ocean-going and harbor utility tug boats and barge derricks for transport and denied port/salvage operations, and modular causeway systems to support LOTS/JLOTS. Capability will be appropriately incorporated into development of the Family of Maneuver Support Vessels (FMSV) Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) studies.

Funding will also be used to enhance the maturation of equipment, systems and sub-systems into Army Watercraft for the purposes of improved performance, energy efficiency, environmental, and regulatory compliance.  Funding is also used to enhance the seaworthiness, safety, survivability, supportability, and reliability of existing systems.  Funded efforts will advance critical gaps in these areas for the current fleet, while at the same time studying, developing, and testing emergent technologies in a manner to support future acquisitions and future fleet planning, as those areas are to be imminently informed by the Army Watercraft Systems Board of Directors (AWS BOD).

Fleet wide funding requirements will complete core requirements for development, prototype operational testing, and military unit assessment of externally mounted accommodation units in support of crew and supercargo berthing, integration of Escalation of Force (EoF) force protection enhancements, to include both lethal and non-lethal, development of Battle Command on the Move (BCOTM) and Common Operating Picture (COP)/interoperability aspects of existing C4ISR, enhancement of developing environmental and energy efficiency technologies to ensure continued compliance with increasingly stringent regulatory requirements, and study/development of digital technology integration in the areas of near and real time logistics management, area situational awareness, trend analysis, Condition Based Maintenance Plus (CBM+), equipment monitoring and diagnostics/prognostics and related functional areas, as well as study, and development of Terminal Operations (ship to shore).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports development of critical soldier support and sustainment systems including shelter systems (rigid and soft wall), cargo aerial delivery, field service systems, mortuary affairs equipment, heaters, camouflage systems to counter emerging enemy threat technologies, and other combat service support equipment.  These systems will fill identified theater distribution and services capability gaps, improve unit sustainability, and increase combat effectiveness.  This project also supports Advanced Component Development and Prototyping of Critical Distribution Capabilities to include cargo aerial delivery systems; which provide improved safety and accuracy while increasing survivability of aircraft, personnel, and equipment.  The project supports the development of tactical heater systems that support mobile Joint Service command and control, medical, and maintenance platforms.  This project develops critical enablers that support the Quartermaster (QM) Force Transformation Strategy and The Army's Modular Capabilities by maintaining readiness through fielding and integrating new equipment.  This project also ensures Army Expeditionary Forces are capable of rapid deployment through aerial delivery initiatives and reduces sustainment requirements, related Combat Support/Combat Service Support (CS/CSS) demands in lift, combat zone footprint, and costs for logistical support.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>LCADS is a modular suite of low cost, expendable parachute/container air items that can be used in lieu of current low and high velocity systems.  System includes a low-cost container, high-velocity parachute (70 - 90 feet per second (fps)) and low-velocity parachute (less than 28.5 fps).  System is compatible with United States Air Force Aircraft (USAF A/C) and aerial port handling equipment.  LCADS is a proven means to execute critical resupply missions without having to place soldiers and ground vehicle convoys on the road.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project develops and demonstrates the potential of prototype equipment and technologies to satisfy petroleum storage, distribution, and quality surveillance system requirements.  The Concept and Technology Development program supports the development and enhancement of rapidly deployable Petroleum and Water equipment. The mission includes developing onboard fuels quality analysis systems; achieving greater capabilities in the removal of Nuclear, Biological, Chemical (NBC) and other contaminants from water sources; reducing the logistics foot print; developing water reutilization systems to reduce the requirement for transport of water into the theater; and material systems to decrease the logistics foot print and employment time for the transfer of liquid logistics in the theater. This vital equipment enables the Army to achieve its mission by providing the Army with the means to be highly mobile and self-sustaining in very hostile theaters of operations.  Future Force operations demand that combat systems be rapidly deployable to the theater, rapidly emplaced upon arrival, and rapidly relocated to support a fast moving non-linear battlefield.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports development of critical soldier support and sustainment systems including shelter systems (rigid and soft wall), base camp subsystems, field service systems, mortuary affairs equipment, heaters, camouflage systems to counter emerging enemy threat technologies, and other combat service support equipment.  These systems will fill identified theater distribution and services capability gaps, improve unit sustainability, and increase combat effectiveness.  This project supports Advanced Component Development and Prototyping of Critical tactical support systems that support mobile Joint Service command and control, medical, and maintenance platforms.  This project develops critical enablers that support the Quartermaster (QM) Force Transformation Strategy and The Army's Modular Capabilities by maintaining readiness through fielding and integrating new equipment.  This project also ensures Army Expeditionary Forces are capable of rapid deployment and reduces sustainment requirements, related Combat Support/Combat Service Support (CS/CSS) demands in lift, combat zone footprint, and costs for logistical support.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>Zero-Footprint Base Camp reduces the operational energy and logistics footprint of the expeditionary base camp system, with the goal being a significant reduction in fuel, water, and power requirements to sustain operations in the field.  Operating a base camp such as Force Provider requires a significant amount of logistics support and also produces an enormous amount of by products, both of which cost money, human effort (that means a risk in the form of soldiers on the road), and represents a potential vulnerability.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Battle Command Sustainment Support System (BCS3) is the logistics Command and Control (C2) solution for U.S. land forces. BCS3 Provides Integrated Battle Command Capabilities, training and support to the Joint Land Component Warfighter. It is the logistics/sustainment part of Mission Command.  BCS3 provides commanders the capability to execute end-to-end distribution and deployment management and brings better situational awareness resulting in better decision-making capability to Warfighters. It enables Warfighters to acquire, scale and tailor critical logistics information in near-real time in order to enable the Warfighter in the planning and execution of operations. BCS3 provides an effective means to gather and integrate asset and in-transit information to manage distribution and deployment missions. BCS3 combines distribution management to include commodity and convoy tracking, and deployment management into a logistics Common Operating Picture (COP) for one mission-focused visual display. It is an inherent part of the common operating environment (COE). It provides the sustainment functionality in the command post computing environment (CP/CE).  

BCS3 has been adopted and integrated into Joint and strategic logistics (C2) processes. BCS3 is the only near-term end-to-end logistics COP solution for the Joint commander. BCS3 will maintain its core capabilities and continue to advance in development while integrating into the Joint (C2) architecture. This continued development will enable decision superiority via advanced collaborative information sharing achieved through interoperability. 

BCS3 has immediate, high pay-off benefit to Warfighters and additional future growth in its capabilities. BCS3 is a force multiplier, a precision tool for sustainment/logistics planning and execution. It is a core part of CP/CE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element (PE) funds development of medical materiel at the start of an official program of record, within the early system integration portion of the System Development and Demonstration phase of the acquisition life cycle using 6.4 funding.  Program efforts support transition of promising Science and Technology candidate medical technologies (drugs, vaccines, medical devices, diagnostics, and mechanisms for detection and control of disease carrying insects) to larger scale testing in humans for safety and effectiveness.  Programs are aligned to meet Future Force (F2) requirements stressed within concept documents and organizational structures.  The PE provides funding for Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulated human clinical trials to gain additional information about safety and effectiveness on the path to licensure for use in humans.  The Projects supported by this PE are: 

(PROJ 836) funds the demonstration and validation of medical products for enhanced combat casualty care and follow-on care, including rehabilitation.  This project also funds the human clinical trials that test the safety and effectiveness of biologics, devices and demonstration.  Clinical trials are conducted in accordance with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations.  Products from this project will transition to 832.

(PROJ 808) funds development of candidate medical countermeasures for infectious diseases of military relevance. Efforts include vaccines, drugs, diagnostic kits/devices, and insect control measures.  These funds support human clinical efficacy trials of the drug/vaccine in a larger group that are designed to assess performance and to continue safety assessments in a larger group of volunteers. Products from this project will transition to 849.

(PROJ 811) funds the development of military relevant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) medical countermeasures.  It provides funding for planning and conducting of human clinical trials in a group of healthy volunteers to assess the drug/vaccine for safety, tolerability, how the drug/vaccine is distributed, metabolized, and excreted from the body, and investigate the appropriate dose for therapeutic use.  Products from this project will transition to Project 812. 

(PROJ VS7) program upgrades, retrofits, trains, and sustains the 256 Medical Evacuation legacy helicopters that continue to play a major role in Iraq and Afghanistan. The force design will increase the number of air frames in the force from 12 to 15 aircraft for 37 MEDEVAC companies to better meet operation needs.  Products from this project will transition to VS8.

This program is managed by U.S. Army Medical Materiel Development Activity (USAMMDA) and U.S. Army Medical Materiel Agency (USAMMA)  of the US Army Medical Research and Materiel Command.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project funds development of candidate medical countermeasures for infectious diseases of military relevance.  These efforts are in: vaccines, drugs, diagnostic kits/devices, and determining if insects are infected with pathogenic organisms capable of infecting service members/preventive medicine measures  .  These funds support human clinical effectiveness (capacity to produce a desired size of an effect under ideal or optimal conditions) trials of the drug/vaccine in larger groups that are designed to assess how well the drug/vaccine works, and to continue safety assessments in a larger group of volunteers.  Funding supports both technical evaluations and human clinical testing to assure the safety and effectiveness of medical diagnostic kits and devices.  This work, which is performed in military laboratories or civilian pharmaceutical firms, is directed toward the prevention of disease, early diagnosis, and speeding recovery once diagnosed; to enhance battlefield readiness.  All clinical trials are conducted in accordance with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations, a mandatory obligation for all military products placed into the hands of medical providers or service members.  Product development priorities are determined based upon four major factors: (1) the extent and threat of the disease within the Combatant Commands theater of operations, (2) the clinical severity of the disease, (3) the technical maturity of the proposed solution, and (4) the affordability of the solution (development and production).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project funds development of militarily relevant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) medical countermeasures.  It provides funding for the planning and conducting of human clinical trials in a group of healthy volunteers to assess the drug/vaccine for safety, tolerability, how the drug/vaccine is distributed, metabolized, and excreted from the body, and to investigate the appropriate dose for therapeutic use.  Development efforts are focused on militarily unique needs effecting manning, mobilization, and deployment. 
 
The major contractor is Henry M. Jackson Foundation for the Advancement of Military Medicine, Rockville, MD.  Research efforts are coordinated with the National Institutes of Health.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project funds the demonstration and validation of medical products for enhanced combat casualty care and follow-on care, including rehabilitation.  This project funds human clinical trials to test the safety and effectiveness of biologics (products derived from living organisms) and devices necessary to meet medical requirements.  When available, commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) medical products are also tested and evaluated for transition to  engineering and manufacturing development.  Consideration is also given to reducing the medical logistics footprint through smaller weight, volume, and equipment independence from supporting materials.  All clinical trials are conducted in accordance with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

TBI Diagnostic Assay System Increment II Point of Care Device will enter pivotal clinical trial for safety and effectiveness and transition to engineering and manufacturing funding in project 832.  Increment III of the TBI Diagnostic Assay System will be delayed and will not reach milestone B (proof of concept) in FY14 based on the maturity of the technology.    Impedance Threshold Device for the Treatment of TBI: Current device has a 510(k) (Premarket Notification) clearance for multiple indications.  The submission of a new 510(k) is planned to cover the expanded indications for the currently fielded device.  Hydration Status Monitor (HSM) will transition from project MM3 6.3 funding to prepare for milestone B (proof of concept) and down-select.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Original models of Army Black Hawk MEDEVAC helicopters continue to play a major role in maintaining high US troop survival rates in Iraq and Afghanistan by evacuating wounded troops in less than one-hour.  In 2009 a VCSA-approved force design update increased the number of air frames in the force from 12 to 15 aircraft for 37 MEDEVAC companies to better meet operational needs.  In 2010, the AMEDD accepted life-cycle management of the MEDEVAC MEP from PEO Aviation.  In order to achieve required operational capability and enhance commonality across the MEDEVAC fleet, the MEDEVAC MEP program upgrades, retrofits, trains, and sustains the 256 MEDEVAC legacy helicopters to achieve the medical capability provided by the HH-60M, which is factory built for the MEDEVAC mission.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

One of the requirements for the UH-60A/L MEDEVAC was a sensor system that assisted the pilots in locating patient pick-up points and assisted them in maintaining situational awareness in night and adverse weather conditions. The MMS was currently being qualified for use on the HH-60M aircraft. This system will be installed on UH-60 aircraft using the proven Sponson-Mount FLIR system, which was currently being used in OEF for the MEDEVAC mission. The funds were developed and tested a Medical Mission Sensor FLIR prototype on the UH-60A/L.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:Text>The HH-60A/L/M had an environmental control system to assist in regulating the cabin temperature. This system helped prevent injury and loss of life to patients due to heat stress or hypothermia during transport. The system provided improved crew comfort in extreme environmental conditions, particularly high temperatures. The system  utilized the component-qualified 2-Pallet ECS developed for the HH-60M and developed and tested a prototype installation for the UH-60A/L.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:Text>Telemedicine was an ongoing requirement for US Army MEDEVAC, to allow the patient care-giver at point of injury or during transport to access the knowledge and expertise of a more qualified care-giver at a remote location, and to provide patient data to the receiving facility prior to patient arrival, allowing the facility more time to prepare for intensive care patients. The program developed, installed, and tested a telemedicine system for the UH-60A/L family of aircraft.</r2:Text>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Nett Warrior (NW) Program (named in honor of Medal of Honor recipient Colonel Robert C. Nett), also known as the Ground Soldier System (GSS) Program, leverages commercial smart devices and secure Army tactical radios to provide the dismounted leader an integrated mission command and situational awareness system for use during combat operations. The NW system provides operators electronic, real-time information on friendly positions; information about enemy activity and movement; navigational data and map imagery; and other mission related graphics which effectively puts the power of the entire Army tactical network in the hands of the dismounted leader. The NW system also provides the same integrated mission command capability to tactical vehicle mounted leaders so that when they dismount their vehicles, they still have access to the common operating picture (COP) and have full situational awareness. This capability provides unparalleled situational awareness and understanding to the dismounted leader allowing for faster, more accurate decisions and reduced fratricide in the tactical fight. 

Beginning in FY 18, this project funds the development and prototyping of the next generation of Nett Warrior, leveraging the extensive technology improvements that will occur over the next five years.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Nett Warrior (NW) program provides unparalleled situational awareness and mission command to dismounted combat leaders through an integrated computer, display, power source and radio. The NW program executed a MS A in FY09 and began three competing TD phase contracts leading to development and operational testing FY10-11. The NW MS C was approved 3 April 2012 followed by a low rate Capability Set (CS) 14 production award. Conduct Developmental Test and Evaluation planned for 4QFY12-1QFY13, followed by 1QFY13 Initial Operational Test &amp; Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) as well as hardware, software, integration and program management. The Developmental and Operational tests are validation of the system utility, supportability, and austere-environment power production and regeneration strategy-leading to a production decision in the 2QFY13 to procure the CS14 quantity of NW systems and support. NW also continues to reduce size, weight and power through a semi-annual integration and evaluation and test of the latest commercial smart device technologies which evolve continuously. This is the next increment of Nett Warrior that will leverage technology available in the FY 18 time frame.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports the Advanced Component Development and Prototyping of select Air Soldier System (Air SS) components. The Air SS provides improved safety, survivability, and human performance that amplifies the Warfighter's effectiveness and facilitates full-spectrum dominance of Army aircraft. The Air SS addresses capability gaps identified during combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan including the effects of weight and bulk, limited situational awareness, and lack of functionally integrated aircrew member life support equipment. The Air SS follows an evolutionary acquisition approach with two sub-increments that integrate mature technologies to build to the full capability. Each sub-increment progressively reduces overall weight and bulk of aircrew equipment, increases situational awareness, and enhances aircrew mobility. This funding provides advanced development for the Air SS in technology areas supporting improved environmental cooling, integrated power, wireless personal area networks, lightweight protective clothing, and miniaturized communication devices.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Air SS follows an evolutionary acquisition approach with two sub-increments that build to the full capability. Through the two sub-increments, the Air Soldier System program focuses on reducing weight and bulk while integrating capabilities including optimized survival equipment; an integrated Soldier-worn electronics suite; integrated wireless aircraft and survival communications capability; a digital day/night heads-up display for all Army aircraft platforms; optimized laser eye protection, and reduced clothing layers with no loss of thermal protection. These funds resource various government agencies to transition critical technologies/products from the Advanced Component Development to the Engineering Manufacturing Development phase in support of the identified Air Soldier System sub-increments.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Joint Program Office (JPO) supports all Services and Special Operations Command (SOCOM). The Integrated Broadcast Service (IBS) is the worldwide Department of Defense (DoD) standard network for transmitting time-sensitive tactical and strategic intelligence and targeting data to all echelons of Joint Service operational users. The JPO's role is to complete consolidation and replacement of existing IBS terminal functionality and capability, and to complete execution of the IBS Technical Transition Plan (TTP). The JTT family of systems currently consists of the JTT-Senior and JTT-IBS. The TTP is a comprehensive refresh effort of the entire IBS network focused on rearchitecting the broadcast from its current multi-broadcast, multi-data format structure, to a single broadcast (Common Interactive Broadcast - CIB) and single data format (Common Message Format - CMF). The JTT family of systems is a critical component of the TTP as these systems are the only IBS receiver/transceiver devices in the DoD being modernized to support both the new consolidated broadcast architecture and the National Security Agency's (NSA) crypto modernization mandate. The JTT upgrades must execute the over-the-air broadcast portion of the TTP and IBS data flow via the existing over-the-air IBS broadcast networks. The JTT is the official IBS producer system, and ensures continued IBS interoperability to a variety of tactical receivers across DoD and the Services throughout the TTP implementation period and beyond. This program funds the completion of evaluation of JTT hardware and software modules, as well as performance enhancements to the family of JTT equipment. This is necessary to ensure crypto modernization compliance and to complete migration to a rearchitected CIB and CMF-based IBS broadcast structure. Funds also support the coordination of JTT configuration management, training, equipping and supporting the Warfighter with improved Joint Readiness and Interoperability.

FY14 Funds of $0.079 million support the continued test and evaluation of the Common Interactive Broadcast (CIB) crypto modernization waveform for migration to the IBS intelligence Data Enterprise.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) develops and demonstrates selected technology enabled capabilities to support advanced ground and aviation systems, precision weapons, and soldier equipment.  Funding facilitates demonstration of relatively mature technologies and systems in relevant environments and tactical / operational scenarios, taking technologies through and beyond Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6. Efforts include competitive prototyping earlier in development to facilitate transition of new capabilities into acquisition programs of record. Efforts funded will be selected by an Army Senior Executive Steering Group to ensure that demonstrations have high potential for filling capability gaps and transition. This PE provides the Army an improved mechanism for fulfilling the goals of the Weapon Systems Acquisition Reform Act (WSARA) of 2009 by enabling greater competition in the latter stages of technology maturation and establishes a closer alignment between Science and Technology (S&amp;T) programs and acquisition programs. This PE also provides analytical support for Analysis of Alternatives (AoA).  It is used to centrally funds AoAs for new program starts that require an material development decision and do not yet have a Program Manager assigned for material development. 

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.
     
Work in this PE is performed by the Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM), Engineering Research Development Center (ERDC), U.S. Army TRADOC Analysis Center (TRAC), U.S. Army Material Systems Analysis Activity (AMSAA), and/or Space and Missile Defense Command (SMDC).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

This project also provides analytical support for AoAs in FY 13. To qualify for funding, a material development decision will be required. The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

Work in the PE is performed by the Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM), Engineering Research Development Center (ERDC), the Space and Missile Defense Command (SMDC), U.S Army TRADOC Analysis Center (TRAC) and U.S. Army Materiel Systems Analysis Activity (AMSAA).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program supports the overall Air and Missile Defense (AMD) architecture and provides a robust intercept capability against Cruise Missiles (CM), Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) and Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar (RAM) threats for deployed forces.  The Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment 2 - Intercept (IFPC Inc 2-I) is a ground-based weapon system that will be designed to acquire, track, engage, and defeat UAS, CM, and RAM. The System will provide 360-degree protection and will simultaneously engage threats arriving from different azimuths. A block acquisition approach will be used to provide this capability. The Block 1 system will consist of an existing interceptor and sensor and development of technical fire control and a Multi-Mission Launcher (MML) to support the UAS and CM mission. The Block 2 system will develop interceptors, sensors, and technical fire control to support the counter RAM mission. The IFPC Inc 2-I System will be compatible with the Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) C2 architecture. The IFPC Inc 2-I System will be transportable by Army common mobile platforms.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Materiel Development Decision (MDD) was completed in fourth quarter FY 2011, allowing for the initiation of an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) to determine materiel solution approach; establishment of requirement baseline; initiation of development of required Milestone documents and execution of the Milestone decision to authorize proceeding into the next phase of development in FY 2013.  

The Government plans to send funding to the Aviation and Missile Research Development and Engineering Center (AMRDEC) for the development and demonstration of the MML.  The Government also plans to send funding to the Letterkenney Army Depot (LEAD) for the development and testing of the Multi-Mission Launcher (MML).  An Analsyis will be performed to determine production of the MML.

No new contracts will be awarded in support of the development of IFPC Inc 2-I Block I effort.  The Government will use existing contracts and work performed by other Government agencies.  Additional work will be performed by the Aviation and Missile Research, Development and Engineering Center (AMRDEC) and Letterkenny Army Depot (LEAD) through funding provided to those organizations by the IFPC Inc 2-I Product Office.  The Government will use the following contracts:

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element (PE) evaluates unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) prototype systems that provide increased flight and/or mission duration for Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) and communications capabilities. These systems include the aerial platform integrated with existing and/or developmental payloads. Project LE4 is developing the Long Endurance Multi-intelligence Vehicle (LEMV), which is a hybrid airship prototype integrated with existing and developmental ISR and communications payloads to improve persistent surveillance and assured communications capabilities. Hybrid airship platform endurance is dependent on weather conditions and payload weight, but the LEMV prototype system is expected to increase endurance to 21 days on average assuming 20 knot winds.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Long Endurance Multi-Intelligence Vehicle (LEMV) is a technology demonstration effort to improve persistent surveillance and assured communications using a platform with significantly improved endurance over existing systems. The LEMV platform is a hybrid airship that achieves vertical lift from helium contained within its hull making it lighter-than-air and from traditional engine propulsion that produces thrust to provide lift.  The LEMV prototype requirements are to achieve 21 day endurance in 20 knot continuous winds, carry 2500 pounds of multiple surveillance and communication payloads, operate at a maximum altitude of 20,000 feet Mean Sea Level, and provide 16 kilowatts (kW) of power to the payload. The LEMV system is recoverable and reusable. The LEMV system prototype and associated technologies will be evaluated during a Joint Military Utility Assessment (JMUA) in an operational environment upon completion of developmental testing.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Army received approval to acquire the LEMV under an Other Transaction Authority (OTA).  Extensive market research determined that this hybrid airship has never been manufactured as a full-scale functioning system and critical hybrid airship technology at the system and subsystem level is mainly available from non-traditional Department of Defense contractors.  An OTA agreement was preferred in order to gain access to critical technology within the Non-Traditional industrial community in this area and to promote competition. The OTA Agreement was competitively awarded using a competitive Request for Proposal process.  A Joint Military Utility Assessment (JMUA) will be conducted in theatre following the system development and transport. A Material Development Decision (MDD) is expected 90-180 days after completion of the JMUA Phase 1 (the first 2 months of the overall JMUA time period).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
