                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program includes support for multidisciplinary basic research in a wide range of scientific and engineering disciplines that enable the U.S. Navy to maintain
technological superiority, and for university research infrastructure to acquire research instrumentation needed to maintain and improve the quality of university
research important to the Navy. Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative (MURI) efforts involve teams of researchers investigating high priority topics and
opportunities that intersect more than one traditional technical discipline. For many military problems this multidisciplinary approach serves to stimulate innovation,
accelerate research progress and expedite transition of results into Naval applications. The Defense University Research Instrumentation Program (DURIP) supports
university research infrastructure essential to high quality, Navy-relevant research. The instrumentation program complements other Navy research programs by
supporting the purchase of high cost research instrumentation that is necessary to carry out cutting-edge research. The program supports Presidential Early Career
Awards for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE), single investigator research efforts performed by outstanding academic scientists and engineers early in their research
careers. This program provides the knowledge base, scientific concepts, and technological advances for the maintenance of Naval power and national security.


Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Title>DEFENSE UNIVERSITY RESEARCH INSTRUMENTATION PROGRAM (DURIP)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>DURIP funds are provided to universities to purchase relatively high cost research instrumentation that is normally not included in single-investigator type research grants. Individual grants range from $50K to $1M. The DURIP program is an Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) interest item and OSD directs that funding for the DURIP efforts be awarded after OSD announces the awardees, which typically takes place towards the second half of the fiscal year. In turn, universities need to purchase the instrumentation and take delivery before any billings are generated. It frequently takes several months for delivery and billing to be completed.


FY 2012 program increases provide for an increased number of grants.  In past years, more outstanding proposals have been received than could be funded.


FY 2014 program increases provide for an increased number of grants. In past years, more outstanding proposals have been received than could be funded.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Title>MULTIDISCIPLINARY UNIVERSITY RESEARCH INITIATIVE (MURI)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>Research efforts include high priority topics that intersect more than one traditional discipline. MURI topics are selected to address Naval Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Focus Areas as described in the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan. 
The MURI program is an OSD interest item and OSD directs that funding for the MURI efforts be awarded after OSD announces the awardees, which typically takes place towards the second half of the fiscal year. Since the MURI program funds academic researchers, execution of the efforts typically ramps up during the summer academic break months. MURI projects make significant contributions to Navy and DoD objectives by; speeding up scientific programs by cross-fertilization of ideas, hastening the transition of basic research to practical applications, and training students in cross-disciplinary approaches to science and engineering research of importance to DoD.

FY 2014 decreased in funds to accommodate the increase in the number of proposals for Defense University Research Instrumentation Program (DURIP).

                                    <r2:Description>PECASE awards are made to academic scientists early in their research careers for extremely prestigious, single-investigator research in areas of vital importance to the Navy. Awards provide national recognition and research grants of up to $200K per year for five years. OSD, with policy and oversight responsibility for the PECASE program, directed that the number of PECASE awards be set at four new awards per year. 

FY 2012 to FY 2013 funding increase reflects need to cover 15 PECASE awardees chosen in FY 2008. 

FY 2013 to FY 2014 funding increase reflects need to cover nine more PECASE awardees chosen in FY 2009.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element (PE) sustains U.S. Naval Science and Technology (S&amp;T) superiority by providing new technological concepts for the maintenance of naval power and national security, and by helping to avoid scientific surprise while exploiting scientific breakthroughs and providing options for new Future Naval Capabilities (FNCs).  The Department of Navy (DON) component responds to S&amp;T directions of the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan for long term Navy and Marine Corps improvements and is in consonance with future warfighting concepts and doctrine developed at the Naval Warfare Development Command and the Marine Corps Combat Development Command.  It enables technologies that significantly improve the Joint Chiefs of Staff's Future Joint Warfighting Capabilities.  The In-house Laboratory Independent Research (ILIR) program also adds increased emphasis to the revitalization of the scientist and engineer workforce component at the Navy's Warfare Centers and Laboratories by attracting superior candidates and retaining our best members through the provision of exciting and meaningful work.

This PE addresses DON Basic Research, which includes scientific study and experimentation directed toward increasing knowledge and understanding in national-security related aspects of physical, engineering, environmental, and life sciences, and is the core of Discovery and Invention.  Basic research projects are developed, managed, and related to more advanced aspects of research in some hundred-plus technology and capability-related 'thrusts', which are consolidated in thirteen research focus areas: Power and Energy; Operational Environments; Maritime Domain Awareness; Asymmetric and Irregular Warfare; Information, Analysis and Communication; Power Projection; Assure Access and Hold at Risk; Distributed Operations; Naval Warfighter Performance and Protection; Survivability and Self-Defense; Platform Mobility; Fleet/Force Sustainment; Affordability, Maintainability and Reliability.  

This portion of the DON Basic Research Program provides participating Naval Warfare Centers and Laboratories with funding for: basic research to support the execution of their assigned missions; developing and maintaining a cadre of active researchers who can distill and extend results from worldwide research and apply them to solve Naval problems; promoting hiring and development of new scientists; and encouragement of collaboration with universities, private industry, and other Navy and Department of Defense laboratories.  

ILIR efforts are selected by Naval Warfare Centers/Lab Commanding Officers and Technical Directors near the start of each Fiscal Year through internal competition.  Efforts typically last three years, and are generally designed to assess the promise of new lines of research.  Successful efforts attract external, competitively awarded funding.  Because the Warfare Centers and Labs encompass the full range of naval technology interests, the scope of ILIR topics roughly parallels that of PE 0601153N, Defense Research Science.

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

						- Continue all efforts of FY 2012, less those noted as complete above.
- Complete FY 2011 initiated ILIR projects during FY 2013.
- Complete the research on the Microbial Biosynthesis of Critical Energetic Ingredients which investigated new methods of microbial synthesis in the production of feedstocks for energetics. Microbial synthesis is the controlled harvesting of organic molecules from biological factories such as E. coli. It is hypothesized that large scale control and manipulation of these efficient microbial factories could lead to increased availability of traditionally rare feedstocks, enhanced sustainability due to the reduced need for organics from non-petroleum-derived feedstocks, and the significant reduction of hazardous waste. 
- Complete the research for Accelerated Quantum Chemistry Simulations of Energetics using a Novel Metadynamics Approach, the goal of which is to develop methods based on a metadynamics approach that can predict important chemical properties of energetic materials and additives that are normally inaccessible to first-principles simulation. The main properties used to evaluate the method are uni- and bimolecular decomposition barriers, oxidation reactions, accelerated aging studies, and crystalline density predictions. The focus will be on complex or novel systems that have previously been difficult to simulate, such as polymer chains, novel high-nitrogen explosives, and organometallic compounds
- Complete the research for Convergent Synthesis of High Performance Heterocycles via Late Amination, which focuses on convergent synthesis of energetic, high nitrogen CHNO heterocycles using novel energetic synthons to provide increased performance to Navy ordnance. Designing higher heats of formation and higher densities into novel energetic CHNO compounds, while retaining good kinetic stability and safety properties, requires new structural motifs. The 1,2,3,4-tetrazine 1,3-dioxide structural motif, first described by Tartakovsky et al. in the 1991 synthesis of benzo tetrazine dioxide, remains an undeveloped energetic synthon. Although furazano tetrazine dioxide has been known for the last decade, its energetic properties are still unknown. The synthetic routes chosen are expected to permit ready transition to the pilot level and offer reasonably priced materials.

This incorporates a coding study to gauge inter-rater reliability as part of the content analysis. The results will be used to (a) generate assessment test materials for a follow-on decision making experiment, and (b) create a summary of the recorded HSI tradeoff case studies, including key learnings and a description of tradeoff decision requirements.
- Complete research for Localization of Human Spatial Processing using Dense-array Electroencephalography.  Aviation mishap statistics confirm that in-flight spatial disorientation (SD) poses one of the greatest human factor problems for military aviators. The impact of this cognitive threat costs the DoD an average of 20 aircraft and 25 flight personnel annually. Recent animal research has identified specialized neural structures involved in spatial orientation. The objective of this research is to determine if spatial neural mechanisms found in animal studies and in human functional magnetic resonance imaging tests can be further localized and defined by introducing limited ranges of normal human motion. 
- Complete Integration of an Implantable Potentiostat for Continuous Monitoring of Nitric Oxide (NO) into a Rat Model of Hyperbaric Oxygen (HBO) Toxicity.  The U.S. Navy has long used oxygen breathing for covert underwater operations. The major limitation to HBO is the risk of HBO-induced pulmonary and central nervous system toxicity. NO is a critical second messenger involved in the pathophysiology of HBO-induced toxicity. The study examines an implantable NO sensor in conjunction with both traditional and experimental implantable potentiostats. This work will lead to the development of new research capabilities to measure NO production in vivo.

- Complete FY 2011 initiated ILIR projects during FY 2013.
- Complete research for the Numerical Analysis and Design of Methods for Partial Differential Equations (PDE) Constrained Optimization.  PDE Constrained Optimization problems arise in many areas of science and engineering, and include problems such as optimal shape design and parameter estimation. While advanced methods for general, non-linear optimization have existed for over a half century, the existence of PDE constraints in optimization problems make the existing optimization methods at best inefficient, and often times infeasible. The goal is to design and analyze new methods which build on previous efforts developed over the last decade, and enable these new methods to be used on problems currently seen in the analysis of naval systems. 
- Complete research for Systems-of-Systems (SoS) Network Analysis where the design of Systems-of-Systems (SoS) requires careful analysis of not only the subsystems, but also the interconnections between the subsystems. These interconnections could possibly correspond to dependencies, communications, shared information, joint operation, or other relationships. This research seeks to develop a theory of SoS engineering and analysis based on graph theory, in particular the theory of time series of attributed graphs, in which the vertices and edges may have attributes (such as readiness levels or communication throughput). This theory will involve both a mathematical formulation of the SoS problem, but also a consideration of how such systems can be simulated, analyzed, and tested. 
- Complete research for Framework for Collaborative Robotic Asset Management where a formalized and extensible approach for discovering, modeling, monitoring, and managing a distributed collection of disparate unmanned systems is defined. This framework will support near real-time system modeling, resource appraisal, and brokering functionalities while using scalable, abstract representations of mission, job, and resource capabilities to provide new levels of intelligent resource utilization to the Navy. The proposed work directly supports research initiatives in the areas of underwater communication networks, minimal operator intervention, intelligent decision-making, and promotes increased situational awareness. This project will present the design of a hierarchical architecture of software components and definition of the elements that comprise the framework Knowledge Representation Scheme in order to provide deliberative management capabilities for a system of collaborating robotic assets.

						- Continue all efforts of FY 2012, less those noted as complete above.
- Complete FY 2011 initiated ILIR projects during FY 2013.
- Complete research for High Fidelity, Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) Cavitation Simulation.  This research advances the state of the art in cavitation prediction, enhancing the understanding of the dynamics of cavitation on control surfaces and propellers though the use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Advances in cavitation modeling will be accomplished through the use of a true, two-phase method to model the vapor and liquid as separate fluids rather than as a homogenous mixture, which is commonly used. The final product should be a RANS code useful for predicting cavitation on control surfaces and propulsors of interest to the US Navy, where these predictions may reveal new details of the cavitation sheet break up and associated acoustics.
- Complete research for Development of a New Vehicle Dynamics-Based Motion Planning and Control Algorithm into the motion planning process. The Sampling-Based Model Predictive Control (SBMPC) algorithm is in development as an efficient Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm that generates control inputs and system trajectories. The method is based on sampling the input space at each sample period, and implementing a goal directed optimization method in place of linear programming, nonlinear programming or evolutionary algorithms. This formulation of MPC readily applies to systems with nonlinear dynamics, and avoids the local minima which can limit the performance of MPC algorithms implemented using nonlinear programming. The generic framework will be adapted to enable time and energy optimal trajectory generation for UUV/USV systems.
- Complete research for Wall Pressure Fluctuation Measurements in High Reynolds Number Turbulent Pipe Flow.  The objective of this effort addresses the problem of flow noise and flow induced vibration experienced by hull mounted and towed SONAR arrays. Turbulent wall pressure fluctuations at moderate to high Reynolds numbers constitute a primary source of direct flow noise for hull mounted and towed SONAR arrays. In addition, they act as a primary source of radiated noise from undersea vehicles. Furthermore, contemporary finite element structural analysis requires forcing functions as input parameters. The general complexity of the turbulent wall pressure field leads to the requirement for measurements and modeling in order to characterize the field and better understand the physics of this unique class of flows.
- Initiate research for Vehicle Dynamics and Turbulent Wake Characterization.
- Initiate research for Hydrodynamic Self Cleaning and Improved Ship Performance
- Initiate research for Predicting Complex Drag on Towed Arrays.
- Initiate ILIR projects that are intended to be approximately three years in length.  Projects selected for FY 2013 will focus on supporting Naval Battlespace Awareness and Intelligent Naval Sensors, Innovative Naval Prototype initiatives in Persistent Surveillance and Sea Basing, and the National Naval Responsibility in Undersea Weaponry.

The stepped planing hull is popular in the pleasure craft industry to achieve faster speeds than a traditional deep-vee planing monohull. Currently in the pleasure craft industry, stepped planing hull design is done by trial and error; unknown to the Navy are the combined effects of military payload and stepped hull configuration on craft performance

						- Continue all efforts of FY 2012, less those noted as complete above.
- Complete FY 2011 initiated ILIR projects during FY 2013.
- Complete Optical Propagation Studies for Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) Underwater Laser Communications. This project's objective investigated the fundamental propagation characteristics of "broad beam", or diffused, light sources for N-LOS optical links. N-LOS links provide the benefits of decreased pointing-and-tracking complexity, increased time for link closure, and decreased sensitivity to obstructions. This project studied how the spatial distribution of light caused by scattering, or shaping of the initial source beam distribution, affects the propagation of modulated light in water and optimal source distributions matched to particular undersea environments.
- Complete research for Turbulent Wake Characterization, where understanding the details of complex turbulent flows around a submerged body is critical for analysis of a propulsor operating in its wake. The inflow characteristics to the propulsor have a significant impact on its performance. This project focuses on predicting the turbulent wake characteristics of a submerged, appended, model-scale body using Large Eddy Simulation (LES) techniques. Because the propulsor impacts the pressure field, it has an effect on its own inflow; therefore, the ultimate goal of this project will be to model a propulsor and an appended body in the same domain using LES.  
- Complete research for Surface Piercing Strut Wake Signature Reduction.  Surface piercing struts in motion relative to water generate a fairly complex wave, producing a rising bow wave in the front of the strut, a cavity on the sides and a wake behind. The size of this white water wake is a function of the strut shape, Reynolds number (Re), Froude number (Fr), water salinity, surfactants, etc. The objective of this effort is to understand the bubble generation and transport phenomena, ideally minimizing the bubble entrainment visual detection to a level comparable to the strut itself. Two approaches are investigated: 1) an experimental method that provides insight into the physics of the flow field; and 2) a computational method that validates the existing results and tests new concepts.

                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>The ILIR initiative seeks to improve the quality of defense research conducted predominantly through the Naval Warfare Centers/Laboratories.  It also supports the development of technical intellect and education of engineers and scientists in disciplines critical to national defense needs through the development of new knowledge in a military laboratory environment.  Initial research focus is often conducted in an unfettered environment since it is basic research, but many projects focus on applying recently developed theoretical knowledge to real world military problems with the intention of developing new capabilities and improving the performance of existing systems.  Individual project metrics then become more tailored to the needs of specific applied research and advanced development programs.  The National Research Council of the National Academies of Science and Engineering's Congressionally directed "Assessment of Department of Defense Basic Research" concluded that the DoD is managing its basic research program effectively.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element (PE) sustains U.S. Naval Science and Technology (S&amp;T) superiority, provides new technological concepts for the maintenance of naval power and national security, and helps avoid scientific surprise.  It is based on investment directions as defined in the Naval Science &amp; Technology Strategy approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (Sep 2011).  This new strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It exploits scientific breakthroughs and provides options for new Future Naval Capabilities (FNCs) and Innovative Naval Prototypes (INPs).  

This PE addresses basic research efforts including scientific study and experimentation directed toward increasing knowledge and understanding in national security related aspects of physical, engineering, environmental and life sciences.  Basic research efforts are developed, managed, and related to more advanced aspects of research on the order of a hundred technology and capability-related 'thrusts', which are consolidated into about fifteen research areas.  These in turn support the major research areas of the Navy and Marine Corps: Autonomous Systems; Command, Control, Communications and Computers (C4); Marine as a System; Information Analysis and Decision Support; Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance; Logistics; Materials; Operational Environments; Platforms; Power and Energy Technology; Sensors and Electronics; Warrior Performance and Protection; Weapons and Support (Education and Outreach).

S&amp;T investment in basic research also includes the National Naval Responsibilities (NNRs), fields upon which a wide range of fundamental Naval capabilities depend.  There are currently five NNRs.

S&amp;T investment in basic research also includes the Basic Research Challenge program which was established to competitively select and fund promising research programs in new areas not addressed by the current basic research program.  The Basic Research Challenge Program stimulates new, high-risk basic research projects in multi-disciplinary and departmental collaborative efforts, and funds topics that foster leading edge science and attracts new principal investigators and organizations.  Basic Research Challenge awards are for a period of four years.

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program element (PE) sustains U.S. Naval Science and Technology (S&amp;T) superiority, provides new technological concepts for the maintenance of naval power and national security, and helps avoid scientific surprise.  It is based on investment directions as defined in the Naval Science &amp; Technology Strategy.  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It exploits scientific breakthroughs and provides options for new Future Naval Capabilities (FNCs) and Innovative Naval Prototypes (INPs).  

This PE addresses basic research efforts including scientific study and experimentation directed toward increasing knowledge and understanding in national security related aspects of physical, engineering, environmental and life sciences.  Basic research efforts are developed, managed, and related to more advanced aspects of research on the order of a hundred technology and capability-related 'thrusts', which are consolidated into about fifteen research areas.  These in turn support the major research areas of the Navy and Marine Corps: Autonomous Systems; Command, Control, Communications and Computers (C4); Marine as a System; Information Analysis and Decision Support; Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance; Logistics; Materials; Operational Environments; Platforms; Power and Energy Technology; Sensors and Electronics; Warrior Performance and Protection; Weapons and Support. Activities in this area also support maintenance of the Science and Engineering Workforce and STEM Education and Outreach.

S&amp;T investment in basic research also includes the National Naval Responsibilities (NNRs),  S&amp;T areas that are uniquely important to maintaining U.S. Naval superiority. With the designation in 2011 of Sea-Based Aviation as an NNR, there are currently five NNRs.

S&amp;T investment in basic research also includes the Basic Research Challenge program which was established to competitively select and fund promising research programs in new areas not addressed by the current basic research program.  The Basic Research Challenge Program stimulates new, high-risk basic research projects in multi-disciplinary and departmental collaborative efforts, and funds topics that foster leading edge science and attracts new principal investigators and organizations.  Basic Research Challenge awards are for a period of four years.

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>Surface/subsurface reduced signatures; free-surface, subsurface, and propulsor hydromechanics; hull life assurance; advanced ship concepts; distributed intelligence for automated survivability; advanced electrical power systems; air vehicles; air platforms propulsion and power; air platforms survivability and signature control; special aviation projects; Unmanned Air Vehicle/Unmanned Combat Air Vehicle (UAV/UCAV); environmental quality; logistics; power generation, energy conversion, and storage; and advancements in naval technology innovations.

The increase in FY 2013 is due to the new sub-activity, Advancements in Naval Technology Innovations, to recognize this new area of science, where game changing technology is likely to be initiated.  Funding decrease in FY 2014 is a result of reassignment of funding for the Basic Research Challenge Program into the newly created Research Activity.

Research planning activities associated with the new Sea Based Aviation National Naval Responsibility (SBA NNR) will take place in FY 2012-13, with most projects starting in FY2014.

Accomplishments and plans described below are examples for each effort category.

                                    <r2:Description>The ONR Basic Research Challenge (BRC) program was established in 2008 to competitively select and fund promising research programs in new areas not addressed by the current basic research program.  In the past, the Basic Research Challenge Program has been integrated into the legacy R2 Activities to illustrate its alignment with the mainstream Naval research disciplines, but with this update BRC is being identified as its own R2 Activity to call attention to the significance it provides to new areas of Naval importance.  The program stimulates new, high-risk basic research projects in multidisciplinary and departmental collaborative efforts, and funds topics that foster leading edge science and attract new principal investigators and organizations. Basic Research Challenge awards are for a period of four years. Topics are submitted by ONR program officers and are selected for BRC awards by ONR's director of research. Basic Research Challenge award topics are then issued as a broad agency announcement.

In FY 2014 the BRC is being identified under its own Research Activity to highlight its more prominent role in stimulating competitive multidisciplinary research between ONR departments. BRC research by its nature will likely cross the traditional Research Activity boundaries and produce standout results worthy of specific focused attention.

                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Defense Basic Research seeks to improve the quality of defense research conducted predominantly through universities and government laboratories.  It also supports the education of engineers and scientists in disciplines critical to national defense needs through the development of new knowledge in an academic environment.  Initial research focus is generally conducted in an unfettered environment because of the nature of basic research, but as more is learned and applications emerge, individual research projects take on a more applied focus.  Individual project metrics then become more tailored to the needs of specific applied research and advanced development programs.  Example metrics include a biporous wick structure for thermal management of power electric modules capable of removing 900 watts per square centimeter which was recently developed by an academia/industry team.  The National Research Council of the National Academies of Science and Engineering's congressionally directed "Assessment of Department of Defense Basic Research" concluded that the DoD is managing its basic research program effectively.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>FY 2013 funding associated with Future Naval Capability (FNC) efforts are transferring to a new Program Element titled Future Naval Capabilities Applied Research (PE 0602750N).  This is to enhance the visibility of the FNC Program by providing an easily navigable overview of all 6.2 FNC investments in a single location.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (Sep 2011).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare.

This PE supports both advanced technology research and near to mid-term transition opportunities.  The advanced research focus is primarily on High Energy Lasers (HEL), Electromagnetic railgun development, high speed weapon propulsion, and electro-optic/infrared (EO/IR) sensor technologies.  

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Title>DIRECTED ENERGY</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The goal of this activity is to develop Directed Energy (DE) technology for Navy applications. The DE program addresses the requirements of future Navy combatants to provide ship defense against the emerging threats that are proliferating throughout the Navies of the world. The Directed Energy portion of this activity consists of two elements. The first element involves applied research and development of technologies supporting advanced accelerators with applications to directed energy weapons. This activity also includes the Free Electron Laser (FEL) Innovative Naval Prototype (INP) which will deliver multi-mission capability. 

FY 2012 to FY 2013 decrease in funding is primarily due to a revised directed energy portfolio focused on a diversified approach. 
FY 2013 to FY 2014 increase in funding is due to increased work on the Solid State Laser (SSL) program.

Solid State Laser - Technology Maturation (SSL-TM):
-Initiate the development of technologies suitable for a solid state laser weapon system, including technologies for maritime beam director, targeting and laser subsystems, which are capable of supporting future Navy missions to defeat small boat swarms, UAV swarms, and provide potential ISR disruption and/or defeat.  This work supports future prototype developments and will include laser subsystem (potentially both slab and fiber solid state systems) and required beam director scientific studies. The focus of the effort will be to support the development and advancement of future Navy Solid State Laser prototypes, including the development of lethality studies and atmospheric characterization. These scientific studies are critical to understand and support missions identified for a layered defensive capability, in the maritime environment, which shall include robust modeling and simulation of atmospheric absorption and turbulence.
-Initiate and conduct lethality testing for notional designs of proposed solid state laser designs. This will include scientific studies of laser erosion, pitting, and ablation of various target materials for improved modeling and simulation, that will support development of the governing technical requirements for a beam director and targeting system capable of performing Navy surface ship self defense missions.  
-Initiate and conduct studies of atmospheric absorption and turbulence, suitable for use to evaluate notional maritime beam director subsystems, and shall include studies in adaptive optics for improved lethality performance in low altitude, maritime surface conditions. These scientific studies are critical to understanding the impact of boundary layer and sea-water-air turbulent mechanics on future laser weapons systems and interfaces.
-Initiate and conduct trade studies on innovative solid state laser subsystems designs, based off industry available technologies or those technologies which are supported through planned investments by the High Energy laser Joint Technology Office (HEL  JTO). These investments will be considered "break through" type of investments, which require additional scientific study to determine their potential for  near term capability improvements in a future naval prototype system.
-Initiate and conduct scientific studies on laser subcomponents, including laser pump diodes and laser gain media, which have the potential to support future acquisition programs, but are based in a solid state laser technologies. Efforts in this area will focus on emerging commercial technologies and government sponsored research, which are suitable for use in a maritime domain. Research and technology developments will include advancements suitable for use by either solid state slab or solid state fiber optic laser subsystems - and which if matured, would enable rapid scientific advancements and improve specific systems performance in identified key performance parameters.
-Initiate and conduct scientific trade studies of notional predictive avoidance systems, which examine the control interfaces between sensors and future prototypical naval laser weapons, which would provide an inherent "safe-arm" function for the projecting of laser power at long range (potentially beyond typical visible, line of sight distances.) Of particular concern is the designs for safety in future laser weapons to halt laser energy propagation, while performing Navy surface ship self defense missions, and avoid inadvertent illumination of non-threat forces (e.g. friendly sensors or platforms.)

                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>This PE develops early components technologies that can be integrated into weapon systems that meet warfighter requirements.  Most of the work in this PE can be classified between Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 2 (technology concept and/or application formulation) and TRL 4 (component and/or breadboard validation in laboratory environments).  The metrics used to evaluate 6.2 programs are necessarily less precise than those used in 6.3 programs. 

The metrics for this PE can be divided into two categories:  technological and organizational/functional.  Technological metrics address the success of the work performed.  The primary technological metrics used in this PE involve laboratory experiments/tests demonstrating proof of the concept for the technology.  This demonstration is frequently a hand-assembled functioning breadboard of the concept.  The organizational/functional metrics applied to this PE include:  transition of the technology to advanced development in a 6.3 PE and applicability of the technology to documented warfighter problems or requirements.  Successful implementation of these categories would result in the application of a pass/fail metric and further evaluation for possible transition to a 6.3 development/demonstration program.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>FY 2013 funding associated with Future Naval Capability (FNC) efforts are transferring to a new Program Element titled Future Naval Capabilities Applied Research (PE 0602750N).  This is to enhance the visibility of the FNC Program by providing an easily navigable overview of all 6.2 FNC investments in a single location.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this program element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (Sep 2011).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare.

This PE addresses applied research associated with providing the capability of Platform and Force Protection for the U.S. Navy.  It supports the development of technologies associated with all naval platforms (surface, subsurface, terrestrial, and air) and the protection of those platforms.  The goal is to provide the ability to win or avoid engagements with other platforms or weapons and, in the event of engagement, to resist and control damage while preserving operational capability.  Within the Naval Transformational Roadmap, this investment directly supports the Theater Air and Missile Defense transformational capability required by Sea Shield and the Ship to Objective Maneuver key transformational capability.  This is accomplished by improvements in platform offensive performance, stealth, and self defense.  

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>The Aircraft Technology activity develops technologies for enhanced capability of naval aviation aircraft platforms in terms of mission effectiveness, platform range, responsiveness, survivability, observability, readiness, safety and life cycle cost. It also develops new Naval air vehicle concepts and high impact, scaleable naval air vehicle technologies, such as - autonomous air vehicle command and control, helicopter and tiltrotor rotor systems, aerodynamics, propulsion systems, materials, structures and flight controls for future and legacy air vehicles. This activity directly supports the Naval Aviation Enterprise Science and Technology Objectives and the Naval Science and Technology Strategic Plan, principally in the Autonomy and Unmanned Systems, Platform Design and Survivability, Power and Energy and Total Ownership Cost Focus Areas, Sea-Based Aviation was designated as a National Naval Responsibility (SBA NNR) in FY 2011 and will refocus investments beginning in FY 2014 in areas that are Naval unique or dominated by Naval requirements. 

FY 2013 funding increase due to two programs that began in FY12 and are ramping up in FY 2013: Variable Cycle Advanced Technology (VCAT) and Autonomous Aerial Cargo/Utility System (AACUS). VCAT will identify and mature critical, relevant variable/adaptive cycle propulsion system technologies for the next generation carrier-based TACAIR/ISR systems. AACUS will develop advanced autonomous capabilities to enable rapid resupply of distributed forces in the short term. The SBA NNR Structures and Materials program is also ramping up in FY 2013. This program will develop the next generation structural capability and material response science for aircraft technology in fixed and rotary wing, manned and unmanned airframe technology to achieve reduced weight, increased durability, strength, streamlined manufacturability, reduced life-cycle cost and maintenance/readiness gaps improvements. Program payoffs include increased availability/readiness, reduced sustainment requirements, fatigue/loads life enhancement, reduced weight and improved range, and advanced prognostics design tools.  

Beginning in FY 2014, applied research efforts will begin under the Sea-Based Aviation National Naval Responsibility (SBA NNR) Propulsion thrust area as well, resulting in the funding increase in FY 2014.  These efforts addresses unique attributes to propulsion and power technologies for Naval Aviation, as well as those having higher importance to Naval Aviation and some that are more pervasive to all of military aviation. Related basic research efforts are addressed under 0601153N.

                                    <r2:Title>FLEET FORCE PROTECTION AND DEFENSE AGAINST UNDERSEA THREATS</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>Fleet Force Protection and Defense against Undersea Threats efforts include applied research for complementary sensor and processing technologies for platform protection and shipboard technologies to increase the survivability of surface ship and submarine platforms against torpedo threats and to develop the capability to interdict underwater asymmetric threats to ships and infrastructure in harbors.  Current small platforms (both surface and airborne) have little to no situational awareness (SA) or self-protection against air, surface, and asymmetric threats.  A goal of this activity is to provide these platforms with effective self-protection.  The technology areas specific to platform protection will develop individual, multispectral electro-optical (EO), infrared (IR), radio frequency (RF), electro-magnetic (EM), visual and acoustic or chemical sensors/biosensors and associated processing.  To defend platforms from current and advanced threats in at-sea littoral environments and in port, these technologies must improve multispectral detection and distribution of specific threat information. 

Another goal of this activity is to develop a torpedo defense capability to fill Sea Shield Warfighting Capability Gap/Enabling Capability: Platform Defense against Undersea Threats, including Four Torpedo Salvo Defense.  This provides a capability to prevent any of the torpedoes, in up to four-torpedo salvos fired at high value units, from hitting those units.  

This activity supports the Fleet and Force Protection FNC and includes support to Sea Shield and Sea Strike Pillars and FNC Enabling Capabilities for: Aircraft Integrated Self-protection Suite; Fortified Position Security; Advanced Electronic Sensor Systems for Missile Defense; and Shipboard Force Protection in Port and Restricted Waters - Detection and Classification.  

This activity supports the development of technologies that aid the helicopter pilot when operating in degraded visual cue environments (brown-out).  

FY 2013 funding decrease is due to completion of the STK-FY09-07 FNC for Helicopter Low-Level Operations (HELO).  The decrease of funding from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is the result of the transfer of resources from this R2 activity to new FNC R2 activities titled Sea Strike and Sea Shield.  Efforts in these R2 activities have been continued from FY 2012 to FY 2013 into new R2 activities to support all FNC program EC Investments.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) in the Navy Strategic Plan (NSP) has specified that the Navy must combat Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) at sea and ashore. To support this requirement, the Navy must be able to temporarily stop ships that are suspected of carrying WMDs or their component materials. This activity addresses the development of key technologies that will enable the Navy to use non-lethal methods for temporarily stopping and delaying non-cooperative large, greater than 20 meters or 300 gross tons, vessels at sea that will not comply with voice commands or warning devices. The technologies will be deployable by ship or aircraft and should be capable of disabling the vessel at safe distances from high-valued assets and infrastructures.

                                    <r2:Description>Efforts include: signature reduction, hull life assurance, hydromechanics, distributed control for automated survivability (includes damage control), and advanced naval power systems. Signature reduction addresses electromagnetic, infrared, and acoustic signature tailoring, both topside and underwater. Hull life assurance addresses development of new structural system approaches for surface ships and submarines, including the management of weapons effects to control structural damage and the improvement of structural materials. Hydromechanics addresses hydrodynamic technologies, including the signature aspects of the hull-propulsor interface and maneuvering. Distributed intelligence for automated survivability addresses both the basic technology of automating machinery control systems, as well as, distributed control of systems utilizing autonomy for mission context based reconfiguration. Advanced naval power systems efforts address electrical and auxiliary system and component technology to provide improvement in energy and power density, operating efficiency and recoverability from casualties. Advanced Naval Power efforts include: developing technologies to improve warfighting capability with more energy efficient systems; reducing the time &amp; cost to certify alternative fuels, and mitigate adverse alternative fuel impacts on Naval platforms and equipment; developing sustainable biomass models to support alternative fuel availability to Naval forces; utilizing the Electric Ship Research and Development Consortium (ESRDC) efforts to develop modeling and simulation tools to provide critical design &amp; operational capabilities for the all-electric ship program, accelerate development and demonstration of technologies, reduce risk of new technology insertion and address the national shortage of electrical power engineers. Efforts for ONR Science Advisors are also funded in this R-2 Activity. Long Endurance UUV technologies will deliver to the Office of Naval Research modular fuel cell systems for UUVs, including practical systems demonstrations, and a path forward for future developments. It will also keep the US Navy at the forefront of advanced electric propulsion technologies.  

The decrease of funding from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is the result of the transfer of resources from these R2 activities to new FNC R2 activities titled Enterprise and Platform Enablers and Power and Energy. Efforts in these R2 activities have been continued from FY 2012 to FY 2013 in the new R2 activities to support all FNC program EC Investments. The $5M decrease from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is to due to the Electric Ship Technologies and the Damage Control Technologies Leap Ahead efforts completing in FY 2013.  Additionally, funding for Science Advisors has been realigned from this R-2 Activity to a new stand-alone R-2 Activity in PE 0602236N starting in FY 2014.  </r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) is the in-house Independent Applied Research (IAR) efforts focused on solving a wide range of Naval Science and Technology (S&amp;T) fleet issues utilizing the unique warfare center (WC) laboratory capabilities.  Efforts under this activity address the full spectrum of the DON S&amp;T Strategic Plan technology focus areas that engage Naval aviation, sea surface, undersea, space, weapons, communication, information, and human systems. The IAR Program provides participating Naval Warfare Centers and Laboratories with in-house funding for: applied research to support the execution of their assigned missions; developing and maintaining a cadre of active researchers who can distill and extend results from worldwide research and apply them to solve Naval problems; promoting the hiring and development of talented new scientists and engineers (S&amp;E) with the insurance of proper mentoring with senior personnel; and encouraging collaboration with universities, private industry, and other Navy and Department of Defense laboratories.  Efforts are selected by Naval Warfare Centers Commanding Officers and Technical Directors each fiscal year through rigorous internal competition.  Efforts typically last two to three years, are generally designed to promote the investment in high-risk high-payoff research, and allow young S&amp;Es to manage a Navy relevant research project.  A limited number of successful efforts developed under the basic research Program Element 0601152N are matured and further developed under the IAR program with the goal of transitioning these technologies to the warfighter.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (Sep 2011).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare.

This PE is organized into nine activities which are represented as seven Expeditionary Warfighting Capability Areas, as well as Future Concepts, Technology Assessment and Roadmapping, and the Littoral Combat/Power Projection (LC/PP) FNC.  The primary objective of this PE is to develop and demonstrate the technologies needed to meet the Marine Corps unique responsibility of training and equipping the Marine Air/Ground Task Force (MAGTF) for Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare.  In the post-September 11 world, irregular warfare (IW) has emerged as the dominant form of warfare confronting the United States, its allies and its partners; accordingly, this PE has been structured to account for distributed, long-duration operations, including unconventional warfare, counterterrorism, counterinsurgency, and stabilization and reconstruction operations.  IW emphasizes the use of indirect, non-conventional methods and means to subvert, attrite, and exhaust an adversary, or render irrelevant, rather than defeat him through direct conventional military confrontation.   IW is now institutionalized in Marine Corps planning, investment, and capability development.  This PE provides the knowledge base to support Advanced Technology Development (6.3) and is the technology base for future expeditionary warfare capabilities.  This PE supports the Expeditionary Force Development System of the Marine Corps Combat Development Command (MCCDC) and responds directly to the Marine Corps Science and Technology (S&amp;T) process as well as supporting related Littoral and Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare capabilities developed by the Navy's Mission Capability Program.  The Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) process is supported and funds are programmed accordingly.  The FNC program explores and demonstrates technologies that enable Sea Strike, Sea Shield, Sea Basing, FORCEnet and Force Health Protection pillars, Space, Naval Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare and the Enterprise and Platform Enablers.  The FNC program comprises Enabling Capabilities (ECs) which develop and deliver quantifiable products (i.e., prototype systems, knowledge products, and technology improvements) in response to validated requirements for insertion into acquisition programs of record after meeting agreed upon exit criteria within five years. The core 6.2 program also supports Discovery and Invention (D&amp;I) and Innovation and Transformation (I&amp;T).  Within the Naval Transformation Roadmap, this investment will achieve key transformational capabilities required by the Sea Power 21 Pillars, as well as enable Ship to Objective Maneuver (STOM), Persistent Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO).  The Marine Corps Service Campaign Plan (MCSCP) is the lens through which USMC S&amp;T priorities are acted upon to guide the future development of the Total Force.
Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>This activity addresses the applied research associated with the Marine Corps participation in the Department of the Navy's (DoN) Science and Technology Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) Program.  The FNC Program represents the requirements-driven, delivery-oriented portion of the DoN Science and Technology (S&amp;T) portfolio.  FNC investments respond to Naval S&amp;T Gaps that are generated by the Navy and Marine Corps after receiving input from Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders.  The funding is aligned with the Naval challenges associated with projecting power despite anti-access and area denial, specifically the Sea Shield, Power and Energy, FORCEnet, and the Naval Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare warfighting capability gaps. The funding profile reflects the alignment of the FNC program investments into Enabling Capabilities (ECs); ECs respond to priority Naval warfighting capability gaps.  Funding for each EC is aligned to a 6.2 or 6.3 Budget Activity (BA) as appropriate.  Concurrent funding for Naval Expeditionary Warfare capability ECs is also provided from Navy PE0602750N and PE0603673N. Both of the Navy PE's were included in the FY 2013 President's Budget Request and are now the only program elements funding Navy FNC work.  In previous submissions 7 Navy 6.2 PEs and 8 Navy 6.3 PEs funded FNC efforts.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Maneuver thrust area focuses on the development, demonstration, and transition of technologies that will increase the warfighting capabilities and effectiveness of the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF).  This thrust aims at capturing emerging and "leap ahead" technologies in the areas of mobility, materials, propulsion, survivability, durability, signature reduction, modularity, and unmanned systems.  Special emphasis on survivability technologies for the defeat of small arms, IEDs, mine blast, and RPGs continue to be incorporated into this thrust area.  Efforts also continue in the development of modeling and simulation tools that integrate many different physics based modeling systems with rigorous operational analysis simulations to accurately define a system's performance characteristics.  These tools will aid in defining the trade space for emerging technologies and assist in providing the program manager insight and guidance into pursuing future technologies.  Finally, this technology thrust area also seeks to develop technologies to enhance combat vehicle crewman effectiveness and situational awareness through the incorporation of advanced autonomous vehicle functions triggered directly by the cognitive state of the operator. </r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>This activity supports S&amp;T investment in Command and Control and is focused in three main areas:  (1) Implementing the FORCEnet concept; (2) Developing decision support systems that enable warfighters to take advantage of the FORCEnet and MAGTF C2, and tactically extend Net-Enabled Command and Control (NECC) for shared situational awareness; and (3) Providing effective combat identification of enemy combatants, friendly forces, and non-combatants.  FORCEnet is the operational construct and architectural framework for naval warfare in the information age that integrates warriors, networks, command and control, and weapons into a networked, distributed, combat force that is scalable across all levels of conflict from the seabed to space, and from sea to land. The Marine Corps instantiation of FORCEnet is Marine Air Ground Task Force Command and Control (MAGTF C2), with technologies to exchange data and information with, and among, distributed tactical forces. Activities in this program area provide technologies for secure, robust, self-forming, mobile communications networks and distributed computing to support information dissemination to all echelons; and sensors, software and data processing to support formation of an appropriate common picture.  Marine Corps specific efforts include power management, low detectability, size and weight constraints, and interoperability within the joint environment.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (Sep 2011). This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps). It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century. The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare. 

Activities and efforts in this program examine concepts and technologies that enable the transformation to network centric warfare. Network centric capabilities rely on information to connect assets and provide timely and accurate understanding of the environment. The mission area requirements for rapid, accurate decision-making; dynamic, efficient, mission-focused communications and networks; and pervasive and persistent sensing drive network centric S&amp;T investments. The program focus is investments in the following Enabling Capabilities (ECs): Combat Identification (ID) Information Management of Coordinated Electronic Surveillance; Automated Control of Large Sensor Networks; OCO Focused Tactical Persistent Surveillance, Globally Netted Joint/Coalition Force Maritime Component Commander, Dynamic Tactical Communications Networks; Dynamic C2 for Tactical Forces and Maritime Operations Center (MOC); High-bandwidth, Free-space Lasercomm; Actionable Intelligence Enabled by Persistent Surveillance; Pro-Active Computer Network Defense and Information Assurance; Fast Magic; Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) Space; Advanced Tactical Data Link; and Autonomous Tactical Persistent Surveillance. In the context of the Naval Transformation Roadmap construct, this investment will achieve capabilities required by FORCEnet (Persistent Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance; Time Sensitive Strike; and Sea Based Information Operations), Sea Strike (Ship-to-Objective Maneuver), and Sea Shield (Theater Air and Missile Defense).

                                    <r2:Description>The overarching objective of this activity is to develop high throughput dynamic wireless communications and network technologies critical to the mission performance and robustness of naval communications for widely dispersed, mobile air, land, surface and submerged platforms.  These platforms are often size, weight and power (SWaP) limited, and will operate under constraints of cluttered RF spectrum, harsh electro-magnetic interference (EMI) and Beyond Line Of Sight (BLOS) conditions.  The technical payoff is increased network data rates, interoperability across heterogeneous radios, dynamic bandwidth management, and greater mobile network connectivity.  The operational payoff is that warfighters from the operational command to the tactical edge have near real-time access to information, knowledge and decision-making necessary to perform their tasks, including coalition and allied forces.  Emphasis is on tactical edge communications and networks to fully realize net-centric warfare, bridging the Global Information Grid (GIG) and the 'disadvantaged user', e.g., small-deck combatants, submarines, unmanned vehicles, distributed sensors and ground units in urban and radio frequency (RF) challenged environments.  The current specific objectives are:

a) Radios and Apertures: Develop technologies for high band radio, electrically-small and actively scanned antennas, addressing critical issue of radio spectrum bandwidth efficiency, spectrum contention and clutter, agile frequency communications with dynamic spectrum access, all-digital front-end with wide dynamic range, power amplifier efficiency, multipath effects, saltwater propagation and BLOS communications. Develop algorithms and signal processing for space-time-frequency diversity communications, including measures for electronic protection, such as low-intercept, antijam waveforms and modulation.  Develop affordable antenna technologies for small size and weight, high radiation efficiency, and wideband operation with rapid beam-steering.  Develop alternatives to RF communications in airborne and terrestrial environments as well as high data rate underwater communications for undersea warfare (distributed sensor netting, unmanned underwater vehicle data exfiltration, submarine Communications at Speed and Depth) using electro-optic/infra-red (EO/IR) technologies.  Develop secure, high bandwidth communications systems and the exploitation of existing and emerging network protocols that will avail development of new, Low Earth Orbit (LEO) based data transport mechanisms.

b) Tactical Networking and Network Control/Management: Develop advanced networking techniques for robust, highly dynamic environments; interoperable networks for secure communications and protocols, bandwidth and network management techniques that manage and allocate bandwidth across tactical and theater levels in support of net-centric operations. Develop rapidly auto-configuring and self-organizing networks with efficient and survivable routing, secure authentication, mobility management and Quality-of-Service guarantee, while optimizing network resources.  Address low bandwidth, synchronization and reliability for Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)/middleware architecture in both mobile ad-hoc networks (MANET) and infrastructure-based Internet Protocol (IP) backbone networks. Develop cognitive network planning and operations engines whose criteria are based directly on mission objectives, while self-adapting and managing the spectrum allocation and radio resources in such a way that network operations, SOA community of interest, and computer network defense are integrated to form a single common tactical network picture that requires a minimum of human intervention and skill.  Develop technology for improving tactical edge networking and for improving voice communications.

                                    <r2:Title>APPLIED INFORMATION SCIENCES FOR DECISION MAKING </r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The goal of this activity is to support FORCEnet by developing enablers for decision making and mission execution, to achieve battlespace superiority.  It focuses on the development of algorithms and software technologies that identify and integrate informational content from multiple sources, leading to decision aids that support user-cognitive processes.  Because persistent sensors are generating massive amounts of data, the focus is on technologies that not only integrate information from diverse sources, but also provide indications of information significance in ways that support the user's decision needs, regardless of location and operational situation.  To achieve this, it must be possible to automate understanding of the battlespace by identifying objects, determining relationships among the objects, assessing intent, and automatically generating courses of action with associated risks and uncertainty.  Effort will also be devoted to developing technology for increasing assurance and security for C3 information systems and technology for improving information discovery and information presentation in such systems.  The Nano Electronics Technology activity is focused on developing ultra-low power, higher performance computing devices and components that are based on novel functionalities of nanometer scale materials and are enabled by improved understanding of nanomaterials, new devices and circuit design concepts, as well as new architectures uniquely suited for nanoscale systems.  

Effective in FY 2013, this activity title has been changed from Computational Framework and Methods for Rapid Accurate Decision Making to Applied Information Sciences for Decision Making in order to completely capture the work being performed.  

The current specific objectives are:
a) Data Understanding (Formerly: Automated Intelligence Tools): Develop automated, image and signal intelligence understanding tools based on rigorous mathematical and statistical methods that lead to improved change detection, improve object and activity detection and recognition capabilities, context and scene understanding, and inferring of the threat levels to support decision making and persistent and adaptive surveillance.

b) Information Integration (Formerly; Battlespace Sensor and Intelligence Integration): Develop innovative methods for combining traditional and non-traditional data from sensors and disparate sources to provide the best estimate of objects, events, and conditions in the battlespace, in terms of their identity, associated error or uncertainty, context, impact, while inferring relationships and their intentions.

c) Mission Focused Autonomy (MFA): Develop proactive situational awareness and rapid decision making applications and analytics with information PUSH as well as PULL, where joint human controlled and automated analytic processes can collaboratively work together to solve tactical and strategic problems within a multi-level, secure environment.  The MFA system contains the following elements: a) access to enterprise level structured and unstructured data repositories and automated search and discovery of evidence collected across these heterogeneous databases; b) analytics that automate the ability to infer the meaning of evidence that is discovered; c) structured process (hypothesis or argument) that provides context in order to constrain and guide the search and analytic techniques toward goals that are focused on proving the hypothesis right or wrong; d) knowledge repository that maintains pedigree and state of hypothesis satisfaction or refutation; e) Collaborative environment wherein all analytic participants can share the state of hypothesis satisfaction and collectively contribute evidence data to solve the common problem. Develop rigorous and efficient methods for building sophisticated situational models, and develop automated reasoning techniques to categorize and recognize situations under a variety of conditions leading to methods that predict situations under different settings.

d) Resource Optimization (Formerly: Automated Decision Tools): Develop automated decision tools based on mathematically rigorous techniques (e.g., mathematical optimization) that support decision-making to ensure the best use of scarce and/or expensive resources, achieving optimal allocations for large complex scenarios, including ones that contain uncertainty, in drastically reduced amounts of time.  Develop methods that support decision making in networked sensor management and allocation to ensure sensor assets are deployed in an optimal, or near optimal, manner.

e) Trusted Systems &amp; Networks (Formerly: Secure Sensor Networks): Develop tools and methods to securely handle information without exposing intelligence information about the networks or systems to adversaries. 

f) Nanoscale Electronics: To develop novel nanometer scale (feature size near or below 10nm) logic/memory devices and related circuits and architectures to deliver ultra-low power, light weight and high performance computational capability for autonomous vehicles and individual warfighters. Effective in FY 2014, Nanoscale Electronics has been transferred from Electromagnetic Systems Applied Research to Applied Information Sciences for Decision Making in order to completely capture the work being performed.  

The decrease from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is a result of the realignment of funds and associated Radar and Surveillance efforts to Multi-Source Integration and Combat Identification activity.  These efforts are more closely aligned to the objectives of this activity.    

The increase from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is a result of the expanded investment in Mission Focused Autonomy research and the transfer of requirements and associated funding for Nanoscale Electronics Research from PE 0602271N.

                                    <r2:Description>The overarching objective of this activity is the achievement of FORCEnet and Sea Power 21 goals by developing human factors principles and cognitive models for human centric design, decision support systems for collaborative decision making, and adaptive command and control structures.  The CNO's new Maritime Strategy and the Commander Fleet Forces Command complementary plan to revise organization of Maritime Operations Centers (MOC) place high priority on the aforementioned FORCEnet and Sea Power 21 goals.  Specific objectives focus on improving small team, platform, task force, and battle group operations by developing advanced human factors technologies for incorporation into operational systems.  The goals and payoffs are to enhance human performance effectiveness; improve the timeliness and quality of decision making; develop strategies to mitigate high workload and ambiguity; reduce manning; improve situational awareness and speed of command through a deeper understanding of human capabilities and limitations; and improvement of team decision making in ad-hoc, complex problem solving scenarios.  The current specific objectives are:

a) Human Computer Interaction/Visualization: Develop an understanding of the limitations of human perceptual and attentional systems in relation to maximizing user performance when interacting with complex Naval displays.  A combination of computational, cognitive modeling and psychological studies are employed to determine the capacity limitations on human performance that will undoubtedly have impact in reduced manning requirements, including information-rich weapons platforms.  Develop technology for improving human interaction with autonomous systems and for improving virtual reality systems for training purposes.

b) Collaboration and Knowledge Interoperability: Develop an understanding of the high-level cognitive processes underlying team knowledge processing, decision making and collaboration in order to improve team performance in the autonomous, agile, quick-response combat team of the future.  Develop cognitive, science-based tools, models, computational methods, and human-agent interfaces to enhance team collaboration effectiveness and team performance in complex problem solving scenarios.  Specific objectives include application of discourse analysis methods and other process metrics to assess team performance.  A conceptual model of team collaboration will be constructed and computational relationships among processes and team performance will be developed.  Findings will be validated and demonstrated in operationally oriented testbeds by addressing issues including: rapid team analysis of large volume, uncertain data; knowledge interoperability in coalition ops; measures of team situational awareness; accelerated team synchronization; improved heterogeneous team performance; team collaboration performance metrics; cultural/language/experience-free representation and transfer of meaning.

c) Organizational Design and Decision Support Systems: Develop quantitative, executable models, task graphs and optimization algorithms for the organizational design of MOC, consistent with the Navy's New Maritime Strategy. Investigate through modeling and simulation human competency requirements for staffing MOC.  Develop quantitative formalisms for monitoring and assessing the completeness, consistency and accuracy of rules of engagement (ROE).

d) Social Network Analysis: Develop computational models and algorithms for the analysis of terrorist threats and counter-measures, and strategies against terrorist threats.  Develop new computational algorithms for the discovery of missing and hidden nodes in complex graphs applicable to the problem of understanding hidden information in terror networks.  Develop new approaches to calculation of network completeness.  Develop computational approaches to the study of factionalism in social movements using Islamist movements as exemplar data collectivities.

The decrease from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is due to the transfer of requirements and associated funding to the Human Factors activities in the Warfighter Sustainment Applied Research PE 0602236N, to provide an easily navigable and consolidated overview of all Human Factors investments in a single PE.

                                    <r2:Description>This activity is devoted to midterm technology development in close concert with programs of record.
The products of these efforts are expected to transition at the end of their schedule into the associated program of record.

The Future Naval Enabling Capabilities in this activity span across the Information Infrastructure, Applications/Tools/Decision Aids, Command and Control, Apertures and Radios, Tactical Networks and Network Control/Management, and Computer Network Defense and Information Assurance technology areas. Technologies being developed will integrate sensors, networks, decision aids, weapons and supporting systems into a highly adaptive, human-centric, comprehensive maritime system. This system will operate from the sea bed to space in a Service Oriented Architecture that can be used in a Joint Environment. The current specific objectives are:

a) OCO Focused Tactical Persistent Surveillance - Develop agile and enhanced tactical sensors for a netted, organically controlled, adaptive sensor field that is capable of detecting and classifying features relevant to other contingency operations, to include organic sensors for small, tactical expeditionary units, capable of supporting the dynamic character of modern operations from the highly mobile to the long-term.

b) Globally Netted Joint/Coalition Force Maritime Component Commander - Develop automated tools and software to capture and share information for 'globally-networked, theater-focused' maritime capabilities that will enhance Joint Task Force (JTF) and COCOM ability to execute their intentions.

c) Dynamic Tactical Communications Networks - Develop dynamically adaptive automated software algorithms, protocols, and network management techniques that provide a self-organizing networking capability. This capability will adapt to available links of opportunity at lower echelons and assure priority movement of critical data intra-network and through reachback gateway networks that interface with the Global Information Grid (GIG).

d) Dynamic C2 for Tactical Forces and Maritime Operations Center (MOC) - Develop software for command, control and combat systems that will provide the maritime commander agile and responsive control and management of tactical Antisubmarine Warfare (ASW), and interactions in a net centric enterprise environment. Focus will address classified ASW requirements for command and control at the tactical level.

e) High-bandwidth Free-space Lasercomm - Develop, integrate and demonstrate free-space optical terminals and retro-reflector optics that are designed to provide an affordable, reliable and high bandwidth Free-Space Laser Communications (Lasercomm) capability, which is adaptive and agile in mitigating a wide range of atmospheric and maritime turbulence, precipitation and obscuration conditions.  This capability will enable surface and airborne platforms to exchange very high bandwidth information in Navy Tactical Networks, even with limited SATCOM or RF spectrum access.

f) Actionable Intelligence Enabled by Persistent Surveillance - Develop analysis tools and software that will provide accurate threat detection by exposing the enemy's vulnerabilities, unmasking their latent networks, discovering their tactics, techniques, procedures, and exploiting in new ways the vast amount of sensor data available today against an irregular threat.  Also develop the following: An electro-optical, infrared and laser Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Targeting (ISRT) optics technology, capable of wide Field of View/Field of Range (FOV/FOR) at variable resolution &amp; pointing direction, for installation in mobile platforms without gimbals; a light weight, low cost sensor suite and autonomy algorithms to enable detection and avoidance of all classes of aircraft or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV).

g) Pro-Active Computer Network Defense and Information Assurance - Develop algorithms, protocols, and software that will allow the warfighter to: 1)identify and counter real-time threats to the network during mission execution; 2) provide dynamic security management and component management of networked-based assets to support mission execution; and 3) ensure that mission essential capabilities and data exist despite malicious cyber actions.

h) Fast Magic - Develop algorithms and computer and information technologies for Naval forces to respond quickly against multiple threats. Details are classified.

i) NRL Space - Develop vessel tracking fusion algorithms and software to integrate multiple modalities of informational elements, including literal and non-literal information.  Develop algorithms and techniques for handling incorrect, out of sequence and intermittent sensor data to provide persistent situational awareness.

j) Advanced Tactical Data Link - Develop the Low Probability of Detection/Anti-Jam waveforms and aperture management functions needed to support Advanced Tactical Data Link operations in permissive, contested, and anti-access environments, as well as the real-time network operations capabilities needed to dynamically add/remove participants, allocate Advanced Tactical Data Link resources to each participant, and add/remove network partitions in support of dynamic mission execution.

k) Autonomous Tactical Persistent Surveillance - Develop the architecture, algorithms, software and knowledge product tools to allow autonomous control of persistent, tactical networks of sensors; enable ISR assets to provide an "Information Bubble" to the mobile user; provide revolutionary sensor and data support to agile tactical missions by anticipating information needs; and provide sensor planning and management relevant to a higher order knowledge model.  This will provide the capability to autonomously maintain persistent surveillance of activities and entities over a region of interest, 24/7, while providing underlying context for real time adaptive surveillance in support of tactical mission objectives.

The decrease of funding from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is the result of the transfer of resources from this R2 Activity to a new FNC PE 0602750N to enhance the visibility of the FNC Program by providing an easily navigable and consolidated overview of all 6.2 FNC investments in a single PE.

						Robotics Platform Research:  
This addresses development of autonomous robotic systems capability to interact with and service other platforms and autonomous vehicles. 

Micro-Robotic Servicing - advanced highly dexterous control of extremely lightweight and flexible robotic arms, with specific application to EOD, surveillance and on-orbit servicing robotic communities. This research would extend ongoing research in lightweight robotic arms.

Autonomous Refueling - development of hardware, algorithms, and sensors for hybrid rigid-compliant robotic arms in rapidly changing environments, with specific application to autonomous refueling of USVs, UAVs and UGVs while moving in their environments, advancing beyond the DARPA-sponsored "Rapid Autonomous Fuel Transfer Project".

Low Power Micro-robotics - development of onboard sensors, control electronics, and actuators requiring very low power, with specific application to robotic missions over long durations.

Advanced Manipulators and Tool-Changers - development of innovative robotic manipulators, tool changers, and associated sensors for challenging robotic manipulation tasks, with specific application to EOD and other robotic missions in difficult environments. This research would extend previous research by providing robust end effector technology and tool changing capability. The overall research outcomes will enhance DoD capability in the areas of explosive ordnance disposal, autonomous vehicle refueling, and innovative robotic arm control. Research deliverables will include hardware development in the areas of lightweight robotic arms, end effector tools and tool changers, and low power electronics and actuators.

Autonomous Vehicles:
- This effort will draw from current research and push the technology development to the next level to provide a leap-ahead capability in long endurance, deployable, autonomous, robotic air vehicle using fuel cell electric propulsion systems for high efficiency, even in small vehicles, which can provide robust airborne sensor capabilities for submarines, UUVs, small naval platforms and small dismounted units.

Undersea Vehicles:
- Funding would be used to acquire a medium sized (12.5 inch diameter) Autonomous Underwater Vehicle as an at sea test platform to advance the state of art of onboard intelligent autonomy. This medium sized UUV is readily amenable to vehicle and sensor testing in the wave pool in the Laboratory for Autonomous Systems Research facility. Subsequently, this would allow at sea testing of State of the art autonomy algorithms (e.g. goal driven autonomy, human cognitive models, Markov decision processes) that allow Navy underwater vehicles to carry out complex mission in denied areas by understanding the environment and adapting mission goals in the context of the commander's intent, with little or no human operator intervention.

Autonomous Systems Integration:
- To support the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering) (ASD(R&amp;E)) priorities in autonomous systems, and specifically to advance the state of the art in heterogeneous teams of autonomous platforms, (including sensor networks and mobile communication nodes) that can work seamlessly with the warfighter, funding will be applied to small air platforms and militarily relevant unmanned ground vehicles to integrate sensors and advanced power sources, and to develop the autonomy software that allows the individual platforms to work together, as well as to work at a peer-to-peer level with the warfighter. This includes advanced human-robot interaction techniques and information processing and presentation techniques that reduce the warfighter's cognitive load and allows him to work with a team of autonomous systems.

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>FY 2013 funding associated with Future Naval Capability (FNC) efforts are transferring to a new Program Element titled Future Naval Capabilities Applied Research (PE 0602750N).  This is to enhance the visibility of the FNC Program by providing an easily navigable overview of all 6.2 FNC investments in a single location.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (Sep 2011).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare.

This PE supports innovation-based efforts that will provide technology options for future Navy and Marine Corps capabilities.  Efforts focus on advanced Naval materials; biocentric technologies; environmental quality; human factors and organizational design; medical technologies; and Naval training technologies. Within the Naval Transformation Roadmap, this investment maps to future transformational capabilities and the FORCEnet pillar of the Chief of Naval Operations and the Commandant of the Marine Corps vision for the future -- Naval Power 21. 

The ONRG International Science Program mission is to search the globe for emerging scientific research and advanced technologies to enable the Office of Naval Research (ONR) and the NRE to address effectively the current needs of the Fleet/Forces, and investigate and assess revolutionary, high-payoff technologies for future Naval missions and capabilities. Within this Global mission, funding for the Naval Science Advisor Program ensures the Fleet/Force (F/F) helps shape the Department of the Navy (DoN) investment in Science and Technology (S&amp;T), develops teaming
relationships to rapidly demonstrate and transition technology, supports development of technology-based capability options for naval forces, and enables warfighting innovations based on technical and conceptual possibilities. Science Advisors provide insight into issues associated with Naval Warfighting Capabilities that influence S&amp;T program decision making. The program develops leaders among civilian scientists and engineers in the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE). Upon completion of their tours, Science Advisors return to the NRE with first hand knowledge of the F/F, warfighting issues, and strategic decision making. The Office of Naval Research (ONR) Science Advisor program enables continuous communication and collaboration between the warfighters, the technical community, and strategic development commands. 

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>The overarching objective of this activity is the achievement of FORCEnet and Sea Power 21 goals by developing human factors principles and cognitive models for human centric design, decision support systems for collaborative decision making, and adaptive command and control structures. The CNO's new Maritime Strategy and the Commander Fleet Forces Command complementary plan to revise organization of Maritime Operations Centers (MOC) place high priority on the aforementioned FORCEnet and Sea Power 21 goals. Specific objectives focus on improving small team, platform, task force, and battle group operations by developing advanced human factors technologies for incorporation into operational systems. The goals and payoffs are to enhance human performance effectiveness; improve the timeliness and quality of decision making; develop strategies to mitigate high workload and ambiguity; reduce manning; improve situational awareness and speed of command through a deeper understanding of human capabilities and limitations; and improvement of team decision making in ad-hoc, complex problem solving scenarios. The current specific objectives are:

a) Human Computer Interaction/Visualization: Develop an understanding of the limitations of human perceptual and attentional systems in relation to maximizing user performance when interacting with complex Naval displays. A combination of computational cognitive modeling and psychological studies are employed to determine the capacity limitations on human performance that will undoubtedly have impact in reduced manning requirements, including information-rich weapons platforms. Develop technology for improving human interaction with autonomous systems and for improving virtual reality systems for training purposes.

b) Command Decision Making (CDM): This is a new sub-project that consolidates the previous Collaboration and Knowledge Interoperability (CKI) and Organizational Design and Decision Support Systems sub-projects. The CDM sub-project is focused at the development of dynamic decision support systems that recognize and are responsive to changing mission and task demands, and adapt to present information appropriately.  This focus is explicitly intended to deliver decision support that will be more timely and responsive to rapidly evolving operational needs.  Current thrusts within the sub-project are to: 1) Conduct research on the application of theory to exploit relevant information for effective decision making; 2) Develop models that are operationally context and task sensitive; 3) Study and apply research for the effective management of highly complex &amp; time critical decision making; 4) Develop and demonstrate decision support tools that address the timely management of risk and uncertainty.


c) Social Network Analysis: Develop computational models and algorithms for the analysis of terrorist threats and counter-measures and strategies against terrorist threats. Develop new computational algorithms for the discovery of missing and hidden nodes in complex graphs applicable to the problem of understanding hidden information in terror networks. Develop new approaches to calculation of network completeness. Develop computational approaches to the study of factionalism in social movements using Islamist movements as exemplar data collectivities. The following are non-inclusive examples of accomplishments and plans for projects funded in this activity.

This FY 2014 activity funding moves from Program Element 0602235N: Common Picture Applied Research efforts associated with the Human Factors activity and is being transferring into this PE0602236N: Warfighter Sustainment Applied Research to provide an easily navigable overview of all Human Factors investments in a single location.

                                    <r2:Description>This program supports the development of field medical equipment, diagnostic capabilities and treatments; technologies to improve warfighter safety and to enhance personnel performance under adverse conditions; and systems to prevent occupational injury and disease in hazardous, deployment environments; including regenerative medicine technologies and therapeutic/restorative practices for the treatment of combat-related traumatic injuries. Navy investment in these areas is essential because Navy/USMC mission needs are not adequately addressed by the civilian sector or other Federal agencies. For example, civilian emergency medicine does not address casualty stabilization during long transit times to definitive care. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) focuses on the basic science of disease processes and not applied research related to development. Programs are coordinated with other Services through the Armed Services Biomedical Research Evaluation and Management (ASBREM) Committee, and Joint Technical Coordinating Group (JTCG) process, to prevent duplication of effort.

					International Science Program

The ONR International Science Program mission is to search the globe for emerging scientific research and advanced technologies, to enable the Office of Naval Research (ONR) and the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) to effectively address current needs of the Fleet/Forces, and investigate and assess revolutionary, high-payoff technologies for future naval missions and capabilities.  This is accomplished through PHD-level Associate Director scientists located in Asia, Europe and South America collaborating with international organizations and researchers through grants in innovative applied research, and establishing quality, relevant connections between international science and technology (S&amp;T) centers of excellence and DON, DOD, and other US Government organizations. The direct impact of this investment is to capitalize on international applied research during unprecedented and dynamic global interdependence, increasing the ability to solve DON S&amp;T challenges through shared knowledge and technologies with partners. Additionally, this investment builds global S&amp;T awareness to reduce the risk of potential technological surprise, and supports theater security cooperation goals to sustain cooperative relationships with an expanding set of international partners and to enhance global security.

Fleet/Forces Science Advisors 

The Naval Science Advisor (SA) Program ensures the Naval Fleet/Forces shape the DON investment in applied research S&amp;T, developing teaming relationships in support and development of technology-based capability options for Naval Fleet/Forces. Funding is also dedicated to applied research efforts in support of the various Naval Fleet/Forces operational commands.

The Science Advisors (SA) are a conduit between the Naval Fleet/Forces, ONR, Naval Research Lab (NRL) and the entire Naval Research Enterprise (NRE). Specific Fleet/Forces Science Advisors include the following:  

SA, Navy Warfare Development Command (NWDC), provides technical support for the generation and development of advanced warfighting concepts leading to innovative new strategies to address Navy challenges and opportunities. 

SA, CNO Strategic Studies Group (SSG) fully partners in the generation of revolutionary warfighting concepts for the Navy of the future. Along with the Technology Fellows, the SA develops the SSG Fall Program which includes researching and inviting lecturers to address the SSG and developing engaging and mind-opening exploration travel for the CNO Fellows and mini exploration travel for all SSG members.

SA, Chief of Naval Operations Code N81 (OPNAV N81) focuses on disseminating the Navy's warfighting capability/risk analysis products to the broader S&amp;T community resulting in an improved influence of requirements pull on S&amp;T. The N81 

SA is part of the ONR internal strategy cell membership for updating the Navy S&amp;T Strategic Plan. 

SA, Naval Mine and Anti-Submarine Warfare Command (NMAWC) works with the Commander NMAWC who is the lead for the FNC ASW sub-Integrated Program Team (IPT). The SA is directly responsible to the Commander for drafting/modifying capability gaps and enabling capabilities (EC) ideas, vetting them through the sub-IPT members, incorporating modifications, and providing the final recommendation to the Commander for presentation to the Sea Shield IPT. The SA advises Commander on Navy's Tactical ASW and MIW support and countermeasures.

This is to enhance the visibility of the FNC Program by providing an easily navigable and consolidated overview of all 6.2 FNC investments in a single PE.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan, approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (Sep 2011).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare.

The Electromagnetic Systems Applied Research Program addresses technology needs associated with Naval platforms for new capabilities in EO/IR Sensors, Surveillance, Electronic Warfare, Navigation, Solid State Electronics, Vacuum Electronics Power Amplifiers, and Nanoelectronics. The program supports development of technologies to enable capabilities in Missile Defense, Directed Energy, Platform Protection, Time Critical Strike, and Information Distribution. This program directly supports the Department of Defense Joint Warfighter Plan and the Defense Technology Area Plans. Activities and efforts within this Program have attributes that focus on enhancing the affordability of warfighting systems. The program also provides for technology efforts to maintain proactive connectivity and collaboration between Department of the Navy (DON) Science and Technology (S&amp;T) and Joint, Navy, and Marine Corps commands worldwide.  

Also included in this PE is the Netted Emulation of Multi-Element Signatures against Integrated Sensors (NEMESIS) Innovative Naval Prototype (INP).  NEMESIS technology addresses the need to generate the appearance of a realistic naval force to multiple adversarial surveillance and targeting sensors simultaneously. 

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>This R2 activity is devoted to mid-term technology development in close concert with programs of record.  The products of these efforts are expected to transition at the end of their schedule into the associated program of record.  These Future Naval Capability (FNC) Enabling Capabilities (EC's) span across the Electronics, EW, Radar, Communications, and other technology areas supporting Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR).  This R2 activity also appears in PE 0603271N.  For Enabling Capabilities (EC) receiving funding from both PE's the PE 0602271N portion is generally focused on component design and development while the funding from PE 0603271N is focused on integration and demonstration.  

The specific objectives of the current EC's are:

e) Affordable Electronically Scanned Array Technology for Next Generation Naval Platforms: Develop and demonstrate electronics components technologies using wide bandgap semiconductors, mixed signal analog and digital, RF, microwave, millimeter wave and associated passive components thus enabling high efficiency transmitter element chains for arrays.

f) Affordable Common Radar Architecture (ACRA): Develop a common, affordable, scalable, open radar architecture that provides affordable capability improvements and addresses total ownership cost challenges for 5 different radars.

g) SATCOM Vulnerability Mitigation: Develop technologies for mitigating SATCOM vulnerabilities using a wideband, airborne and air-to-surface infrastructure.  Technologies include approaches for development of ultra-low cost phased arrays and techniques for mitigating multi-path and scintillation issues on communications links.  Architecture and application development will include surface-to-air communications in the 14-17 gigahertz (GHz) band, and air-to-air communications in the millimeter wave bands.  Additionally, advanced techniques for the use of the ultra high frequency (UHF) spectrum will be developed, which include beam forming techniques and alternative waveform designs that are used to support high bandwidth infrastructure establishment and control.

h) Radar Electronic Attack Protection (REAP): Develop single platform, precision, passive electronic support measure (ESM) and electronic protection (EP) techniques and technology to counter hostile use of modern electronic attack (EA) self protection jammers.

l) Submarine Survivability-Electronic Warfare: Develop and demonstrate technologies that will provide submarines an EA capability against surveillance radar systems through EW payloads integrated with submarine masts, as well as networked offboard platforms.  These capabilities will improve the submarine's survivability in a hostile RF environment by providing a non-kinetic strike capability against enemy Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) sensors

Decrease in funding from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is due to transfer of FNC efforts addressed in this PE to a new PE titled Future Naval Capabilities Applied Research (PE 0602750N).  This is to enhance the visibility of the FNC Program by providing an easily navigable and consolidated overview of all 6.2 FNC investments in a single PE.

                                    <r2:Description>The overarching objective of this activity is to develop higher performance components and subsystems for all classes of military RF systems that are based on solid state physics phenomena and are enabled by improved understanding of these phenomena, new circuit design concepts and devices, and improvements in the properties of electronic materials.  An important subclass are the very high frequency (VHF), ultra-high frequency (UHF), microwave (MW), and millimeter wave (MMW) power amplifiers for Navy all-weather radar, surveillance, reconnaissance, electronic attack, communications, and smart weapon systems.  Another subclass are the analog and high speed, mixed signal components that connect the electromagnetic signal environment into and out of digitally realized, specific function systems.  These improved components are based on both silicon (Si) and compound semiconductors (especially the wide bandgap materials and narrow bandgap materials), low and high temperature superconductors, novel nanometer scale structures and materials.  Components addressed by this activity emphasize the MMW and submillimeter wave (SMMW) regions with an increasing emphasis on devices capable of operating in the range from 50 gigahertz (GHz) to 10 terahertz (THz).  The functionality of the technology developed cannot be obtained through Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) as a result of the simultaneous requirements placed on power, frequency, linearity, operational and instantaneous bandwidth, weight, and size.  Effort will involve understanding the properties of engineered semiconductors as they apply to quantum information science and technology. 

This activity also includes Anti-Tamper development of innovative techniques and technologies to deter the reverse engineering and exploitation of our military's critical technology and critical program information in order to impede technology transfer and alteration of system capability and prevent the development of countermeasures to U.S. systems. The current specific objectives are:

a) Solid State Transistors and Devices: Develop solid state transistors and devices for high frequency analog and digital operation.

b) High Efficiency, Highly Linear Amplifiers: Develop high efficiency, highly linear amplifiers for microwave, millimeter-wave, low-noise, and power applications.

c) Superconducting Electronics: Develop components for RF systems utilizing superconducting and other technologies which are designed to deliver software defined, wide band, many simultaneous signal functionality over a wide range of frequencies, in increasingly field-ready packaging and demonstrate the ability of these components to be combined into chains to deliver superior functionality in conventional system contexts, including, but not limited to, SATCOM, Electronic Warfare (EW), signal intelligence (SIGINT), and communications.

d) Control, Reception, Transmission, and Processing of Signals: Develop electronics and photonics technology that provides for the control, reception, transmission and processing of signals.

e) Novel Nanometer Scale Logic/Memory Devices and Related Circuits and Architectures: Develop novel nanometer scale (feature size at or below 10nm) logic/memory devices and related circuits and architectures to deliver ultra-low power, light weight and high performance computational capability for autonomous vehicles and individual warfighters.

f) Anti-Tamper: Develope innovative techniques and technologies to deter the reverse engineering and exploitation of our military's critical technology and critical program information in order to impede technology transfer and alteration of system capability and prevent the development of countermeasures to U.S. systems. 

The increase of funding from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is due to the progression of Anti-Tamper Technology research from Basic to Applied Research.

The current specific objectives are:

b) Lithographic Fabrication Techniques: Develop lithographic fabrication techniques for upper-millimeter wave amplifiers.

                                    <r2:Description>The objective is to develop a System of Systems (SoS) able to artificially create the appearance of a realistic naval force to many adversary surveillance and targeting sensors simultaneously. It will benefit the warfighter by providing battlespace confusion to adversary surveillance and targeting systems, both above and below water, creating seamless cross-domain countermeasure coordination, and enabling rapid advanced technology/capability insertion to counter emerging threats. 

a) Develop reconfigurable and modular EW payloads, Distributed Decoy and Jammer Swarms (DDJS), effective acoustic countermeasures (CM), and  Multiple Input/Multiple Output Sensor/CM (MIMO S/CM) for false force generation to both above and below water sensors.

Increase in FY 2014 is due to the transfer of funding from PE 0602114N and increased investment supporting NEMESIS development of EW payloads and platform integration.  NEMESIS related EW payloads research was initiated in PE 0602114N in FY 2013.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (Sep 2011).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare.

This PE provides the unique, fundamental programmatic instrument by which basic research on the natural environment is transformed into technological developments that provide new or enhanced warfare capabilities for the Battlespace Environment (BSE).  The objectives of this program are met through measuring, analyzing, modeling and simulating, and applying environmental factors affecting naval material and operations in the BSE.  This program provides for BSE technological developments that contribute to meeting top joint warfare capabilities established by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, with primary emphasis on Joint Littoral Warfare and Joint Strike Warfare. 

This PE fully supports the Director of Defense Research and Engineering's Science and Technology Strategy and is coordinated with other DoD Components through the Defense Science and Technology Reliance process.  Work in this program is related to and fully coordinated with efforts in accordance with the on-going Reliance joint planning process.  There is close coordination with the US Air Force and US Army under the Reliance program in the BSE categories of Lower Atmosphere, Ocean Environments, Space &amp; Upper Atmosphere, and Terrestrial Environments.  Within the Naval Transformation Roadmap, the investment will contribute toward achieving each of the "key transformational capabilities" required by Sea Strike, Sea Shield, and Sea Basing.  Moreover, environmental information, environmental models, and environmental tactical decision aids that emerge from this investment will form one of the essential components of FORCEnet (which is the architecture for a highly adaptive, human-centric, comprehensive maritime system that operates from seabed to space).  The Navy program includes efforts that focus on, or have attributes that enhance, the affordability of warfighting systems.

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides technologies that form the natural environment technical base on which all systems development and advanced technology depend.
Furthermore, this technical base provides developments that may be utilized in the Future Naval Capabilities programs: Organic Mine Countermeasures (MCM) and
Autonomous Operations. This project contains the National Oceanographic Partnership Program (NOPP) (Title II, subtitle E, of Public Law 104-201) and efforts aimed
at understanding and predicting the impacts of underwater sound on marine mammals.

Major efforts of this project are devoted to: gaining real-time knowledge of the BSE, determining the natural environment needs of regional warfare, providing the on-scene commander with the capability to exploit the environment to tactical advantage and, developing atmospheric research related to detection of sea-skimming missiles and strike warfare. This project provides natural environment applied research for all fleet operations and for current or emerging systems. Major developments are routinely transitioned to the Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center and to the Naval Oceanographic Office where they are used to provide timely information about the natural environment for all fleet operations.

Joint Littoral Warfare efforts address issues in undersea, surface, and air battlespace. Efforts include ocean and atmospheric analysis and prediction for real-time description of the operational environment, shallow water acoustics, multiple-influence sensors for undersea surveillance and weapon systems, and influences of the natural environment on MCM and Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) systems. Joint Strike Warfare efforts address issues in air battlespace dominance. Efforts include influences of the natural environment on air operations, electromagnetic (EM)/electro-optic (EO) systems used in intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, targeting, bomb damage assessment, and detection of missile weapon systems. They also include improvements in tactical information management about the BSE.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>The marine atmosphere affects most aspects of naval operations. This activity develops observing technologies, models, Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) systems and Tactical Decision Aids (TDA) that describe the atmospheric environment and its impacts on naval sensors and operations. This activity focuses on uniquely marine aspects of atmospheric science such as air-sea interaction, coupled ocean-atmosphere modeling, EM and EO propagation, coastal meteorology, Tropical Cyclone (TC) prediction, and the use of remote sensing to obtain quantitative observations of atmospheric properties. Aspects of the atmospheric environment of particular interest include near-surface phenomena that affect refractivity, marine boundary layer dynamics that affect clouds, rain, visibility and fog, and processes that control TC structure, track, and intensity. Objectives of this activity are improved NWP systems and TDAs that provide NOWCAST and forecast skill at global, regional, and tactical scales for operational support, sensor and system development, and performance prediction.

Funding increase from FY 2013 to FY 2014 reflects increased emphasis across Marine Meteorology efforts including ramp up of some efforts initiated in FY 2012.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>This activity is dedicated to the determination of the impact of the natural ocean environment on acoustic wave phenomena in support of naval undersea warfare and underwater force protection operations. This activity studies underwater acoustic propagation, scattering from ocean boundaries, and ambient noise issues that impact the development and employment of acoustic systems. The Littoral Zone (LZ) has been the ocean environment of greatest interest. Aspects of this environment, that greatly impact underwater acoustic systems, are the shallow water included in the Littoral Zone, the consequent closeness and physical significance of the ocean bottom, and the complexities inherent to rapid changes of the ocean structure. The objectives of this program are met through measuring, analyzing, modeling and simulating, and exploiting ocean acoustic factors to gain advantage over potential adversaries using undersea acoustic systems. Results of this activity support acoustic sensor and system development, performance prediction, and tactical decision aids.

Funding increase from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is due to increased emphasis across the spectrum of existing efforts within this activity.

Funding decrease from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is due to the completion of efforts associated with acoustic noise shielding and acoustic propagation models.

                                    <r2:Description>The goal of this activity is to develop naval tactical uses of knowledge of the physics of the ocean within the BSE. This is achieved through the development of predictive models of the water mass structure, waves, currents, and air-sea interactions and developing measurement/observation technology. Other applications utilize knowledge of the interaction of the water column hydrodynamics and the acoustics to predict the undersea transmission characteristics and sources of uncertainty in these statistics. Utilizing knowledge of the ocean surface physics, the physical oceanography program seeks to exploit the combination of remotely sensed data, in-situ data, and adaptively sampled data to optimize predictions of ocean currents and water column structure. These predictions, custom databases, adaptive sampling schemes and data programs serve ASW, Naval Special Warfare (NSW), Sea-Basing, and mine warfare needs.

Funding decrease from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is due to the realignment of resources for higher priority requirements as well as the completion of an effort for the ocean-atmosphere coupled system.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The DOD's Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Program (JNLWP) was established by the Secretary of Defense, who assigned centralized responsibility for DoD joint research and development of non-lethal technology to the Commandant of the Marine Corps as the Executive Agent.  The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics provides direct oversight of the JNLWP.

The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) reflect science and technology (S&amp;T) investment decisions provided by the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons (NLW) Integrated Product Team, a multi-service flag level corporate board that executes the JNLWP for the Commandant of the Marine Corps.  This direction is based on the needs and capabilities of the Services, the Special Operations Command, and the Coast Guard, as identified in the DoD's Non-Lethal Weapons Joint Capabilities Based Assessment Document.  This coordinated joint S&amp;T development approach addresses mutual capability gaps and assures the best non-lethal technologies and equipment are provided to the operating forces while eliminating duplicative service S&amp;T investment.

This program funds the applied research, study, assessment, and demonstration of technologies that could provide a non-lethal capability or target effect.  Investment areas include applied research related to: non-lethal directed energy weapons (lasers, millimeter wave and high power microwave) for counter-personnel and counter-materiel missions; non-lethal acoustic and optical technologies; advanced non-lethal materiels (including materiels for vehicle/vessel stopping and counter-facility applications); associated human effects and effectiveness for new non-lethal stimuli; injury potential and effectiveness of directed energy, electric stun, ocular, and acoustic based non-lethal technologies; and developing models of crowd behavior and dynamics.  This program transitioned from PE 0602114N, Power Projection Applied Research by order of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, USD(AT&amp;L), to a separate PE for Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Applied Research and established the Commandant of the Marine Corps as the Executive Agent for DoD Joint Non-Lethal Weapons RDT&amp;E.

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>FY 2013 funding associated with Future Naval Capability (FNC) efforts are transferring to a new Program Element titled Future Naval Capabilities Applied Research (PE 0602750N).  This is to enhance the visibility of the FNC Program by providing an easily navigable overview of all 6.2 FNC investments in a single location.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (Sep 2011).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare.

This PE funds applied research efforts in undersea target detection, classification, localization, tracking, and neutralization.  Technologies being developed within this PE are aimed at enabling Sea Shield, one of the core operational concepts detailed in the Naval Transformational Roadmap.  Associated efforts focus on new Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) operational concepts that promise to improve wide-area surveillance, detection, localization, tracking, and attack capabilities against quiet adversary submarines operating in noisy and cluttered shallow water environments.  Related efforts are aimed at leveraging technologies that will protect the country's current capital investment in surveillance, submarine, surface ship, and air ASW assets. Research focused on understanding the impacts on marine mammals of manmade underwater sound is also conducted in the Program Element.

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This PE funds applied research efforts in undersea target detection, classification, localization, tracking, and neutralization. Technologies being developed within this project are aimed at enabling Sea Shield which is one of the core operational concepts detailed in the Naval Transformational Roadmap. Associated efforts focus on new ASW operational concepts that promise to improve wide-area surveillance, detection, localization, tracking, and attack capabilities against quiet adversary submarines operating in noisy and cluttered shallow water environments. Related efforts are aimed at leveraging technologies that will protect the country's current capital investment in surveillance, submarine, surface ship, and air ASW assets.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Title>ANTI-SUBMARINE WARFARE (ASW) DISTRIBUTED SEARCH</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>ASW Distributed Search focuses on the development of technologies for the non-covert tactical search for undersea targets ranging from hours to weeks, using automated sensor systems deployed around operating areas, including along key transit routes to protect naval/maritime forces, around temporarily fixed sea base regions and naval force operating areas, or around fixed defensive regions and areas of interest, such as key US/Allied ports. "Non-covert" implies availability of airborne assets for sensor deployment (although other means may also be used), and the ability to employ active sonar along with passive and non-acoustic methods. "Search" is conducted in concentrated areas, typically exploiting cues received from surveillance systems. The submarine target must be detected beyond its weapons release range. The objective is to develop rapidly deployable systems employing automated detection and classification capabilities for use in both shallow and deep water operating environments. Distributed Search supports the ASW protected passage Maritime Shield operational constructs. Related efforts include the development of distributed systems employing optimization as well as active acoustic sensing and processing techniques, navy-unique transduction and underwater networking technology. Efforts also include the development of Unmanned Undersea Vehicle-based and affordable off-board deployable sensing systems employing persistent detection concepts and components. These efforts provide an extended reach of organic platform-based systems through the use of new sensor concepts, improved materials for advanced sensors, optimized deployment, employment, and automated operation of distributed sensor fields. The cornerstone of Distributed Search is the development of rapidly deployable, long-endurance active sensors with automated processing suitable for use in a wide variety of operational environments. 

Funding decrease from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is due to the realignment of Future Naval Capabilities (FNCs) SHD-FY10-02 ASW Command Level Training and SHD-FY10-02 Operator Training to the R-2 Activity SEA SHIELD in PE 0602750N.

                                    <r2:Description>The goal of this work is to integrate ocean and atmospheric environmental characteristics with sensor performance predictions in order to develop algorithms and Tactical Decision Aids (TDAs) that will accurately predict overall sensor performance in a given environment in near real-time for both present and future situations. The results of these research efforts in conjunction with embedded state-of-the-art command and operator-level training will facilitate the optimum employment of ASW sensor systems, thus increasing their effectiveness and potentially decreasing the number of sensors used to provide coverage in a given area. This work will provide operational commanders with sensor performance predictions which allow them to accurately judge the performance of those sensors, as well as information with which to deploy them for the greatest operational effect. It will also provide information as to how the performance evolves over time due to effects such as the deformation of sensor locations by currents, sound velocity profile changes, geologic magnetic interference changes, or changes to the optical properties of the water, etc. The effort includes performance predictions for fields of sensors as well as individual sensors themselves and applies to both acoustic and nonacoustic sensors.

Work includes development of ASW sensor and system performance models, and realistic simulations and measures of effectiveness that incorporate and exploit critical environmental knowledge. It includes efforts to couple ocean dynamics and acoustics, characterize ambient noise in the littorals, measure and model acoustic and optical propagation and scattering in complex environments, develop algorithms to extract environmental information from through-the-sensor measurements and quantification and prediction of uncertainty. This information is combined with the operating characteristics of particular sensors (or groups of sensors) to provide predictions of sensor performance in the environment at that particular time and in the future. The predictions will also include assessments of the prediction uncertainty due to environmental measurement and sensor performance uncertainties.

This work aligns principally with the Assure Access and Hold at Risk S&amp;T Focus Area in the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan and contributes measurably to the Operational Environments S&amp;T Focus Area strategic objectives.

                                    <r2:Description>Precision Localization focuses on the development and demonstration of technologies which use information from surveillance or search systems to determine an area of uncertainty (AOU) relative to target range, bearing, and depth adequate to handoff to an attack system. Precision Localization employs non-acoustic techniques such as magnetic and optical sensing to highly localize submerged threats. The objective is to increase magnetic sensor range and robustness, enable deployment on Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs), and increase optical sensing search rates. Efforts include the development of non-traditional tracking and advanced magnetic and electric field sensors and processing. These technologies will provide a decreased AOU size thus enabling the effective use of smaller, more versatile torpedoes as well as increased performance gain in detection, targeting, tracking/trailing, and homing via target acquisition and covert prosecution.

                                    <r2:Description>ASW Surveillance focuses on dramatically improving detection, classification, and localization capabilities in large ocean areas relative to the capabilities of legacy ASW surveillance systems. The related technologies support the conduct of covert, wide-area surveillance ranging from one day to six months. The objectives are to develop and demonstrate technologies that provide clandestine indications and warnings in far forward and contested operating areas, and in complex operational environments against all submarine threats, including new threats with unknown target signatures and tactics. Covertness implies use of non-observable platforms and/or deployed automated sensors employing passive sonar, or other non-detectable methods. The surveillance process includes initial detection and classification. Efforts include the development of Unmanned Undersea Vehicle-based and affordable, off-board deployable sensing systems employing a wide variety of surveillance concepts and components. These efforts focus on alternative detection phenomena, vector/tensor sensors, automated acoustic processing, more compact and longer lasting power sources, and high bandwidth, acoustic communications links.

                                    <r2:Description>The goal of this activity is to support: (1) marine mammal research related to understanding impacts of underwater sound (especially sonar) on marine mammal behavior, hearing, physiology, distributions and ecology; (2) development and testing of new technologies for the detection of marine mammals at sea; (3) research on the bio-acoustic properties, use of sound for detection of, and effects of sound on fish and lesser marine organisms; and (4) research on optically important biota in the coastal ocean in support of Naval Mine, Undersea, and Special Warfare (including oceanic bioluminescence and the development and testing of bioluminescence sensors).

The marine mammals research conducted in this Program Element (P.E.) represents part of a total effort executed in coordination with complementary research performed in PE 0602435N.

The emphasis of efforts within PE 0602747N Marine Mammals Activity focuses on the effects on the behavior of marine mammals of manmade sound transmitted underwater which includes Integrated Ecosystem Research, Controlled Exposure Experiments (free-ranging US waters), Marine Mammal Hearing, and part of the Monitoring &amp; Detection thrust (Autonomous platform development; gliders, profilers, etc.), Population-level Consequences of Acoustic Disturbance, effects of chronic stress (captive/modeling studies), and risk assessment modeling.

This Activity has been created specifically to address the work associated with determining and mitigating the effects on the behavior of marine mammals of manmade sound transmitted underwater.

                                    <r2:Description>Undersea Weaponry focuses on the development of enabling technologies to counter threat submarines and surface vessels by increasing Probability of Kill and platform survivability. Weapon technology focus areas include: Explosives and Warheads, Guidance and Control (G&amp;C), Simulation Based Design, Propulsion, Power Sources, Supercavitation, and Counter Weapons/Counter Measures. The ultimate goal of this activity is to provide revolutionary capabilities needed to fill Sea Shield and Sea Strike Warfighter Capability Gaps, to accommodate unique payload limitations through the development of modular and reduced sized undersea weapons based on common technology enablers (where possible), to provide improved platform pre-engagement positioning and fire-control solutions for effective weapon-to-target engagement, and provide countermeasures and counterweapons against current and next-generation undersea weapons. 

Funding decrease from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is due to the realignment of the FNC effort Torpedo Common Hybrid Fuzing System (SHD-FY11-01) to the SEA SHIELD R-2 Activity in PE 0602750N.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) address the Applied Research associated with the Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) Program.  The FNC Program represents the requirements-driven, delivery-oriented portion of the Navy Science and Technology (S&amp;T) portfolio.  FNC investments respond to Naval S&amp;T Gaps that are identified by the Navy and Marine Corps after receiving input from Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders. The Enabling Capabilities (ECs) and associated technology product investments of the FNC Program are competitively selected by a 3-star Technology Oversight Group (TOG), chartered by the S&amp;T Corporate Board and representing the requirements, acquisition, research and fleet/forces communities of the Navy and the Marine Corps.  

This was a new PE in FY 2013 that consolidated all Navy 6.2 FNC Program investments into a single Navy 6.2 PE.  Marine Corps FNC 6.2 investments are consolidated in a single Marine Corps 6.2 PE (0602131M). In FY 2011 and FY 2012, Navy 6.2 FNC Program investments were spread across 7 separate 6.2 PEs:  0602114N, 0602123N, 0602235N, 0602236N, 0602271N, 0602747N and 0602782N.  The consolidation in this PE allows all investments to be viewed by FNC Pillar, Enabling Capability (EC) and Technology Product.  It greatly enhances the visibility of the FNC Program by providing an easily navigable overview of all 6.2 FNC investments in a single place.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>FNC investments are typically 3-5 years in duration.  They provide a continuance of basic research by maturing technologies from a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 3 or 4 to a TRL of 6.  All FNC products require BA2 and BA3 funded technology development, which is coordinated to ensure tangible technology products are delivered upon completion of each investment.  Each year the TOG refreshes the FNC Program by approving new ECs and technology products as older ones get delivered.  After transition to an acquisition program, FNC products are further engineered, integrated and, ultimately, delivered to the warfighter. The development and delivery of each FNC product is guided by a Technology Transition Agreement (TTA) that is signed by the requirements and acquisition sponsors, as well as the S&amp;T developer.

This project supports the naval pillars of Capable Manpower, Enterprise and Platform Enablers, Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare, Force Health Protection, Forcenet, Power and Energy, Sea Basing, Sea Shield and Sea Strike.  Each of these pillars is listed as a separate R-2 Activity, as is FNC Management.  Under each R-2 Activity, the BA 6.2 accomplishments and plans for every Enabling Capability (EC) and Technology Product in the FNC Program are listed.  ECs are composed of one or more interrelated technology products, so for clarity, each product is shown under its EC.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>As discussed in Section A, there are a significant number of FNC technology products within this PE.  In all cases, these technology products support the Department of the Navy FNC Program and are managed at the Office of Naval Research.  All FNC investments in this PE are subjected to management oversight by 2-star chaired Integrated Product Teams (IPTs) that control the naval pillars of Sea Shield, Sea Strike, Sea Basing, Forcenet, Naval Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare, Enterprise and Platform Enablers, Power and Energy, Capable Manpower, and Force Health Protection.  Each EC is aligned to a pillar and each technology product is aligned to an EC.  At the lowest level, each technology product is measured against both technical and financial milestones on a monthly basis.  Annually, each technology product is reviewed in depth for technical performance and development status by the Chief of Naval Research against goals that have been approved by the Navy's 3-star Technology Oversight Group (TOG).  Also annually, each technology product is reviewed by its 2-star chaired pillar IPT for transition planning adequacy and transition commitment level.   Products must meet TOG required transition commitment levels for S&amp;T development to continue.  Transition issues and required adjustments are reported annually by the Chief of Naval Research to the TOG, which establishes investment priorities for the FNC Program.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>FY 2013 funding associated with Future Naval Capability (FNC) efforts are transferring to a new Program Element titled Future Naval Capabilities Applied Research (PE 0602750N).  This is to enhance the visibility of the FNC Program by providing an easily navigable overview of all 6.2 FNC investments in a single location.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (Sep 2011).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare.

This PE provides technologies for Naval Mine Countermeasures (MCM), Expeditionary Warfare, U.S. Naval sea mining, Naval Special Warfare (NSW), and Joint Tri-Service Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD). This program is strongly aligned with the Joint Chiefs of Staff Joint Warfighting Capability Objectives through the development of technologies to achieve military objectives with minimal casualties and collateral damage. Within the Naval Transformation Roadmap, this investment will achieve one of three "key transformational capabilities" required by "Sea Shield" as well as technically enable the Ship to Objective Maneuver (STOM) key transformational capability within "Sea Strike" by focusing on technologies that will provide the Naval Force with the capability to dominate the battlespace, project power from the sea, and support forces ashore with particular emphasis on rapid MCM operations. These efforts concentrate on the development and transition of technologies for the MCM-related and Urban Asymmetric/Expeditionary Warfare Operations (UAEO)-related Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) Enabling Capabilities (ECs). The Mine and Obstacle Detection/Neutralization efforts include technologies for clandestine and overt minefield reconnaissance, organic ship self-protection, organic minehunting and neutralization/breaching. The Urban Asymmetric Operation effort includes critical warfighting functions such as Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR), fires, maneuver, sustainment, etc. The Naval Special Warfare and Explosive Ordnance Disposal technology efforts concentrate on the development of technologies for safe near-shore mine detection, diver mobility and survivability, and ordnance disposal operations.

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Title>MINE/OBSTACLE DETECTION</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>This activity focuses on applied research to enable longer detection ranges and precise mine location with fewer false alarms in a variety of challenging environments. It supports Discovery and Invention (D&amp;I) and MCM-related FNC ECs. Efforts in Synthetic Aperture Sonar (SAS) technologies for longer range detection and classification of mine-like targets and magnetic gradiometer sensing and electro-optic (EO) technology for buried mine identification, and sensor integration onto Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are being addressed. EO sensor research develops algorithms to enable image processing for rapid overt reconnaissance from an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). Other processing, classification and data fusion techniques to reduce operator workload, and a mine burial prediction "expert system" are also being developed. Efforts also support development of MCM Mission Modules for Littoral Combat Ships (LCS).

FY 2012 to FY 2013 funding decrease is due to realignment of Future Naval Capabilities (FNCs) SHD-FY10-03 Integrated Forward looking Sonar - Dual Frequency Synthetic Aperture Sonar (FLS-DFSAS), SHD-FY10-03 Long Range LFBB Sonar (AUV Platform Option), SHD-FY10-03 VSW Acoustic Color-Imaging Sonar, SHD-FY12-04 Compact Modular Sensor-Processing Suite (CMSS), and SHD-FY12-04 Mine Drift Prediction Tactical Decision Aid (TDA) to R2 Activity SEA SHIELD in PE 0602750N.

This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare.

This program develops and demonstrates advanced technologies, including Electromagnetic (EM) Rail Gun for naval weapon systems.  This Program Element (PE) includes elements of the following Future Naval Capabilities (FNCs); Time Critical Strike, and ForceNet.  Within the Naval Transformation Roadmap, this investment will achieve one of four key transformational capabilities required by Sea Strike, as well as technically enable elements of both Sea Shield and Force Net.

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>The Navy is furthering Decision Making Tools in the following areas:

1)  Data to Decision: The Navy is performing a series of limited technology experiments (LTE) identifying issues to enable the integration of combat systems and C2 systems to enable rapid, accurate decision making.  These experiments are integrating S&amp;T capabilities directly into current combat systems and SOA C2 systems.  This is a joint series of experiments with the AF and Army including Navy PEO IWS and PEO C4I which will lead to transition directly into the Advanced Capability Builds 12 - 16 for the IWS POR and into CANES for PEO C4I POR.  In FY2012, Navy will continue work associated with the LTEs and perform integrated prototype testing in a more operational environment.

2)  Autonomy and Data to Decision: This Navy effort involves integrated reverie and land scenarios.  The objective is to develop autonomous networked sensor systems (disparate platforms and sensors) that significantly reduce (objective eliminate) human system management and analysis to enable small forces such as Navy reverie expeditionary teams to focus on the execution of missions with significant sensor support. Currently mission execution is limited by the number of people that have to be engaged in sensor management and analysis.  Autonomous Data to Decision capability is also adaptable to autonomous sensor networks in support of forward operating base protection.  More funds in the first year would enable a much richer diversity of sensors, platforms, and automated analysis techniques.

The decrease in funding from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is due to the migration of these funds to the new PE for FNCs (PE 0603673N).</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Cyber Security Architecture effort will establish a prototype environment that be used to integrate the results of numerous ongoing S&amp;T efforts to build a cyber security architecture of ever increasing capability There are a number of strategies that have been taken to help mitigate cyber attacks.  This effort is aimed at developing an integrated approach that draws on these different strategies and enables new concepts to be brought into the integrated approach.  The key is developing a highly flexible architecture. The overarching approach is to providing integrated and modularized cyber defense platform with built-in multiple levels of intelligence for controlling and acting against known and new cyber attacks. The platform encompasses all levels of hierarchy and abstraction of cyber infrastructure, and allows for all cyber defense techniques to efficiently and synergistically co-exist, providing maximum collective coverage against cyber attacks and enhancing mission assurance.

Project goal is to develop technology that will utilize EW for platform / task force protection through the integration of EW into a networked coherent structure to provide better fleet defense, and develop techniques to deny the enemy the effective use of their sensors to do battle space awareness and targeting by creating a distorted battle space picture. This effort also continues EP modeling and implementation improvements by funding upgrades to hardware and software required for the characterization of platforms, contribute to modeling and simulation of implementable solutions, and technology validation through flight demonstrations of those solutions.  EP upgrades scheduled for transition to the platform program offices in FY 2013 and FY 2014.

                                    <r2:Title>FLEET FORCE PROTECTION AND DEFENSE AGAINST UNDERSEA THREATS</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>Fleet Force Protection and Defense against Undersea Threats addresses efforts that include applied research for complementary sensor and processing technologies for platform protection and shipboard technologies to increase the survivability of surface ship and submarine platforms against torpedo threats. 

The first major goal of this activity is to develop complementary sensor and processing technologies for 21st century warfighting success and platform protection.  Current small platforms (both surface and airborne) have little or no situational awareness (SA) or self-protection against air, surface, and asymmetric threats.  This activity will provide tactical aircraft (TACAIR) and other platforms with effective threat warning and self-protection.  The technology areas specific to platform protection will develop individual or multi-spectral [Electro-Optic (EO), IR, radio frequency (RF), EM, visual, and acoustic] sensors and associated processing.  To defend platforms from current and advanced threats in at-sea littoral environments and in port, these technologies must improve multi-spectral detection and distribution of specific threat information. 

The Fleet Force Protection portion of this activity includes support to the FNC Enabling Capabilities for: Aircraft Integrated Self-protection Suites; Intent Determination - EO/IR Enhancements; Proof-of-Concept for Non-lethal Approach; Advanced Electronic Sensor Systems for Missile Defense; Hostile Fire Detection and Response Spirals 1 and 2; Defense of Harbor and Near-Shore Naval Infrastructure Against Asymmetric Threats; Four-Torpedo Salvo Defense; and Shipboard Force Protection in Port and Restricted Waters - Detection and Classification.

The second major goal of this activity is to develop enabling technologies that will increase the survivability of surface ship and submarine platforms against torpedo threats.  Proposed technologies focus on defeating high priority threats including torpedoes (i.e. straight running, wake homing, acoustic homing, air dropped torpedoes, and salvoes of torpedoes).  Technologies developed will minimize shipboard impact and require no shipboard organizational maintenance.  The Anti-Torpedo Torpedo (ATT) provides technologies that enable an ATT to engage threat torpedoes detected by a surface ship towed sensor system.  The ultimate goal is to develop technologies to enable a torpedo defense capability, including ship self-defense against salvo torpedo attacks, to fill the FNC Sea Shield Warfighting Capability Gap/Enabling Capability: Platform Defense against Undersea Threats. Ultimately the goal is to deliver an anti-torpedo-torpedo for use in defeating a four-torpedo salvo attack against a surface platform.  This activity supports the development of technologies that aid the helicopter pilot when operating in degraded visual cue environments (brown-out).  

The decrease of funding from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is the result of the transfer of resources from this R2 activity to new FNC R2 activities titled Sea Strike and Sea Shield.  Efforts in these R2 activities have been continued from FY 2012 to FY 2013 into new R2 activities to support all FNC program EC Investments. All efforts in this R-2 Activity have been realigned to PE 0603673N, Future Naval Capabilities, for FY13 and later.

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>FY 2013 funding and associated Future Naval Capability (FNC) efforts addressed in this Program Element (PE) are transferring to a new PE titled Future Naval Capabilities Advanced Technology Development (PE 0603673N).  This is to enhance the visibility of the FNC Program by providing an easily navigable and consolidated overview of all 6.3 FNC investments in a single PE.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (Sep 2011).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare.

Activities and efforts in this program address the advanced technology development, test, and evaluation of a dynamic distributed common picture based on emergent technologies that will improve situational awareness across command echelons.  The promise of net-centricity and potential for persistent and pervasive sensing creates greater demand for automated fusion of large volumes of multi-sensor data, techniques to coordinate deployment of multiple diverse sensors, and tailored dissemination of information to support network centric operations.  The focus of this program is to refine technologies that exploit information and networking technology to ensure mission success in unpredictable warfighting environments.  These missions include the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO), urban operations, and asymmetric warfare.  To ensure Maritime Domain Awareness, the Navy must be able to collect, fuse, and disseminate enormous quantities of data drawn from US joint forces and government agencies, international coalition partners and forces, and commercial entities.  To further network centric capabilities, this project demonstrates technologies that support seamless information services afloat and ashore; collaborative decision-making among geographically dispersed warfighters; a common, consistent view of the battlespace geared to user requirements; system interoperability with coalition forces; real-time information access with quality of service guarantees; and information assurance.  Technologies of interest provide access to, and automated processing of, information necessary to make decisions that lead to rapid, accurate decision-making and result in decisive, precise, and desired engagement outcomes.  The payoff is access to tailored information in near real time with corresponding increases in speed of command, improved decision-making, and reduction in manpower.  

The Common Picture Program supports FORCEnet, Sea Shield and Sea Strike pillars and contains investments in the following Enabling Capabilities (ECs):  Combatant Commanders (COCOM) to Marine Combat ID; Combat ID Information Management of Coordinated Electronic Surveillance; Combat ID in the Maritime Domain to Reveal Contact Intent; Automated Control of Large Sensor Networks; Dynamic Command and Control (C2) for Tactical Forces and Maritime Operations Center (MOC); Dynamic Tactical Communications Networks; Globally Netted Joint/Coalition Force Maritime Component Commander; OCO Focused Tactical Persistent Surveillance; Actionable Intelligence Enabled by Persistent Surveillance; High Band Width Free-Space Laser Communications; Pro-Active Computer Network Defense and Information Assurance; Fast Magic; Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) Space; Advanced Tactical Data Link; and Autonomous Tactical Persistent Surveillance.

In the context of the Naval Transformation Roadmap construct, this investment will achieve capabilities required by FORCEnet (Persistent Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance; Time Sensitive Strike; and Sea Based Information Operations), Sea Strike (Ship-to-Objective Maneuver), and Sea Shield (Theater Air and Missile Defense).

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

						Network Situation Awareness &amp; Security:
- Continued new high assurance security protocols for networks and communications infrastructure with particular emphasis on attack resistance and security management.
- Continued development of algorithms/methods for providing attribution of threat-agents through the network/infrastructure. Emphasis was placed on addressing translational boundaries, cross-domains, and obfuscation techniques to avoid detection and tagging.
- Continued development of new algorithms to link/mine disparate system/network activities in order to identify malicious/threat agent actions against infrastructure components/systems.

Network Traffic Analysis and Assessment:
- Initiated development of new algorithms focused on detection of nation state sponsored activities through the network infrastructure. Developed algorithms to address sophisticated malicious code techniques that exploit network traffic/data that is fragmented, encrypted, and/or obfuscated using polymorphic techniques.

Information Assurance:
- Continued development of new domain data sharing algorithms/technology to address disparate classification levels, identification and authentication, inference techniques, and policy enforcement.  Ensured algorithms/technology scale to support representative networks and provide the necessary protections against exploitation techniques such as data exfiltration.

                                    <r2:Description>A portion of this activity is devoted to mid-term technology development in close concert with programs of record.  The products of these efforts are expected to transition at the end of their schedule into the associated acquisition programs of record.  This activity area also appears in PE 0602235N.  The aspects of a given EC in PE 0602235N focus on component technology, while this PE focuses on the integration of the components and on demonstrations.  Warfighter Capability Gaps are being addressed by EC's.  Each EC delivers capability-level products to acquisition in a three to five-year effort, and allocates a sufficient investment to ensure a capability is provided.  

The Future Naval Enabling Capabilities in this activity span across the Information Infrastructure, Applications/Tools/Decision Aids, Command and Control, Apertures and Radios, and Tactical Networks and Network Control/Management, and Computer Network Defense and Information Assurance technology areas.  Technologies being developed will integrate sensors, networks, decision aids, weapons and supporting systems into a highly adaptive, human-centric, comprehensive maritime system. This system will operate from the sea bed to space in a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) that can be used in a Joint Environment.  To accomplish this information integration, efforts are underway to develop rapid, accurate decision making and dynamic, efficient, mission-responsive communications and networks.  Objectives of the current ECs are:

a) OCO Focused Tactical Persistent Surveillance: Develop a netted, organically controlled, adaptive sensor field that is capable of detecting and classifying features relevant to OCO.  This includes organic sensors for small tactical expeditionary units, capable of supporting the dynamic character of modern operations from the highly mobile to the long-term.  Also, Tracking, Tagging and Locating (TTL) technical development of Quantum dot, Electro-Optic (EO) phase shifted and optical tags for use against vehicles and high priority entities.  Finally the effort includes technical development to enhance tactical sensor communications for a two-way high data rate radio.  Technology allows for automatic adaptation of waveforms for increased network capacity.

b) Globally Netted Joint/Coalition Force Maritime Component Commander: Develop 'globally- networked, theater-focused' maritime capabilities to enhance Joint Task Force (JTF) and COCOMs' ability to execute their intentions.  The efforts will support multiple users and multiple roles to access data at any command echelon; provide consistent, qualified, and traceable operational &amp; tactical maritime information across theaters; provide pedigree to provide a clear representation of complex situation and threat elements; supports user interaction across the SOA environment.   The benefits to Naval forces include:  exploitation of navy presence FORWARD to monitor vessels, people, cargo and designated missions, areas of interest within the global maritime environment; access to all relevant databases; and collection, analysis, and dissemination of relevant information. 

c) Dynamic Tactical Communications Networks: Develop, integrate and demonstrate dynamically adaptive automated software algorithms, protocols, and network management techniques that provide a rapidly auto-configuring and self-organizing networking capability.  This capability will adapt to available links of opportunity at lower echelons and assure priority movement of critical data intra-network and through reachback gateway networks that interface with the Global Information Grid (GIG) across multiple security/routing domains.  Benefits of this effort to the war-fighter include:  timely exchange of situational awareness and C2 information for the Naval Expeditionary Combatant forces; high throughput tactical network access/delivery, SOA and coalition interoperability through a reliable communications grid; ad-hoc re-tasking and targeting of warriors, weapons and sensors with minimum human intervention; shortened kill chain for tactical engagement missions.  

d) Dynamic C2 for Tactical Forces and Maritime Operations Center (MOC): Develop a capability that will provide the maritime commander with agile and responsive control and management of tactical Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) interactions in a net-centric enterprise environment.  Focus will address classified ASW requirements for command and control at the tactical level.  Benefits to Naval forces include flexible command and control among tactical units with severely degraded communications with the Maritime Operations Center.  

e) High-bandwidth Free-space Laser Communication (Lasercomm): Develop an affordable, reliable and high-bandwidth Free-Space Lasercomm capability which is adaptive and agile in mitigating a wide range of atmospheric and sea surface/state turbulence, precipitation and obscuration conditions.  Benefits include real-time high-bandwidth direct ship-ship, ship-air and ship-shore links in RF denied environments; enhanced reachback for Forward Operating Bases (FOB) to Marine expeditionary Command Operation Centers (COC) with limited SATCOM access; and biometrics information sharing between Marine Interdiction Operation (MIO) parties.

f) Actionable Intelligence Enabled by Persistent Surveillance: Develop a capability to provide accurate threat detection by exposing the enemy's vulnerabilities, unmasking their latent networks, discovering their tactics, techniques, procedures and exploiting in new ways the vast amount of sensor data available today against an irregular threat.  Also being developed:  an electro-optical, infrared and laser Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Targeting (ISRT) optics technology, capable of wide Field of View/Field of Range (FOV/FOR) at variable resolution &amp; pointing direction, for installation in mobile platforms without gimbals; a light weight, low cost sensor suite and autonomy algorithms to enable detection and avoidance of all classes of aircraft or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV).  

g) Pro-Active Computer Network Defense and Information Assurance: Develop a capability to 1) identify and counter real-time threats to the network during mission execution; 2) provide dynamic security management and component management of network-based assets to support mission execution; and 3) ensure mission essential capabilities and data exist despite malicious cyber actions.  Specific efforts include: 1) Next Generation Sensors and Gateways to provide security and control mechanisms to protect networks, data and systems from attacks (e.g., malicious code, data exfiltration); 2) Next Generation Security Protocols and Security Management Protocols to provide hardened, highly survivable, stealthy, reconfigurable overlay of protocols onto networks to ensure network-base configuration and control of security components essential to mission operations, as well as provide data provenance to support dynamic resource management and decision support; and 3) Common Operational Security Decision System to aggregate, correlate, fuse and visualize network security posture information to support integrated warfighting decisions.

h) Fast Magic:  Develop a capability for enabling Information Operations from tactical platforms in a net-centric environment.  Details are classified.

i) NRL Space:  Develop a capability to integrate multiple sensor information from multiple net-centered data stores in a service oriented architecture environment for persistent vessel tracking situational awareness. Details are classified.

j) Advanced Tactical Data Link - Develop a capability to support Advanced Tactical Data Link operations in permissive, contested, and anti-access environments as well as the real-time network operations capabilities needed to dynamically add/remove participants, allocate Advanced Tactical Data Link resources to each participant, and add/remove network partitions in support of dynamic mission execution.  

k) Autonomous Tactical Persistent Surveillance - Develop a capability  to allow autonomous control of persistent, tactical networks of sensors; enable ISR assets to provide an "Information Bubble" to the mobile user; provide revolutionary sensor and data support to agile tactical missions by anticipating information needs; and provide sensor planning and management relevant to a higher order knowledge model.  This will provide the capability to autonomously maintain persistent surveillance of activities and entities over a region of interest, 24/7, while providing underlying context for real time adaptive surveillance in support of tactical mission objectives.

The decrease in funding from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is due to transfer of resources and associated objectives of FNC efforts to a new PE titled Future Naval Capabilities Advanced Technology Development (PE 0603673N) to enhance the visibility of the FNC Program by providing an easily navigable and consolidated overview of all 6.3 FNC investments in a single PE.

The following accomplishments and plans are non-inclusive examples of accomplishments and plans for projects funded in this activity.

                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>This PE supports the development of technologies that address the advanced technology development, test, and evaluation of a dynamic distributed common picture based on emergent technologies that will improve situational awareness across command echelons. Each PE Activity has unique goals and metrics, some of which include classified quantitative measurements.  Overall metric goals are focused on achieving sufficient improvement in component or system capability such that the 6.2 applied research projects meet the need of or produce a demand for inclusion in advanced technology that may lead to incorporation into acquisition programs or industry products available to acquisition programs.   

Specific examples of metrics under this PE include:

- Enable the coordinated Global Joint and Coalition Force Maritime Component Commander to capture and share information from sources and processes with the intended result of managing at least 10,000 tracks per day in a consistent manner to support user awareness and control (current capability is approximately 200 tracks per day globally).

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>FY 2013 funding associated with Future Naval Capability (FNC) efforts are transferring to a new Program Element titled Future Naval Capabilities Advanced Technology Development (PE 0603673N).  This is to enhance the visibility of the FNC Program by providing an easily navigable overview of all 6.3 FNC investments in a single location.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (Sep 2011).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential S&amp;T efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare.

Warfighter Sustainment Advanced Technology supports:  Manpower and Personnel, Training, and Readiness; and the Future Joint Warfighting Capabilities identified by the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  It supports Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) Programs in Airframe/Ship Corrosion; Turbine Engine Technologies; Littoral Combat; Sea Base Planning, Operations and Logistics; and Sea Base Mobility and Interfaces.  It develops technologies that enable the Navy to better recruit, select, classify, assign, and manage its people; to train effectively and affordably in classroom settings, in simulated and actual environments, and while deployed; and to effect human systems design into weapon systems.  Other technologies enable reduced operating costs through life-extension of legacy systems and increased efficiency of future propulsion systems and improved diagnostic tools.

Within the Naval Transformation Roadmap, this investment supports the achievement of all the transformational capabilities of Sea Warrior and the transformational capabilities of:  Ship to Objective Maneuver and Time Sensitive Strike required by Sea Strike; Littoral Sea Control and Anti-Sub Warfare required by Sea Shield; Compressed Deployment and Employment Times and Enhanced Sea-Borne Positioning of Assets required by Sea Basing; and Battlespace Integration required by FORCEnet.

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

These technologies will enable advanced capabilities for Navy weapon systems at reduced total ownership costs.  Versatile Affordable Advanced Turbine Engines (VAATE) is a DoD/DOE/NASA/Industry program to develop and demonstrate versatile, affordable, advanced engine technologies enabling for increased systems capabilities and reduced total ownership costs. The VAATE goal is 10X improvement in propulsion system affordability (capability/cost) by 2017, with interim goals of 4X by 2009 and 6X by 2013.  The elements of the capability-to-cost index are increased thrust to weight; decreased specific fuel consumption; and reduced development, production, and maintenance costs for the entire integrated propulsion system.  To achieve these goals, VAATE is organized into multiple product areas. Specifically for the Navy, the focus, as part of the Enterprise and Platform Enablers FNC, is on turbine engine capability enhancements for future and emerging systems.  Technologies critical to Navy fighter jets are being worked, including low pressure turbine technologies for short takeoff and landing; high pressure turbine technologies for higher temperature, longer life; fan and compressor technologies for greater engine robustness and durability, and instrumentation and control technologies for greater engine state awareness and less unscheduled maintenance. Technologies being demonstrated include advanced aerodynamic, material, and structural concepts and emerging active control, prognostic health management, thermal management, aircraft subsystem integration, and information technologies.

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>FY 2013 funding and associated Future Naval Capability (FNC) efforts addressed in this Program Element (PE) are transferring to a new PE titled Future Naval Capabilities Advanced Technology Development (PE 0603673N).  This is to enhance the visibility of the FNC Program by providing an easily navigable and consolidated overview of all 6.3 FNC investments in a single PE.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (Sep 2011).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare. 

Activities and efforts in this Program Element (PE) address technologies critical to enabling the transformation of discrete functions to network centric warfare capabilities, which simultaneously perform Radar, Electronic Warfare (EW), and Communications and Network functions across platforms through multiple, simultaneous and continuous communications/data links.  The Electromagnetic Systems Advanced Technology program addresses Radio Frequency (RF) technology for Surface and Aerospace Surveillance sensors and systems, EW sensors and systems, RF Communication Systems, Multi-Function sensor systems, and Position, Navigation and Timing (PNT) capabilities.  Within the Naval Transformational Roadmap, this investment offers affordable options for the transformational capabilities required by the Sea Shield (Theater Air and Missile Defense), Sea Strike (Persistent Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance), and ForceNet (Communications and Networking) SeaPower 21 Naval Warfighting Pillars. 

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>The overarching objective of this activity is to develop, test, and demonstrate communications, electronic attack (EA), electronic surveillance (ES), electronic warfare (EW), and radar functions.  This activity also includes development of affordable wideband, high performance Advanced Multifunction Radio Frequency (AMRF) apertures.  A portion of this PE is devoted to mid-term technology development in close concert with acquisition programs of record.  The products of these efforts are expected to transition at the end of their schedule into the associated acquisition program of record.  In this PE, these Future Naval Capability (FNC) Enabling Capabilities (ECs) span across Electronics, EW, Radar, and Communications technology areas.  This activity also appears in PE 0602271N.  For ECs receiving funding from both PEs, the PE 0602271N portion is generally focused on component design and development while the funding from this PE is focused on integration and demonstration.

The Navy assumed responsibility for Joint Counter Radio Controlled Improvised Explosive Device Electronic Warfare (JCREW) 3.3 S&amp;T by Congressional Mandate.  In FY 2012, JCREW EC program will support JCREW 3.3 Acquisition Program Increment 2 Blocks 1 and 2 and will develop an advanced multi-function communications and EW architecture with supporting component technologies to support prototype development.

The major objectives of this activity are:

a) Affordable Common Radar Architecture (ACRA) - Develop a scalable, open radar architecture that addresses affordability challenges for 5 different radars.

b) SATCOM Vulnerability Mitigation - Develop a diverse, multi-tier communications networking capability for Naval strike forces.

c) Long Range Detection and Tracking - Ability to detect, track and identify (ID) future anti-ship ballistic missiles, advanced cruise missiles, aircraft and Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs).

d) Affordable Electronically Scanned Array Technology for Next Generation Naval Platforms - Develop and demonstrate affordable components in beamforming element chains for efficient S- and X-Band radar, and EA using highly efficient digital solid state electronics components covering the RF and microwave frequencies.

e) Countermeasure Technologies for Anti-Ship Missile Defense (ASMD) - Improve ship survivability by disrupting the terminal engagement phase of hostile Anti-Ship Cruise Missiles/ Anti-Ship Ballistic Missiles (ASCM/ASBM), including improvements to both onboard Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program (SEWIP) and offboard Nulka RF EA systems.

f) Next Generation Countermeasure Technologies for Ship Missile Defense - Develop and demonstrate the fundamental technologies required to conduct next generation, persistent EW in support of ship, sea base, and littoral force missile defense operations in a distributed, coordinated manner across the entire battlespace.

g) Next Generation Airborne Electronic Attack - Develop and demonstrate advanced capability Airborne Electronic Attack (AEA) sub-systems (e.g., broadband exciters, power amplifiers, and transmit arrays) that provide Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD), deliver Non-Kinetic Fires, counter Integrated Air Defense Systems (IADS), and provide suppression of Command, Control &amp; Communications (C3) links and data networks.

h) Data Exfiltration Nanosatellite Innovative Space Enabler (DENISE)(formerly known as Global Applications for Data Exfiltration(GLADEX)) - Develop a capability for monitoring and relay of unattended sensor data for global situational awareness.  Benefits include security through encryption, reduced dependence on commercial systems, and reduced collection needs by manned and unmanned in-area assets.  It addresses a shortfall to monitor shipping in territorial waters and the open ocean to combat terrorism, and, enforce criminal law.

i) Radar Electronic Attack Protection (REAP) - Develop single platform precision passive Electronic Support Measure (ESM) and Electronic Protection (EP) techniques and technology to counter hostile use of modern Electronic Attack (EA) self protection jammers.

j) Joint Counter Radio Controlled Improvised Explosive Device Electronic Warfare (JCREW) 3.3 - Develop integrated RF communications and RF jammer capability that addresses the electromagnetic interference (EMI) issue to enable interoperability.

k) Submarine Survivability- Electronic Warfare - Develop and demonstrate technologies that will provide submarines an EA capability against surveillance radar systems through EW payloads integrated with submarine masts, as well as networked offboard platforms.  These capabilities will improve the submarine's survivability in a hostile RF environment by providing a non-kinetic strike capability against enemy Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) sensors.

l) Electronic Warfare (EW) Roadmap - Develop classified advanced electronic warfare technology in support of current and predicted capability requirements. 

Decrease in funding from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is due to transfer of FNC efforts addressed in this PE to a new PE titled Future Naval Capabilities Advanced Technology Development (PE 0603673N).  This is to enhance the visibility of the FNC Program by providing an easily navigable and consolidated overview of all 6.3 FNC investments in a single PE.

                                    <r2:Title>GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM (GPS) &amp; NAVIGATION TECHNOLOGY</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The overarching objective of this activity is to develop technologies that enable the development of affordable, effective and robust Position, Navigation and Timing (PNT) capabilities using either GPS systems, non-GPS navigation devices, or atomic clocks.  This activity will increase the operational effectiveness of U.S. Naval units.  The focus is on the mitigation of GPS electronic threats, the development of atomic clocks that possess unique long-term stability and precision, and the development of compact, low-cost, Inertial Navigation Systems (INS).

The major objectives of this activity are:

a) GPS Anti-Jam Antennas and Receivers - Integrate and demonstrate anti-jam antennas and antenna electronics for Navy platforms for the purpose of providing precision navigation capabilities in the presence of electronic threats; to integrate and demonstrate anti-spoofer/anti-jam processors for the purpose of providing precision navigation capabilities in the presence of emergent threats. 

b) Precision Time and Time Transfer - Integrate and demonstrate tactical grade atomic clocks that possess unique long-term stability and precision for the purpose of providing GPS-independent precision time; to integrate and demonstrate the capability of transferring GPS-derived time via radio frequency links for the purpose of providing GPS-independent precision time. 

c) Non-GPS Navigation Technology - To integrate and demonstrate inertial navigation systems for the purpose of providing an alternative means of providing precision navigation for those Naval platforms which may not have GPS navigation capabilities and/or loss of GPS signals; to integrate and demonstrate a correlation navigation technique using earth maps of high precision (including bathymetric, magnetic and gravimetric data) for navigation for those Naval platforms which may not have GPS navigation capabilities and/or loss of GPS signals.

The increase in funding from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is due to restoration of previously programmed funding level for GPS and Navigation Technologies research.  FY 2012 GPS research was reduced to fund critical related work in Gallium Nitride (GaN) High Electron Mobility Transistors (HEMTs) supporting Electronic and Electromagnetic Research program objectives.   

The decrease in funding from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is due to the reduced investment in Advanced Technology efforts for GPS and Navigation, and planned increase in Applied Research investment in the Navigation Technology activity in PE 0602271N.

                                    <r2:Title>INTEGRATED TOPSIDE (INTOP) INNOVATIVE NAVAL PROTOTYPE (INP)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The overarching objective of the INTOP INP is to develop and demonstrate a set of prototypes that integrate RF functionality (EW, Radar, Communications, Navigation) into a common set of multi-function apertures electronics and software through an architecture that is modular, scalable across all platforms, and open at the RF as well as computer and software level.  The apertures are capable of providing multiple simultaneous, independent beams which can together perform any of the above functions.

The major objectives of this activity are:

a) Submarine SATCOM Array - Develop wide-band SATCOM array capable of supporting EW for submarines.

b) Electronic Warfare (EW)/Information Operations (IO)/Line of Sight (LOS) Communications (Comms) for Surface Combatants - Develop wide-band array to support EW capability and other functions, including but not limited to IO and LOS Comms, for surface combatants with potential application to other platforms.

c) Architecture, Standards and Devices - Develop architecture and standards for wide-band multi-beam, multi-band arrays and below deck systems and the technology and electronic devices needed to make integrated array systems affordable.

d) Surface Combatant Communication Array - Develop wide-band surface combatant communication array capable of supporting other RF functions.

e) Resource Allocation Manager - Develop enterprise common Resource Allocation Manager.

f) Digital Radar - Develop an all digital radar to demonstrate advanced concepts for coherent radar networking and control, which will increase radar coverage and provide new levels of electronic protection (EP), while maximizing radar resources and reducing cost.

g) Low Band Communications, IO and EW - Develop low band technology development and concept studies leading to development of an Advanced Development Model (ADM).

The decrease in funding from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is due to completion of the SATCOM Array prototype build during FY 2013.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (Sep 2011).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential S&amp;T efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of United States Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare.

As a key component of naval expeditionary forces, the Marine Corps has unique and technologically stressing requirements because of its expeditionary mission and intensive operational tempo, Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) structure, and conduct of maneuver warfare.  Critical requirements in this PE are: Command, Control, Communications, Computers (C4); Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR); maneuver techniques and means; force protection; logistic sustainment; human performance, training and education; and firepower. There are ongoing actions to develop and demonstrate advanced technologies and concepts in operational environments. Joint service efforts are aligned with Defense Technology Objectives and Joint Warfighting Capability Objectives. In addition, there is funding for experimentation in warfighting concepts as well as operational assessment of emerging technologies, to include technical support of operating forces to assess military utility of selected technologies. This PE specifically supports: continued development of enhanced warfighting capabilities through field experiments with Marine operating forces; rapid response to low-, mid-, and high-intensity conflicts in the Overseas Contingency Operation (OCO); methods for countering irregular threats; and expansion of seabasing and naval force packaging capabilities. The investment directly assists in fulfilling the forward presence requirements of Sea Shield and the transformational capabilities prescribed by Sea Strike. The Future Naval Capability (FNC) process is supported and funds are programmed accordingly. This PE is largely focused on demonstration of products and capabilities from the knowledge base and Discovery and Invention (D&amp;I) phases of Naval S&amp;T. As Naval partners, the Navy and Marine Corps S&amp;T Team strive to transition technologies that will implement objectives outlined in the Naval Operations Concept. This PE also funds technical solutions designed to increase Naval force capability, such as the Naval Expeditionary Combat Command. Investments in S&amp;T provide the opportunities for future capabilities and will prevent technological surprise. The PE as a whole will advance the amphibious and expeditionary capabilities for the Combatant Commanders helping to meet their emerging challenges by enhancing Naval S&amp;T contributions to the long commitment to the OCO. The Marine Corps Service Campaign Plan (MCSCP) is the lens through which USMC S&amp;T priorities are acted upon in order to support the future development of the Total Force.


Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Schedule: Project 2297, Worldwide contingency and combat operations (e.g., Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and humanitarian efforts) have increased the operations tempo of the operating forces to the extent that their support of, and participation in, the Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory (MCWL) experimentation was/remains challenging to coordinate and often directly impacts planned projects.  Additionally, rapid responses to emergent warfighter needs impacts planned projects.  Also, experimentation itself is not a precise business and information gained throughout the process can also effect program plans.  Thus, executing planned projects becomes "an art" in an effort to balance complicated and competing needs.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Critical Marine Corps requirements/imperatives addressed in this Project are: Maneuver; Force Protection; Human Performance, Training and Education; Logistics; Command, Control, Communications and Computers (C4); Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) and Firepower.   These are ongoing efforts to develop and demonstrate advanced technologies and system concepts in an operational environment.  Multiple transitions into the Sub-system/Component Advanced Development Phase are planned, as well as fieldable prototyped to reduce risk in System Concept Development and Demonstration.  A tactically effective Mine Countermeasures (MCM) capability is vital to Force Protection and necessary if Maneuver on land is to become a functional component of Naval Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare.  Maneuver, supported by MCM provides synchronization and speed of detection, breaching, clearance, proofing, and marking operations.  This project supports: 1) engaging regional forces in decisive combat on a global basis; 2) responding to all other contingencies and missions in the full spectrum of combat operations (high, middle, and low intensity), in Military Operations in Urban Terrain (MOUT), and in Operations other than War (OOTW); and 3)  warfighting experimentation.  By providing the technologies to enable these capabilities, this project supports the goals and objectives of the Strike, Littoral Warfare and Surveillance Joint Mission Areas.  These are ongoing efforts to develop and demonstrate advanced technologies and system concepts in an operational environment. 

In addition, this project supports the goals and objectives of the Littoral Combat/Power Projection related Enabling Capability (EC) within the Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) portfolio.  The focus of the EC within this PE is technology related to Urban, Asymmetric, and Expeditionary Operations (UAEO).  The UAEO Capability Gap is a science and technology developmental area that is of the highest importance to Marine Corps operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and is one of the highest ranked Capability Gaps prioritized by the Chief of Naval Operations and the Marine Corps Combat Development Command (MCCDC).  The UAEO technology gap is being pursued as part of an overall effort that addresses the Sea Strike Capability Gap.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>This activity supports the demonstration of technologies to enhance situational awareness and tactical decision making through automated analysis, fusion of data, rapid integration of information, and acquired knowledge resulting in actionable intelligence at the lower command levels. The activity includes the demonstration of ISR efforts involving enhanced reconnaissance and persistent surveillance, and sensors for unmanned ground and aerial vehicles.   Advanced Technology demonstrations also include the collection of information [monitoring, sensing, and locating] in the 3D urban battlespace as well as exploiting information [identifying and classifying data] as part of the intelligence preparation of the battlespace in order to facilitate operational maneuver and distributed operations.

The increase in the ISR Thrust funding from FY2012 to FY2013 is due to the initiation of Tagging, Tracking, and Locating efforts to demonstrate a system that will automatically translate large amounts of wide area surveillance data into tracks, useful to expose entity to entity associations; build urban context, as well as detect events and anomalies; and associate objects, tasks, locations and events for creating actionable intelligence in on-board firmware which is a USMC and United States Special Operations Command (SOCOM) priority. Efforts to mature the semantic web construct needed to enable information dissemination and utilization will also be initiated.  Efforts to infer and disambiguate graphs generated from structured and unstructured data will be accelerated as will development in processing low signal to noise audio data.

                                    <r2:Description>This activity addresses the advanced technology development associated with associated with the Marine Corps participation in the Department of the Navy's (DoN) Science and Technology Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) Program.  The FNC Program represents the requirements-driven, delivery-oriented portion of the DoN Science and Technology (S&amp;T) portfolio.  FNC investments respond to Naval S&amp;T Gaps that are generated by the Navy and Marine Corps after receiving input from Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders.  The funding is aligned with the Naval challenges associated with projecting power despite anti-access and area denial, specifically the Sea Shield, Power and Energy, FORCEnet, and the Naval Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare warfighting capability gaps. The funding profile reflects the alignment of the FNC program investments into Enabling Capabilities (ECs); ECs respond to priority Naval warfighting capability gaps.  Funding for each EC is aligned to a 6.2 or 6.3 Budget Activity (BA) as appropriate.  Concurrent funding for Naval expeditionary warfare capability ECs is also provided from Navy PE0602750N and PE0603673N. Both of the Navy PE's were included in the FY 2013 President's Budget Request and are now the only Navy program elements funding Navy FNC work.  In previous submissions 7 Navy 6.2 PEs and 8 Navy 6.3 PEs funded FNC efforts.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>This activity supports Marine Corps Expeditionary Logistics which is the practical discipline and real world application of the deployment, sustainment, reconstitution, and re-deployment of forces engaged in expeditionary operations.  Expeditionary Logistics replaces mass with assured knowledge and speed, is equally capable ashore or afloat in austere environments, and is fully scalable to meet uncertain requirements.  Expeditionary Logistics logically divides into five pillars:  deployment support, force closure, sustainment, reconstitution/redeployment, and command and control.  These pillars are thoroughly integrated and perpetually related in execution.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory (MCWL) supports the Deputy Commandant of the Marine Corps for Combat Development and Integration (DC, CD&amp;I) in his mission to define what the Marine Corps of the future should look like in combat development terms.  More specifically, MCWL develops and evaluates future Marine Corps warfighting concepts using an integrated combination of live force experimentation, technology assessment, modeling and simulation, wargaming, and analysis.  MCWL's principal outputs improve current (and inform future) United States Marine Corps (USMC) doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership, personnel, and facilities (DOTMLPF) requirements.  MCWL conducts service-specific experiments and participates in joint service experimentation.

Wargames are conducted to frame emerging warfighting concepts, establish the Joint context for the Marine Corps Force Development System, and establish priorities for development of experimental and non-experimental capabilities.

Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S)-based events allow MCWL to examine capabilities with larger scale venues and forces than is practical with live forces at lower cost in terms of funding and in terms of operating force personnel and equipment.  M&amp;S also enables assessment of proposed capabilities before making investments in costly concept demonstrator technologies required in live force experiments. 

Technical assessments are conducted to ensure that prototype or surrogate technologies are ready for insertion into live force experiments, and to explore the military utility of promising new commercial or government technologies.

Live force experimentation permits exploration of prototype and surrogate technologies, as well as Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs), in order to better refine equipment requirements and to identify DOTMLPF initiatives needed to produce future capabilities.  Experimentation encompasses inquiries into multiple warfighting areas, including:  Combat Service Support (CSS) and Force Protection; Command, Control, Communications, and Computers (C4); Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR); Fires, Targeting, and Maneuver; and Warfighting Excellence.

Using operational forces, MCWL conducts Advanced Warfighting Experiments (AWEs) supported by Limited Objective Experiments (LOEs), Limited Technical Assessments (LTAs), Wargames, and Studies.  These events are planned and scheduled as part of a series of experimentation campaigns focused on one or more central warfighting concepts.  These campaigns are executed under the guidance of the Commandant of the Marine Corps (CMC) and under the auspices of the DC, CD&amp;I.

The current MCWL Campaign Plan (MCP), formerly called the MCWL Experiment Campaign Plan (ECP), is focused on the challenges associated with the Enhanced Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) Operations (EMO), ShipTo Objective Maneuver (STOM), and Seabasing concepts.  This campaign began in FY 2011 and is projected to culminate with an AWE in 2014.  EMO experimentation seeks to capitalize on the enhancements achieved during the previous MCWL campaign, Enhanced Company Operations (ECO), completed in FY 2010, which centered on expanding the combat capabilities of the Marine Infantry Company.  EMO experimentation examines and develops the capabilities of other elements of the MAGTF beyond the infantry company.  Focus areas for this effort are logistics, command and control (C2), and fires, targeting, and maneuver.

The next MCWL Campaign, beginning in FY 2014, will shift focus to Future Maritime Operations (FMO) line of effort.  FMO will pursue themes of experimentation that support a flexible and sustainable Marine Expeditionary Brigade (MEB)-sized force involved in immediate crisis response operations across the range of military operations within the emerging "Single Naval Battle" concept.  FMO will examine future enhancements in training, organization, and equipment for a crisis response MEB.  The goal of this concept-based line of experimentation is to operationalize the concepts of Operational Maneuver From The Sea (OMFTS), STOM, and Seabasing.

Furthermore, during FY 2010, the Commandant of the Marine Corps (CMC) designated MCWL as the lead agency for all USMC Counter Improvised Explosive Device (CIED) activities, thereby expending MCWL's responsibilities in this critical area.  Additionally, MCWL will continue to support the immediate needs of deployed forces and exploit opportunities presented by promising emerging technologies.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>This activity includes MCWL CSS and force protection experimentation efforts including assessment of equipment, new TTPs, training programs, and proposed organizational changes associated with enhanced capabilities.  Although this category covers several small (less than $500K per FY) efforts being pursued by MCWL, most programs listed below are considered major (valued at $500K or more) or have near real-time operational impact. 

The increase in MCWL CSS and Force Protection activity funding FY 2012 to FY 2013 is due to larger investments in the MCWL specific Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)-legged robot and technologies that reduce the demand required to support the MAGTF, such as Adaptive Logistics pursuits.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>This activity includes MCWL ISR related experimentation efforts including assessment of equipment, new TTPs, training programs, and proposed organizational changes associated with enhanced ISR capabilities.  Although this category covers several small (less than $500K per FY) efforts being pursued by MCWL, most programs listed below are considered major (valued at $500K or more) or have near real-time operational impact. 

The decrease in MCWL ISR activity funding from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is due to the earlier than anticipated completion of small infantry unit Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV), Unmanned Aerial System (UAS), and unattended ground sensor employment methods as well as integrated company level C4 ISR network assessments.  </r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>MCWL Operations (Support) efforts include overall MCWL experimentation doctrine, planning, analysis, data collection, as well as technology transition tracking efforts.  Although this category covers several small (less than $500K per FY) efforts being pursued by MCWL, most programs listed below are considered major (valued at $500K or more) or have near real-time operational impact.

The increase in MCWL Operations funding from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is due to a re-classification/categorization of efforts.  The FY 2012 Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) assessment was applied solely to this activity. In FY 2013 and beyond, MCWL plans to spread the assessment to all effected areas instead of applying to only one area.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The DOD's Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Program (JNLWP) was established by the Secretary of Defense, who assigned centralized responsibility for DOD joint research and development of non-lethal technology to the Commandant of the Marine Corps as the Executive Agent.  The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics provides direct oversight of the JNLWP.

The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) reflect science and technology (S&amp;T) investment decisions provided by the Joint NLW Integrated Product Team, a multi-service flag level corporate board that executes the JNLWP for the Commandant of the Marine Corps.  This direction is based on the needs and capabilities of the Services, the Special Operations Command, and the Coast Guard, as identified in the DoD's Non-Lethal Weapons Joint Capabilities Based Assessment Document.  This coordinated joint S&amp;T development approach addresses mutual capability gaps and assures the best non-lethal technologies and equipment are provided to the operating forces while eliminating duplicative service S&amp;T investment.

This program funds Advanced Technology Development of next-generation Non-Lethal Weapons (NLWs) and includes performing analysis, technical development efforts, and modeling and simulation necessary to ensure optimum weaponization and use of these NLWs.  Investment areas include research and development of next-generation NLWs such as: non-lethal directed energy weapons (lasers, millimeter wave and high power microwave) for counter-personnel and counter-materiel missions; non-lethal counter-personnel technologies (acoustic, optical, and human electro-muscular disruption technologies), and advanced non-lethal materials (including materiels for vehicle/vessel stopping and counter-facility applications).  Next-generation NLW systems focus on long-range localized Non-Lethal (NL) effects to identified threat individuals (or groups of individuals) and/or their threat weapons systems operating in complicated environments such as urban areas, crowds, buildings, vehicles, vessels, and also in close proximity to high-value civilian facilities.  By order of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, the Commandant of the Marine Corps was established as the Executive Agent for DoD Joint Non-Lethal Weapons RDT&amp;E.

The change in funding from FY2012 to FY2013 is due to a Below Threshold Realignment from PE0602651M for counter-personnel requirements received from the joint community that, based on the research planned to be conducted, more appropriately fit into budget activity 3 according to the FMR definition.

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) address the Advanced Technology Development associated with the Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) Program.  The FNC Program represents the requirements-driven, delivery-oriented portion of the Navy's Science and Technology (S&amp;T) portfolio.  FNC investments respond to Naval S&amp;T Gaps that are identified by the Navy and Marine Corps after receiving input from Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders. The Enabling Capabilities (ECs) and associated technology product investments of the FNC Program are competitively selected by a 3-star Technology Oversight Group (TOG), chartered by the S&amp;T Corporate Board and representing the requirements, acquisition, research and fleet/forces communities of the Navy and the Marine Corps.  

This was a new PE in FY 2013 that consolidated all Navy 6.3 FNC Program investments into a single Navy 6.3 PE.  Marine Corps FNC 6.3 investments are consolidated in a single Marine Corps 6.3 PE (0603640M). In FY 2011 and FY 2012, the Navy's 6.3 FNC Program investments were spread across 8 separate 6.3 PEs:  0603114N, 0603123N, 0603235N, 0603236N, 0603271N, 0603279N, 0603747N and 0603782N.  The consolidation in this PE allows all investments to be viewed by FNC Pillar, Enabling Capability (EC) and Technology Product.  It greatly enhances the visibility of the FNC Program by providing an easily navigable overview of all 6.3 FNC investments in a single place.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>FNC investments are typically 3-5 years in duration.  They provide a continuance of basic research by maturing technologies from a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 3 or 4 to a TRL of 6.  All FNC products require BA2 and BA3 funded technology development, which is coordinated to ensure tangible technology products are delivered upon completion of each investment.  Each year the TOG refreshes the FNC Program by approving new ECs and technology products as older ones get delivered.  After transition to an acquisition program, FNC products are further engineered, integrated and ultimately, delivered to the warfighter. The development and delivery of each FNC product is guided by a Technology Transition Agreement (TTA) that is signed by the requirements and acquisition sponsors, as well as the S&amp;T developer.

This project supports the naval pillars of Capable Manpower, Enterprise and Platform Enablers, Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare, Force Health Protection, Forcenet, Power and Energy, Sea Basing, Sea Shield and Sea Strike.  Each of these pillars is listed as a separate R-2 Activity.  Under each R-2 Activity, the BA 6.3 accomplishments and plans for every Enabling Capability (EC) and Technology Product in the FNC Program are listed.  ECs are composed of one or more interrelated technology products, so for clarity, each product is shown under its EC.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>As discussed in Section A, there are a significant number of FNC technology products within this PE.  In all cases, these technology products support the Department of the Navy's FNC Program and are managed at the Office of Naval Research.  All FNC investments in this PE are subjected to management oversight by 2-star chaired Integrated Product Teams (IPTs) that control the naval pillars of Sea Shield, Sea Strike, Sea Basing, Forcenet, Naval Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare, Enterprise and Platform Enablers, Power and Energy, Capable Manpower, and Force Health Protection.  Each EC is aligned to a pillar and each technology product is aligned to an EC.  At the lowest level, each technology product is measured against both technical and financial milestones on a monthly basis.  Annually, each technology product is reviewed in depth for technical performance and development status by the Chief of Naval Research against goals that have been approved by the Navy's 3-star Technology Oversight Group (TOG).  Also annually, each technology product is reviewed by its 2-star chaired pillar IPT for transition planning and adequacy and transition commitment level.   Products must meet TOG required transition commitment levels for S&amp;T development to continue.  Transition issues and required adjustments are reported annually by the Chief of Naval Research to the TOG, which establishes investment priorities for the FNC Program.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>FY 2013 funding associated with Future Naval Capability (FNC) efforts are transferring to a new Program Element titled Future Naval Capabilities Advanced Technology Development (PE 0603673N).  This is to enhance the visibility of the FNC Program by providing an easily navigable overview of all 6.3 FNC investments in a single location.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (Sep 2011).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare.

This program supports the development and demonstration of field medical equipment and technologies to improve warfighter safety and to enhance personnel performance under adverse conditions. Navy investment in these areas is essential because Navy/USMC mission needs are not adequately addressed by the civilian sector or other Federal agencies. These projects support funds future capabilities within the Force Health Protection Program, a Future Naval Capability (FNC) that will provide technology options for the future Navy and Marine Corps by reducing morbidity and mortality when casualties occur.

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>FY 2013 funding associated with Future Naval Capability (FNC) efforts are transferring to a new Program Element titled Future Naval Capabilities Advanced Technology Development (PE 0603673N).  This is to enhance the visibility of the FNC Program by providing an easily navigable overview of all 6.3 FNC investments in a single location.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (Sep 2011).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare.

All Navy advanced technology development in undersea target detection, classification, localization, tracking and neutralization is funded through this PE.  The related technologies being developed are aimed at enabling Sea Shield, one of the three core operational concepts detailed in the Naval Transformational Roadmap.  Associated efforts focus on new Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) operational concepts that promise to improve wide-area surveillance, detection, localization, tracking and attack capabilities against quiet adversary submarines operating in noisy and cluttered shallow water environments.  The focus is on leveraging technologies that will protect the country's current capital investment in surveillance, submarine, surface ship and air ASW assets.

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Title>ANTI-SUBMARINE WARFARE (ASW) DISTRIBUTED SEARCH</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>ASW Distributed Search focuses the development of technologies for the non-covert tactical search for undersea targets ranging from hours to weeks using automated sensor systems deployed around operating areas including along key transit routes to protect naval/maritime forces, around temporarily fixed sea base regions and naval force operating areas, or around fixed defensive regions and areas of interest such as key US/Allied ports. "Non-covert" implies availability of airborne assets for sensor deployment (although other means may also be used), and the ability to employ active sonar along with passive and non-acoustic methods. "Search" is conducted in concentrated areas, typically exploiting cues received from surveillance systems. The submarine target must be detected beyond its weapons release range. The objective is to develop rapidly deployable systems employing automated detection and classification capabilities for use in both shallow and deep water operating environments. Distributed Search supports the ASW protected passage Maritime Shield operational constructs. Related efforts include the development of distributed systems employing optimization as well as active acoustic sensing and processing techniques, navy-unique transduction and underwater networking technology. Efforts also include the development of Unmanned Undersea Vehicle-based and affordable off-board deployable sensing systems employing persistent detection concepts and components. These efforts provide an extended reach of organic platform-based systems through the use of new sensor concepts, improved materials for advanced sensors, optimized deployment, employment, and automated operation of distributed sensor fields. The cornerstone of Distributed Search is the development of rapidly deployable, long-endurance active sensors with automated processing suitable for use in a wide variety of operational environments.

                                    <r2:Description>The goal of this work is to integrate ocean and atmospheric environmental characteristics with sensor performance predictions in order to develop algorithms and Tactical Decision Aids (TDAs) that will accurately predict overall sensor performance in a given environment in near real-time for both present and future situations. The results of these research efforts in conjunction with embedded state-of-the-art command and operator-level training will facilitate the optimum employment of ASW sensor systems, thus increasing their effectiveness and potentially decreasing the number of sensors used to provide coverage in a given area. This work will provide operational commanders with sensor performance predictions which allow them to accurately judge the performance of those sensors, as well as information with which to deploy them for the greatest operational effect. It will also provide information as to how the performance evolves over time due to effects such as the deformation of sensor locations by currents, sound velocity profile changes, geologic magnetic interference changes, or changes to the optical properties of the water, etc. The effort includes performance predictions for fields of sensors as well as individual sensors themselves and applies to both acoustic and nonacoustic sensors.

Work includes development of ASW sensor and system performance models, and realistic simulations and measures of effectiveness that incorporate and exploit critical environmental knowledge. It includes efforts to couple ocean dynamics and acoustics, characterize ambient noise in the littorals, measure and model acoustic and optical propagation and scattering in complex environments, develop algorithms to extract environmental information from through-the-sensor measurements and quantification and prediction of uncertainty. This information is combined with the operating characteristics of particular sensors (or groups of sensors) to provide predictions of sensor performance in the environment at that particular time and in the future. The predictions will also include assessments of the prediction uncertainty due to environmental measurement and sensor performance uncertainties.

This work aligns principally with the Assure Access and Hold at Risk S&amp;T Focus Area in the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan and contributes measurably to the Operational Environments S&amp;T Focus Area strategic objectives.

                                    <r2:Description>ASW Surveillance focuses on dramatically improving detection, classification, and localization capabilities in large ocean areas relative to the capabilities of legacy ASW surveillance systems. The related technologies support the conduct of covert wide-area surveillance ranging from one day to six months. The objectives are to develop and demonstrate technologies that provide clandestine indications and warnings in far forward and contested operating areas and in complex operational environments against all submarine threats including new threats with unknown target signatures and tactics. Covertness implies use of non-observable platforms and/or deployed automated sensors employing passive sonar or other non-detectable methods. The surveillance process includes initial detection and classification. Efforts include the development of Unmanned Undersea Vehicle-based and affordable off-board deployable sensing systems employing a wide variety of surveillance concepts and components. These efforts focus on alternative detection phenomena, vector/tensor sensors, automated acoustic processing, more compact and longer lasting power sources, and high bandwidth acoustic communications links.

                                    <r2:Description>Undersea Weaponry focuses on the development of enabling technologies to counter threat submarines and surface vessels by increasing Probability of Kill (PK) and platform survivability.  Weapon technology focus areas include: the Lightweight Torpedo Technologies (LTT) and the Compact Rapid Attack Weapon (CRAW) projects. The ultimate goal of this activity is to provide revolutionary capabilities needed to fill Sea Shield Warfighter Capability Gaps, to accommodate unique payload limitations through the development of modular and reduced sized undersea weapons based on common technology enablers (where possible), and to provide improved submarine cuing/wide area search in deep and shallow water ocean areas while providing the capability to rapidly transition the submarine mission to engagement/neutralization.

                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Improve target detection, localization, and tracking and increase attack capabilities by providing the following capabilities:
- Localization of 85% or more of enemy submarines in far forward or contested waters with false locations of less than 10% of total calls.
- Effective cueing of an attack from a distance of up to 200nm.
- Improvement of the Lightweight Torpedo (Mk 54). Specific improvements are classified.
- Extending deep water active distributed system lifetime to a few months with a probability of detection (Pd) of 90% within 4 hours (field configuration) or 90% per crossing (barrier configuration), with a False Alarm Rate (FAR) of no more than 4/day.
- Delivery from a Vertical Takeoff Unmanned Air Vehicle (VTUAV) and/or a long-range, high-speed Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) a compact undersea weapon capable of a high Probability of Kill (PK) given precise target localization.
- Detection and localization performance with a single-line vector sensor array nominally equivalent or superior to that of two coherently processed TB-29A arrays. Acquisition costs to be competitive with the cost of a current TB-29A and at least 30% less than the cost of two arrays. Sensor and telemetry packaging will be adequate to achieve neutral buoyancy in an existing TB-29A form factor with array power efficiency greater than 75%. Array handling will be compatible with the existing TB-29 handling system.

Increase sensor to shooter performance and the effective lifetime of distributed ASW search systems by:
- Achieving a drifting active distributed system lifetime of at least two days in areas of tactical significance while maintaining required system performance with a minimum number of sensor nodes.
- Maintaining an effective lifetime of a month for mobile active distributed systems when subjected to the action of eddies from a major ocean current.
- Predicting reseed 6 hours before performance degrades.
- Holding the Area of Uncertainty (AOU) to no larger than 10 nm2 for an hour after initial detection through the control of the coherent sources.

Through a combination of better Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) command-level training and improved operator training provide the following:
- Improve the ability of active sonar operators to detect targets and reject potential false alarms compared to current simulation based training.
- Increase Pd by 50%.
- Provide a decrease in FAR by a factor of two.
- Provide a reduction in the probability of a hit on a High Value Unit (HVU) by a factor of two.
- Improve the ability of the ASW Commander to position assets to increase coverage, reduce active system interference and deal effectively with competing missions.
- Reduce training cost by greater than 80% and increase the frequency of training opportunities by greater than 600% relative to live training.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) addresses the development of recent technology breakthroughs to meet current operational needs from a subscale proof-of-principle into a full-scale prototype for warfighter experimentation during laboratory and operational demonstrations, Fleet Battle Experiments (FBE), Limited Objective Experiments (LOEs) and Sea Trial Exercises.  The key aspects of this PE are divided into four areas: (1) SwampWorks develops and demonstrates newly invented or recently discovered technologies that address emergent and enduring operational problems in an accelerated timeframe; (2) Naval Warfare Experimentation develops prototypes of recent technology breakthroughs and provides them to the warfighter for experimentation during FBEs, LOEs or Sea Trials; (3) Tech Solutions develops rapid response science and technology prototypes addressing Fleet/Force needs identified by Sailors and Marines at the deckplate level; and (4) Operations Analysis provides the Navy and Marine Corps the means to identify capability needs that can be addressed with science and technology solutions, and (5) Manufacturing Technology Science and Technology (S&amp;T) to accelerate recently discovered manufacturing technologies to reduce the acquisition and ownership costs of current and future platforms.

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

This is to enhance the visibility of the FNC Program by providing an easily navigable overview of all 6.3 FNC investments in a single location.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (Sep 2011).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare.

This PE primarily develops and demonstrates prototype Mine Countermeasures (MCM) and Expeditionary Warfare system components that support capabilities enabling Naval Forces to influence operations ashore.  Third-world nations have the capability to procure, stockpile and rapidly deploy all types of naval mines, including new generation mines having sophisticated performance characteristics, throughout the littoral battlespace.  Real world operations have demonstrated the requirement to quickly counter the mine threat.  Advanced technologies must rapidly detect and neutralize all mine types, from deep water to the inland objective.  This program supports the advanced development and integration of sensors, processing, warheads and delivery vehicles to demonstrate improved Naval Warfare capabilities.  It supports the MCM-related Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) Enabling Capabilities (ECs).  Within the Naval Transformation Roadmap, this investment will achieve one of three key transformational capabilities required by Sea Shield as well as technically enable the Ship To Objective Maneuver (STOM) key transformational capability within Sea Strike.

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project primarily develops and demonstrates prototype MCM technologies that support a range of capabilities enabling Naval Forces to influence operations ashore.  Third-world nations have the capability to procure, stockpile and rapidly deploy all types of naval mines, including new generation mines having sophisticated performance characteristics.  Recent operations have demonstrated the requirement to counter the projected mine threat.  Advanced technologies are required to rapidly detect and neutralize all mine types, from deep water to the inland objective.  This project supports the advanced development and integration of sensors, processing, warheads and delivery vehicles.  It supports the MCM-related FNC ECs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Title>MINE/OBSTACLE DETECTION</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>This activity focuses on developing and demonstrating technologies that support detection, classification, identification and multi-sensor data fusion of mine and obstacle data to speed tactical timelines and increase operator standoff.  Efforts include: electro-optic sensors/systems to enable Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) rapid minefield reconnaissance and precise mineline location from Very Shallow Water (VSW) through the Beach Zone (BZ); sensors/systems to enable cooperating Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs) to perform wide-area reconnaissance and assault lane reconnaissance/preparation from shallow water through the Surf Zone (SZ); sensor development for detection and classification of buried mines; technologies for MCM Mission Modules for the new Littoral Combat Ships (LCS); and sensor data fusion to enable a theater mine warfare common operating picture and own ship protection.  This activity supports the development and transition of technologies for the MCM-related FNCs.

This S&amp;T investment supports the Joint Requirements Oversight Council of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (OPNAV) validated requirements for MCM.  This S&amp;T investment of mine and obstacle detection provides critical S&amp;T transitions to the Mine Warfare Mission package of the Navy's new LCS.  This investment in MCM S&amp;T is reported as part of OPNAV's annual report to Congress in the MCM Certification Plan.  This plan is reviewed and approved by the Office of the Secretary of Defense, and any deviations in ONR's reported S&amp;T funding for MCM throughout the Future Years Defense Plan must be reported and justified through Navy and OSD.  Further, the MCM S&amp;T investment plan structure is reviewed and authorized by the Navy's Technology Oversight Group that approves ECs, their supporting products, and funding profiles.

The FY 2012 to FY 2013 funding decrease is due to the realignment of Future Naval Capabilities (FNCs) SHD-FY10-03 Integrated Forward Looking Sonar - Dual Frequency Synthetic Aperture Sonar (FLS-DFSAS), SHD-FY10-03 Long Range LFBB Sonar (AUV Platform Option), SHD-FY10-03 VSW Acoustic Color-Imaging Sonar, SHD-FY12-04 Compact Modular Sensor-Processing Suite (CMSS), and SHD-FY12-04 Mine Drift Prediction Tactical Decision Aid (TDA) to R2 Activity SEA SHIELD in PE 0603673N.

The FY 2013 to FY 2014 increase is due to the Joint Service Explosive Ordnance Disposal program.</r2:Description>
